I can easily do six on this.It is a bit of a nuisance to clean. Sometimes I wish I had got the one with removable plates. But since I use this only occasionally when we have guests, I can complain too much. Burgers come out very nicely with great grill marks on them.Update on 11/26/12.The great thing about Amazon readers and users is that there is some constructive feedback. I think having hot water / steam help loosen the gunk. Placing wet paper towels helps. But the fastest way is to continue to keep it plugged in, and use damp paper towels to wipe down the surface. I used the spatula provided to swab with wet paper towels, so that I don't grill my fingers. Clean up was much quicker. Use abundant caution as this is not a safe way to clean the grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasts just a few months before food sticks","review":"This is my third Foreman grill. The concept is great but the quality is poor. The worse part is the \\"nonstick\\" surface quickly is lost and food sticks horribly to the grill. Cleanup is time consuming and you never can quite get it all off. I am done. The only reason I have this third grill was because it was a Christmas gift. Prior to it, I had vowed never to buy another. The last one had inter-changeable plates but, get this, you can't buy replacement plates!!!! Im going to buy a grill that I dont need to replace every few months. Or at least one with plates you can purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even use my oven anymore...","review":"Accept for my make your own pizzas. Fair price and works as advertised.

Why would I want the exact same thing on CD?!?) OR...b) Known that the song wasn't 5 minutes long, even if you put the two parts of the song together. 0:59 seconds of the track is the song I wanted, and the rest is Boris Karloff reading the story.

The sound is excellent, the angles are great and it makes you feel almost as a band member watching it. Everything about it = well worth the money.Only one complaint is the multiple angles. This is kind of a bait and switch. The multiple angles are only available on a couple of songs, and the angles change still...

A shocking, unforeseen incident defines the tension of the final two-thirds of the story, until it is finally revealed. Monardo writes with a steely elegance.

I was sadly dissapointed when I played the game. All it is is running around shooting things with pretty lame weapons. There's nothing to really figure out and there's not even anything really interesting to look at. There's only one path through the game.. how stupid is that? One person likened it to Metal of Honor which I also have... it is NOTHING like Metal of Honor... that's actually a very good game with alot of thought behind it... this thing looks like it was slapped together in a few hours by the developers... In other words - don't buy it... get Metal of Honor instead... you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four player action...

At $26 dollars this game is a steal on Amazon. Get all four contolers and four buddies and put on your seat belt. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is I really am not interested in playing the single player game. I am not one of those dudes who can play with himself for hours and hours...

I had many complaints about the fact that it was difficult to follow. Some of the exercises were ambiguous and some were over wrought with typing. It did have poor planning on the organizational side. While it built on the previous exercises, sometimes it was ambitious on some items and lacking on others. A similar amount of time was spent on 'opening' a document as was spent on creating a 'table.' On the positive side, if you already know what you are doing, it was easy to follow. If you already know what you are doing, you probably don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real secure","review":"I wasn't very happy with this. The snaps seem to pop open very easily with minimal readjustment. I honestly wish I would have returned it. I ended up getting the minotaur by comp-tac.

When she wrote about pirates shooting their \\"revolvers\\", I completely lost interest. It is pretty common knowledge that revolvers did not come into being until the mid 1800's, when Sam Colt invented the concept by, ironically, observing a ship's helm (wheel) in action. This historical inaccuracy was enough to turn me off to this book, and calls into question the validity of the remaining research contained therein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for a Juvenile Audience","review":"I could not read beyond the first chapter on Blackbeard. I realized this novel was historical fiction, the author having used obviously fabricated dialouge to describe interactions. Nancy Roberts was a story teller, not a historian. And, the book was written for a juvenile audience. Not what I was looking to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made an online Political Science class so much more interesting","review":"With this book, you'll get your history and political science lessons and a built-in instructor for free! By this, I mean the voice in which the author writes makes learning about political cultures the reader may or may not ever experience first hand very interesting and relevant. It helps explain the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" behind many current political clashes and warfare. It really gives insight into the current hostilities between certain nations in the middle east and the west (the U.S. included). By content alone, I think it was one of the best textbooks the online university I was attending at the time had ever chosen for any of my classes. Best of all, I purchased it in like-new condition (no marks, folds, etc.) for about $20 from an Amazon seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countries and Concepts: Politics, Geography, Culture","review":"Hi.

However, what we have here instead is an indie bedroom album, while some of the songs have novelty interest, none of the songs are developed nearly enough and the overall production not of a quality expected for its price range....tinty drum machines, someguitar tones that sound like they are played beneath a blanket. Lastly, there is really no linking theme between the songs which leaves a listener without a proper code to appreciate what Nikhil is attempting. In summary, this album is fine if you realize you are getting an entry level work by a young aspiring artist, not a carefully crafted product of an artisan...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this game for my 11 year old cousin.

This game makes Aquaman (GameCube) look like Resident Evil 4! Overall this game is terrible. I traded it in for 10 dollars. You should only pay under a dollar for it. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didnt know tongs could be this nice.","review":"These are tongs so I wont get too in depth. They are clean and sleek, no crevices for junk to get stuck in, very easy to clean. One side has teeth and the other is smooth, making them very versitile.The best feature is that they are easiliy operated with one hand. Of course you can manipulate the function with one hand, what I mean is you can lock and unlock them one handed. Simply hold them closed and tip them upward, the lock will slide out of the handle and keep them closed. To open, simply sqeeze the handles and point them down, the lock will slide back into the handle and they will open. You dont realize how handy this is until you actually are cooking with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I Bought These Because of Other Reviewers' Recommendations!","review":"So, the hubby wanted some new tongs for his grill. Mind you, this man is a serious bull in a china shop. I could no longer skimp on tongs that he will abuse, carelessly toss in the dishwasher (some of the old ones couldn't go in the dishwasher, ugh!), leave outside, drop on concrete patio, etc.These tongs have been the perfect solution! They are heavyweight with 18/10 stainless steel and dishwasher safe, though I like to wash them by hand. The locking closure is really cool and unbreakable-so far, unlike the flimsy ones the hubby has broken in the past.I purchased these tongs on the basis of other Amazon reviewers' recommendations and I have to say they steered me to the perfect product at an incredibly affordable price. Do not be fooled by the price, these are HIGH QUALITY tongs!You will not be disappointed with these tongs, so buy them already."},{"rating":"1","title":"At the Last Trumpet: Jesus Christ and the End of Time (William Barclay...","review":"This book is a collection of previously published excerpts from Barclay's numerous Bible study writings where he just incidentally mentions something related to Christ's second coming. The books advertisement led me to believe that Barclay was giving his entire focus to this subject. The book was edited and put together years after his death and I considered it a rip-off. I respect Barclay and own a number of his writings. This one I don't even plan to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock on!","review":"this cd is sooo awesome!

Great rock sound. I highly recommend this CD--you won't be disappointed. I'm especially a big fan of the lead singer, Ryan Gillmor--he rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great best of","review":"This is better than great I really like this greatest hits collection and I enjoy the new tracks I hope that they release a new album together. You get 2 discs of the absolute best of Crue I say you need to buy this"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any Motley Crue fan!!","review":"This is, by all means, the cream of the crop of all of Motley Crue's songs, the best of the best packaged onto two CDs. Two hours plus of hardcore metal at its finest. This album has all of Motley's biggest hits, from the beginning to today, as well as covers from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols, just to name a few. Also included are 3 brand new tracks that prove that Motley Crue is indeed alive and kicking, and are just as good as they have always been for the past 20 years. If you are a Motley Crue fanatic, simply put, YOU MUST GET THIS ALBUM!! I cannot emphasize this enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I'm totally digging this cd, it's a great selection of good Motley Tracks, both from the '80's and the '90's. but.....the new songs, about that....If I Die Tomorrow, not that great , first off, SIMPLE PLAN WROTE THE LYRICS or whatever, that's just lame, and Mick's guitar riff, is an ALMOST DIRECT rip off of the verse riff of a Shadow's Fall song, The Art Of Balance, whether coincidental or purposely, it makes me raise my brow, Sick Love Song is awesome, totally different from anything else Motley, but totally rad, and Street Fighting Man isn't too bad either. Another downside, all these remixes, like the Afraid (Alternate Rave Mix), what is up with that, the song is EXACTLY THE SAME, the drums just sound more processed, like seriously, just release the regular song, but all in all the album is good, but the guys are a little washed up, good album tho!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for CD 1...Big fat Goose Egg for CD 2","review":"Sometimes you just want a good mix of the good stuff. Can I just but CD 1 for half the price because I don't think a frisbee that says Red, White & Crue CD2 is worth $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red White & Crude!","review":"First off, If I Die Tomorrow is a waste of time. Secondly, there's Sick Love Song which raps, so I hate this one. Last we have the Stones classic \\"Street Fighting Man\\", Yawn! Vince's voice is pretty rough. All of it is pretty hard to take. The cover and packaging are good. But what about the rest of the music? Well, let's say it's no...DEEP PURPLE! With DP you'd need pretty much all the studio albums, but with MC you really just need a greatest hits package or maybe this anthology. All their finest cuts are here, Girls, Girls, Girls, Shout At The Devil, Smokin' In The Boys Room, Home Sweet Home, Live Wire, Wild Side and Dr. Feelgood. There are plenty of rare and unreleased nuggets too. Bravo! As stated earlier, disc one of \\"Red White & Crue\\" is clearly better than disc two, so if you need to check out this collection first, go to your local Borders listening station."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick of greatest hits","review":"Man this like the fourth g-hits album they put out I don't even know why people even bother in buying it, the crue is my Fav band but I'm sick of G-hits they need to release a real album."},{"rating":"1","title":"With a big reunion tour, THIS is the best they can do?","review":"First off, I have all their albums, minus generation swine. Three new songs? Two of them werent even written by them(A Simple Plan wrote If I Die Tomorrow). This should have only been one disc by putting a couple of New Tattoo songs on the first. The other songs on disc 2 include- 4 from previous greatest hits albums, some from the Corabi era(which a lot of people dont count)Tommy Lee's quaternary song, and some from Generation swine, which I thought sucked. Instead of doing a new album, they release two boxsets within 5 years of reissuing their catalog twice! Instead of getting this, I would get their book \\"The Dirt\\". I absolutely love it. At least the album cover's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmie a break.....................","review":"Come on and give me a fuggin break!!! This CD totally blows.

Gimmie a break!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Band","review":"OK, now I know I am going to recieve half a dozen negative counter reviews from Crue fans, but I really don't care. If you think this band is heavy, you need therapy. Have you ever heard of bands like Suffocation? Or how about Cryptopsy? Perhaps Slayer, King Diamond, Celtic Frost, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death or Disgorge? Those bands are a TRUE metalhead's wet dream. This is pure fluff. And just try and compare Vince Neil's obnoxious whining to the vocals of Robert Plant or Chris Cornell. And what's with the make-up and Spandex pants? What kind of statement is that? I mean, they come off to me as the kind of band who fancy playing at gay bars. Big surprise.Avoid this band like the plague, along with all the other hair metal acts of the 80's.Burn in hell Motley Crue..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game got better","review":"the first game was alright. so what did they do they took what was good from the first game and made it better this is not gt2 but but its a very good raceing game. if you want to spend your hard earned money i dont think you can go wrong with this game. its nice to see some one get it right and i look forward to their next game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special versions (for Stokowski) of Grainger favorites","review":"The Warriors may be the highlighted item on this disc, but I was blown away by the \\"versions for Stokowski\\" of seven Grainger pieces (mostly the great chestnuts) -- both the arrangements and the performances are fantastic! The composer made several versions of each, for strings, full orchestra, wind band, etc.; these Stokowski commissions are perhaps the most interesting. \\"Room music tidbits\\" Mock Morris and Handel in the Strand are here, but the other five (folk-music settings) make an especially outstanding set. The beautiful Irish Tune from County Derry and Early One Morning complement the sprightly Molly on the Shore, the somewhat wacky Country Gardens (*very* different from the well-known arrangement), and Shepherd's Hey with an ending that knocks you off your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of many trying to capitalise on Japan bashing","review":"The book was a complete and utter disappointment. Someone trying to capitalise on the difference between the East and West of doing things.

It is certainly not worth owning - sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Not the best design for a keychain.

It was partly my fault, but still the design needs to be improved.And my light doesn't work, tried changing battery, no difference.. wiring is messed up or something.I still give it a 2/5 because the blade is pretty decent, and overall it is a nice item to keep handy if the light works :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A humble attempt at a review of Michaela Foster Marsh's CD","review":"If someone else hadn't introduced me to Michaela's CD, I would never have tried it out on my own. I will never forget the day my sister casually popped Michaela's CD into her disc player as background music while I was visiting. Let me tell you, forget it being good background music. There is no way you can talk over those incredible songs. It needs to be listened to loud and it demands your full attention. The sounds Michaela mixes in, combined with her distinct voice, passionate piano, and rip-your-soul-open lyrics, makes it a surreal experience. It didn't take me long to become a fan! Seeing Michaela live was nothing short of a religious experience for me. Very few musicians move me emotionally, especially with the current trend of pop stars singing catchy tunes that seem to have been written by marketing pro's. Michaela's CD is a refreshing, original and beautiful offering that everyone should have the chance to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Independent Film","review":"The Kiss is a well written and directed gem of a film, its a very good romantic film, well acted by the whole cast, Eliza Dushku is very much under used in this film which is a shame, as she's a very talented actress, a must see independent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meezers rule","review":"What's not to like?

And, embarrassing how true the stuff really is..","review":"It's embarrassing how dead on all the stuff on this book is! It made me cringe to remember all the times I've used the \`Officespeak' sayings, like \\"here's a heads up,\\" or \\"just touching base,\\" or \\"team player.\\" The office space is a sick, sick world & DW Martin captures it perfectly with absolutely hilarious writing! His voice is perfectly tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic--just enough so that you can give the book as a gift to your boss without him/her fully realizing just how much you're making fun of your job. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And you thought happiness couldn't be bought!","review":"Read this book! But don't read it like one of those predictable, ho-hum, chapter-by-chapter, plot-thickening numbers. Read it savoring the taste of each little section of comedic brilliance. Read it out loud sitting around the kitchen table. Read it knowing you're going to have to read this baby again and again until D.W. Martin publishes his next masterpiece.This book is so funny, it will improve your sense of humor by up to fifty points!! Do you know what St. Augustine heard that brought about his great conversion? He heard the voice of a little child saying \\"take up and read.\\"So do what a great saint did and take up and read Officespeak!(Note: Augustine didn't have Officespeak yet, but I'm guessing Officespeak will probably become as famous as the 'good book' that he ended up using.)BUY IT!

Instead she went on and on about diet, exercise, make-up, etc.--things I already knew. If I had wanted a book about personal improvement I could have bought any other of many good books written by professionals. I was totally disappointed. I read less than half of the book and couldn't even bring myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame!","review":"I've been a bookworm all my life, but this \\"book\\" is enough to turn me off reading. \\"Shine\\" is totally offensive and disgusting.

Hmmmm...","review":"My friend and I picked this book up at a yard sale for $.25 based on our mutual loathing of SJR. It was everything we dreamed it would be: Self-absorbed, deluded, nearly illiterate and Harlequinesque. She could teach Paris Hilton a thing or two about self-promotion; it's so disgustingly shallow and materialistic that it moves into the realm of parody after only a couple of paragraphs. However, I cannot deny that I laughed a lot. From a questionable marriage to a strangely accelerated weight loss and tacky, drag-diva makeover; this book is a riot. Yet, oddly, some \\"reviewers\\" found this inspirational? Funny how their comments are so very brief and this is the only book that has inspired them to write a review. I'm just saying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Star!","review":"Goodness...what does one do when their first review is taken off by Amazon? In my case, write another because I do feel that I can add my 2 cents on this book without fear!! Star Jones has written a \\"tell all\\" book that basically tells nothing. For someone that was so strong in her \\"plus size\\" power she fails to tell us the one thing we all want to know: Dang, girlfriend, how DID you get so skinny? Jones glosses over this tidbit, prefering to tell us instead that she \\"eats half of what is on her plate\\"--well, I would too if my my stomach were 1/4 of it's size! If you didn't have an operation, fine, but let us know how you control your once out of control cravings!As for \\"love\\"--I sure didn't learn much from this book. Save your money and call it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of MONEY","review":"This book was a waste of time and money. Who lets this stuff get printed? Star is full of herself and is a fool to think anyone cares about what brand of face wash she uses. The whole, \\"Think like a lawyer\\" bit was rather patronizing. Other people, outside the legal profession, use critical thinking when making decisions and are \\"methodical\\" as she likes to say. \\"Auntie Star\\" is ridiculously materialistic, and I found the majority of this book to be shallow and even insulting. If you are a seriously Star Jones fan, get the book, otherwise enlighten yourself with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Star Found a rich man!","review":"If you would like to hear a fairy tale this is the book for you! I was expecting a biography on her life and how she found love. Not 101 ways to catch a rich man. Very unhappy with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Star...","review":"... for teaching me how I, too, can become a materialistic diva. This is something I've always aspired to be, only I wasn't sure where to look. Low and behold, you came along and saved me! Before you, I only had my women's magazines to turn to for trite advice on love and fashion - and only my trashy romance novels to read when I was in the mood to hear way-too-much information about someone's love life. But you have it all in your tome, a work which will no doubt tangle with THE GRAPES OF WRATH and MOBY DICK as being the greatest published masterpiece of all time. Praise Star, hallelujah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I have to admit. . .I may not have picked up the book had it not been for the recommendation of my best friend. She was at the bookstore, came across Star's book on Saturday, started reading, and called me an hour into the book. Later that night, I caught up to her. We both finished the book by Sunday night. It's RIGHT-ON for women our age (late 20's). I love Star's honesty! For once - - someone says it's okay to have an \\"ideal man!\\" Of course, good old Star, telling it like it is, reminds us that we've got to present ourselves as best we can for these guys! And how about that \\"think like a lawyer\\" section. I've already started to think about people in my life and where I've placed them.I don't follow celebrities and their crazy lives, but it's nice to know that there are some out there who have something to say that's worth listening to.Great job, Star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star celebrates Girls Night Out","review":"If you enjoy a fast, funny, smart, how-to book, then Shine is perfect. Star celebrates the joy of finding happiness in the moment. Star celebrates her relationship with God and lives the scripture to 'eat, drink and be merry';for this is a gift from God. Thanks for the reminder Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Buy It","review":"God bless Star Jones, but I just can't buy her ruminations after watching her for years on The View. I don't think she is being honest, just presenting her idea of a new persona that still lacks humility and compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all the media attention surrounding this book, I had to read it to see what all the commotion was about. I'm very disappointed. None of the tips and pointers provided were unique. It is all imformation that I have read elsewhere. For example, there's absolutely nothing new with writing a wish list for the person you want to attract. My friends and I did that very same thing when I was 15.My feeling is that Ms. Jones-Reynolds journey is not yet complete since she hasn't yet achieved contentment in her life. She isn't content with the celebrity status she has already received - now she wants others to view her as an expert of love...a love coach. I'm not sure how she feels she is qualified for this title. Her self proclaimed title of \\"diva\\" is far more believable.If you are curious about this book (as I was) please avoid the urge to make a purchase. Instead, chose one of the many well respected authors who also has the education and experience needed to provide sound advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Why are Star's friends and family writing the 5 star reviews? Do not buy this book it is really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Save your money. I did. I got it at the library. This book is all about Star bragging on what she has, including her \\"perfect\\" husband/marriage. I did not find anything useful in what little I read. It is one big joke. Not enjoyable reading at all. It's amazing how one can be such an expert on marriage with so little time invested. Next time I'm abroad, I'll check out the bargain shops! (Yeah, right!) This Star doesn't deserve 1-star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly!","review":"[...] the premise behind this book is that true happiness can only come when you marry the man of your dreams and acquire a huge collection of material goods. While Star prattles endlessly about her close and deep relationship with God, it's interesting to note that this chapter is AFTER the really \\"good\\" stuff dealing with bargain outlet stores, fake eyelashes, money making tips, and man-hunt tips.Honestly, it's an unintentionally hilarious book, because you can just tell that Ms. Jones seems to sincerely believe that this is the path to happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell for it hook, line and sinker","review":"All the hype of how she was going to reveal how she lost her weight was just that, hype to get you to buy the book. I am happy for her that she is healthy and happy, but I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to read what I can hear every day on The View."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Is A Big Joke!","review":"Star Jones makes a mockery of the Christian faith in this book especially in the chapter on morals and sex! She blatantly mocks the Biblical teaching that sex is wrong outside of marriage regardless on ones age or any other circumstance. The little \\"pyramid\\" that she created is a big joke. She redefines the Bible and her spirituality to fit her own desires and needs. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity personified","review":"Yet another semi-celebrity proclaiming their proficiency in subjects best left to the professionals. One would hope that this trend will end and someone will realize that this fluff belongs in weekly magazines and not on the library shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for \\"Shine\\"","review":"I read \\"Shine\\" and enjoyed it tremendously. If you're in a rut and have ever thought about changing your life then \\"Shine\\" is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff...not enough substance.","review":"Nothing much new here. If you used to watch her on The View, then you've pretty much heard all this before."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer a flan...","review":"Unfortunately, I received this book from my grandmum for my birthday. I think she overheard me saying, \\"I'm jonesin' for a car.\\" and somehow misheard it as \\"I want Star Jones' new book.\\" Anyway, quick review. If you have even the slightest bit of common sense, you'll not need this book. While, I celebrate Star's meteoric rise to the highest level of daytime talk shows, this tome is little more than skullduggery disguised as gladhanding. I wonder how self-aware Star is. Does she actually think that people need this advice? Or is she simply trying to cash in on her exposure? I don't begrudge her trying to make a buck, but I just hope people know what they're getting. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a reader...","review":"Well I HAVE read this book and despite the claims of those that loved it, my bad reaction to Star's writing has nothing to do with jealousy. I just didn't see anything new or revolutionary in her advice or guidance...it all just feels like a re-tread of familiar territory, dumbed down to the lowest common denominator.If Star positioned this book as her autobiography, then it would be more palatable. But she is touting it as a self-help guide and that is just laughable. She is not qualified to advise others on any topic beyond shopping, weaves and footwear.Good for her for shedding the weight, good for her for realising she was killing herself with her lifestyle, and good for her for finding a man who is willing to live with her. But none of that means she has gained any special wisdom that is worth imparting, or that will help today's woman with today's problems. That's just her ego fueling her ambition at the expense of having anything meaningful to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This HAS to be a joke. I'm torn between flaming this book for how ignorant it is and laughing at how ridiculous it is.The writer simply rehashes old advice. Also, I think it is wise to be honest with yourself while writing a self-help book, because one of the goals is to enable the reader be more truthful with themselves. How can a book pretend to be giving useful advice if the writer just tells us the few, possibly made up stories that she wants us to know?I'm immediately selling my copy of Shine, if someone is gullible enough to buy it. Really, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an honest book","review":"I tried very hard to like this book and look for something good in it. I guess if you've never dated, you might find it a good primer for getting started. But even that's a stretch.I don't see honesty from Star. [...] she changes her story too often and is inconsistent in how she presents her views or experiences. I think she wants to be something she's not, and that's the face she's presenting. This book is a whitewash over the reality of Star's life and I think we deserve a little more respect from an author asking us for money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of praise","review":"I read this book in two days and have to say it doesn't merit the glowing reviews some people are lavishing on it here. I expected that someone who has gone through life's trials the way that Star has would have far deeper insights into what it takes to overcome them. The examples given in this book are pretty self-serving and seem to address people of Star's wealth and need for materialistic things. It doesn't address the common woman who is trying to navigate the tricky waters of relationships.I expected more and didn't get it. This book left me with as many questions as I had before I read it and that's not a testament to self-help at all. Amazon has lots of great books on the subject so look elsewhere if you really want to sort out your love life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I wanted to like this book. But it was so poorly written that I'm convinced if it were some non-famous person's book, it wouldn't have even been considered for publication. Do not waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Help You Can Do Without","review":"The premise of this book is disturbing - your life won't be complete unless you find a man. Despite being an educated and successful woman, Star Jones was unable to find emotional and spiritual peace until she found someone to provide it for her. Star's spiritual journey seems to have nothing to do with inner peace and self-fulfillment. Rather, it seems to be all about \\"finding a man\\" and hording material possessions.If you want an inspirational tale from someone you can relate to and admire, I really recommend you give this book a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written -- A Fun & Informative Read!","review":"[...] I believe that the book included information that was exactly what Star has promoted it as -- fun, informative, and from the heart. I didn't find the book to be \\"self-promoting\\" at all. In fact, it was straight-forward and direct.I highly recommend that individuals purchase the book and read it for themselves in order to form an opinion... Great job, Star -- and kudos to you for remaining who you are in spite of the negativity that is spewed your way on what appears to be a regular basis. I admire your strength, courage, AND compassion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grady revisited","review":"Earlier this week our family suffered the loss of another beloved dog.

I knew Mr. Bronson during the time he was writing this book, my daughter Robin was his childrens' Nanny. I remember how concerned and caring he was regarding his girls feelings about Gradys death.I felt that the book was just what my family needed this week, and as expected, it helped us all.

Great material, great reproduction. If you are a longtime fan, this is a wonderful way to reconnect to the essential Dylan. If you're younger, this gives an excellent introduction to the poet who inspired the Sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehhhh","review":"The book was fantastic in the beginning and in the end - but somewhere in the middle Dylan seemed to get caught up in his own self pity and bitterness of his fame. He talks about his fans with little affection, and resents his name as the leader of a generation. Yet, he contradicts himself later while he attempts to rediscover an audience, a new, younger group. At times I felt like I was wasting my time reading him whine. However, this could be a tribute to his ability to let us understand. At the beginning he is in Greenwich very open minded, and in the end he gets a contract with columbia records - in the middle he is burnt out and tired of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe a deep poet, certainly a shallow writer","review":"Your hometown whitepages telephone directory has fewer names in it, is more interesting, cheaper, less boring, is written in better english and is not self-celebrating. Read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attn: Ghost Writer required","review":"Upon completion of this book, I came away knowing less about Bob Dylan than before I picked it up. There must be a reason he elaborates on certain aspects of his life that would appear to be trivial in nature to most people however we've no idea why these events warrant pages of type.I don't buy this 'He's a genius so everything he does is genius'. Even a genius can fire blanks now and again. Dylan is no exception. Why is this books timeline so jumbled? What's the point of it? Presumably he chose the order in which his rather boring anecdotes were presented in, however again we're left scratching our heads.Too many names dropped, not enough editing. This guy's a songwriter - not a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better things to buy with your money","review":"This man's life is BORING. Don't buy this book. Not even the graphic description of his sex life saved this book. There were a few moments. The bit where he talks about chasing some guy's dog with a knife was funny but unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the audio.","review":"Imagine \\"The Kid Stays In The Picture\\" narrated by anyone other than Robert Evans? No way. What a disappointment to find Dylan's \\"Chronicles\\" read by someone other than Dylan - it's laughable! Hahaha! Why bother? Don't. Read the book instead . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a little biased?","review":"I'll admit that I'm going to be biased about this review, because I am an imense Bob Dylan fan. However, I think anyone interested in Dylan should read this book and hear what he says about himself. So much of what he has told \\"us\\" about his life was somehow skewed, that even this little (VERY little) sliver of the truth (I hope it is the truth at least) is great for fans.Of course, when my brother came to me asking me what book I thought was the best to read about Bob Dylan, I told him probably not this one. There are other books that have more information, which, for people who are going to only read one book about Bob Dylan, would probably be better off reading.However, anyone who considers himself a Dylan fan should read his autobiography, no?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-read it in English","review":"I've read this book's Chinese translation edition, now I am reading the original edition, I feel like I am reading a new book, a well writen book. Compared to this book, other Dylan books not written by Bob Dylan himself is nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrific waste of paper.....","review":"I am a member of a book club and someone chose this book as our inagural offering. I was unfamiliar with Bob Dylan and saw this as perhaps an opportunity to learn more about his life. After reading this book, I've come to the distinct conclusion that not only do I not know more about his life, I'm not entirely certain Mr. Dylan does either. There is no plot, no sequence of thought - just mind-numbing rambling which leads to nothing. It's almost as if his mind vomitted words and they somehow congealed into a published book. My sincerest wish is that \\"Volume Two\\" would not be foisted upon an unsuspecting world. If only it were possible to give it less than 1 star......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Dylan still alive?","review":"I remember loving the music twenty years ago, but I was disappointed by the book. It didn't take me back to a good place or give me extraordinary insight into this man. I felt is was just another way for him to make a buck and keep his name alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I enjoy the music of Bob Dylan, but could not stand this book. I have not finished the first 100 pages and it is highly unlikely that I will be able to do any more reading. So far it seems nothing more then a list of people he knows/or knew and how great he is compared to them. The way he presents himself on paper, he sounds like an awful person whose ego is way to big. I never intend on buying anything of his again. If you want to read a good book, get Woody Guthrie's Bound For Glory. This book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"This book is complete garbage. Bob Dylan continuously reaffirms that he is his own biggest fan and what an 'aw shucks legend' he is and how he's just regular folks. Furthermore, the writing is sloppy, disjointed, there's no continuity, no chronological order and absolutely no point. As much energy as Dylan expends trying to convince the reader that he didn't want to be labeled or propped up as the voice of a generation, he contradicts that by talking about himself in grandiose terms as just that. If he really wanted to avoid all the infamy and press he should have disappeared. A good read if you want to completely waste time in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"The fact that this book was greeted with such universal praise by fans and critics alike serves to show what mediocre, feeble times we live in. I picked up this book expecting at least an interesting memoir of this man, but instead all I got was disjointed ramblings about people he knows and places he played.The only insights he gives into these people are that they were \\"deep\\", \\"profound\\", or \\"heavy\\". Sometimes it sounds like a teenagers essay. I had misgiving after about twenty pages, but as I read on I became more incredulous at how utterly dull, boring, and downright bad this book is. I have got to about page eighty now and I don't think I can read anymore. Dylan comes accross as a self-indulgent, humourless man with no personality. It is staggering that this book can be regarded so highly and it re-affirms the suspicion in my mind that rock music is much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Boring","review":"Disappointed, but perhaps I expected too much of this book based on the hype. If this is his memoir, then this is his memoir, so be it. But to me, it didn't say much more than I already thought I knew. I felt he rambled on, and on, just being the same old cautious Dylan making sure none of his real life and feelings come out for viewing, except for trivia, so what's the point.Bob should forget the 'memoir' stuff, authorize a real biography from a brave and thorough biographer free of Dylan worship, and get out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for this one star, some times","review":"I alternated between amused interest and stark raving boredom. While Dylan would paint an intriguing word picture of some of the times and places that he has passed through, some times his words would read like a pile of blank verse that wasn't really all that moving or even interesting. One example of the things that reached me was his encounter with Gorgeous George near the beginning of his career. An example of what left me cold were his overwrought declarations of self-perceived importance to his generation and the revolutions of the sixties. It left me wanting to say to him, \\"Lighten up, Bob.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"lone pilgrim","review":"Beautifully and maddeningly crafted. This man ain't gonna tell ya what he's all about...how long will it take 'til ya figure that out...God bless him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles reads like an extended interview","review":"Chronicles reads like an interview, where Bob Dylan resonds in writing to the questions: \\"Who were your influences and friends when you were starting out? What were you thinking, and what have you been reading?\\" His use of imagery is as strong as ever. He leaves the time lines, chronologies, and picture sections for other books. The structure is non-linear as he tends to free associate. The vignettes and details that he includes make this a joy to read. It's like he's talking straight to you when you've got a lot of time to kill, like going for a drive cross country, just the two of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me looking forward to Volume Two","review":"Heard the taped version of CHRONICLES, VOLUME ONE byBob Dylan . . . it traces the singer's beginnings from when hefirst arrived in Manhattan in 1961 . . . I enjoyed his take onmany recording artists, including the great Roy Orbison (headmired), Ricky Nelson (he didn't think would last), Dan VanRonk, etc.This isn't a typical autobiography, in that it doesn't followa straight chronological approach . . . rather, it is a collectionof Dylan's observations on a wide range of topics includingthe music business, his loves and how he came up withideas for his songs.It left me looking forward to CHRONICLES, VOLUME 2--particularlyif Sean Penn repeats the excellent job of narration he did onthis first part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Penn reads like Dylan writes","review":"I very much enjoyed this reading by Sean Penn of Dylan's book. It is very easy to listen to, and doesnt sound contrived or artificial, conveys the stream-of-consciousness recollections Dylan is recounting quite well. The story is interesting in its nonlinear flow and in what seemingly trivial things strike Dylan as significant. I enjoyed his reminiscences of Tiny Tim, Moondog, and Dave van Ronk. A nice recounting of that bygone era."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Onion?","review":"As good as I thought it would be, and different from what I expected at the same time. Made me want to buy Oh Mercy, after feeling like I sat in on those sessions.I hope very much that there is a Volume 2.Anybody else think it's weird that The Onion was listed as one of the publications praising this book (back of the paperback edition.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the Point Is?","review":"Anyone looking for deep insights into Bob Dylan and his art will likely be disappointed in this rather skimpy memoir in which he seemingly picks out a handful of aspects of his life and career at random while ignoring everything else. We get a very lengthily chapter on the making of his 1989 album \\"Oh Mercy\\" which is a solid album, but it seems odd that this relatively obscure work gets so much ink while groundbreaking albums like \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" and \\"John Wesley Harding\\" go ignored. Also missing is anything about his infamous motorcycle accident or his late 70's conversion to fundamentalist Christianity.Perhaps much of this is to be covered later, after all the full titles of this book is \\"Chronicles, Volume One\\" but thus far Mr. Dylan's memoirs come across as little more than a brief stream of consciousness attempt to reassert his reputation for being an egnegmatic recluse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Meat?","review":"I picked this up to maybe get some insight into the songwriter. Instead what is written is trivial rememberences from scattered parts of his life. Stream of consciousness some say. Drivel, I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name Dropping at its Best","review":"The book is a dry hustle. If what you are interestd in is a list of persons the author knew, this is the book for you. He mentions literally hundreds of \\"famous\\" names: people he either met, heard singing on records, or read books by, and he gives a one or two line description of each. Apart from that, and the message \\"I knew what I wanted to do!\\" there is little else of substance in the book. True, there is a cleverly-turned phrase or two here and there, but essentially there is nothing of value here. If this book were written by anyone other than Dylan, it would never have been considered for publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"written by bob dylan.","review":"there's one part where he uses lots of idomatic expressions all in a row and it's so silly and funny. one time his last name was zimmerman but then he changed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subterranean Homesick Review","review":"Opened up the box and what did we see?In his own write, the words of Bobby Z.Started in to read while we ate our lunches--There was famous names, a-comin in bunches.Folk-singers . . .

Oh, I knew his name. As it turns out, I knew some of his songs, I just didn't realize they were his songs. This past Spring someone mentioned his name in passing, later I looked him up on the internet, just on a whim. I WAS HOOKED!!! The more I read of this man the more I wanted to know. Of course, I bought this book and it just fueled the fire. He is a man who, seemingly, uses every talent he possesses... at his own pace, in his own way. So many of we mortals have talent that we waste, Bob Dylan never wasted his talent and we are all blessed to have shared this time with him.The book is so well written that it makes you feel you know the man, that you sort of got into his mind. Then later you realize he only allowed you a peek and that the vast being of Bob is still a mystery to us all.If you read it you will, like probably everyone who reads it, be happily anticipating Volume Two."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for volume 2.","review":"As I read this autobiography, I imagined myself coming face to face with this extraordinary, almost mythological figure as he describes the somewhat unremarkable experiences of his youth. I grew up on the poetry, music and mystery of Bob Dylan, and I am grateful to him for giving me a glimpse, through this book, into his life. It's an entertaining, well written, and thoughtful read. I look forward to the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I'm always iffy about autobiographies as they are subject to 'image crafting' and 'convenient memory' but this tome pulls few punches as far as these things go. I think it could have been a bit longer and wonder why Dylan glosses over his motocycle crash, but all in all a good time here for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"DYLAN RULES!","review":"As a longtime Bob Dylan fan, I was excited when my girlfriend gave me CHRONICLES, Volume 1 for my birthday. It's the perfect book for a rainy weekend. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.Bob's turn of phrase, his quirky but sometimes disjointed thoughts and always fascinating insights made me feel the book is a great companion to the best of his CDs.Dylan and Hendrix have been major creative influences on my thinking. If you feel the same, I'm sure you'll enjoy Bob's thoughts. Me and several buddies are looking forward to the next volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio by Sean Penn isn't very good...","review":"I use audio books, and this audio book only comes abridged (YUCK), and is narrated by Sean Penn.

Thank goodness I did not buy this audiobook."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificient","review":"I disagree with most reviews so far, I think this effort from Dylan could have come out circa 1966 and would have sat comfortably with his albums of the time.On Joan Baez 'she was like Cleopatra living in an Italian palace'.Stunning stuff and it is filled with his brilliant manipulation of language.At the time of writing this a reviewer from the Daily Telegraph (U.K)admits that at no time has he read an autobiography of this high quality by anybody.As for the suggestion that, he Dylan should have had the book ghosted is way of the Plimsole line.Dylan has once again thrown down the gauntlet to his contemparies.He does not raise standards ,he sets them."},{"rating":"2","title":"soulful look at himself...","review":"a rambling, disconnected but thoroughly engrossing look at his journey that became the legend of Bob Dylan..the answers my friend are blowing in the wind..maybe, not the answer and insight to the great questions that you are seeking but if you want to understand or at least come to a better understanding of the forces that drive the great artists then Bob has tried to give you an insight..if you want the gossip and lurid details, go elsewhere..this is an artist revealing the essence of what makes him tick..it's all about the music..and that drive to express what lies in one's soul..I loved Vol. 1...can't wait for Vol. 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Auditory Experience","review":"Dylan, who has put his indelible imprint on music, has found another medium on which to work his magic.The linear narrative becomes less so -- it fairly sings with the recognizable inflection, the peculiar yet distinct melodic structure of Dylan's grammar, so that reading turns creative and becomes a way of being Dylan, thinking like Dylan, breathing like Dylan and makes of his Chronicles an auditory experience.There is an inner listening; an unshy,arhythmic beat accompanies what we are reading in the most agreeable way possible.Lauren Lawrence, \\"Your Dreams\\" columnist of NY Daily News"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was Wrong","review":"From his autobiography, it appears that I was really wrong about my conception of Bob Dylan. He wasn't a \\"protest singer\\" or \\"leader of progressive causes and disaffected youth\\", but rather a father, husband, well-read intellectual and musician. It's interesting to get Dylan's take on such golden oldies as Ricky Nelson and Roy Orbison. His book is also peppered with references to many people with whom I'm unfamiliar, but this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of this candid autobiography"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like Writing Lyrics","review":"This is a very enjoyable and most importantly, readable book. Who would have thought Dylan could write so well, be such a good story teller in straight forward language? After spending years listening to his lyrics I have to admit that I was surprised by how well this is written. Surely songwriting and penning an autobiography are very different arts, but Dylan does it. Apparently sans the ghost writer.This book is full of the early years in NY, sleeping in other peoples places, working his way into the in-crowd, meeting his hero, Woody Guthrie. Be sure to pick up this gem as well!Bound for Glory (Penguin Modern Classics)Great stuff. He does get a little off-track with the making of a particular LP, \\"Oh Mercy\\" but works his way back round to the before time.Was he really asked to join Peter, Paul and Mary?We got a look at girlfriend Suzy that appeared on an album cover, very interesting.And between the lines you can sense the pressure of being the spokesman for a generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a story teller extraodinaire","review":"The narrative in this book has a lilting melody akin to that of a leaf, newly released from the tree - the words, one after the other, move in harmony to the entire score . . . narrative only a poet could bring to life. My only difficulty in reading this book was finding a resting point . . . but somebody has to pay the light bill. Chronicles II . . . I eagerly anticipate its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Problem: It's Boring","review":"I love early Dylan and I'm especially fond of the 'Bootleg' stuff he's been releasing lately. But this book, like his later records is a real drag. He just drops name after name after name but he doesn't have one interesting story to tell about any of them. Then he devotes two very long chapters to two mediocre mid career albums, New Morning and Oh Mercy. I consider Dylan the greatest lyricist in rock'n'roll history. He's also one of the most important musicians of all time. His guitar playing is greatly underrated but come on! That book needs some spice. If he doesn't want to reveal anything he shouldn't write an autobiography. We already know he loves Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Wonderful book...that's all that's needed to be said.

I was amazed at all the famous names mentioned and how Mr. Zimmerman (I love calling him that...) writes about how he felt about these people and their effect on him. I was also captivated by him talking on and on about different books he had read. They were either written by or about some of the greatest people in history! I dunno...I just think it's awesome to be able to see who and what Bob Dylan, an American icon himself, is and was inspired by. I guess that's my main point...get this book! You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Chronicles Destroyed by a Big Gaffe","review":"I love Sean Penn as an actor nearly as much as I worship Bob Dylan as, well, Bob Dylan. With a four-hour drive ahead, I load up my CD player or the long haul. In a few minutes, I say, \\"Penn's got perfect pitch for this reading. He's got all the nuances and vocal stylings you'd want. UNTIL I hear Sean Penn pronounce Don Juan as Don Jew-in. Not once, but three times. Inexcusable. Makes you wonder if rolling out the CD meant more than assuring its accuracy; someone's sloppy editing ruins this for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dylan's worst biographer....himself","review":"Dear god, what a terrible writer this guy is (and always has been). From the garbage liner notes on Highway 61, to the unreadable Tarantula, to this pile of blathering inanity (Vol. 1? What a jerk. Why not wait until it's *finished* before selling it!) Face it, we're never going to get anything like the truth out of Dylan, and even if we were so lucky, it won't be presented in anything like a coherent manner. Dylan just sits down at a typewriter (or tape recorder, most likely, since this reads like listening to him talk) and proceeds to babble about the 60s (when he's not time-travelling into his married life or name-dropping dozens of people that no one cares about). If he's the \\"voice of a generation\\" then that generation is approaching senility.Stick to your music, Bob. Preferably 1962-66. Because beyond that, you really don't have a damn thing to say.RstJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a ghost writer would have helped","review":"I confess I have read only the excerpt in Newsweek, but both the writing and the content were...pathetic. If only Bob had gotten some writer to supply him with such essentials as theme, context,or style.He rants away on the same parnoid topics again and again with seemingly NO insight into himself, but lots of concern about the multitudinous OTHERS who are pressing in on him, threatening him, asking him for what he cannot give. Whew! And yet he manages to be very dull in the face of all this drama.Here's one of my favorite lines: \\"This main meal of garbage had to be mixed up with some butter and mushrooms and I'd have to go to great lengths to do it.\\"If you like this line, you will probably love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a bogus look backward","review":"Around every 20 pages, there's a phrase that's faintly reminiscent of the early years, the intellect that penned \\"it's allright, ma\\" etc. But so much of what he claims happened is just not reality. For instance, if you went by his words, from the late 60s onward he'd take off years at a time to play with his kids on the living room floor, go camping, rafting, etc a big stay at home family man, presumably married to the same woman, etc.That's all false; so how much else is false? Basically, he's lived in a cocoon for 4 decades surrounded by yes people, and it's had the result you'd predict. It's actually more a work of fiction, or one of those invented autobiographies of a historical figure by a current author where everyone knows it's bogus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Drivel","review":"Rather than provide meaningful details of his life, Dylan provides only disjointed incidents, many of which the reader would consider trivial. The writing style is so filled with claptrap or trite prose, that one comes away feeling that Dylan is being disingenuous, that he doesn't believe what he's writing. I have been listening to an audio version of the book, and find myself muttering rather often, \\"Shut up, Dylan!\\" because of his penchant for wasting time discussing stupidities, trivialites or overblown \\"philosophy\\" rather than the details of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Did not think it was well written. I love his music, but his book was as bad as one of his live concerts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating yet poorly organized","review":"It is impossible to have grown up under the influence of his music and not be interested in what Dylan has to say. Yet somehow I felt that he really missed the opportunity to express himself. I found that he writes his autobiography with metaphors that reflect his songwriting tendencies, e.g. \\"There was a cold wind blowing outside...\\", and do not advance his narrative. Also, didn't he use an editor? The story meanders here and there without temporal sequence or evident intentionality. Aside from these flaws, I was fascinated by the opportunity to glance into the mind of such an important artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"finally- a cure for insomnia","review":"What a dissapointment. This book desperately needed editing. Such namedropping yet very few interesting stories about anyone-including himself. As a child of the 60's I felt a need to push on, and keep reading not so much to learn about him but to recall that period in time and he did recreate the Village of the 50's and 60's for me.

In fact the speakers even started buzzing at higher sound levels as if one of the speakers were blown.I would'nt be so quick to rant if I feel I got my money's worth for the short time I had this tv, but the sad part is I only used this television an average of 1 HOUR A WEEK because I rarely have the time to watch.

Went to avsforum.com, and found over 50 pages of complaints on this unit, as well as the workaround to get it replaced. Turns out, there is a known design flaw on the system boards, and they routinely fail (causing the sparkles issue). Attempted to get the unit fixed, and since it was under warranty and could not be fixed within 15 business days, I was issued a full refund.

Basically thus far, this T.V. cost me $76/month to use. IF I pay to repair it, who knows how long it will last until it fails again.Odds are, I will scrap it, do my research for a more reliable brand, buy an extended warranty, and kiss a few hundred dollars goodbye on a smaller LCD set.Thanks Zenith (LG) for [...] my wallet dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud popping noise, black screen","review":"This worked ok for 3 1/2 years and then on July 4th I was watching TV and heard two loud popping noise and the screen went black, although could still hear the sound ok.

I can't possibly afford the module that needs to be replaced...again. So now I have a $3000 piece of garbage. Learn from me, don't buy Zenith or LG, they don't stand behind their products.

My subtitle for the book would be 'all I ever needed to know about LBOs' -- the RJR Nabisco buyout is an excellent case study. There's little too much extraneous detail on the characters -- it's distracting -- but perhaps that's an effort to give them some depth. Indeed, it's a pity that many of the main protagonists are so reprehensible -- I found it hard to empathise with any of the characters.

The side handle is made of a cheap plastic and attaches to the drill near the chuck with a cheap plastic hose clamp.That area near the chuck is round and painted smooth. Even when you tighten the thumb screw, the side handle is not secure. If you were to put a real bolt in place of the thumb screw, the plastic hose clamp would crack. The tool has plenty of power and torque being 6.5 amps, and so, if you are turning screws that are stiff, or drilling into something hard, the handle will slip and the whole tool will get ripped from the other hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it for Dewalt 7700 Radials","review":"The \\"bracket\\" is a short piece of aluminum angle with a hole drilled to pass the anti-kickback pawl. The hole is in the right place but appears a hand-drilled piece with erratic edges...i.e. no better than hand-drilling a piece of aluminum angle from Home Depot. More importantly, the bracket does position the laser effectively. This bracket holds the laserkerf laser much too close to the work surface so that the beam does not reach the edge of the blade or extend far enough onto the workpiece.Nice idea but basically a complete waste.If you want to mount the Laserkerf, which seems to be a decent piece of kit, position it by hand a few times to get a feel for where the beam will be cast, then cut your own bracket. It will take 15 minutes but work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird item","review":"This rag is a weird little item proposing a different method of shoeing horses than what was commonly being done at the time (pre-automobile).

If you lose the seeming unimportant scrap of paper found in the jewel box (which is totally empty except for the play disks and this little piece of paper), you're screwed. You need this ID code to install ALL the game disks. I didn't realize the importance of this little piece of paper, and I lost it after I moved my computer desk and all its contents. I had installed the SS and, when I tried to play the Chamber of Secrets, I couldn't believe I had to use the number code to install that game too.

Especially, \\"C by Example\\", by Greg Perry Que Publishers, and Greg's other book \\" Programming C in 12 Easy Lessons\\", Sams Publishing. Of course the \\" C for Dummies\\" is a big help also.

Many scenes focused on owners roughly handling their pets by throwing them into the air, using bed sheets to launch them into air, or other negligible acts.

For me it was disappointing on many levels. Since all the marketing hype presents Darkness Bound as an excursion into the dark and sexy world of bondage and fetishism I expect more than a vague and tepid kind of fumbling sensuality. The eroticism is very artificial at best. Keep in mind, bondage isn't really about sex, it's about the illusion of control and the loss of that control. While that might justify the book's inept sexuality, the dominant/submissive relationship is just as poorly portrayed. The characters are very shallow and the situations often are ridiculous enough to cause more laughter than arousal. Finally, the plot wanders, characters are poorly defined and the final effect is unsatisfying. I would suggest that the reader save his or her money and re-read Justine or the Story of O.

I pull this decorated binder out every year and this is one of my favorite stories in it. I was excited as I listened to a 3rd grade teacher read this version of the story to her class today. It is a beautiful, well written Christmas story, with a background story involving the Holocaust. The Holocaust stories are told as remembrances from the older characters in the book. The kids were enthralled with the book. They asked a few questions, but nothing too deep.Patricia Polacco is not afraid to tackle tough subjects: bullying, bigotry, Holocaust, etc. She writes as though she thinks kids are intelligent enough to learn and smart enough to change the world.

While this story might be appropriate for older kids, my grandchildren are 6,8 and 10--far too young to hear about these horrors.

One part of the cord is slightly scraped. I didn't actually expect it to work but it did, although I'm not sure how great of a charge it gave.For $1.20 it does the job but don't expect a new product. I've purchased generic Apple cords/chargers on Amazon before and this is the first time I've gotten something that looks used. It also takes forever to ship to you so don't expect it to come soon.

This usb worked ok at times. But it did take longer to charge than the usb that came with my product, and most of the time I had to wiggle it around the usb port for it to work.But the biggest problem is that it must overpower your computer, because when I inserted it into all of my USB ports on multiple laptops, it would cause the computer to shutdown. I can't recall if this happened with the 3gs because that was a long time ago, but def with the 4s. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP","review":"DO NOT buy this product it's so cheap that when I inserted the cable on my ipod the cable broke when I was taking it off.

Not sure if mine was an exception but I would not recommend this cable.Update: It appears that the tight cable connection damaged our 2nd gen nano.

It was a small hassle to try and connect the Ipod with the cord. The cord did successfully connect the Ipod to the computer. A month later, my Ipod died on me. I'm not sure if it was because of the age, or because of this new cord, but one minute it was working and the next it was gone. This cord is a suspect and I do not recommend it unless you want to take the risk.

I have bought several audio and video cables that have worked great that cost next to nothing. This was not the same. The end of the cable that goes into my Ipod does not attach smoothly. I have to angle the cord just right and force it in. I am almost afaid to use it because it might damage my Ipod. This is the case where I should have bought a higher quality cable.

Honestly, it just sat in my computer - but hey, I guess the constant minor charge from the USB port was too much for the pitiful thing. In less time than it took to get here, it broke. Certainly not ordering from this company again, nor would I suggest any of you do so.

The price was right for this cable and so I thought I would give it a try.I was surprised how quickly it arrived in the mail.The jack that plugs into my iPod was a bit tight. It appears to be ever so slightly larger than the original. However, it does fit. When I plugged the USB connector into my PC, iTunes came up and sync'd as expected. So this cable does everything the original Apple cable does.Except for slight difference in size of the connector to the iPod, this is a cost efficient means of replacing the original cable that came with your iPod.

Worse yet, it doesn't even work properly. This item should be removed from Amazon, and the companies that sell it should be banned.

Also, it seems as if it has caused a glitch in my phone. If I leave it to be fully charged, the battery indicator reads full no matter what!

That said, it's really tough to hear Cannonball's classics, both the bop and soul jazz tunes, rendered so smoothly. Eric's version of Mercy, Mercy, Mercy lacks all the soul that made the original so hip. I involuntarily cringed after the transition between Cannonball's spoken word intro and the new, oh-so-smooth drum machine groove. Work Song is supposed to be a field blues sung by slaves, and the original really does so with a driving, intense feel. This version is just weak and, let's face it, extremely white.If you like smooth jazz, Eric Marienthal is an excellent player of that genre, but if you are expecting a Cannonball tribute that actually captures the soul behind Cannonball's music, this isn't it. Extremely smooth interpretations lacking the fire that made Cannonball such a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"5 Stars\\" is an Understatement!","review":"This album, and, all others on which Eric can be heard truly demonstrate his phenomenal musicianship, including amazing lyricism, creativity and unparalleled technical ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine, slick, cliched, and overproduced","review":"This guy has not one iota of soul, which stands in stark contrast to Cannonball, who was soul personified.

I bought this the 1st day released based on how good the comic was. The comic was way better. This movie is just disappointing because it was an oversimplification, they cut so much and rewrote so much to cram it into 67 minutes. It loses alot of the menacing of Lex Luthor being president and is basically a big fight without substance. One of the best things about the comic was seeing Superman and Batman's contrasting thoughts and what they really thought of each other - this movie leaves that out. And while Batman does, Superman doesn't look quite like McGuiness drew him. Also some language was beyond the realm of the cartoons and didn't serve anything - the occurrences were just glaringly unfortunate.All in all If you're a fan of either Superman or Batman series you'll want to see this and maybe if you didn't read the comic book storyline, you'll like it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for kids","review":"I thought I was renting a kids cartoon. There was cursing. A kid in the movie makes sexual suggestions, including the creation of x-ray goggles to be able to see the very large breasts of one of the superheroes...

Power Girl, oh my goodness.The plot would have been merely passable had I not read the graphic novel on which it's based, but there is so much missing from the book that it's a travesty. Sure, books are always more detailed than movies, but the movie is 67 minutes.

Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles behind","review":"This was a real disappointment. The quality of the animation is frequently jerky, artistically lower than Saturday morning fare and miles behind last year's Gotham Knight. There's no reason to spend the money on a Blu-Ray for something with so little detail. Bodies are blocky and distorted, faces are expressionless.The voice acting isn't much better, with the exception of the always excellent Clancy Brown. Batman and Superman deliver their lines in virtual monotones that are barely distinguishable from each other. Dialogue is laughable, and the story isn't much better. The action sequences, while serviceable, don't rise to the level that they can redeem the movie's other flaws.

It works great! (NOTE: Don't buy the ODJOB mixing drum, just save your money and use a wheel barrow). If you use the product level with the ground you can use a wetter mix of concrete. If you need to use the stone mold on a slope use a stiffer mix of concrete so you can lift the mold to make the stone level, which is what I needed to do for the areas of my yard that have a small grade. It worked well in all situations and the form is very well made. You can use the form again right after you pour the first stone so you do not have to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pathway!","review":"Been using this mold this past week. Gone through over 20 bags of concrete and the mold is holding up wonderfully. Once you get the hang of the concrete consistancy (not too dry or wet), and the easiest way to fill the mold (using rubber gloved hands), it goes quick. One of the benefits of this type of mold is that it can be removed after just a minute of settling of the wet concrete, and you move on just as fast as you can mix another bag.

We have since bought 2 other forms in different patterns and used them in various places.

Plural is important, domestic plus export and import sales. I disagree with him on the unions' role, because he does not look at work rule problems. But otherwise, Tom Frank is right: The democratization of capital is largely a myth. Really, this is a thoughtful and - How did he have the time and stomach to read all that junk blah-blah management literature? - a very well researched and written book.

But the repetition is necessary, since the process that imprinted these ridiculous free market ideas on our brains is exactly the same. Endless advertising, spin, pundit-speak, and political/corporate syner-babble have brainwashed into seeing GNP, consumption, investment, jobs and other economic factors as the only appropriate matrix for social thought; and it requires an equally determined effort like Frank's to shake loose some of that haze. This book is excellent reading for people who want to understand how the \\"historical inevitability of globalization\\" is itself just another slickly-packaged product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an event!

I was sanding a plywood floor when my old sander died. The 4\\" Bosch is very heavy, but the weight comes in handy. I completed a 12 X 20 floor in thirty minutes this morning. I liked that I did not have to push down on this sander to make it work. I also liked that the wide footprint keeps the sander from biting groves when you change direction.When I ordered this sander, I was looking for a belt sander that has an option of a sanding frame. Both Dewalt and Bosch offer a sanding frame. I did not like the reviews on the Dewalt because I was reminded of electronic problems. I have been through that issue with Dewalt routers and it was not a pleasant experience. The wide belt also swayed me over to Bosch. So far, I am very happy with this sander.

A timely book for all.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKS SUBSTANCE AND QUALITY","review":"What this book does point out is the imposed limitations and oppressive treatment of women, and a country torn by war, unrest and political upheavel. Death and destruction seem to prevail though this short book, which leaves the reader with the impression there is nothing more worth mentioning about the country other than the Taliban movement who harbors the accused terrorist, Osama bin Laden. We learn little about the Afghanistan people other than that of the Taliban. If the reader is searching for answers in this book, they will not likely find them.The quality of the black and white photographs is extremely poor, so much so that some are hardly worth printing. The overall consensus of the book was that it lacked substance, quality and insightful information; the reading was equally as dark and gloomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-graduate?

I found myself not connected to her at all. She has been wronged by her family in the past, but her means of coping were completely childish and rubbed me wrong throughout the book.I would like to talk briefly about Pendleton, but that is difficult. We are not given a true character profile of our hero! I like to \\"know\\" the characters in the books I read, and Pendleton (even after reading this book) remains a mystery to me. What made him tick, what was important to him, why did he do the things he did......your guess is as good as mine!Overall...pretty disappointing. I laughed as certain times, and \\"kind of\\" appreciated the secondary romance, but I can't recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I read this before?","review":"This book was my first by Elizabeth Bevarly, so I didn't really know what to expect. I can't really say I liked it. I thought that Pendalton was an interesting enough character, but Kit was awful. From the very beginning I didn't like her. I have to like the characters in the book in order to really enjoy it. Also, the plot has been overdone. In order to get an inheritance Kit must marry within 2 years. Haven't I read that one before?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Man Pendelton","review":"Totally agree with Miss.G review. hated Kit character. how anyone could love her is beyond me. Glad it was free.

I could overlook the silly dialogue because it was a pretty clean book. (What sophisticated multimillionaire woman in her late 20's uses terms like \\"duh\\" and \\"hubba, hubba\\"?) However, when I finished 75% of the book and hit the heavy sex, I was done. It was a predictable story that wasn't that well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Man Pendleton","review":"I was totally disappointed with this book, it was free, but it was not funny, witty or any of the other words used to describe it. I read about 3 or more chapters of the book, and kept waiting for it to get interesting. Never did. Too many words describing things happening in the book, and not enough to keep up the interest in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out what you rebel against.","review":"I read this in one night. One of the best reasons is because it was both laugh-out-loud funny and touching. I was worried that Kit was going to ruin everything, just so she could be \\"right\\" and she just about throws a good man away, as in the old cliche \\"cutting your nose to spite your face.\\"Anyway, read Harriet's review, and then read this book. Elizabeth Bevarly knows how to take the rule \\"author's should not repeat words in the same vicinity,\\" and make it screamingly hilarious. None the less, her descriptions about feelings and the respective reflections and musings of both Pendleton and Kit as well as skilled writing craft make this book not just one to read for laughs.My favorite bookseller, Toni Bruner, owner of New & Recycled Romances in Costa Mesa, CA, calls this series of humorous romances \\"The Avon Ladies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good afternoon read","review":"This is a sweet little love story written with a lot of humor.

Don't waste your time. It was like a bad made-for-TV-movie. There is 2 storylines going on. One is Kit, who has to get married in order to save the family fortune, and then we have her brother who is a recovered alcoholic. The way Elizabeth Bevarly portrays a recovering alcoholic is completely ridiculous and inaccurate, (she must have never met one). Her brother is in love with Faith Ivory, who he has only seen once and is just enamored with her.

She wrote the perfect corporate type characters that reeked of money and a \\"business first\\" mindset.I thought the secondary romance throughout the story was a let down. I really wanted to see something happen with Holt and Faith. It was left to our imagination. I felt the author did a great two-step with both sets of characters. She went from chapter to chapter with each love story and it was refreshing to come back to them. I was as captivated by Holt as I was by Pendleton. All in all it was a fun read with realistic, vulnerable people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expecting a romantic comendy and Ms. Bevarly delivered","review":"I like romantic comedies and this fit the bill. Not entirely certain why Pendleton put up with all the nonsense instead of walking but I'm glad he did. You had to feel sorry a bit for Kit who's family has strongly discouraged or bought off any beau or potential beau she has had while growing up. You really can't blame her for playing the games she does when they now need her to marry. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that I'm glad she found love in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved, loved, loved it!","review":"Loved this story! There are a few typos, however they do not distract from this wonderful story. It is witty, funny and will tug at your heart. I look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"The character of Kit was simply awful, an obnoxious brat, odious enough that I don't know how ANY man could fall for her. And the character of Pendleton was so underwritten that I felt at times he was almost ghostly. The fact that he seemed to have no first name was only a part of this problem. I say, don't bother. In fact, I never made it all the way through this book before giving up in disgust--there are too many other good books out there for me to waste my time with bad ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"Very disapointing book, despite the overall positive reviews. Although if you look closely, quite a few of other reviewers share my opinion. Female main character is nothing more than a spoiled brat.

Such biting lyrics about homophobics and religious fanatics and narcissistic rockers. \\"Succumb\\" is extremely disappointing. In a sense, the band did seem to \\"succumb.\\" The songs here lack the biting, offensive lyrics and seem to lack a lot of intelligence as well. The musicality has gone downhill with everything else. If you ever have the chance to buy \\"Stay Away from my Mother\\" (at this point, you have to write a letter to Emperor Norton to do so) you should definitely do so.

I reviewed the 6 books available from my library and this was the only one I wanted to keep around. Aidell provides great base recipes and helpful timely tips for me and my crew as we tweak and develop our own recipes and techniques. I shall point out that Aidells' brand of commercially packaged sausage is inferior to the quality and flavor produced when following the recipes in this book. But really that should not have come as a surprise since homemade is usually worth the effort.We produced a most respectable medium heat level smoked andouille yesterday using Aidells' recipe using only half of the cayenne and red pepper called for.

The bratwurst we made come out perfect on the first try. The background information that it provides helps you see the entire process. Then, the details help you with tips-and-tricks that ensure success. It even tells you when things are going to be difficult (so we didn't try hotdogs for our first sausage making experience.) The recipes themselves taste great, and are much less greasy than what you can buy at the store. That, in itself, is worth the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much worth reading","review":"Perhaps the most complex and intelligent science fiction novel I have read in many years. Full of great ideas, cutting edge genetics, and some serious thought about the nature of war, violence, security and duplicity. At times the burden of ideas overwhelms the plot and characters, which are just not strong enough to carry the burden. The absence of any moral valence left me cold towards all the characters, even the protagonist who effectively conveys the blank affect of a genetically-overbred clone. In the end the author's imagination is more entrancing than the story. But this is definitely an author to watch, and someone whose books set a standard for being informed, thoughtful and engaged with the kinds of moral issues we face in the 21st.(speaking of which, the whole point of the book is that labels like 'gay' are just stupid, and if that is the most important thing you get out of this novel, I am really sorry you missed so much.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"page turner -- confusing at times","review":"This is the second book from an author that had a stellar writing debut in \\"Spin State.\\" Moriarty's biggest strength as a writer is the ability to create convincing layered characters and dialogue; and yet, her books are plot-oriented. This was a fantastic combination in \\"Spin State\\"; it is still good, but not quite as good, in \\"Spin Control.\\" Spin Control is a hard science fiction spy novel. The complexity of the plot at two levels -- trying to understand the operation of the futuristic universe Moriarty has created, and the complex politics -- is a bit overwhelming at times. Still a very solid read; but if you are a first time reader of Moriarty, I would recommend starting with \\"Spin State.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser","review":"Well it's my belief that if I really don't get someones ideas I'm usually beingBS ed in some way and that's the case here.

While it takes me about 2-3 times listening to a lesson before I really have it down, I have made good progress and am more than half of the way done with the discs. It's exciting to be able to converse with Native Mandarin speakers, and, without fail, they are extremely impressed with the accent and precision of pronunciation. I think I could learn more quickly from a program that is written out or on the computer; however, I don't think that other programs would give me the ability to speak with a Mandarin (really the Beijing dialect of Mandarin) accent. And, it suits my purposes perfectly since I necessarily have to listen and repeat while driving as opposed to visually following along with a program.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST THING SINCE THE MICROWAVE!!!!","review":"I have taken a foreign language and school and memorized vocabulary lists and that works for me, but this is quick and easiest way to learn.

Users should realize that spoken and written Mandarin are different and this course is ONLY for the spoken language. However, it is excellent for listening and speaking. The speakers in the series are clear and easy to understand. My only objection to this course is the lack of written material to accompany it (though the booklet that does come with it is very intersting and informative). Unfortunately, much of Mandarin sounds alike and most 'words' have multiple meanings depending on tone, accompanying words and context. A pinyin or other phonetic guide to the conversations would be very helpful. But for those with a good ear who want to learn by listening and speaking, this course is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment with child sewing machine","review":"This sewing machine is not appropriate for kids under 13, because it doesn't work very well by the foot pedal and when just using the on button, you must be ready to sew.

I dare anyone to listen to that song and not want to move, it just gets you going! My next favorite is \\"Wild Island Nights\\", I keep waiting for the palm trees to sway or the ocean to roll. It puts you right in the middle of some far away island with music from the natives rocking you all night! The other two songs, \\"Dream Rider\\" and \\"Sight of Heart\\" are also great!

You will get tired of hearing to buy genuine value when it's cheap, trust me. You will get tired of the hyperbole as well, along the lines of \\"follow this advice and you'll be a billionaire!\\"I bought the Kindle edition, and it's rather expensive as Kindle books go. Oddly enough, the book is the opposite of what it preaches: mediocre value at a high price.I would recommend you search the web for quotes from Buffett and do your own interpretation of their meaning.

Its a wonderful read and I highly recommend it! The Buffett quotes are both enlightening and often very funny, and the commentary to the quotes is aimed at giving the reader greater insight into Buffett's investment methods. I particulary found this comment insightful:\\"The key to Warren's success is that he has been able to identify exactly what the economic characteristics of a wonderful business are - a business that has durable competitive advantage that owns a piece of the consumer's mind. When you think of gum you think of Wrigley, when you think of discount store you think of Wall-Mart, and when you think of a cold beer you think of Coors or Budweiser.

The viewer gets to know all of the original members of the band, their personalities and artistic contributions. The film does an excellent job of explaining how and why Pearl Jam survived for 20 years.As a life long Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit there were a few events in the film that I did not know about. The film is full of different emotions and I laughed more then I thought I would. Overall, a must see for anyone who grew up listening to Pearl Jam.The extra footage in the delux edition is well worth the buy.

In this book, I was shocked at how little flexibility the scenarios offered. Life, including Army life, is about small decisions. This book only emphasizes big decisions. A quote I read once said \\"Life is what happens when you are making big plans.\\" In this book, that is all that needs to be remembered. The commander you play in this war game is a West Point graduate, and a graduate of several Army schools, including the Rangers. To paint him as a newbie is a real stretch, especially when dealing with an incumbent and overbearing platoon sergeant. The United States is played as a continually unprepared military power and the enemy is made out to be on steroids. This book is almost irrelevant post-Iraqi Freedom. Save your money and buy a David Hackworth book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to learn tactics","review":"I felt the book was very hard to pull lessons from. The book format has you making choices about tactical situations but when there is a good or poor outcome, there is very little information about why your decision and the outcome was good or poor.There are also many times where the author just asks you to roll dice to determine your fate which leaves you wondering what the lesson is.Worst of all, there is no chapter in the book that has a summary of the tactical situation or situations and actually teaches you how to review the tactical situation like a training soldier would.All in all, you can barely learn any tactics unless you are willing to make an investment of many hours reading the book multiple times to try to extract information in very small pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bulky","review":"The motor housing/handle of this grinder is too big to be comfortable.

It's a delight to hear \\"Kevin Is Gay,\\" come on in a random iPod session, right after RIDE or My Bloody Valentine, if nothing but for the fact that while it's along the lines of those bands in sound, it's a way more cheery. This will also remind you of mid 90's post grunge stuff from LA. I know the band hates this reference, but they sound a bit like The Breeders.

The variety of styles is impressive, even the \\"shoegazer\\" songs are well-crafted and non-stereotypical. I'm depressed, but not surprised, that this wasn't bigger - more of a statement of the sad state of music than Annie's talent. I'd love to see her make it, but I also admit it's nice having a secret again. . .and, yeah, more \\"Breeders\\" than MBV.

The shoegazing songs are delightfully loud and not as druggy as some of the other shoegazing that's out there, although I like that too (without the drugs being taken myself). What I like most about this album are those surprises that come up like at the end of smashing where follows her number with some unrelated cack.

Without making this entire review a comment on how this sounds like Mercury Rev, it does mix the chaotic noise of Yerself Is Steem and the focused beauty of See You On the Other Side.There is some interesting and unexpected use of electronics on this album, such as \\"Univac Bug Track\\" which features a lo-fi jungle beat along with the distant plucks of a string section looped, sometimes coming close to videogame soundtrack territory if it weren't so gorgeously muddy. The first track, \\"Silver Balloons\\" also has a familiar breakbeat and some nice Spacemen 3 styled guitars and vocals.Still, with all of the experimentation he can muster up, the best tracks are the drugged out ballads (The Ballad of the One Eyed Angelfish, NY Avenue Playground) which sit nicely amongst the freakishly diverse structure of The Orbit of Eternal Grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, but just a tad too short","review":"Nicely crafted, smooth edges with no burrs or irregularities.

If the shipment is still with the local custom, how come all the other shipments (they were actually rings & accessories also) arrived so swiftly and NOT this one?

Well, I not only cried at the end again, but cried and moaned during the movie. Why? Because about 15-20 minutes has been cut out of the movie, just like the VHS version. Segments cut out here and there do really tamper with the continuity of the movie. If I had not seen the COMPLETE movie on TV a few times, I would have definitely had troubling following the story. Only by filling in (in my mind), the parts that had been cut out, was I able to understand the story. My youngest son, watched the movie with me. I told him as the movie unfolded how this, that and the other thing was cut out. He asked \\"why would they do that Dad ?\\" I SAID, I DON'T KNOW.

I am a woman with over 20 years experience with power tools, I read and follow instructions carefully, and I do not force things to their breaking point. However, after one use with this tool, instructions in hand (having been forewarned), I went to change the blade. Though I followed instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the blade out. Again and again I tried, not knowing what I was doing wrong. The top plastic piece then broke right off leaving me in the middle of a job with no tool to finish.

Full disclosure: if you are the kind of person who doesn't carefully read all the instructions first, it is easy to break it while trying, with increasing force, to lock the blade.Why all this spinning and clicking anyway. Compare to the Milwaukee Sawzall: quarter turn locked, quarter turn unlocked, never fails under a lot more stress than a jigsaw might encounter.The bevel adjustment is equally awkward, though not likely to break.Someone else may know if there is a better Jig saw out there.

I first received one that was broken and had to be exchanged. On the plus side, I did receive the replacement fairly quickly. However, it turned out this treadmill is not computerized - a huge disappointment. While you can vary the speed and incline, you have to make the adjustments as you walk, they can't be pre-programmed.

Then, when I bought the game, I couldn't believe how much fun it was. There's a grip of real moves, and tons of combinations to keep you busy for a while. The environments are many and amazing, from malls, to schools, to Area 51. The only bad thing I can really say about this game is that it's slightly unrealistic (example, jumping off a roof of a tall apartment building, and grinding the top edge of a nearby one), but that's why it's a video game in the first place right?

If there was an option to either disable the music or at least change songs, I would appreciate that, though. Hearing the same incomprehensible song over and over, and OVER, continuously is a downside I think (but this is minimized by keeping the volume down). Freeskate games/scores cannot be saved to the memory card - which would be a nice option, also.It was still fun to play, despite my lack of experience with both system and subject matter. Watching my character skateboard as though both possessed AND under the influence (result of it being my first-time experience across the board) was absolutely hysterical. I also appreciate the injury graphics being both minor AND *far* from gory.My 10-yo is absolutely thrilled with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun...","review":"This game is really a fun game, but it doesn't really feel like skateboarding.

True, it is a complex system, and it took me quite a while to get up to speed. But once mastered, the sheer number of extensions provide an enormous resource that saves you a lot of time when you develop web-applications. I don't see Typo3 only as a content management system anymore, it is a web-application development platform. And that is where this book kicks in. I agree with other reviewers that the book is not very easy for people who get started with Typo3, but once you reach the stage of developing your own extensions, the book will guide you on that path. For beginning users, I would just recommend the videos on the typo3 website, but anybody who wants to get beyond the basics, this book is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst technical book ever","review":"I use Typo3 for a living and all I can say is this book is terrible.

I know, you're thinking \\"But Typo3 is so hard, I need a book and this is the only one, so I should just get it because it's the only choice.\\" I thought that too but it really isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

This organization works well and reads easily. The authors adopted a chatty and informal tone that doesn't sit so well. Further, their observations, with only a handful of exceptions, seemed not far beyond the realm of common sense.

I originally bought it because I needed to repair my very old foundations, and it was nearly impossible to dig through the very heavy clay and sandstone that my house is built on. This tool combined with the clay spade made digging the holes and trenches I needed possible. It's small size relative to other brands made it much easier to use. I also own the larger yellow breaker hammer for the big concrete breakup jobs, but I still often end up reaching for this one. It may take longer, but the light weight makes it much easier to use, especially when you are trying to break into something at an angle. The ability to rotate the bit is also extremely useful when digging holes with the clay spade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"The problem with all CS books is they show pretty outfits, which anyone with a little taste can create, but they lack direction on integrating the pieces into a functional wardrobe. Are the pictures pretty? Yes. Do you need another purple jacket that doesn't match with anything else than one outfit? CS books are about 90% single-outfit ensembles. Consider this before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for the fashion-impaired","review":"I found this book to be timeless and extremely helpful, not at all trendy. Unlike the fashion mags which are outdated one week after they go on sale, this book gives tips on how to build a year-round wardrobe from the ground up, with basic, timeless fashions and advice on how to coordinate tops, bottoms, shoes. It is a big help for those of us who are shopping addicts and tend to buy trendy clothes and accessories only to find we don't have a thing to wear 4 months later. Also try \\"Dressing For Occasions\\", another Chic Simple book. I would not recommend this for fashionistas in the big cities or women with an interest in lots of inexpensive trendy up-to-the-minute items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at but not a practical guide","review":"The design and photos are beautiful and elegant. I loved the layout and it's a book I enjoy leafing through for pleasure.As a practical guide to building a wardrobe I found it frustrating. The clothes shown are lovely but seem very geared toward people with a lot of money and/or time who can afford to purchase chothes at exclusive boutiques (or comb through sales racks & thrift stores). Many items shown also come from private collections. As a small, pear-shaped mom with a limited budget and no time I just couldn't imagine how I'd ever build such a wardrobe.Sooo if you want a lovely book to look at, this is great. If you want a quick, easy to use workbook for any budget, look elsewhere.I continue to dream of a simple workbook that will help a woman with budget, time, and figure limitations build a great wardrobe.

Including the initial read, I've referenced this book once since.If you are an absolute fashion beginner (with little or no existing wardrobe to build upon) with a sizable budget, get this book. The pictures are fabulous, and the cuts and styles are basic enough to find even today -- among finer designers.If not, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definition book rather than style or fashion.","review":"This book is terribly simple. It gives no suggestion of style but plenty of definition to the different types of clothing. It does nothing for my wardrobe. The one star is for the pretty pictures. Eventhough one outfit is shown with other pieces, you still have to find and buy those other pieces... more to clutter your closet with. If mix and match is what you want, you are better off taking advice from Spiegel catalogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Every Woman Should Own","review":"At first I wasn't sure I would like it. Once I began to read all of the information provided I realized how useful this book really is. I have a closet of clothes and it is teaching me how to combine textures and different pieces to create my own style. This book is a timeless book because it stresses the importance of classic clothes. It allows for fads but it's basic intention is to show the consumer how to shop and actually spend less money by buying classics and working from a starting point. For those who want to always look pulled together this book is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't bought this book!","review":"I am just starting to build a professional wardrobe and hoped this book would help me save money on clothes. The book does have some striking photographs, but the design is so incredibly distracting that I couldn't concentrate on what the text actually said. Which might have been just as well: what little I could stomach was trite and banal. Most of page 169, for instance, is devoted to a huge-font reproduction of the words to \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\" If I had come across this book in a bookstore I never would've bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For lovers of quotes, not clothes","review":"Simple, o.k., but where's the chic?

The criticism I have of the book is that he advocates a special diet, rather than focusing on what your body tells you it needs. Another book \\"The Overfed Head\\" by Rob Stevens shows you how to do that with the goal of losing weight. I think the information from Roizen and the knowledge from Rob Stevens would be the perfect combination to lose weight and be healthy and feel great....so check out \\"The Overfed Head\\" in addition to this book.....I lost 15 pounds in one month without any sort of diet and have kept it off!

I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this book as much as cellulite","review":"While Oz and co. might have some useful advice, good diet tips and groundbreaking news for anyone battling their weight - the book is practically unbearable to read. It is so wrought with lame jokes, bizarre cliches, cheesy metaphors and otherwise unfunny attempts at humor that I just couldn't stand it. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that there are more than three or four of these types of inclusions on every page. I don't know why a respected doctor would litter his book and obscure his message with gratuitous (and lame) jokes.I'm all for information the \\"Average Joe\\" can comprehend and a dieting book that isn't a drag to read, but seriously, this is a right mess.

The illustrations are very well done, but were distracting to me and I am usually not distracted easily when reading a reference book.The diet is good and is exactly what I believe to be a healthy way to live.All in all, if you want to learn about your body on a diet this is a good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For inexperienced dieters only","review":"The book basically tells us what experienced dieters already know. Stay away from processed foods, sugar, fat, and so on. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. Eat smaller meals more often (6) rather than a few larger ones (3). Exercise; aerobic (walking) and strength training (weights or bands). He states eat less calories and burn more through exercise. If you have ever dieted before you know this already. The book with the images and factoids seemed like a book I would have read in grade school. The positives; it told you some foods that were good for different parts of your body, such as tomatoes are good for the skin, etc. There were a few good recipes. But you could get this information on the internet, rather then spending the money on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can trust this diet","review":"I read everything I can get my hands on in the way of diet so I aced the test in this book, but the one thing I can't get past is making myself exercise. This book finally made me get off my duff and do it. You can't help but be convinced that you're not wasting your time when you read this book. While I prided myself on my knowledge of diet, I still learned a lot of interesting things I'd never known before and, more importantly, understand now what you need to do to compensate for the bad habits I have such as using food to deal with the stress in my life.

However no matter what the good doctor says it is a diet. And like all other diets that I have tried for my whole life if you follow it it will work.

That advice works exactly as well as the \\"Just Say No\\" campaign!This book offers the answers I needed, based on solid research. That those answers are presented with a light touch is a plus!New ideas are sprinkled throughout, interrelationships between hormones, food, and stress explained.

The book is disorganized. The index is shoddy. many many aspects covered in the TV special are not even in the book (aargh). The book could use a seasoned editor. if the book followed the same organized and simple format of the PBS special, then it would be worth it.

The meal plan is easy to follow with real ingredients most of us actually would eat, although there are a few grocery items that were kind of odd.

It is an easy read and takes complicated material and puts it in plain language that anyone can understand. The amount of material in this book is HUGE. It is definitely a book that you will benefit from owning rather than just giving it a once over read. I refer to it over and over again.This book is more of a health manual than a diet plan. It is explains how food reacts in your body and why different foods help you feel full and others make you crave more. For me, it makes it a lot easier to make healthy choices because I understand the why behind it.

Their approach is fresh. I can say that. You must think out of the box when it comes to weight loss dieting because most diets ultimately fail. I think their physiological information on the human body's processes is invaluable and explains in quite simple terms what is possible and to what extent success can be attained. The biological in tandem to the body's psychological response is key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popular but weak on details","review":"Dr. Oz is great in his ability to deliver information in a fun and popular manner. Unfortunately this book is full of cute explanations that actually leaves people more confused than delivering the scientific facts. Worse though is some misinformation (Examples: page 136 has a list of blood test levels - the first TSH advises \\"less than 5\\" when it should be less than 2.2; Page 98 implies Sucralose, Aspartame and Saccharin are ok for you yet scares you away from the best choice of the list: Stevia).Hopefully this book will help a lot of people improve their health. Unfortunately I can't recommend it as a good source of facts about nutrition (actually it may cause some harm by spreading false information). Don't trust medical doctors for information on nutrition. Do your own research.The main message is great though: eat healthier and exercise, lose excess weight and you'll do wonders for your health."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID","review":"I thought this book would be professional and interesting.

Its really the same info in a new cover with humor that soon becomes monotonous, repetitive and condescending. There are no new medical breakthroughs in this book! The basic premise is this - eat less - exercise more- sound familiar? The diet plan is very similar to weight watchers. The only information in this book that surprised me were the chapters on using diet drugs, getting weight loss surgery and/or liposuction!

I'm surprised that so many people seem to think that buying this (or one of the literally dozens of other similar books on the market) will provide something in the way of a \\"new and improved\\" way to lose weight.

The authors use a good amount of humour and practic advise to keep you interested while still being informative. I decided to try the plan and found it was difficult to follow. I actually could not find any bread without high fructose corn syrup in it, for example. This being said, this is sound advise on how to make a lifestyle change and would be made even simpler if you did what most people know, eat whole foods and avoid processed.I am most fond of the exercises suggested as they do not require any equipment and ther doc's strong suggestion of daily walking.All in all this is a great resource but will be difficult for the harried American to follow.

It is not. When has any other diet book gone into such detail about digestion and how our bodies store and use fat? When have you ever heard the word Omentum before? This book really makes you realize what you are doing to your body with fat and sugar. It makes you WANT to eat better. It tells you WHY you should eat certain foods and what happens when you eat food. It's great. I have been following this plan, and it really works. You can eat, be satisfied, and not starve yourself. It has recipes, tells you what to order when you eat out, and puts you in control. I can't even consider eating a cookie after reading this book. If I look at one, I get images in my head of what my body will do with that cookie, and it's not pretty.

If you already know, then I recommend that you go for their DVD. The instructor does the entire workout with you, and it's much easier to follow than trying it based on the pictures/diagrams in the book. The exercises are easy to do, and I felt the pain the next day. It works! I tried some of the recipes. Some of it was pretty good and easy to make, but I thought the calories were high.

Insulting and trite.","review":"Fortunately, I checked this out from the library instead of spending money on it. I couldn't even manage to read it, let alone figure out what they were trying to suggest.I found the constant insulting analogies extremely off-putting. Really, if you're trying to encourage people to lose weight and let go of the all-or-nothing beliefs that lead many people to give up after the first slip, then you should reconsider slipping an insult into every other sentence.Absolute junk. Send your copy straight to the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are windy","review":"This may be a good diet but the book is nearly unreadable. These guys take for ever to get to the point, what ever that is.We read their first book and enjoyed it but this is a yawner.I wanted to at least find a list of foods to avoid and a list of recommended foods. If there is one I was unable to find any reference to it in the index and unwilling to read the entire book.I am disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"You: On a diet: the Owner's Manual for Waist Management","review":"Lost interest about 1/2 way through book.

A rehashing of things we (anyone who diets and follows diets) doesn't already have knowledge of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I'll start out by saying that these doctors know their stuff and I respect the essence of what they have to say about diet and health. I read a very good article in a men's health magazine about a year ago (unfortunately I can't locate it at the moment), but I believe it was by them, titled something like \\"How to Feel Like 50 When You're 80\\", and that was a great article. I saw the piece about them and this book on 20/20 and the info presented there made sense, and in fact that is what inspired me to get the book. Needless to say, I was disappointed when I started to read it. The goofy analogies and metaphors in nearly every paragraph made me cringe, and the endless sidebars interspersed in every chapter were distracting and made it hard to focus on the material. So I must go against the grain here (I am amazed at all the glowing reviews) and give this book a poor rating for its bad writing style and lack of good organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"common sense book a little boring","review":"This is a good book. It is basic common sense and is easy to follow. It is a little boring though it goes into very detailed description of medical reasons why we are fat from the things we eat. I would highly recommend it if you are prepared to give up white flour, sugar and junk food. It is also written with a bit of humor to make up for the boring parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Unreadable","review":"I had to be refunded for this book on the Kindle Reader. Many sections of the book appear to have charts or columns that went off the screen no matter what size font I chose on the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful as well as humorous","review":"This book really helped me look at eating in a whole new way. It is so much more than a diet book. It is also a medical book, teaching how the body processes all foods and what actually takes place, whether good or bad. I think it is very important to read the entire book rather than skip to the back for the diet and exercise program. If you don't read the book, then the diet and exercise won't mean anything--it will just be \\"another diet and exercise program\\" in a long list of others that haven't lasted. This is the only book in this genre that has really impacted my eating habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and informitive book","review":"My husband and I both love this book. We learned so many things about how your body works. You can feel good about practicing what they teach. It just feels right. Healthy & Balanced, not like your depriving your body of Carbo's or Protein. The work out is great too. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE. Not just people who need to loose a few pounds-- If you are interested in being healthier and understanding how your body process food, BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"way of life\\" teaching","review":"I read this book because the cover said that I would be able to lose upto two inches around my waist with what the authors called a \\"two week reboot\\". While that did not happen, what did happen was that the book opened up my mind to many things that I was doing wrong. I think that anyone who has had a weight problem knows what it feels like to yo-yo from a peak weight to a lower-than-peak weight while continuing to remain obese. This book has enabled me to create a checklist for myself and I have been following it for the last three months. I have ended up losing around 12 pounds. Most importantly, it has made me feel good about myself. This is NOT a fad diet book but something more akin to a \\"way of life\\". Great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realize your potential","review":"Having seen Dr Oz many times on Oprah, I was curious about his book... and I was not disappointed. I've been dieting 11 weeks now and everything in this book really works! Where I have failed before, now I am succeeding (23 lbs lost so far). I just needed it explained to me in an easy understandable \\"ah hah\\" sort of way. It's like all these secrets are known by doctors but no one (until Oz) has told us how easy it really can be... to realize our weight loss potential. So much of it is commmon sense that you find yourself saying \\"ah hah\\" throughout the book :) and the way the sections are organized, you are guided through the book and taught in a way that is easy to comprehend. Highly recommended for those who want to make a lifestyle change, as this is not just another diet book... it's a way to permanently change your diet and exercise to achieve a healthier you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks!

Its great to have the series reprinted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to its superior predecessors","review":"A stilted variation on the previous books in this excellent series. I found it difficult to become interested, as for once Cook's easy writing style seems to have deserted him. While this one disappoints, Cook's track record with this series is good enough that I will be eagerly lining up to buy the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it went to the used book store as soon as I finished","review":"\\"Beer and a Shot\\" book. The writing is done in extremely short chapters,a page to seven or eight. It reads as if the writer sat down, poured adrink, worked until the drink ran out, and then stopped until the nextday. The first few Garrett books were imaginative and fun, an interestingmixture of Chandler and fantasy. The series has run its course, however,and it seems time to end it. Garrett the P.I. would have smelled this one amile away and flushed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Visual","review":"Being a very visual person, I bought \\"Men At Work\\"-- photographs by Lewis W. Hine-- to help me in my research for a novel. I was not disappointed! Not only were the photographs a remarkably authentic look at what went on at the Empire State Building site as it was going up in 1930-31, the captions gave me a clearer idea of how the various 'gangs' worked; i.e., the rivet gang, the derrick gang, etc. etc. For anyone who is interested in looking at how men worked in the building industry, with some additional pictures on railroad workers and miners, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality. Coffee-table book of great photos","review":"Superb collection of Hine's later work. Not what's usually thought of when we think of Hine. A short book, not a lot of writing-it's about the photos, which are wonderful. I bought a \\"used\\" (like new) first edition (has better quality photo reproduction than more recent reprints). Great tonal range and good size to enjoy these important, rarely seen photos. A worthwhile addition to anyone's photo library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I love the cd.

We found the best places to stay, motels and bed and breakfasts that are really special, at a great price. I used this book for planning many trips to the Southwest, for myself and friends, and it was always a great experience. It is the best reference books on places to eat and to stay, phone numbers of attractions etc. You can find every place in the Southwest. However, I would still use another travel guide for more detailed information about e.g. national parks and monuments or specific hiking tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed info, very good","review":"Very personal writing style and detailed recommendations make this a great read and a great guide. This book covers the major sights in more detail than most compact guidebooks. The maps are easier to read than most guidebooks due to higher contrast. I loved the suggested iteneraries and \\"hidden\\" travel suggestions you may not find in other guidebooks. This is a thick book, maybe a bit bulky for travel. I do recommend it. It has been a great guide to help me plan a trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Modern Classical Music","review":"I stumbled upon Rautavaara's music by chance, and have been grateful ever since! Eschewing a virtuosistic approach, Rautavaara opts instead for a rich, ocean-like orchestral style which completely envelops the listener. The three works presented in this CD are representative of the best of what this modern composer has to offer, making it an excellent buy for the listener making his first contact with Rautavaara or modern classical music in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"I would not recommend this book to help one study for the ANCC Psychiatric-Mental Health CNS exam. It is outdated in content (except Freud of course), I disagreed with many of the rationales for the answers.

Besides acting as a manual for future grass-roots organizations batteling corporate giants, It gives hope to those who feel they are faced with insurmountable odds.

The one that I kept for myself works just ok...it randomly skips sections of about 1 second when playing back mp3 CDs. If the disc is replayed, it never skips again in the same locations. This leads me to conclude that the player is faulty. I bought it for 2 reasons: first is because I've only ever heard great things about all eclipse products and second because the player was only $50. It's not worth replacing, but kinda funny when passengers notice the skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent historical romance","review":"i loved loved loved this book! it was a relief to find the characters showing a semblance of their real historical time, and not acting like transplanted, liberal americans into earlier centuries. loved the imperfection of the characters- how the knight is aging but jolly; how the lady is cold and too organized but has a lot of suppressed feelings. and i love how they resolve their conscience in the end. it's good! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good (Slightly) Old-Fashioned Romance","review":"I stumbled across this rarity - a medieval that isn't a \\"paranormal\\" (and why oh why is that now a rarity??) While I wouldn't call Once a Knight \\"hilarious\\", it is infused with gentle humor. More than anything, it's a well-written book by a very talented author who doesn't let her long-time success make her lazy. The characters are developed and believable, the plot plausible, the editing crisp. Most of all, I just fell in love with the Alisoun and David, I felt that they were \\"real\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't like Alisoun or David. While a lot of other reviewers felt that Alisoun was too cold for David, I felt that they deserved each other - they were both stupid.Basically, my recommendation is to skip this book, but if you are a huge Dodd fan, check it out from the library. I know a lot of other reviewers loved this book - so I guess it is worth checking out from the library or borrowing to see if you like it. If you haven't read Dodd before, don't start with this one - most of her other books are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once a knight","review":"I have to say this is the most boring book I've read in a long time.

It won't be the last because I did enjoy it but it didn't thrill me. I found it to be humorous in some spots and down right boring in others. I liked the hero and the author really developed him well. The heroine left a lot to be desired. She was a cold fish and even during the love scenes I didn't think she thawed any. I also found this story a bit hard to follow at times. It seemed like the conversation would start and stop at the weirdest times and lines seemed to be out of place. I did like the secondary characters in this book and would be interested in reading future books with their stories.

The author utilizes many illustrations, photos, tables and graphs to enhance text descriptions of concepts. Organic growers have a harder time warding off insects, diseases, weeds, and mammals effectively. This book describes the theory as well as the integrated pest management techniques, making the reader a better all-around viticulturist. In addition, chapters describe many grape species and cultivars, propagating techniques, grafting methods, and grapevine physiology. I highly recommend this book for both organic and conventional grape growers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"A Guide to Grape Growing in The Northeast would be a more accurate title.

Seeing some potential for our 40 acres, I recently invested in a small library on grape growing and winemaking, and find this book to be first-class. It is very straightforward and gives a great introduction to the growing of grapes in general, with enticing tangents about grape propagation and breeding. I did not find the book burdened by the \\"organic\\" in the title. He offers a wide variety of solutions to grape growing problems, and while his philosophy favors organic methods, I didn't find the book awkwardly tied to only those solutions. I thought it was very balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"author knows grape growing","review":"Lon Rombough has written an easy to understand book with many helpful suggestions based on a true understanding of how grapes grow and what they need to be healthy and productive.

It was nice to get a break from books about man stealing friends and cheating husbands. This book was excellent. It was well-written, it flowed smoothly I did not want the boo to end.

I finished this book in 2 weeks because I wanted to savor every page. I didn't want it to end. I read the book in '98 when I just happened to see it on the bookshelf and thought I'd try it out. What a wonderful surprise!! It usually takes me a long time to finish a book (even the ones I really like). This is the only book that ever made me CRY.

The characters were two dimensional and the plot took many interesting twists and turns. I have always been an avid reader of African-American fiction books but I have never read one where the friendship of two women were so deeply explored. I didn't feel that they glossed over things. The plot also caused you to think of things in your own life. I could see myself and my friends in this book. I have given many copies to my friends. My book discussion group had a lively discussion which branced off into many other topics. I would have to say with all honesty that this is to date my favorite fiction book. I am excited that the authors have written a new book. I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago when it first came out. I loved it. I found it to be a real page turner. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I think it showed, at least a little bit, what its like for a woman to put her career first and hit such highs and have no love, as in Pat's case, or to put everything in a man to have all the material things in life and be rendered so low, as in Gayle's case. I might have been a little partial to this book since one of the main character's name was not only the same as mine, but spelled the same, which you don't see often. I really liked this book and found it to be very entertaining and have been really looking forward to another book by this duo. I also thought this book would make a great movie. I mean, how many times have we been forced to sleep in that bed we made? Sometimes its as smooth as 300 count sheets.

I had no sympathy for Ramsey at all (what a great twist in the story).What was funny was my best girlfriend recommended this book along with a list of 10 other Black authors she met at a retreat in June 03, in NY.

So I picked it up to finally read it, and I was sorry I did not read it earlier. This is a very good book! I really enjoyed it. The only reason I gave it only four stars though was because I felt that the emphasis on race was too constant. The story would have been just as effective without the readers constantly having to be reminded that the characters are black. I would reccommend this book, especially to women, as they will best understand the delicate nature of female friendship.

But that's publishing, especially where black markets are concerned. The marketing mavens see a vein of sales, and then mine it until that market is so saturated with knock-offs that nobody sells anything. At that point they move on to the next \\"new thing\\". There's a raft of books like this that are being dumped wholesale into the marketplace, with the result that a great many black female writers with potential are simply not learning the craft of serious writing. A waste and a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down - Absolutely wonderful","review":"With style and grace, the authors take us on a world wind tour of the main character's ( Gayle and Pat) lives, friendship and family.

One, given a home by her friend and her parents, never quite feels at home or that she belongs; the other who always felt she belonged, discovers she really doesn't. This book chronicles their lives as they go their separate ways and their paths cross throughout their adult life.

The authors show you what can happen to a friendship when you let bull_ _ _ _ get in the way. Although the characters were highly immersed in drama, I must admit I stayed up a night or two to see how the characters were going to survive his or her particular drama. This is a very good effort for the first time novelists and I eagerly anticipate their second effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tryin' to Sleep is an extraordinary book about relationships","review":"This book enthralled me from page one. Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made allowed me to eavesdrop on the lives of Gayle, Patricia, and Marcus. However, by the end of this work, I felt more like a close friend who had shared in the experiences of these characters rather than an intruder. If you're searching for a heart-warming book about overcoming past horrors and building solid relationships, then turn the pages of Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made--you'll surely find it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baster!","review":"I have managed to melt every single baster I've ever owned.

I simply cannot get this thing to not immediately drop all its contents within seconds of suction. I suck up the hot liquid, and it all dumps out again within 2 seconds. I hear it all go in, and then when I lift it or just move it just a little it all goes rushing out. It's nice, though, construction wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - best baster ever!!","review":"I ordered this baster to replace an old plastic one, which was discolored (YUK) and had started to crack. No matter how long I soaked it and right after using the plastic one, it seemed to never get clean to my satisfaction. I absolutely love this metal one, and it comes with a brush!!! and a metal tip (injector) to infuse the meat. The clean up was great, I just put soap on the brush and scrubbed the inside of the baster. Metal is a lot better at getting clean than plastic, because the plastic absorbs odors, and bacteria, no matter how much you scrub. One thing I do want to point out, when you are basting your meat with hot juices, be VERY CAREFUL, do not touch the metal tube of the baster, I did without thinking and it does give you a start. This does absorb heat and you can and will get stung, so be mindful of that. This is a very sturdy baster, that will last for years and remain clean of all bacteria and odors. You won't regret using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-designed, easy to clean, no more plastic BPAs!","review":"I've been on a quest to rid my kitchen of plastic and BPA chemicals and bought this.Who would think a stainless steel baster could be so much fun to use? This baster feels solid in your hand. It's real. It's substantial. It's worth the money. I am using this baster more than I ever used the old crappy plastic one.We are so inundated with plastic made-in-China junk these days. One forgets how much better stainless, ceramic, and glass feels in your hand and looks on your shelf and in your cupboard. Solid. Clean. Something that will still be around next year and five years from now.It's so easy to slide the bulb off and on.Extremely easy to clean... with or without a dishwasher.Stainless steel is sanitary.It's just a humble baster. But it's something more in stainless steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stainless baster","review":"I use this for pulling hydrometer samples out of a homebrew fermenter and it works very well.

The injector tool is very sharp so be careful where you store that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"This book provided straightforward, invaluable information to our family when faced with our child's seizure disorder. It explains all the medical terms that our neurologist seemed to throw around without explanation (thereby scaring us!). It is optimistic and practical. It spans everything from how to deal with seizures, the pros and cons of different treatment, and how your child can live a full life. Most of all it put us at ease and educated us as to how to proceed with our child's medical treatment. It also helped guide us with what to tell others - the school, babysitters, grandparents. Definitely a must read for parents dealing with a child with seizures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive","review":"Obtained this book as my grandson was diagnosed with epilepsy. The book give some good information, but overall, seemed too basic. The book repeatedly mentioned that most forms of childhood epilepsy will frequently resolve with time - I think this is somewhat unrealistic and tends to minimize the problems associated with this condition.The only 2 things I learned from the entire book was not to overindulge or overprotect the child and that the seizure threshold increases with age.I was looking for strategies to help my grandson cope with epilepsy - but this book did not really provide that. It may be best suited for those children who have benign idiopathic seizures, such as febrile, but not for those who have other abnormalities that will not resolve with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This would have to be one of the best reads around for parents, friends or carers dealing with children and epilepsy.

The authors of this book make a valient effort to condense material about neurology to parents. This is a tall order.I am an EEG technologist, and life long student of neurology. I found this book a fairly easy read based on pacing and structure, but I am not so sure that people who do not have a good foundation in the life sciences, let alone neurology, will have such an easy go of it.Never the less, I strongly encourage those unfortunate parents to take a crack at reading this book, and taking notes to bring to the neurologist of their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disliked","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to be over.

I read it while in Fallujah. This is simply a phenomenal book! It reads quickly, is very interesting, and gives the reader an appreciation for how massive the Allied deception campaign was in the months leading up to the invasion of Normandy.To the reader who gave this book one star, I am not sure anyone, other than Adolf Hitler, will ever know what he did or did not believe. One point that all readers should appreciate is that the author was a private who waded ashore on June 6, 1944 and survived an event without parallel in the European Theater of World War 2. The author has my utmost respect and admiration. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"purely fictional entertainment","review":"This book is just another attempt at selling interesting sounding ,far-fetched assertations.They are many gross mistakes not only in the text,but also in the illustration captions.For instance,one of his captions claims that hitler predicted the Normandy landing at Pas decalais,instead of Normandy.The fact is hitler did indead predict Normandy,while others did not share in his view.Also,a Skorzeny attempt at killing Roosevelt.Hoodwinking hitler makes a great fictional novel based on real people,but it's research and historical accuracy lack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! 30 years.","review":"I purchased the lp the day it was released in '75, saw EJ at Madison Square Garden later that year.

This re-issue is phenomenal.Just last Friday, my wife & I saw Elton again at Madison Square Garden. The first 45 minutes or so were dedicated to his most recent studio disc \\"Peachtree Road\\", which we all politely listened to. After, he went straight into \\"Captain Fantastic\\", (all but 2 songs)and the place went crazy.

One thing I can think of off the top of my head is the story behind Lady Jessica's(Paul's mom) conception and birth. There are now 2 differing versions of what happened between the Baron and Rev Mother Mohiam. In the Encyclopedia, she has one child and leaves her with the Bene G's. In Dune: House Atreides....she does somethng totally different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Superior to the Prequels","review":"The authors of the three Dune prequels (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino) have repudiated The Dune Encyclopedia and it is very unlikely to be reprinted because parts are inconsistent with the prequels. Having read both, I believe that The Dune Encyclopedia is closer to Frank Herbert's vision than the prequels. For example, in the prequels the planet Ix, source of technology for the Empire, is ruled by one of the Great Houses. In Frank Herbert's books no mention is made of Ix being affiliated with the nobility, and The Dune Encyclopedia follows Frank Herbert in making it an exception to the general system. This book also fills an important place because Frank Herbert enjoyed introducing concepts such as the Orange Bible or the Bulterian Jihad without much explanation. The conclusions reached here seem plausible given the structure of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert. If you can find this book at a used book sale, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mua Dib demands a reprint!","review":"I have read and re-read this refferance numerous times.

My hands actually hurt after using the Hitachi for only a couple of cuts. The Dewalt was designed so that you can't see the blade as you're cutting, and the base was far out of alignment with the blade.The Bosch is far more comfortable to use. I can see the leading edge of the blade, and the guide marks at the front of the base are quite accurate, so \\"cutting to the line\\" is pretty easy. It has plenty of power, as it now comes with a 15-amp motor. The base isn't perfectly aligned with the blade, but it's much closer than either of the other two saws. I haven't had any trouble with the base flexing, even though it's not as stiff as the Hitachi's.All in all, it's clearly the best of the three saws. I never tried the Makita.If you're in the market for an 8-1/4\\" saw, I recommend that you start with either the Bosch or Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"An oversimplified summary about Soros","review":"For those who admire George Soros and would like to be able to quote the sacred name in front of his/her average investor friends, fine.

The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but disappointing","review":"Several friends who'd had turduckens raved about them.

It then takes a good 200 pages for anything of real interest to occur once more. The ending is rather good & one would not suspect whose responsible for the nasty goings on. Trouble is are we reading a murder mystery or a Mommy & Me story? There is so much superfluous fluff written into each chapter dealing with the kids it kills the book. It seems it's written in there to take up space. You'll find yourself scanning, instead of reading, to get past the Mommies & little ones. I came close to just chucking this one. So much unnecessary verb-age I'll have to rate this a 1 star despite the rather good ending. This was my 1st & last novel by this author"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah, right","review":"To go along with the premise of this book, you would have to believe that a mother of small children would willingly commit suicide leaving her children in the hands of a psychopath who has just threatened her child's life.

I'm sorry, but I can't believe anyone is dumb enough to commit suicide and leave her child(ren) motherless on the guarantee of a psychopath that her child will be spared.

She writes excellent contemporary heroines and has an excellent grasp of what it is to be a mother in todays hectic world. That said, I loved the book and for a while, I was truly scared. Unfortunately I think she choked at the end and didn't give the conclusion the same attention to detail as she did the beginning and middle of the book. Rather than continuing the leisurely pace that she set from the start, it seems like she rushes to an uncharacteristically trite and unsatisfying conclusion. I do recommend this book, just not as much as I recommend all of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After listing to the album a couple of times I realized that it is one of, if not the greatest, album After Forever has released.

The girl happens to be in France, precisely when Sigma is in France...But if you want a decent story with fast paced adventure, this is a great story... It kept me wondering what will happen next, and I finished it rather quickly.I have been a fun for years, after I first read Amazonia and keep coming back... the Sigma Force books are starting to run on the same storyline though.Overall I liked it for a decent adventure story so it go 4 stars.

It was my first James Rollins book and unless he gets a decent editor, it will be my last. \\"Monk leapt to Cat's aide, utilizing his medical training.\\" The text is stilted, adds redundant details and stretches every scene until I can't wait to get it over with. Let's not forget that Monk has medical training (I couldn't help but see Tony Shaloub's face every time I heard \\"Monk.\\") The \\"taut thriller\\" is written in an overly dramatic style, like a romance novel for people that don't like frills.

It has all the stereotypical actionfest elements but none of them are done very well. This one tries the DA VINCI CODE hat on for size but the author forgot to make the historical/scientific stuff interesting must less believable. The cookie cutter characters are unusually poorly drawn so much so that when one is seriously injured I found myself hoping I wouldn't have to see him again. You won't care who did it or why but you will be happy that this one's finally over so much so that I doubt you'll want to sample the excerpt from the next book in the series that's included in the paperback edition.

Amidst all the recent Da Vinci Code rip-offs, this book manages to set its own tone and succeeds in delivering a fast-paced plot and likeable characters.With the currently popular mix of religion, history and science, Rollins weaves a plot with many twists that at times feels like an Indiana Jones yarn. The book is a bit long but kept me going back for more.The sadistic villain Raoul is as sinister as they get, but his end is a bit disappointing; you'd expect a more befitting treatment of a man capable of such evil.If you are a fan of the genre, don't skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This is a canned product with only a potential for having been a decent reading.

I have now read all of his books and shelved them behind glass along with Douglas & Childs and Diana Gabaldon as treasures to pass along in my will.

I jumped right into the story, and immediately liked the main character of Gray. But as the story progressed I found myself losing interest. \\"Map of Bones\\" does have it's moments, but for some reason it fails where other Rollins books, like \\"Excavation\\", \\"Amazonia\\" and \\"Ice Hunt\\" succeed. I just couldn't get into the rhythm of the story. I would find myself losing interest, or getting it confused with \\"Excavation\\", a better story involving strange gold and religion. Normally when I crack open a Rollins novel I eagerly come back to it and usually finish it off within a couple days. That was not the case with \\"Map of Bones\\". I would pick it up, and leave it for awhile, then come back to the story, but without the anticipation a Rollins tale normally produces. James Rollins is a fantastic author, but I wouldn't recommend this as the book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast paced fun adventure that doesn't disappoint!","review":"I'd have to say that Map of Bones has been my favorite James Rollins book thus far, although I have enjoyed all of his novels and would recommend each and every one of them. I recently read James Rollins' Shadowfall (written under his other pen name of James Clemens for his fantasy genre of novels) and it was awesome! So if you like James Rollins' style of writing and his ability to write great adventures, check it out even if you're not a big fantasy buff. It was a very cool book (and the first of a new series.)

I'm the type of person who will quickly drop a read if it doesn't \\"hook\\" me in the first couple of chapters. But being a Rollins fan, I stuck with the book and finally at around 300 pages in, I got interested. Mr. Rollins, if you happen to read this, please get back to that wonderful lore of old.

As an example of the poor quality of the digital version, this is a Sigma Force novel, yet in an early chapter where the protagonists are given a report with the Greek letter sigma on the cover, the digital version has a question mark instead of a sigma! Ellipses in the printed version, to indicate that someone was interrupted in mid-sentence, are frequently rendered as a space in the digital version. The scanner that created this version was also confused by text in italics, often not including the space after the last italic word. In addition, with the printed version you get a couple of useful maps - Europe and the Vatican - that are so small in the digital version that they're useless. Finally, the story itself isn't as well crafted as Rollins' other novels, relying too much on extended action sequences for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and educational","review":"again Rolins doesnt disappoint. his intertwining of historcal religious facts and intriguing modern day good vs evil plots makes this another must read. whether its the historical trail of the Catholic Church, or the modern day Sigma vs Guild, i enjoyed every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Map of Bones review","review":"I'm not quite finished reading it yet but it holds your interest all along the way.

It's toooo James Bondish for me! The great plot was quickly diminished by all the silliness of combat. Only the bad guys got killed. I haven't finished the book and I sure it will end with the usual lead man and lead woman solving all the clues, rescuing the planet in the nick of time and falling in love by the last chapter.

Very simply, they are not believable. These so called professional characters and agencies are at best amateurish and at worst, totally incompetent. Even a good Sci Fi book must be believable or plausible. Rollins fails terribly on this believability issue.

This book is way too long and could be shortened by a hundred or so pages. I don't know what the author was trying to accomplish with this book as it was a kind of a knock of of The DaVinci Code but more confusing. The storyline seemed to wander at times and then get back on track but then you didn't know how it got back on track. How and why some of the scenarios came to be was a bit confusing too. But I will continue to read James Rollins' novels as they usually are action packed and keep you reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian and Latin are NOT the same language","review":"I had to stop reading once the author quoted Dante Alighieri, \\"Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate,\\" and identified it as the \\"original Latin.\\" His character is then praised for fluency in Latin.

I guess I'm just not cut out to enjoy the work of James Rollins. I started with Sandstorm, which I was barely able to finish, and followed up with Map of Bones, which is just as bad as its predecessor. Both feature a team of \\"good guys\\" who know everything about everything. Both feature a secret underground group of \\"bad guys\\" who want to use some ancient relic to create some far-fetched Goldbergian super-weapon. Chaos (supposedly) ensues.The entire first half of Map of Bones felt like the set-up, like we were building toward the main plot, just about to hit that point when the action really kicks up. Problem was, that point never arrived. The plot never kicks into high gear, at least not as far as I could tell. It was chapter after chapter of slow, tedious, implausible buildup. There's no reason to compare this to The DaVinci Code; it's not even close. The plot completely resembles Sandstorm, which isn't a good thing at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than da vinci, but different.","review":"I have to say that James Rollins is a better writer than Dan Brown. His characters have more depth, and furthermore, his plots are more completely thought out. I've been disappointed in some of Brown's books, because although the action is fun, the plots are pretty lame. I just don't care if they found a meteor with fossils in it.Rollins however, has ventured away from his normal formula of taking people underground, throwing in weird creatures, and having the hero escape. It's nice to see him grow as an author, and hopefully someday he'll have movies made based on his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenseful but not much more","review":"Apparently this book is widely compared to Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. This book is perfect for a summer read if you're looking for something with an intense plot and not much else.I was annoyed with the author's attempt to make the book more authentic by using sentences in foreign languages (German, Italian, French, Portuguese). If you do that, at least do it right. Apart from German which I don't speak, there were mistakes in the other languages, the sentences were direct translations from English etc.Even in English, the language is sometimes very stilted and awkward.The flow of the novel is bearable when it comes to the action parts, all the rest sounds unnatural and awkward. The dialogs are huge info dumps and are annoying to read because you constantly try to pretend they sound like real life dialogs. They don't.And if you want a realistic story, this one is not for you. The implausible premise is hard to swallow if you don't have a very vivid imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow and Repetitive","review":"I was very excited to read this book after sampling an online chapter, but was utterly disappointed half way through the story. The author has clearly copied Dan Brown's formula (and subtly, some of his ideas) and wrote a story that is a mixture of extremely detailed technical/sci-fi descriptions (similar to Michael Crichton's) and slow/repetitive 'action' scenes that go somewhat like this: \\"When the enemy got distracted, he pulled a gun hidden on his boot. He lifted the gun. He turned his hand to point the gun to the enemy. He put his finger on the trigger. He slowly pulled the trigger. And the bullet crossed the space between the two of them.\\" Zzzzzzz... I'm giving two stars because the historical information in the book is quite interesting. However, the breaking of codes just doesn't flow with the story and the author could have easily trimmed the book down to 200 pages. This is the first and last James Rollins book I will read. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but.....","review":"This is a good book, but to compare it to The DaVinci Code is a bit of a stretch, in fact, a long stretch. Rollins writes more simply, not quite dumbing down, but with simplified challenges for the reader. Again, one of his best, but not up to Dan Brown by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is, without a doubt, Rollins' best novel to date. A fascinating and fantastic adventure that is well researched as well as being filled with action and chilling escapes. If you like riddles and mysteries of the past, it's also included. Great entertainment from one of my favorite 'must read' authors.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Da Vinci Six Code","review":"It appears the author did some research on the subject matter in the book and that was a little entertaining. The storytelling part was a little tedious though. If one combines Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six and Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, one might end up with a book like Map of Bones. Simply put though, I was disappointed with this book and I don't know if I could read anything else by this author. (Sorry dude.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monatomic Mayhem","review":"Action packed mystery with more Vatican villains. Sort of a Da Vinci Code spin off with an alchemical cult (Imperial Dragon Court) plotting armageddon. Those who enjoyed this secret society conspiracy novel may also like Foucault's Pendulum.

Well, it's chock full of gorgeous tech-house, so that's not unexpected. Deep grooves and Detroitian melodies? Also expected. The long, jazz-ambient start of \\"Arabian Nights\\"? OK, that's unexpected. But it's a perfect intro (fear not, the beat eventually comes in, as expected). Indeed, it's the jazz influence that speaks the loudest, from the atmospheric breaks on \\"Timeless\\" to the vocal utterances set to a house thump on \\"Scatman.\\" But, just in case, he goes back to solid techno with \\"Over Here\\" and \\"It's Too Hot in Here\\" and smoother Detroit tones with \\"Bump.\\" Or, you could go with the percussive frenzy of \\"Be Bop\\" or martial drumming on \\"Rudiments.\\" But the mellow grooves of \\"D.O.B.\\" suit me better, I think. This, however, is not entirely unexpected."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CD PLAYER!!!","review":"This cd player is ok, but for the money it is not. First of all just because it has 40 sec. anti-skip protection does not mean it is good. It has anti-skip MEMORY, not protection. What is bad about memory is if it is set to 40 sec, it takes 40 sec for the protection to be full. If it is shook at 5 seconds after it is set, it skips. That can really become annoying. If you also skip to another song, the skip memory starts from 0 then works it's way to 40 sec of protection. Other than that it is ok. It is quite big compared to other CD players. One other thing, it does not play CD-Rs or CD-RWs with the same quality of music as a regular cd. Also the skip protection does not work at all if a CD-R or a CD-RW is played. One plus is the headphones, they are good and comfortable. The other good thing about this player is that it also looks cool.

I'm not sure what advantages are offered by buying this router over the 310 model, except for a savings of about 15 bucks. The 310 is also compact but more powerful, and can be fitted with optional tilt and offset bases, whereas the 309 cannot. The base on the 309 is a smaller diameter than the 310, and thus is tall, skinny, and unstable. I'm really not sure why Porter Cable makes this router, as it seems an inferior redundancy to the 310.

However, two things bothered me greatly. First off, it is very clunky to play. I have a pretty darn good computer and this game would seize up often. Many reboots were needed to complete the game.My second complaint is that it was VERY short. I normally take a bit of time to complete a game, I finished this in around a week. I was stunned that it was over and thought that it may lead to a more advanced scenario, but nope.All in all, it was fun, but not worth what I paid due to the shortness of the game and the clunky interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I have been a buyer of Legacy Interactive games since they starting producing them, and I have bought all their medical type games plus also their vet related games. In their medical type games you pick up instruments and treat patients, plus of course interact with them by talking to them. Their games take about 3-4 cds which shows how much they encompass. When I heard about this new game I was very anxious to get it since I knew what excellent quality and how addicting the other medical games are. I was very disappointed to see only one cd, and playing it is nothing like the other games. You do not pick up instruments nor any of the treatment measures like the other games- you basically wave your hands over the person. In reality the game reminds me of the SIMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I have over the years purchased a few emergency medical type games, and really do enjoy that genre, however this game doesn't even touch upon any skill one might have with diagnosing or even seeing patients. I guess what I had anticipated was a virtual setup of the television show, mixed with what had already come out, what I got was a point and click type atmosphere with virtually no challenge to the game whatsoever.

If I have the skill level to treat the patient I assign that patient to a bed in one of the exam rooms and then go to that room to treat the patient. During the course of the game I am given orders from the attending doctors. Some of them, if not completed in the set amount of time are fireable offences(GAME OVER). But some if not completed, just go on my record. While trying to complete all these orders I am given. I eat when I can, sleep when I can, and shower when I can.

Even Emergency Room which was released years ago looked promising. When I bought ER and played it, I was totally mortified.

On the facts alone one feels deeply for Maier personally and respects his incredible rehab, but oft cited medical reports,training charts and plans, and media strategy do little to tell us how Maier personally coped with his losses and regained his form. Clearly Maier has great courage, on and off snow, but the book reduces him largely to a re-engineered man and athlete, rather than someone facing human and career death who by family,will,passion,faith and science recovers. That story is there, but barely. To be fair, the book seemed to be a function of Maier's stoicism, which is clear throughout the book.

Maier's book fails to re-create the experience of the extraordinary event, and his miraculous return to competition. Hard to believe that a story such as this could be made tedious. It reads as though Maier dictated it into a computer program which translated and transcribed it. I also suspect they rushed it to print without the revisions it needed desperately.

A good editor and a little more flair could have made this a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I have always been a fan of Hermann Maier - not many have the ability to bounce back like he can. I bought the book for my son who is just learning to ski and he really enjoyed the biography. It is a good against all odds story and I would encourage anyone looking for a gift for an aspiring skier to send them a copy.We have learned that Hermann has a talent for skiing but the guy can write too. The book also teaches good sportsmanship and I want my son to grow up respecting his team mates and have a good attitude. Being a good sport is not just about big sponsors.We really enjoyed watching him ski and win medals at the Olympics!! And we really enjoyed his book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like the other reviewer I was really excited to get the book and get started. After the first 20 pages or so I thought it would pick up and get more personal. It however, dragged on as Maier described his injuries. He was not as humble as I thought many moments and I didn't find it as \\"inspiring\\" as I was hoping for. The writing is very bland and the book far too long for the story he presents. Some of the details are not important...I ended up skimming the last 1/2 of the book. It is an incredible comeback but this book is not so revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd single","review":"one of best cd singles i ever bought.

Many configuration commands, networking, etc are missing. There's a big overlap with my five-year-old Unix V reference, also published by O'Reilly.Similarly, I think the large Perl section is misplaced in a Linux reference book. If you need this level of detail, you get one of the camel books.Also, the index leaves something to be desired -- and that's a big minus for a pure reference book like this. Indeed, as some other reviewers have noted, once you know which command to use, man pages will in many cases be just as convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I get dissapointed.

However, once you get through all the initial fluff, I found the details necessary to actually follow through on the author's suggestions to be extremely limited. The author discusses how to make any pot self-watering, but uses a ready made insert. Then he does not say where to get the ready made insert from. Parts of the book read more like a pat on the back to his own successes with pictures from his own garden.

I bought this pouch in hopes that it would prevent this, but it only does so if clipped to my belt. The pouch isn't completely rigid, so if I stuff it into a pocket or bag, the button on the headset can still get mashed. The pouch is small, and the clip is short, so it seems liable to get bumped off of my belt and lost, prompting me to want to stuff it into a pocket anyway. This is a well-made product, even if it isn't well-engineered. It would have been perfect if it were rigid enough to protect the button, but as it is it's largely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"Lovely idea, but as the other reviewers point out, it presses down on the activation button.

At first, the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving, I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened, all the boxes were packed, sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily, the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement.

The case should have a deeper indention for the button on the bluetooth. When you lightly press the side of the case, it puts the unit into \\"bluetooth pairing mode\\" thus inducing useage and added battery drain. The result is an occasional premature battery failure or less useage times in the bluetooth because it has been \\"bluetooth pairing\\" off and on all day while you were carrying it.

I will probably cut a small piece of double sided velcro to fix the problem.The sides are made of elastic, they should drop the elastic and make the whole case using the front and back synthetic material.

If the case was an extra 1/8\\"-1/4\\" deeper this would prevent this from happening. I even tried using the case/cover without the elastic strap that is supposed to keep the bluetooth unit inside and still the problem occured.

Although I get the same results as all the other reviewers. I got it to work for me.As I use my H700 for the car, I have the BLT-04 clipped to my visor. I stretched the elastic out a little bit so it wouldn't squeeze the headset as much. That seemed to work. Also, if you don't pull the strap too tight, it won't hold in the call button.After all that, it works well for that I need it for. I don't really need the strap since I just have it sitting in the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case TOO snug","review":"The case is nice looking, but the implementation is poor.

Thought I would be happy because:A. Made by Motorola, and I was using it for a Motorola headset - what could be better?B. It looked kind of like something Batman would wear on his utility belt - so wouldn't I be the cool dude!When I ordered it, the photo showed it having a velcro strap across the top that retains the headset in the case.The case I ended up with is like the photo here and does not have a retaining strap.My Motorola H-850 headset will not stay in the case, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having a case for it in the first place.It was like pulling teeth to arrange for a refund, so my advice is:1. Don't buy form Eforcity2. No matter who you buy from, make sure you are getting the case that works.P.S. I had to give this turkey a star in order to post this review. Given the choice, I would not give it any positive rating at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally useless for Motorola H700!!!","review":"I only chose 1 star because there is no zero star rating.

It is very dissappointing that Motorola did not design this to work with their own headsets. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible case for the HS700","review":"I have the HS700 and this case (because it isn't rigid) constantly presses the button, putting the headset into discovery mode. This should have been an aluminum hard case with room to keep that from happening. You could also call that a design flaw in the headset, but either way you should get the combination of this case with that headset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like a good idea at the time","review":"I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset. It fits the headset very nicely, but.. But, the design of the case does not prevent the multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that. The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button. If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider an alternative","review":"Given all the complaints about this case's design and how it inadvertently presses buttons, consider the Motorola Leather Bluetooth Headset Carry Holster instead.

My friend called me and said to stop calling him or at least talk when he answered the phone. I didn't know what he was talking about. Then I figured out what was happening.

The description for this item calls out the H700 as one of the compatible headsets, but that is so far from the truth. Yes, the headset fits into the case, but as all of us that were tricked into buying this and wasting our money have discovered, it turns out to be totally useless, as it keeps the headset button pressed in, placing the headset into \\"discover\\" mode. I threw this on my shelf and forgot about it until I was asked to write this review. Bad move, Motorola! I also would rate it ZERO (or even Negative) if the system would allow it.

I would have prefered something more readable - not bad to fall asleep to though. However, the biggest problem I had with it was that too much of detialed other animal species.

Indy moves as if he's walking in a molassses swamp, the controls are awful, and all the game amounts to is a weak Tomb Raider clone. This one is likely to hit the bargain-bins fast.

The plot feels true to Indy and I love the locales, especially. It's been a challenge to use the controls but not too difficult. I don't enjoy the combat much but all the leaping, swimming, and puzzles are proving much fun. I have the hint book and I admit to using it once or twice being inexperienced but the game is overall not too difficult to figure out what to do next. The only thing is, I'm exhausted after an evening of playing! I recommend this game to both action AND adventure game fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am certainly amazed!","review":"I just finished playing Lucasart's latest Indiana Jones thriller, and I am certainly amazed by it! I find it hard to believe that this excellent game has gotten so many poor reviews. Come on people! Don't we buy computer games (especially when they're run offs of our favorite movies) to try and journey into another world? Isn't that exactly what Indy and the Infernal Machine does? It great gaming at its best!The only draw backs to the game were a few errors, such as appearing in a new level without any of your items (which include some Infernal Machine parts which are critical to getting through most levels.) Aside from that, the game is very good.So whether you're dashing along a beach on a tropical island in the Philippines, busting commies at 75 miles per hour, blasted your way off a Soviet ship, or hiking through snowy mountains, you'll find every level in this game to be excellent!So.....what are you waiting for?

I expected more from Lucas Arts, especially considering their excellent efforts with the x-wing/tie fighter sims.

Another thing is like other games I have , like roller coaster tycoon the graphics are way too dark, I hate that. How can I jump when I can barely see where I am standing or where I supposed to jump to? This kind of thing can be extremely annoying.

The tiny label on the box informing the buyer of this prerequisite is way too small, especially when buying it online where the box pic isn't life-size! Check before you buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick this one up","review":"This game plays very much like the tomb raider series - seasoned gamers will be able to jump right in, but casual gamers might find themselves scratch their heads from time to time. Most of the puzzles are fairly straight-forward - you either perform a series of switch-pulling, or locate a key item to open the door. A small portion of the puzzles require clever maneuver of tools (some of which also double as weapons), which in my opinion is the highlight of the game. The platforming is on the easy side, and most of the enemies are pretty idiotic - if you toss a grenade at them they usually don't run away. The graphics are a bit granny in today's standard but I believe was handsome at its day. Fans of the movies will be pleased to find the music in this game is variation of that from the movies, and they even managed to find a voice-over for indy that is pretty close to Harrison Ford.

Truly I saw no results using these Hyland pills. I decided to go with Claritin and I got results within one week. My hives went away within a few days.Save your money and skip these pills unless you want to give it a try.

And, I liked the way he introduced his guides - he made them apart of the story. Agradable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely writing, especially the Violin Sonata","review":"The String quartets are certainly worth hearing, but the violin sonata is special. The first movement is passionate and compelling, while the closing of the finale has a hushed stillness which is rare in 20th century music. William Alwyn, her husband wrote similar music, but I prefer Carwithen's style, kind of like an amalgamation of Howells, Finzi, Arnold, and Vaughan-Williams! Strongly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Shadow","review":"This film is a big disappointment. First of all, the copy I received was defective and I missed about 15 minutes of the film. A poor DVD copy. Secondly, the film itself is not very good. Liv Ullmann, as much as she is in it, is wonderful as usual, but her presence is limited. Michael York was passable, though I didn't really believe his conflict. York just wasn't given enough good material to work with. The story was incredibly choppy and the end was thoroughly dissatisfying, arriving at a conclusion which seemed far too pat and easy, especially considering the fact that nothing is really resolved before the final denoument. The great cinematographer-turned-director Vilmos Zsigmond can't even capture the beauty of Israel in this film. As a director, he seems like a fish out of water. It's too bad. I had high hopes for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful, awful","review":"First of all, I hate myself a little just for having bought this book - regardless of whether it came out of a bargain bin, or not.

It looks so becalmed from the majesty of its surrounds and all those tinctures of blue but it is a death-trap all the same. No-one knows how many bones lie at the bottom of the abyss . . . . . .This recording is just as lethal. Yes, Haydn is the master of the minuet but twenty four of them in a row is too much of a good thing. Surely this was the last recording made by the Philharmonia Hungarica: come the final bar, most of those poor devils must have died of the bends. And Dorati reputedly went to his grave with a tremor in his right hand.Here on Amazon, I am a Haydn gladiator - hence the trident-and-net show. But there are limits and the line is here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atonality at its Best!","review":"That's right. For the average listener, atonal music can rarely take the place of tonal music when it comes to giving us a fufilling musical experience. This is mostly because it is limited in its capability to communicate certain emotional qualities. It cummunicates to us in methods other than emotionalism, which characterizes most of our popular music now days. Most average listeners now days find atonal music disturbing and emotionaly unsettling, and that is because that is the emotion that atonality communicates best. Here, in this ablum, Lief's composition HEKLA takes full advantage of this musical phenomenon. Here the deafening atonal blast from the orchestra is used to create the ominous suspence and the horrifing destructive power witnessed by Jon Liefs as he watched an erupting volcano. It is VERY AFFECTIVE. If you want to REALLY experience this music, you HAVE to turn it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An add-on to below","review":"Leifs' music may be unusual stuff for the average classical music fan--even those who love heady 20th century product--but I've found that it's stunningly communicative to, well, average people--kids in particular, and especially if they're fans of Lord of the Rings and such. I'm sure Leifs would have been pleased to hear that.Without meaning at all to sound patronizing (I admire this composer tremendously) there is something of the \\"soundtrack\\" to his sound. Leifs is compared to Ives, but I'd suggest he has more in common with Copland although many who've listened to his wild and woolly sound-world would disagree.This entire BIS series is wonderful; especially Baldr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Volcano Music Ever","review":"Yes, all the music on this CD is great, but really, the star is \\"Hekla,\\" a tone poem based on the giant volcano in Iceland. As other reviewers have noted, it's famous for being the loudest piece of music ever composed, but it's more than that. I don't know of any piece that more faithfully captures the imagination of what it might be like to be before an exploding volcano. \\"Hekla\\" makes Hovhaness' \\"Mt.

I tried to reach out to Amazon to tell them they should at least pay the $40 that was for the board ($125 service fee), but it's been too long and they won't do anything about it.To be entirely forthright, the fireplace man said that he loves Skytech but about 1 in 7 of these boards does not work.

Look elswhere.","review":"Mr. Tegner obviously knows little to nothing about Aikido. This is probably one of the worst examples I've ever seen of a book dealing with the subject. A small number of the techniques do have some value but I would be hard pressed to call any of it authentic Aikido. In addition, the \\"bo kata\\" bears little resemblance to the stick techniques traditionally taught in Aikido schools. Mr Tegner has written books worthy of consideration (his book SELF-DEFENSE NERVE CENTERS AND PRESSURE POINTS comes to mind) but this certainly isn't one of them. My advice? If you're looking for a good introduction to Aikido, your money would be better spent elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"this guy knows NOTHING","review":"This guy knows NOTHING about the effectiveness of the martial art of Aikido, he says in this book that Aikido doesn't work as self defense, i've been practising Aikido for about 2 years and i know very well that Aikido is a VERY effective art for self-defense and NOT for show.

For us Japanese citizens the religious documents so called \\"The Bible\\" or \\"The Scriptures\\" are nothing but a superstitional data of exclusive monotheism = Judaeo-Christianity. And ,I think some chapters of the book are not suitable for the name of \\"Homosexuality\\", e.g. Ruth and Naomi --- because their mutual affections are or were very common relationships in Japanese women , and nothing special ones. Et aussi , the love between David and Jonathan is an elemental feeling which every humankind has , not only between the same-sex members but also between the different-sex ones , like Achilleus and Patroclos, Theseus and Peirithous, Alexander Magnus and Hephaistion, and Jesus of Nazareth and Johannes etc.But I recommend the book for anybody who wants to know about the \\" same-sex eroticismus \\" in the Biblical times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Joy","review":"This is such an energetic, beautiful, FUN album.

Rilo Kiley as its minor league musical successes. On its full-length debut Wild Like Children, Tilly and the Wall have a ways to go before joining the company of their peers. There is an appealing childlike feel to their music (you could also call it rudimentary), and a cynical edge to their lyrics, but the group vocals (redolent of bad high school choruses) are a distraction to these adolescent tales of ennui. The rockers are like an indie-touring company of Grease. Their pop is feckless. That leaves the folk music (\\"Bessa\\", \\"Let It Rain\\") - proving once again that simplicity has its rewards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and lovely.","review":"I got this album after Tilly and the Wall started gaining some buzz. Initially I was skeptical about the fact that they have a tap dancer as the percussionist, as it seemed really gimmicky. After listening to it for the first time, I fell in love with this band. I'll have to admit that the tap really is quite a natural foundation for this band's light, fun sound.Highly recommended for those who like Mates of State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game's Great, but where's Beezwax?","review":"Oh, yeah, this game is truely great.

The Boston Symphony is a shadow when compared to the modern European orchestras. Yo Yo Ma was the star of the evening - played Klid from the Bohemian Forest with great interpretation and feeling. von Stade's interpretation of Rusalka - Song to the Moon was when compared to Fleming's interpretation at the Waldbuhne in 2010 was like chalk and cheese. She sang it like a song that had to be sung - nothing more. Fleming made one feel the emotion of love that I think Dvorak wanted to bring across. Overall a great disappointment as regards quality on all levels. Not money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well watch PBS","review":"I really enjoyed Yo Yo Ma's short performance on Botti's Boston bluray.

I received two DVDs on the same day, this one and Grieg, Chopin & Saint Saens Piano Concertos / Previn, Rubinstein, London Symphony Orchestra (2006).

When the book gets into the time of the 20th century and later, it seems that Hiro sides with the radicals, or makes excuses for their actions.America and the West are not perfect, and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east, but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous.

I am a reasonably fit 30-something and I can tell you that the only way to learn snowboarding is by getting on a board, getting the feel of it, taking plenty of lessons and spending plenty of time on the bunny slopes. Whereas skiing is a bit more technical and possibly could be learned through reading a book, boarding is much more feel and you'd best be advised to not kid yourself.

Instead out of curiosity, I read the rest of the book silently to myself, and what I found was more and more outrageous. All crazy situations, to which the author suggests our only response should be \\"love.\\" Little kids are highly unlikely to understand the distinction between \\"I love YOU but I may not love WHAT YOU DO.\\" All they hear from the story is \\"love...paint the walls,\\" and \\"love... hide my keys.\\"Some of the things presented in this book as lovable did not actually occur in my household.

But the moment I had need of it, and discovered the inferior quality of the blade, I became suspicious and examined it more closely.

I would get it under the bottle cap and start to pry and it would start to come off but then it would slip because you couldn't get proper leverage. I let my friend use it at a party and gashed his hand up pretty badly when the thing slipped off the top of the bottle cap. I found the knife to be pretty useful when opening packages or anytime you needed a small knife. I know some people have said they can get it past security but I just saw a TSA agent confiscate one on my last flight.

When opened it locks with a loud \\"click\\" and just feels of solid quality. Love this keychain knife for what it is...a keychain knife.*UPDATE* 6-28-12Well, it finally happened. The great thing about knives on your keychain is they are always handy when you need them. The downside is you often forget they are on your keys.

I love the live quality of this recording because it makes me feel like I was there somewhere in the back of the room. It has this bass-heavy growling that you get in an old theater (and surprise it was recorded in an old theater).I love the way the guitars sound; gritty and real like they come from an amplifier similar to one I own.I'm more of an early SDRE fan, but I feel that this record helped me get into post-Pink record songs a little more. For example, Guitars & Video Games was not a song I really appreciated until I heard this.Also if you're a little burned out on In Circles, the version on this Live album rocks.Finally, if you were a big Sunny Day Real Estate fan and haven't listened to them in a while, this record will help you rediscover them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contractual obligation","review":"Sunny Day Real EstateLive; 1999Sub Pop RecordsMy Rating: 4/10This was a \\"contractual obligations\\" album I guess, released by Sub Pop after the band jumped ship post-HOW IT FEELS.

Coyle and Mal Sharpe are men whose cosmic sense of humor was well ahead of the time in which they instigated these humorous urban encounters. In the early '60s Coyle and Sharpe spent their days on the streets of San Francisco armed with mic and taperecorder posing ridiculous situations to the people they met. The resulting interviews are still incredibly funny - they have withstood the test of time. This CD is only a small portion of their archive, but a representative sample. My favorite? \\"3ism\\" a classic in which they recruit a man waiting for the 6 Masonic bus to sacrifice his individuality and become their \\"3ist\\" partner \\"now and forever more\\". \\"You have come into our destiny, and henceforth you shall remain with us\\". The man plays along wonderfully as they join him on the bus and ask him \\"what's for dinner?\\" If you enjoy this CD check out Coyle and Sharpe \\"On the Loose\\" which was released 5 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality creates anti-alaising artifacts","review":"Perhaps the worst issue with this unit is that the resolution is so low (vastly lower than even a $59 digital camera) that text edges are extremely rough with huge pixels. With small/narrow fonts, this makes character recognition very difficult. After short periods of use, I get serious headaches from the poor image quality.I tried \\"snapshot\\" mode on one page, then did the same thing with my Sony camera in closeup mode. The Sony image is sharp/crisp and even though the magnification is not as high and the screen is much smaller, the type is far easier to read on the cheap Sony. It's also no where near as clear an image as a KindleIn this day and age, they should be able to provide a far better image, particularly for this extremely high price. Almost $600 for something only useful for short looks at bills, signing checks, etc is absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Didn't think i would like this book but was pleasantly surprised.

I don't think that no one should ever stay with someone if they are unhappy for materialistic reasons and that is what Mina did.

It was good thing that she had a strong family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring in the beginning, ended with a bang","review":"I began reading the book after hearing such good things about it and I was disappointed.The book starts off slowly and begins with Mina and her life. To people on the outside it seems as though Mina has it going on with all of her material possessions. In her personal life it seems the same way being that she is engaged to the mayor's son.Andrew Wellington is Mina's fiancee. Andrew is a controlling and judgmental person. Mina knows this but figures she has to settle for what she is getting. She runs into her childhood sweetheart Victor and things start to change.With all of the things going on in Mina's life which man will she choose.This book touched on some hot issues such as love, infidelity, living on the down low, physical abuse, you name it and it was in this book.

Mina was a woman caught up between two men, her no good fiance and her childhood crush. There were alot of surprise's and secret's revealed. Mo from \\"Torn\\" is also in the book as well as all the other ppl from the salon. Although i did enjoy this read, there was alot of label dropping that begin to get on my nerves toward the end.

You are truly talented and I admire you. I have read not all but most of your books and you never cease to amaze me. I am an avid reader and reading and writing is a passion of mine. Hopefully one day I can be half as successful as you are. I only have one question WHEN is Mina's Joint 2 coming out??? Just like many of your other fans I fell IN LOVE with Victor. He was like a dime in dream. Since I am thick as well I identified so much with Mina. Many of her characteristics remind me of my own. Mina's family was a mess but loving and very supportive.

With Mina this is what happened to her soon to be husband Andrew , was not all he seemed to be and that soon came to the light , Mina finds her true love in the end and almost risk her life in the processes.

I love the Zune look to it and the feel of it.Update 1/11/2010, I ordered my adapter from LLYtech They are selling them for a penny plus shipping, The adapters they are selling are Genuine Microsoft Zune Chargers.

John Mueller is feted as the best Buddy Holly tribute performer and apparently is endorsed by Maria Elena Holly. I can only say that his performances on this CD are nothing better than 3rd rate karaoke performances that you might hear at a 'Sing along with Buddy Holly' night at your local pub. His singing is thin, off key and does no justice to the original songs. By comparison, the 'Ritchie Valens' and 'Big Bopper' performances on this CD are more convincing. Maybe you need to see a live performance of 'The Winter Dance Party' to appreciate this CD, but if you buy it 'cold' you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth exploring","review":"Akos Rozmann is a Hungarian-born composer whose postgraduate studies in Sweden led him to settle there. All of his music is either electronic or electro-acoustic, the three \`Impusioni' heard here being early exercises in purely synthetic sound which show Rozmann to have a strong sense of structure and narrative fantasy in territory where conventional musical criteria are almost beside the point. The featured item, \`Two, with Three Instruments,' is even more impressive, a later piece comprised exclusively of digitally sampled sounds of the organ, piano and zither, with the composer's own voice thrown in for occasional commentary. There is never any sense of gimmickry here, throughout this nine part work one is struck by the symphonic use of the samples and the way they are integrated into what is heard as a totally natural soundscape. Rozmann's name may not be well-known, but this is music of great imagination and structural mastery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old formula talking animals - sooooo cute.","review":"Dumb, stereotypic juvenile talking animal humor for adults (or juvenile adults depending upon point-of-view).

Eventually he realizes that he has moved on and now actually is in love with the Zoo's vet played by Rosario Dawson. The whole movie is one giant stupid animal joke after another. I suppose if you are a 13 or 14 year old this movie would actually be funny but for the rest of us it got old very quick. The chemistry between Kevin James and Leslie's Bibb's characters are very fake and unbelieveable at best.

I loved Kevin in his supporting role in Adam Sandler's Grown Ups and I just wanted to watch him again but this time the lead actor of a comedy. He was so funny in imitating the animals in his cubby-ness. The movie had some voice over in the animals with personalities such as Sandler as the monkey, Stallone as the lion, Cher as the lioness, and Nick Nolte as the gorilla. If you are a fan of movies like Babe, Cats and Dogs or any movie with talking animals, this might interest you.

I loved King of Queens, Paul Blart, even had the odd laugh at Grown Ups (I won't mention The Dilemma), but this is one dumb movie. Sure, there are a couple of chuckle scenes, but most of the movie just entails prat falls and silly noises.Most movies have one annoying character, Star Wars had Jar Jar Binks, Lion King had Timone, this has a little monkey called Donald (He needs to find a new agent by the way, as the other movie he was in this year was The Hangover Part II). I just couldn't quite put my finger on why he was so annoying until I discovered who played his voice then it all made sense - Adam Sandler!Surprisingly, Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, John Favreau and even Cher have voice overs in this giant cow pat of a film, but it doesn't help, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb!","review":"Wow, this was the most dumbest movie I ever saw don't waste your money or time on this one.Even the kids fell asleep watching it no creativity in this movie at all must of been very low budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"it was a funny and hilarious movie my husband loved his Christmas gift and he loved watching it also and i loved watching as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Funny","review":"The zookeeper is a good movie , not to be taken too seriously.

Anytime there's a movie with talking animals, I get it because my kids tend to love those movies. I knew going into it that it was a PG movie and I can say that it is a PG movie. However, you have to wonder who these folks targeted the movie for... because it just misses on all levels. Most \\"normal\\" adults aren't going to enjoy this; it's not bad, but it's basically juvenile. Some scenes and episodic language isn't for those below Jr High... and those young kids are the ones that are typically going to watch talking animal movies.2. Bottomline, this movie could have been pretty good, if it just focused on one target audience; ie young kids and their parents and cleaned up the language / certain situations... but they didn't and as a result, this movie is already headed for the trash heap of has been films that will be lost to memory etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zookeeper","review":"This film was not well crafted and would appeal mostly to the younger crowd.

The animal voices were irritating at best, the jokes vulgar and disgusting. Just no redeeming value at all. Nothing funny about it. Don't waste your time or your money on this garbage! The writers should be ashamed of wasting so much money producing such a waste of time, then promoting it as a great funny movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal love","review":"I rented this movie and loved it until the animals began to talk, then I realized this flick was for children. Then it turned into a love story and I began to regain some hope, until the cliche ending of racing to the airport. But since airport security has lost their mind, you can't do that anymore. However, if one were to try, forget using a cell phone, perhaps riding an ostrich or a gorilla would be easier. But what do I know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither My Kids Or I Got Many Laughs Out of This","review":"Talking animals are usually a sure hit with my kids, and I generally like Kevin James and his affable humor. But we were just too bored with this one. James plays the zookeeper of the title, with serious romantic problems, and a zoo full of animals that he finds out can talk and decide to try and coach him through his romantic woes. There are a few funny moment - a favorite was when he takes the gorilla to TGI Fridays - but mostly it's just a bit too slow. Having the plot revolve around adult romantic issues also just didn't work - talking animal movies are usually skewed to a young crowd (my own are 5 and 7), but they just don't get some of the romance/mating related jokes. So unfortunately, I think this one was a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"My son loves his boots!! Great product and very durable.

Took the advise of previous reviewers and bought a size bigger and they are fine, even a little big. Which is ok. They are better made than other froggy boots we've bought at a popular retail store for the same price.

He wore them for a month, (from Christmas Day almost to the end of January) and they have split on the side just above the sole.

All the action was clumped at the end, at the end of a two-year voyage. To make it interesting, Celia should have drawn things on the letters she was sending to her cousin, Abigail - since she said she enjoyed drawing. The crewmembers were underdeveloped - we only heard about Mr. Grimes, Isaac, and Nate in great detail. Surely there must have been other men Celia conversed with on the ship, of interest? The relationship between Celia and her mother was very predictable and the mystery of Celia's father's first wife was not really a mystery. I wish there had been more colorful explanations of the ocean, whales, dolphins, the ship, and hurricane. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST FOR FUN-","review":"I'll happily go along with the other reviewers, this short opera is pure enjoyment with no profundity or conflict to disturb the moment. The production, that is, orchestra with three people shifting before it with a few makeshift props, seems admirably suited to the simplicity of the plot and \\"songs\\".Ghyslaine Raphanel and Matthieu Lécroart are near perfect as wife and husband, Franck Cassard,,is satisfactory as the wife's suitor and the husbands apparent friend. The trios are just fine, Cassard a bit weak on his solos. To add to the fun, as has been pointed out by others, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star plays a prominent role as solo and trio, with admirable effects.All-in-all, the opera is a delightful 84 minutes of well-done thoughtless entertainment.

It sticks out so far that it interferes with other car functions. The speaker should be separated so it can be mounted away from where the cigarette lighter is. In one of my vehicles, it sticks out where it is regularily kicked by someone in the passenger seat, and in my other car it sticks out so that I can not use the beverage holder. In my third vehicle, it interferes with my shift lever. I had to buy a cigarette lighter extension cord so I could lay the unit in my center console. Other manufacturers have designed much better adapters for their phones. If I had know this was what Qualcom (Kyocera)had, I would never have bought their phone. I live in NYS and hands free operation is required by law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Brazilian.","review":"The lynchpin of the Cinema Nova movement, Glauber Rocha crafted this moving portrayal of the underdeveloped, Brazilian sertao at the young age of 25. Set in the 1940's, the film follows a disgruntled cattle rancher who murders his boss after he attempts to swindle him from his already meager earnings. The film follows this character throughout, as he confronts more bloodshed, an immoral priest and one's decision on who's voice to follow, that of religion or his own. Beautifully shot and directed, Rocha depicts the impoverished, Bahian drylands with a stark realism not unlike that of his Italian predecessors. Sweaty, samba music accompanies the visuals throughout, making this an essential piece of Brazilian filmmaking. About the only readily available Rocha film in the US, so grab it if you get the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY","review":"This came after about 7 days and it is so small I cannot even fit my arm in!

I loved the originality of a blind female and male, but the plot never went anywhere. William was entirely unlikeable, a flat character. Saura was equally so. I had to push myself through it, even through the very predictable ending, which was a big let-down. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read again & again","review":"This is the first Christina Dodd book I ever read; she has remained one of my favorite authors ever since. The book's characters are well rounded, the story has many unique elements and the plot keeps you guessing. You will laugh and you will cry and you will want to read this book again and again. Once you have finished this book, you will be spoiled for choice; as, Dodd has written dozens of romance books over the past 20 years in various genres including historical, contemporary and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldnt get into it..","review":"I thought that this book had unbelievable potential, but I just couldnt like it no matter how much I wanted to.

I have many books by Ms. Dodd and I have enjoyed the majority of them..sadly, I cannot say the same for \\"Candle in the Window\\" This is not a book that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but couldn't bring myself to finish it.","review":"Well, normally I really love Christina Dodd's works, but this one just didn't do it for me. At all. Frequently the writing was choppy and distracting (a la Cathrine Coulter), and the story as a whole I just found weak. True, I loved the first 150 pages or so, when Saura first went to \\"help\\" William, but then he conveniently got his sight back and it all just went to pot. I'm very suprised too, because Christina is usually a much better writer than this.Though this wasn't enough to put me off this author entirely, I'll definately be checking to see whether the books I pick up in the future of hers are the early attempts or her better, later works. My advice, if you just HAVE to read all of C. Dodd's books, wait until this one shows up at your local library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have to give Ms. Dodd a A+ on this one. Not your typical love story. These people had problems and they over came their problems through loving each other. Just because one regained their sight it didn't mean the other person became weak. But they learn to build on each other strengths that's what made this story work. It's good to read a story and know that people have real problems. It just wasn't that old when will they know that they the love each other thing going on. But it's was nice to see two people who know that they want and went after it together. It's also nice to know that it's not all about good-looking, but who you are and what on the inside that counts. Now that for real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Got this for my RV and it works good on low power items like stereo and dvd.

We bought two, this one and a higher power one. One for each vehicle. We have been very happy with them. A word of caution however. If you use it for a long time (for days)and then don't drive anywhere you can end up surprised with a dead battery. Common sense usually prevents this. We camped for six months and were constantly charging various things.We hard wired this one in. We don't manually connect it every time. We wanted it permanent, but this power level did not come in a hard wire version. So we made it that way. It is nice to have a background in auto electronics :-)UPDATE: I just wanted to add the discovery of one annoyance. The outlets are too close together to plug two things in at once unless they are the slim old style plug. So you may need to use an extension cord or outlet strip to have more than one thing plugged in at a time. Other than that, this is still working just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It becomes useless if one of the fuse blows, and one did on mine.","review":"Me using the Cobra inverter started off great.

The rule sheet doesn't make a lot of sense and never addresses the prospect of having more than two teams, even though there are four player pieces.

I am NOT exaggerating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Game","review":"My family and I enjoy playing new games. But did not enjoy this game at all. The questions were pretty dumb. They did not give you a scenario at all.

But you have no water to drink. What should you do? Three choices. And I think it would be beneficial to find out why the \\"right\\" answer is correct. (I agree with the other reviews-that I question some of the \\"right\\" answers)We were lucky enough to be able to take back an open game to the store. We didn't even finish the one game we played of it. It was pretty boring, pointless, just a pure guessing game.

My husband and I got it for a wedding present and it was highly recommended by some friends of ours. That's the last time I'll take their advice for sure! The only people who would enjoy this, in my opinion, are people who enjoy watching paint dry. Most boring game in the world!

I would suggest playing this game if you have company over that will never leave because this will encourage them to go.

This is the worst game ever. Not only are most of the card question and answers stupid, but there are some that are plain wrong. Out of the small box of questions, (Dont let the size of the game fool you. It is mostly empty.) I found about 20 of them that seemes like fun questions. The rest were stupid. Like, \\"How do you keep from being abducted by an alien?\\" It is not a joke, it is serious! Dont waste your money. Unfortunatly the place where I bought it wouldn't let me return an opened game. That is the only reason I still have it.

Let me explain...When you play Trivial Pursuit, part of the fun is when you are reading off the question to your opponent, that in your mind you try to think of what the answer would be. You flip the card and then you see the answer and think, \\"oh I was right\\" or \\"oh I was wrong\\" or \\"oh they will never get this\\".But with the Scenario Game, the card posts the question and three multiple choice answers all on one side. The correct answer is in bold. Now this is no fun to read the question, because you immediatley know the answer as you read it. There's no guessing for the question asker.Plus the board itself is a very boring start to finish game. Board games are much more interesting when you have to travel around the board many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs something more","review":"We got this game for our eight-year-old son and played it with him and his 9-year-old friend. The concept of the game is very simple - counters move around the board by correctly guessing the answer to a 'worst case scenario' question. The questions were difficult for the children. Some of the words were hard to read and the situations difficult to answer for children of this age group with their limited life experience. The most glaring problem, however, was the justification as to why that was the correct answer. Nowhere was that given. This would have given the game a much more interesting spin and made the trip round the board that much more worthwhile. It did give rise to some discussion but the answers were so esoteric that after a while we just gave up. We never did finish the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"My husband, kids and I like to play board games, but I can hardly qualify this disaster as a \\"game\\". It's simply a race to get from the start of the board to the finish line by answering some pretty lackluster questions. I also have my doubts about the accuracy of some of the answers. There's no strategy involved, no sense of competitiveness, no fun. When we finished playing, we were relieved to be done. We've never played this game again. It sits in the closet.

The same problem can be seen with similar Sony camcorder models. These camcorders tend to develop the blank screen issue anywhere from 6 months to 2 years after purchase.There are reports all over the internet about this problem but Sony denies that it's a manufacturing issue and wanted 200+ to repair.

I expected this soap to smell of pine, but the dark, resinous scent is more smoky than green. It is quite pleasant on the body, however, lending a slight woodsy edge.I've used it for three showers, and the combination of this soap and water a bit less hot are calming my itchies marvelously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Soap but...","review":"This soap lathers wonderfully and cleans well without over drying skin. The only thing I can say to beware of is the smell. It is NOT subtle. You will come out of the shower smelling like you bathed in Pine Sol. It has a VERY strong smell of creosote like wooden railroad ties. It's not a light pine scent. If you are OK with that then by all means, get this soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me think of grilled fish, which is a good thing!","review":"I'm still not sure what tar smells like, but this soap must smell like pine, because it makes me think of the fish that my uncles make on the grill, which is an awesome scent to take a shower with. As others have said, the smell is not too strong, and doesn't stick to the skin for a long time. It does leave a perfume in the bathroom for the rest of the day, but again, I enjoy the smell of burning wood in a grill.The company that I ordered this soap from is highly professional, and I wasn't happy with the condition that my soap arrived in, but they offered me a discount when I e-mailed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooh ooh that smell","review":"Smells like a hobo and cleans like an angel!

So waking up in the morning to the smell of a poorly cleaned charcoal grill is challenging. I hesitate to describe this as a chimney smell, because most chimneys smell pleasantly faintly of wood.

My OBGYN said there was nothing we could really do to make the rash go away until delivery. Just to be sure, I googled it and found that Grandpa's soap supposedly would help, so I decided to try it out. Within a week, the rash was gone! I am now on my 2nd bar and will KEEP using it until the twins are born, just in case it decides to come back. Not the best smelling stuff in the world, but it works!!

The one time that I did use the product it cleaned well and left a clean feeling. However I never smelled clean. Some reviewers say that the product smelled like a lumber yard; another reviewer claims that it smells like a campfire. Unfortunately my experience was much worse, it smelled like a pine tree puked or smells like someone was burning plastic in a campfire. What makes it worse is that I smelled like that all day. Not just a few hours but all way time until I was able to take another shower.I recommend this product only if you like exotic smells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old World Soap","review":"Soap is not something I thought I would be writing a review about but this soap is worth it. This soap is nothing like what I've gotten from the grocery store. It small great, keep in mind it has a heavy woodsy musk smell to it, but if that's what you're looking for it is great. The scent will fill the shower and while it is a really strong scent it won't come off on you too much. As an unexpected benefit it helps with finicky skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a shaving soap!","review":"As others have said, this is not a shaving soap. I figured it'd be worth trying, in spite of the warnings... But no. Don't. The lather is very thin and by the time you're done putting down your brush and picking up your razor, the soap is already drying up. I tried re-milling it as another reviewer mentioned, but it didn't help me at all.I'm sticking with Colonel Conk's for shaving. It's fairly priced and does the job much better.Now, I really do like the scent of this soap, and I'll continue using it as a general face soap (I already bought it, right?), but it is NOT a shaving soap and should not be advertised as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried 3 weeks for psoriasis, negligible results","review":"After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes that Grandpa's Pine Tar soap would help with my psoriasis, but after using almost daily for 3 weeks, I can't say it helped all that much if any at all. If anything I would say that the soap leaves the skin feeling dry, and I found myself using more lotion to compensate, but would still end up itchy towards the end of the day. Psoriasis is a weird thing though, so you may have better results.Like the other reviews note, the odor is very strong and takes some getting use to, but it is not entirely offensive either. Kinda manly actually, and not too dissimilar from the smell of coal tar shampoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for rashes!","review":"I've had a terribly uncomfortable rash on 25% of my body (unknown cause but unrelated to the outdoors) for the last week or so and I scrounged Amazon for some itch-relief products while waiting for my doctors appointment. I had this soap overnighted and I have to say, it worked even better than the over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.Unfortunately, the effects are temporary (I can feel it begin to wear off within a few hours) but it lasts slightly longer than the relief from the itch creams, and the smell is pretty horrible. Sort of like tar or burning rubber. I also felt a light film on my skin but I guess not much more than I do from the average moisturizing soap. Honestly, for a couple hours of peace it's beyond worth it, and if you rinse well the smell doesn't really linger on your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nokia is irresponsible when it comes to spare parts","review":"There's one perfectly good reason not to buy this product -- Nokia irresponsibly refuses to carry spare parts.

It cuts well, cuts straight, the fence is good (not as good as some on more expensive or larger table saws) for the size saw. It has large rubber feet to prevent slipping. It is easy to change blades. I used it to cut laminated flooring which is a very dense product. It cut it well and the blade lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.

It is normal weight for this \\"portables\\"...i'd guess 55-60 lbs. The amazing thing is the price: $250 shipped to your door. And it's not a cheap Delta or Ryobi (sorry, but they are junk).

I wanted to try a belt driven table saw, and although I find this feature helps with noise and blade vibration, the rest of the saw's design leaves me disappointed. First off, all these other guys that complain about the fence and miter guage being sloppy are absolutely right. Even at full adjustment, the fence will easily lock in at 1/4 \\" out of square. Also, every peice of hardware on this saw just feels cheap. From the blade depth adjustment knob to the lockdown screws to even the on/off switch, each component simply feels like just another made in China cheap part. I am a fan of JET industrial equipment; this saw however is just borderline acceptable. I will not brag about owning this saw, and if my wife wasn't pushing me to install a hardwood floor in our house, I would DEFINATELY send it back and get a Bosch for double the price of the JET.

Great Idea but Cheaply Made","review":"I purchased this saw about a year ago. At first, I thought it was a very good value for the price and Jet is a big name. It was quiet (relatively speaking for a saw) and cut fairly well as long as I paid attention to the fence being perfectly parallel to the blade. After about 9 months of light cutting (maybe an hour of use a month) the motor became very erratic in speed and finally froze. I can't find motor parts on line.

I really wish some people would do the book some more justice and not crave simple one-liners, who think that they know literature because they read Oscar Wilde and J.D. Salinger. They have a word for those people too - \\"posers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK","review":"Everybody has always told me this book was great. Everybody I've ever talked to is an idiot.

The first couple of cuts on 1/8\\" metal were real nice, no sparks, just metal files that dropped to the ground. After a few more cuts, the blade starting making sparks as it cut, which it isn't supposed to do, as it's a \\"cold cut\\" blade. These sparks have made the transparent plastic on the saw almost impossible to see through. Now whenever I cut with this blade, I just get a lot of sparks, which I was trying to avoid by not going the abrasive blade route. Needless to say, I'm dissapointed in this blade. For $40, you expect more than just a handful of quality cuts on 1/8\\" mild steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speculative Fiction","review":"This book is Christian speculative fiction. It was very interesting because it presents a possible future in which a second civil war takes place in the United States.It has some wonderful plot twists. Basically it is the story of one man Douglas Richfield, a member of the peoples' movement (Socialist) who becomes a constitutionalist. It is the story of his development as a person, and as a person of faith. He is awoken from rote life living as a cog in the machine, to being a man of conscience, to finally a man of character.It has elements of being a spy story, a love story, a story of political intrigue and faith all rolled up in one neat consistent package.It is a good read that I could honestly recommend to just about anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow pace and an unsatisfying ending.","review":"The pace of the book is very uneven. When it focuses on the espionage part it is for the most part at least somewhat interesting, but too often when it's getting interesting, Aikman stops the action to go into overlong descriptions of life in a submarine, or General Hodges's life story. On the other hand, he never really lets us get to know Ritchfield, the main character very well. Not enough at least for me to really care about him. There's also several examples of repetition, where the author explains things he's already explained. But apart from the slow pace, the biggest problem is probably that the book leaves way too many loose ends. Like the most obvious question, who won the war in the end? It's like there was supposed to be a sequel that was never written. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This product does not work well at all.

Field's most recent release, is a true treasure. Nestled within the compact disc recording you will find CALL OF THE SHOFAR, the hit of the album. I have never heard such an exquisitely crafted composistion for trombone quartet. I am especially fond of the roundness of the second and third tenors, the sumptious bass trombone playing from a sure to be \\"up and comer\\", and of course the masterful virtuosity of Andrew Glendening. I wish this quartet would record more works, for they are truly outstanding as a balanced and blended ensemble. The next best song is the title track, KABALA. All in all, KABALA is a masterful disc with several eclectic listening interests. Just remember --- K stands for KABALA...and the trombone quartet (nestled in the foothills of Eastern Appalachia) is for sure the PRIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS!!! Hope everyone enjoys this disc as much as I did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rooster Crows","review":"My favorite is the Rooster Court Ball: an excellent display of Dr. Fields' talents in using traditional modalities for modern expressions.

The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still.

Gladys Knight has such a powerful voice and really added a significant level of quality to the entire movie and I found this cd, reviewed the information, and purchased it believing I'd hear more Southern style gospel like CeeCee and Marvin Winans, Pattie LaBelle, & Mariah Carey have produced.

I enjoy these hymns very much as she sings/directs them. When Gospel music is sung, i listen to the message. She and her choir sing of \\"Loving One Another\\" and being a \\"Child of God\\". Those teachings ring true with me, whether sung by a member of my church or another church.As far as a review of the album? The songs are simple enough to follow, but they certainly have the famous Gladys touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this CD is a bit of a ripoff.","review":"I was really excited about getting this CD, loving Gladys and gospel music the way I do. But I think that it should be made clear that Gladys only appears on 5 of the albums 15 tracks.

There are no photos, nothing enlightening - nothing unique unless the reader doesn't know who Hugh Hefner is or what he's been doing for decades. Any compassion initially felt for the author as a child becomes overshadowed by her focus on shallow sensationlism. She clearly still has a love-hate problem going with \\"Hef\\", her parents, herself, her sister. The gist of the story is told in the first few chapters and what follows is indulgent reminiscing where one wishes the author had, instead, invested even half as much time in improving her writing style as she does in focusing on clothing labels. The complaining and finger pointing got exasperating. It's a book that shouldn't have been written because the author didn't really commit herself to a true expose' or personal growth. Not that the reader can see anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"I thought this was a very good book. It kept me very interested and I couldn't put it down.

The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor. Her father was a mess.The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc. Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful. What a life for a teenager. This book is very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally boring, self-pity","review":"This book is boring. The portions of the book about the Playboy Mansion and the use-and-abuse of young models are interesting, if only because they're relevant touchstones of America's historical popular culture.

The exercises are ridiculous, particuarly the ones about revealing your deep dark secrets to your romantic partner and using your romantic partner as a mentor. The author shares that among the many women he had, he married four and, not surprisingly, divorced three.

As a mother and an educator, I think that this product would be better suited for an older child as it is quite hard for a child younger than the age of 2 or even 2 1/2 to sustain the attention needed to interact with the games, etc. I would recommend waiting to purchase this for your 18 month old. I am an advocate for Fisher Price products as I feel Fisher Price is pretty accurate in guiding parents to age appropriate toys. However, with this one I feel they missed the mark.

Since there is no direct or indirect evidence of something called GOD, HOW can you make a stab at a reasonable probability. This answer is that you cannot. Of course that is a lot shorter book. On a side note, good and evil is clearly a manmade subject. Take away man, and you dont have any good and evil. We made it up. Great example of a lot of words that do not really say anything.

Then I notice that the case for the drill has space for this flashlight, so I picked it up. It's nicely built too. Same color as the drill and use the spare battery comes with the drill and fits in the case with the battery on. The flashlight illuminates the work nicely and bright and stays where you put it, not like my MagLite that I always have to struggle with placing it somewhere to keep it from rolling away while working on something.

The modern four cylinder motorcycle engine started with Honda's 250 cc four cylinder racer from the early 60's (looks the same as todays engines). If you like small, complex, hi-tech engines (a 50cc twin, DOHC, 4 valve per cylinder racer that Honda multiplied into a 5 cylinder 125cc racer and again into six cylinder double overhead cam racer) this book is for you. It details it all with amazing photos and history of ALL of the Japanese brands all the way up to the current MOTO GP racers. Two stoke lovers will not be disappointed. It covers with amazing detail a technological era of racing and competition that shows clearly why racing improves a brand. My only complaint is that the book is not hardbound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Fuzzy Logic","review":"I grabbed this book automatically, having known Kosko's writing in Fuzzy Logic in the 1980s. Then, he took a new concept and brought it to life in a simple, interesting way. In Noise, Kosko basically just re-tells the science of the types of noise. It is missing the simplicity and predictions of Fuzzy Logic.

It is incomprehensible to me that these 200 pages of low- grade pop-sci were written by an E.E professor from USC. I made it through 60 pages before my nerve cracked and I tossed the book. He babbles on and on about Claude Shannon's masterpiece \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\" without contributing anything of value.

Unfortunately, it is the worst popular science book I have ever read (and I read alot of 'em). Kosko glosses over certain topics that require much more explanation to fully understand, while going in-depth into other, more uninteresting examples in a redundant and boring fashion. He often throws out rather complex concepts as if the reader must know what it is, which makes for such a bumpy ride. Do you know the difference between positive and negative frequency is? Kosko will assume you do. I have been tempted several times to throw the book down and give up on it.

The reviews for it sounded so good but boy were they wrong. First off you have to continually press the hole open and closed to get the \\"pumping\\" action. Which to me is just silly because whats the point of a electric pump if you have to control it manually the whole time. Even at the highest setting I barely was able to get any milk after pumping for 15 minutes I finally stopped. In fact I get more milk using my manual 15 dollar pump. The worst part though is that the suction cups themselves are so uncomfortable and painful. My nipples feel raw after usage. They put nothing soft on the cups to make them comfortable. I had a pump with my son and it did not feel like that at all. I wish I still had that pump because this was such a waste of money. I'm currently in the process of returning. Please find another pump moms!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality, bad experience with seller, I would never do it again!!!!","review":"I purchased this item just few weeks before having my baby. When I opened for my first trial I realized the suction was not strong enough to get milk. The motor is very loud and it was vibrating too much. I contacted the seller by mail (by phone never returned the call) to return or exchange the product. The seller said that it was not possible but they could replece it for an used one, I said what??????? I didn't pay for an used pump so please give me my money back. They suggested to contact the manufacterer, when I did it, they told me that this pump based on the serial number it has been USED and they don't manufacter this kind of pumps anymore due to a recent recall on the product, they are no BPA free and I should return it. I tried, but with any success...So, VERY BAD SELLER, and BAD PRODUCT as well (maybe the new version is much better who knows???)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this said Ameda?","review":"Firstly, the product we received is not Ameda it is Bailey Nurture III.

Speculative fiction better describes the genre of this book than does science fiction simply because the stories are steeped in very human reality.Banks is a masterful story teller with a vivid imagination. I enjoyed all the stories in this book and was unable to decide on a favorite.

When a person with a pair of glasses wear the EarHugger, he or she wouldn't be able to use it without having to constantly adjust its position around the ear because it doesn't stay fixed longer than 5 minutes.

Also something about his Schwarzenegger-like jawline/smile freaks me out a little, because otherwise he is pretty hot. But in general the show is very entertaining and worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV sreies lover","review":"great series if you like some action with a little comedy sprinkled in ,actors & actresses are excellent together"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite shows ever - can't wait to buy Season Two!","review":"I think this is a great series, so what can I say, but I love the DVD.

Unfortunately, I missed many of the episodes or at least parts of them, so it's great to have them all in one place and in order.

But today, during a marathon and after watching the demise of Vaughn, the first show of the first season came on and I left it on. I was surprised and then very annoyed to discover that there is quite a bit of dialogue that is not included in my DVD. I must assume that there is missing dialogue in all the DVDs.I don't understand the point of this. It is so contrary to normal practice where DVDs usually contain more, not less, material than on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Intelligent Entertainment","review":"Jeffrey Donovan's witty and probably closer-to-the-real-thing take on being a spy (than 007) as the character Michael Westen is endlessly entertaining to me, as are the roles of Sharon Gless (as his needy mother), Gabrielle Anwar (as his former IRA operative ex-girlfriend) and Bruce Campbell (as an ex-Navy Seal friend). All but the mother conduct various operations to help \\"little guy\\" clients out of their life-threatening troubles with various criminal types.

We give her DVD for baby gifts, birthday gifts, etc. So we were excited to see that a new Laurie DVD was out. The grandson has his own remote control (non-operative, but he doesn't know that). After about 5 minutes of watching the new DVD he was shaking his head \\"no\\" and clicking his remote controller. We thought perhaps he was disappointed because one of his favorite Laurie DVDs was not playing, but as we watched it seemed that the production, the plan, the directing was not up to the same level as previous DVDs. In fact, in the opening song it appears that the filming might be done with a hand held video camera. The picture was bouncing and the first songs seem to be a little frantic for our little guy. Earlier videos have us spoiled with their smooth production and softer approach. We are still big Laurie fans, just not of this video. Maybe this is for older preschoolers/children??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Laurie Berkner Videos","review":"My grandchildren love the Laurie Berkner DVD's; they have the whole collection; Laurie is a wonderful entertainer along with her group, and her songs and their words are just fabulous; my favorite is Victor Vito!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this video!! and so does my 2 1/2 year old daughter","review":"My 2 1/2 year old daughter is IN LOVE with Laurie Berkner and this video is the best one yet!

The three chapters on choreographing were unbelievably helpful as I went through the process of making some of my own dances. Like having a trusted friend talk you through the process. I was able to critically examine and revise (or throw-out!) some of the elements I was using. As the previous reviewer noted, a unique and particularly helpful aspect of this book is the numerous movement and compositional exercises the author walks (dances) you through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of the scent","review":"I've been looking for something cheaper than California Baby Calming body wash/shampoo, which I currently use for my kids. Had high hopes for this, I do like the foaming pump bottle that you can use one-handed. The stuff just smells too strong though. I have never considered myself sensitive to perfumes, but this smell just gets to me--it has a smell reminiscent of vomit. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like mildew and oranges","review":"While our 2-week old has seemed to tolerate this shampoo/body wash just fine, it smells like mildewy towels and oranges. Not super pleasant. I'll be looking for a new shampoo that lets our sweet baby smell like a baby and not a dirty dish towel. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby's skin is too sensitive for it","review":"I thought I would love this after reading the other reviews. I didn't really care for the smell, but it wasn't offensive, so I figured I could handle it since it was all natural. But my baby broke out when I bathed her with it. It wasn't a huge allergic reaction or anything, but looked like slight irritation. I switched to another brand and it went away. I was really disappointed that this didn't work out for me. I had such high hopes for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potassium Cocoate is as harsh as betaines!!!","review":"We bought this for our daughters, 2 and 6 months at the time. This irritated thier skin and created a rash, left thier skin feeling tight and not conditioned. After further research we found that the potassium olivate and cocoate are just as harsh ingredients if not harsher than the coco betaines in other natural products. There really is no different other than the betaines are more conditioning and less of an irritant for infant skin. Don't buy this, it gave both our children a rash, then it went rancid after three months of it sitting, what is that?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused a rash!","review":"I really wanted to LOVE this product because the ingredients are amazing, but it made my son break out in a rash. He doesn't have extremely sensitive skin either, so when I read some reviews that said their children broke out in a rash I just assumed those kids had super sensitive skin. We have tried 4 or 5 different washes and this is the only one that has ever caused a rash. This product has a lot of essential oils and my son must be allergic to at least one of them,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stand the Smell :(","review":"I give this 2 stars because it is at least organic and has Zero toxins in it. Other than that, I hate this stuff! I had high hopes and really wanted to like it. I thought it smelled great when it was still in the bottle but after bathing my son and myself in it, it left an awful smell on the both of us. I didn't realize it at first but it was BAD! I honestly think it's the orange oil because it smells acidic. It also dried out his skin :( I would be more inclined to use it if it smelled better and didn't dry out my baby's skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Using At Age 4","review":"Love this stuff and highly recommend for newborns to any age! I had twins and tried using other baby soap...but I found it hard to dispense and make lather with one hand. I love that this product is natural (even though it will sting the eyes, so be careful around the face!) and even more so that is has a foam dispenser, I can use one handed, and it smells nice. I buy this big bottle and refill the same pump I originally bought 4 years ago.I also buy this for everyone I know that is expecting! A great shower gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"Love the smell, but this is extremely drying. Definitely not our favorite. The foam is not great either. I will not be repurchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much ...","review":"Thought I'd try this because it received glowing reviews here on Amazon. However, it's going in the trash because it left my 5 month old daughter's hair greasy. Also, it stated on the bottle to avoid getting in baby's eyes as it will sting. That alone made baby's bathtime stressful for me and my husband. I will go back to using California Baby fragrance free shampoo which works great. I was just trying to find a shampoo that smelled nice since my husband misses the scent of our baby's head after using Johnson & Johnson's Baby Shampoo. We stopped using J&J immediately after we read it contained harmful ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"Well, it's organic. That's about the nicest thing I can say about it. The foam goes nowhere and leaves my three year old's hair so greasy looking. Also, it has a light but odd orange smell to it in the bottle. I could deal with that, even though it's not a delicious fruity smell, more like a light spicy orange smell, but on her hair - oh my. I honestly thought my husband forgot to wash her hair the first time because it smelled like it still had spit up from my newborn on her. But several washes later, I now know that's just the smell. As one other reviewer put it, it smells like vomit. Not horribly gross vomit, really, but baby vomit/spit-up if that makes you feel better. I won't be buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant scent","review":"I may have received the rare defect, one that started to go bad before its expiration date. I can't be sure. What I know is that I thought the smell was off, as if it started to go rancid. It might be subjective, but I found it too unpleasant and didn't want to take the chance or mask that wonderful baby smell with this one even if it didn't/hadn't started to go bad. I don't know how effective it isn't, because I didn't use it - I just smelled it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells like Heaven!","review":"I am such a fan of Earth Mama's products! I have sensitive skin and typically can't use much that is scented at all. Angel baby shampoo and body wash is not just for babies! I don't use it as shampoo, but it lathers great,cleans well, rinses clear, and smells divine as a body wash. I will definitely use this on my baby. Just note that it is not tear free so you'll have to be careful. Also, make sure you have the pump to dispense this. It makes it last a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells good, leaves no residue","review":"I first got this as a gift, and I liked it so much that I've continued to use it. It doesn't leave a filmy residue on my daughter's skin and it smells good (like a citrus fruit!). The only downside is that it is NOT a \\"no-tears\\" formula which means that there is no anesthetizing ingredient in it. I have to be extra careful when I'm rinsing her hair so that the water doesn't run down her face and into her eyes. I also do not use it on her cheeks and forehead... for that I use the original Jergens bar soap which is about as mild as you can get as far as soaps go.Also, just a comment... the body wash was delivered to my house on a cold day, and it had turned a muddy opaque color. At first I thought it was defective, but after letting it return to room temperature, it went back to normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns and itches","review":"I know others like this brand, and its ingredients ARE very clean, but that said it really burns the baby's eyes. It also has an extremely strong smell. I prefer my baby to smell like himself not like he just bathed in an orange. (and it burns eyes just as though you had squirted citrus into them. I know. I tried it for myself.) I have used this soap several times while showering with the baby and found that it makes my skin and scalp itch like crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby wash overall","review":"My kids both have sensitive skin and I have used this wash on my 2.5 year-old since day one. He has never had any irritation from it whatsoever. I love that it lasts a long time too. It rinses off easily and leaves no residue. I've tried other baby washes but nothing comes close to this. I love the light scent and how clean and fresh my babies are after using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smell, gentle on baby's skin","review":"I love the smell of this body wash. My baby girl smells like orange sherbert after her bathtime. It's gentle on her delicate skin and gives me the peace of mind that she's not absorbing any toxins. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five star review is that her hair still looks oily after it's washed with this. I know it can't really be helped because the product is made with essential oils to keep baby's skin from drying. Also, another reviewer said that a little goes a long way. That's not the case. I usually have to use 6 pumps of this for a full bath for her and I'm not applying it generously either. But overall, I would recommend this. It does what it's supposed to and my baby hasn't had any skin reactions to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, High Price","review":"Absolutely love the way this smells and so do my daughters. Unlike some reviewers, we have not had an issue w/eye sensitivity. Unfortunately, it's a little \\"watery\\" as are most organic washes, however, it still works great. The only issue is finding a good price on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even sealed!","review":"Smells and looks differently from what I bought last time, not to mention that the product I got this time is not sealed at all. The one I bought last time is sealed under the lid, while this time, I found they use plastic to wrap the lid from outside, nothing inside under the lid. I will never buy from this seller any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too liquidy","review":"Not so crazy about this shampoo. It smells great (orangy-citrus), but it's very liquidy and is hard to get out of my baby's hair. Don't think I'll buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will burn your child's eyes. Beware.","review":"Worst shampoo ever. My kids were crying when the bubbles got in their eyes. The warning on the bottle was tiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Great!","review":"We love the smell and it keeps our baby smelling nice and clean. Highly recommend it for anyone interested in keeping toxins away from your baby's skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, effective, gentle soap.","review":"I love that there are no chemicals in this soap, that it smells wonderful, and that it doesn't irritate my daughter's sensitive skin. I even use it for myself--for body and face! It isn't harsh at all, and it's nice having one container of soap for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Blas can play some Latin Jazz!","review":"Johnny Blas can really play some congas! I enjoyed his conga playing and I think as a band leader he is very good. This CD was good from start to finish.

Several peices that are designed to fall of come off a lot during transformation. He's kind of hard to pose too, as he is bulky and his feet don't stand right; but he looks really cool, makes great sounds, and is fun to transform and play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authentic Leica Product?","review":"I received my M8/9 Leica replacement battery on time. But upon opening the package, I noticed a couple things that caused me to question the authenticity.The original battery that came with my M9 was rated at 1800mAh. This battery was rated at 1860mAh.Packaging says M8. Odd that the older model camera battery would be coupled with a higher capacity battery.Second, the writing on the battery's back is in Russian.Third, the battery while packaged in Leica branded packaging, was crudely packed in cheap bubble wrap.So I really have no idea if I was sold an authentic Leica battery, or a cheap knock-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink & Wet is right...right away","review":"At first glance, you'd never know this is a drink and wet doll with it's soft body. It is cute and cuddly and my 22 month old daughter likes to carry her around.However, as a potty training aid it lacks completely. I thought this doll was broken when we tried to \\"feed\\" her the first time as it leaked all over the floor. I thought I overfilled it. I tried again and I saw it leaking out the bottom. Come to find out there is no resivoir to hold the liquid in for you to squeeze like the other drink and wet hard body dolls. This doll will not allow my daughter to \\"teach\\" the doll how to potty (using Dr. Phil's training method). Like the other reviewer said, you can't undress her as her clothes are her body except for the drop bottom flap and cute little rubbery bottom.I should have just spent the extra money and bought the actual potty doll.VERY disappointed, and it is a shame too because Goldberger has been around since 1916 and is well known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Although Mark has a good voice, I found this to be a very boring CD.

Heather has a great voice, and most of her songs are beautiful. Tracks 5 and 6 are the best. The only thing that bothers me is that toward the end of the album, the songs start to meander. Track 8 is too long, and the last two songs could use more vocals and less techno-y music. I'm not complaining really, because I like these songs, but they pale in comparison to the amazing music that fills the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, melodic electronia","review":"If you like Dot Allison, Delirium, Lisa Gerrard, or Mandalay, you'll like Heather Duby.

Definitely check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eloquently written, but not engaging","review":"Gentlemen and Players begins in style: the setting is patiently and beautifully defined; the characters are well-introduced; and the central plot of the book--as described on the inside flap--is enough to keep any reader interested. However, after 100 pages of the 400 page book, I felt like the reader was still trapped inside the first 10 pages. The patient exposition that I had welcomed for 25 pages became downright annoying after 100. Joanne Harris writes well, but I feel that the same level of enjoyment could have been gleaned from a 200 page version of Gentlemen and Players instead of a 400 page version. Buy it if you'd like, but be prepared to skip a few irrelevant chapters in the middle to speed things along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoable reading - with very surprising ending.","review":"... and here I thought that I knew what's going on!This very clever and intelligent thriller has more twists and surprises than any other thriller that I can remember.

It was good book with lots of fascinating twists and turns (especially in the last seventy pages or so), but it gets just four stars because it drags at times. Despite my impatience with some parts of the book, I still think it's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary masterpiece","review":"If I could I would give this book 10 stars!!!!I was intrigued by the storyline of this book; someone trying to undermind the teachers and students of this elite school. This novel was much more than that. I loved how the author roped you into this story with her beautiful words. I compared this book to The Talented Mr. Ripley on how someone becomes another person just to undermind those around them and succeed in life. All of the characters I came to care for and was sad when I turned the last page to finish this great book.I could see this book becoming a movie with Ian McKellan in the title role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable and engrossing","review":"This is the first book I've read by Joanne Harris but it appears to be a departure from her other works. I only know \\"Chocolat\\" from the movie, but looking at it and her previous novels did not prepare me for the subject of this book: A fairly dark revenge-driven plot set in an all-boys school in England. The plot has been compared to \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" and there are similarities.

I don't think I have ever been stunned by the final revelation more than in this book. But from the beginning, the suspense begins to build, and we watch a master trouble maker turn into a murderous avenger, faced all the while with the veteran old Master teacher Straitley. The details about goings-on at an English school for boys are fascinating, the characters well drawn out. One should avoid the strong temptation halfway through the book to flip to the back to see how it comes out, no matter how worried one gets about what will happen. A first-rate book, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging mystery with a twist to look forward to!","review":"\\"Gentlemen and Players\\" is an excellent mystery set in a Boys School in England.

I don't know if he's sure why he wrote the book in the first place. He certainly does a lot of name-dropping. There has always been, and will always be, class distinction based upon income, education, family history, physical features, etc. It happens in every race and culture, and I am not surprised that it happens in the African-American race. I believe that many of the organizations that Mr. Graham allude to in his book were initially formed as \\"support systems\\" for those few Blacks who became educated and successful. During the early years, these organizations were probably nothing more than social clubs. But over years, I believe that many of the organizations' members have re-identified their main purpose and developed a social conscience.

We were all quite shocked and amazed at the high level of snobbery and uppityness that was portrayed in Mr. Graham's work. I commend his efforts to highlight some of the history behind the Black social organizations, schools, and vacation spots. I even enjoyed his chapter on the undercover world of those \\"passing for white.\\" Those interesting tidbits, however, were more than overshadowed by the shallow and egotistical quotes from members of the elite. I didn't think that one of our own would write something that has the potential for being so divisive to our race. Mr. Graham has done this segment of our population a huge disservice. I'm sure they all aren't so petty......Can't we all just get along??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little analysis. Exhibitionistic.","review":"I grew up in the environment that Graham describes. However, I am not impressed with the book. The author has great material for a study and botches his effort by offering little analysis. He drops names and places, letting us know that he knows this world, but he does not offer much critical insight. He confuses time periods, talking about the Palmer Institute, or Camp Atwater or the importance of certain historically black colleges (Spelman, Howard), without volunteering key facts, such as that Palmer doesn't even exist any more. He doesn't touch on or analyze the tensions between Northern and Southern black elites. Ultimately, the book reads like a show and tell exhibit for white people and blacks who are not part of this world. It doesn't tell insiders anything they don't already know, and it doesn't offer the world at large any coherent ideas other than \\"See, these people exist.\\" This simple notion does not sustain a whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The life of rich black folk","review":"I think that this book was a real eye opener.

What a great decision! The contents of this book could have been summed up in a 5 page article!! I've seen Mr. Graham's other writings (e.g., U.S. News & World Report) and he seems obsessed with proving he belongs to the \\"right\\" group of people and distancing himself from blacks who haven't, in his eyes, \\"made it\\". Ho hum. We've gotten your message, Larry. I don't know why people are getting so upset about this silly piece of self-promotion. WHO CARES? If these people want to obsess over such trivial things as hair and skin color, college degrees, summer homes, who is \\"in\\" and \\"out\\", etc., I say, let 'em.

While the author does shed light on an interesting segment of African-America, my opinion is that he does not maintain enough professional detachment from his subject matter - subject matter that is \\"lightweight\\" to begin with.Regarding all of the sound and fury posted here, I am somewhat embarassed to see so many of my people engaging in commentary that is so publicly mean-spitited.Tip: for a book that is truly thought provoking, try \\"Black Genius: African-American solutions to African-American Problems.\\" (also available on Amazon.com). It is a book filled with insightful and thought-provoking commentary from some extremely bright and well-respected members of our community. Unfortunately, only one person has reviewed it online.Thats a shame - it is far more worthy of our time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this it ?","review":"Although, it was interesting to read the history of the black elite, Graham's failure to be more critical of this groups is it most glaring omission. Graham's star struck portrayal does him in. These people were not the leaders in the civil rights movement, but frowned upon it. Why isn't he asking the hard questions such as how could black colleges have denied admission to dark skinned blacks ? or, just how relevant are these organizations today ? Also, he is constantly referring to status symbols, mansions, rolls royces, etc. I would like to ask Graham if he ever dated a dark skinned black woman? It isn't an \\"accident\\" that his wife happens to look white?

And his sources count for nothing, as most of them are wannabe types just like him. If his point is that educated and/or monied blacks can be just as shallow, stupid, status-minded and vulgar as their white counterparts, then the point is nicely taken. But the real problem here is the author's vision: he's in love with fancy labels, and bores the reader to death by ticking them off, page after page.

However when I heard the author speak in person, I said maybe there is something I can learn from this book. I should have stuck with my first instinct. I found the constant name dropping and designer brand name references to be more than I could tolerate. Having grown up with and around many of the organizations the author refers to, I wonder if maybe I was living in some identical universe, because his experiences and mine were so far from the same.

If his parents did not graduate from any of the colleges he references in his book, does that make him an \\"insider wannabe\\"?

Use this book for the names only. It has no social value other than that. He would have been better off publishing his roledex in place of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Right","review":"With all due respect to Mr. Graham, I think that maybe he was honestly trying to take the reader on an historical journey to explain why the differences in social class within the African American race. Where he failed miserably is while trying to convey this central theme of class difference, he chose to intertwine his personal views and opinions within the text. The reader (myself) comes away feeling as if something is just not right with Mr. Graham......the feeling that perhaps Mr. Graham is a bit of a snob.I give it a 2-star rating simply because the cover looks really cute blended into my current cultural library of books. And also perhaps in the future I can use it as a demonstration to teach young African Americans how the mindset of some confused people (aka: Mr. Graham) can set out to destroy our spirits and divide our wholeness. Other than that, I cant really recommend it as solid reading material at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those who know don't tell....","review":"Those who know don't tell. And those who tell don't know. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I picked up this book with the expection of getting some insight into this world unknown to me. Instead, I flipped through page after page of name dropping wondering when it would get better or end. He touches on the old paper bag test, desire for straight hair, etc. but does nothing to analyze it. Instead, he accepts the ignorance as simply \\"right\\". The author proclaims that he understood what his younger brother did not of the importance of staying out of the sun at an early age. Although I had no knowledge of some of the mentioned organizations, I got the feeling that much of this information was outdated. The repetitivness became unbearable to the point of me having to listen to music just to get through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject was interesting....Book was not.","review":"Well, first off let me say this. The book itself was terrible. Graham was gossipy and the book was like reading a shout-out list. I read this book after reading some other ( and more informational) books on the subject, and I was thoroughly disappointed. I could go on about how disgustingly shallow he made the black-upper class, but that would be pointless. Also, Graham seems to be talking about a generation that was long ago. I seriously doubt that many of the \\"elite\\" feel the way some of the old timers do. Anyway, if you're looking for something informative and helpful, look somewhere else. Some of the stuff he talked about was common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I was not raised in this group, but I am interested in them since some of my family are \\"Black Upper Class\\". I liked his book because he told the negative aspects of the group (his grandmother's insults against brown skin; the extreme--and to me--the nightmare/paranoid lifestyle of \\"passing\\"), but at the same time he talks about the positive aspects of the group and he admits that he has not rejected the group--he is an active participant. That is refreshing. It is easy to be a Black nationalist on paper, then to be snobby in your everyday life. This author seems to be saying \\"this is the truth I have experienced. This is the upper class. It is a pungent group. Make up your own mind whether you think it is a delicious or repugnant odor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark entirely","review":"If the author were truly the \\"insider\\" he claims to be, then he would know that the black upper-class handed over Oak Bluffs and Sag Harbor years ago to various and sundry \\"celebrities\\", athletes, riff-raff with money, and petty arrivistes (such as the author himself) some thirty to forty years ago. We now summer in Maine, Nova Scotia, Tuscany, Sardinia, Provence, St. Paul de Vence, St. Tropez, Montreux, Lake Como, and other such places. Oak Bluffs and Sag Harbor are now overrun with crass, nouveau types who think that because they've made a little money, they're automatically \\"upper class\\". Yes, the party continues, but the venues have radically changed. The author is about one generation behind the curve."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Shame","review":"You can't blame people for how they were raised but you can hold them accountable for their actions. Granted Mr. Graham thinks this is an important part of American History, but should we be proud of a group of people who bought in to and sold out to the dogma that whiter is better. How could the same group of people that judged based on skin color hipocritcally claim African heritage? The body is just a physical dress for the spirit and what ugly spirits these people have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very elementary and in many instances, inaccurate.","review":"I cannot believe that an African American wrote this book. Does the author really know his history of how we Blacks got to be \\"blue bloods\\". Is he really proud of the white blood that runs through his veins? Does he realize that someone was raped in order to have the straight hair, the light skin, etc.? He needs to read, read, read, and then try again to write a book with a little more substance. We cannot put him in the same class with our outstanding Black writers. Maybe in Mr. Graham's next book, he will come out and let us know where the roots of his inferiority lie. Believe me \\"we all (Blacks) will go when the wagon comes\\", and maybe the author will learn this before the wagon comes for him, for it surely will.

An immediate example that comes to mind is the listing of Mrs. H.Nash Chisholm as Mrs. H. Chisholm Nash. The hackneyed writing was tiring with phrases repeatedly begining with \\"such as\\" and overuse of \\"like.\\" This writer will never have to answer the call offering a literary prize.

It only demonstrates the psychotic mindstate of many Afrikan people. We still have not (many of us) come to terms with the debilitating effects of the Slave Experience upon the collective psyches of Afrikans worldwide. Instead of finding commonalities amongst ourselves, we would rather divide over the most trivial of issues or programs. How so many Afrikan members of Frats and Sorors are at eachother's throats over cliqueishness is mindboggling.When we are faced with oppression (on any level) the oppressor could care less if we belong to the AKAs or the Deltas, the Alphas or the Omegas. We have more in common than not. We need to overlook these petty differences and come together on more important issues.BNS FOREVER.SOULONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This is a book about who's who in the black upper crust.

Needless to say, I was very intrigued by the existence of such an important and influential part of America which I had entirely missed. Unfortunately, I found the book poorly written and disorganized. For starters it could have been half as long without any loss of purpose. The anecdotal examples are repetitive and tiresome. In addition, the recurrence of \\"sore topics\\" (e.g. \\"passing for white\\") ends up loosing the most interested reader.

It exposes class conflict in the African-American community. Whether or not this class conflict is a good thing is besides the point, in my opinion. It exists so there's no point in ignoring it. Most important, I learned some things I hadn't known before. So it was definitely worth my time. However, it's not without its faults. The author would have done better not to continually inject himself into the narrative. A preface describing his background would have sufficed. At heart, this book is a gossipy expose. But hey, I knew I wasn't getting an analytical, scholarly tome when I noticed that it didn't have footnotes or a bibliography.

With some genuine Carnauba wax I tested it on my son's car and it looked great and was not a big chore like hand waxing.Next I polished my car and it looks like show-room new!

The pad that comes with it is only for applying the polish or wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"This price is a joke","review":"I am writing this review because the markup on this tool is ridiculous.

I came back to a 350-some dollar tool? WHAT!?Look anywhere but here for this tool. CoastalTool currently has it at just over 100 - still not as low as it should be, but 350-some dollars?!

I then wet sanded a fender using 1500 grit paper. This unit will not TOUCH a wet sanded finish. Its ridiculous.. I should have read all these glorious reviews closer.. this is nothing more than a high end waxer that you could buy for $20 at your local autozone.

The motor does not sound good when it runs, it has a cheap Chinese product sound. It starts with a jolt spraying the compound everywhere. Speed control at it's lowest setting is still much to fast. Crummy pad supplied cannot be removed from the backing pad.OK for light polishing but the polishers with slow-start and slower speeds are a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polisher makes easy and fast work of waxing","review":"A little heavy but very effective.

The color camouflage sounds gimmicky but it actually works, and does not seem to compromise line-strength. You can choose between a black, red, or clear knot to fit your needs.

While the tight writing keeps the reader's interest, the people do not. Bausch, who is capable of drawing a reader into incredibly complex ethical situations, does none of that here. And, while we can all get at least a little excited about pure mayhem, this unrelieved hostage tale provides no such excitement. No moral tension, because there are no moral people. Just grossly denegrating behavior--homosexual rape of an eleven year old, illicit fingering of his mom, violent deaths---why?

However, when I read this book, I was very disappointed -- like too many other books in this genre, it dwells very heavily on the negative feelings an older child has about a new baby, and only on the last page is any positive feeling expressed. Of course it's important to acknowledge the negative feelings an older child will have -- but a book that presents a more balanced picture of feelings about new siblinghood, such as Joanna Cole's books I'm a Big Brother and I'm a Big Sister, or Martin Waddell's lovely book When the Teddy Bears Came, seems much more appropriate and comforting reading for siblings-to-be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget...WRONG TRANSLATIONS","review":"This had such great reviews to motivate me to order for my son.

But, its true strength lies in the best world and character building narrative that I have ever seen in any scifi book. The members of this future society as well as the society itself are vastly different from what we know today, but Turner does an exceedingly good job of building a believable world with complex and UTTERLY FASCINATING characters.

It seems a bit odd coming from this band(well, unless you were alive in the 70's and saw them in the clubs) but for some reason it actually works. The rest of the CD is great too; I especially liked Lady's Boy, Pay the Price, and Can't Stand Still. Shoot 'em Down sounds way different than the version on the Under the Blade album, but it's awesome anyway.

Overall, I have a good connection, but the bugs are too annoying for me, and I am returning the unit. Belkin makes an adapter compatible with OS X, and I hear AeroPad is good too.

I downloaded the newest drivers from the web site and managed to get it up and running rather easily. But I soon found myself faced with serious problems involving an external firewire hard disk connected to the computer -- the drivers seem to have been corrupted to the point where it appears that only a complete erasing of the internal hard drive and reinstallation of the system is going to solve my problems. Obviously, this is more than I bargained on. Perhaps there is a way of getting this to work with Macs and some who have purchased it report good results. But, in my case, the costs have far outweighed the benefits.

They're supposed to work with MacOS X (10.2) but never have... at best I've seen them work intermittenly (and usually you have to plug it into the computer after you've booted it). As for PC users, it's a mixed bag. The adapters themselves seem to get unreliable after about 30 feet... sometimes I get good signals with interference-causing objects in between and sometimes I get poor signals with no apparent objects that should be causing interference.

I don't even try to read the content of the file...I just open up the file and then move on to the next task.That one small step usually gets me feeling better about tackling the big task/goal.When I do these small things consistently, my mental block erodes, and I end up doing bigger things easily.This is a super short book as well.Give it a read, it will help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I was so tired of reading about case studies of other people's phobias I could not continue reading.

The Kaizen Way reminds us that big changes need not be painful if we focus on little steps, micro practices, and incremental shift. 1% shifts, done regularly, can get us to a new place with (less) personal pain and in fact are more likely to help us make permanent shifts in our behavior.I'm an executive and life coach, and the philosophy espoused in this book fits perfectly with the approaches I already use with clients. What I love about this book is that the author lays out a very good argument for small changes.

Finally.","review":"After too long, everyone's favorite fantasy gumshoe has returned. Many threads from the previous books are brought together as G gets pulled into a case of Human Supremacists by way of Old Man Weider, brewer extrordinaire. The book is fast paced, sometimes a bit too fast paced. People, plots and politics come and go at blinding speed, only occasionally making me think \\"Now who was that again?\\" Most refreshing is that Garrett has toned down his sourness and seems less estranged from Morley, Saucerhead and the Dead Man. The last few books have seemed to feature a more alienated Garrett, and I (for one) am glad to see a bit of the old man back.Rumor has it that Roc is sitting on another completed Garrett novel. Here's to hoping it sees the light of day faster than the last one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One day, Garret will return.","review":"Truly one of the best genre-bending series out there, the series creates a rich fantasy world that nonetheless is grounded in a reality we can easily recognize.

Harley is a strong character, determined to get what she wants, yet senstitive to the needs and feelings of others--she'd make a great best friend!

It is overly complex and involved way too much \\"process.\\" Almost every paragraph introduces a new idiosynchratic piece of jargon - microcycles, mesocycles, and macrocycles - give me a break! This book outlines an entire plan without detailing the plan! You must make a goal and write it down. You must decide whether you want to use \\"threshold\\" heart rate or maximum heart rate. You must calculate your zones. You must then periodize your training and then personalize the periodization (or maybe you personalize first and then periodize). It is simply too evangelical to be of any use unless you buy into the zen program. For someone who has a specific goal, this book may help you achieve it.

My two main complaints: convoluted writing (I mean, some of what she writes is sooooo confusing) and poor editing.However, it deserves one star because in my opinion, the story itself had potential -- though it is rather bizarre -- but the book is just too difficult to wade through.

I mainly used it for framing and rough work, so accuracy isnt so important, but this is not an accurate table saw. With a 10 inch blade you cannot rip a 2x4, you have to go so slow for it to chew through it that the blade burns the wood. So I removed the 10 inch blad and put on a 1 1/4 inch thin fast cut blade, which solved the power problem, but the blade barly raises high enough to make it trough, maybe this works if you are cutting 1 inch material and you dont care if your cut is straight, other than that, this isnt your saw"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some solid parts, but lots of problems","review":"Adjusting the blade into parallel was nearly impossible. The blade is currently stuck on the arbor. I tried beating on it pretty hard to get it off. I know most people are probably saying \\"what an idiot\\" right now, and I agree, but when you are pressed for time and getting really annoyed, it is easy to get violent. I should have called Jet, but I never got around to it. This happened almost 6 months ago, so I am a little out of touch with exactly what is wrong.(I have been at college so I haven't been able to get to it)Some one mentioned putting a cement blow on the bottom for weight, I did that and when the saw was working it worked very well in keep the saw from shaking.If you are some on that doesn't mind screwing around with stuff, this saw might not be bad for you, as the actually construction seems to be pretty solid.

The runout on the blade is literally over 1/16\\". That's really pretty bad. When I rip boards, I get burning and a frantic edge throughout the cut. I went to a TK Freud blade and got no improvement. The fence is weak and flimsy. The tabletop is small.So, you are asking...........\\"You paid $210 for this, what did you expect?\\" Good call. I expected very little.

I read about the features of the GoBack 3.0 Deluxe, so I bought this program, but every attempt to install (clean or upgrade), has resulted in the install being rejected - due to incompatibility problems with my version of Windows. Really? A reinstallation of GoBack 3.0 Personal Edition, never has any problems, but apparently it's a \\"bridge too far\\" for the Deluxe version. A little frustrating, but the program didn't cost a bundle, and I've likely got friends at work who would be willing to engage in a transaction to give this program a good home.

Why would the author and publisher want to insert such content--which would resonate more with the 12-14 year-old crowd--into a book for 4-8 year olds?

This first offering by Nimoy and De Lancie's joint audio venture, ALIEN VOICES, is a delight. I also highly recommend the other performances by Alien Voices - Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD, and another classic tale by the classic H.G.

Amazons website says it won't fit my vehicle but I called Westin to be 100% sure and they verify that it fits my truck.The installation doesn't need any drilling so it's really easy to install and I use a torque wrench to tighten everything in place. Because of my excitement, I didn't check the step board for dents before I install it and only to discover that it has two dents, one in each side (ouchh!).

There are 5 songs that have been previoulsy released,and it seems like there's not enough Lynch on the album.But overall,its real tight"},{"rating":"2","title":"on point","review":"I am a true lynch fan. I have had all of his discs. And I think that if you take this cd, and lynch's verses more specifically, and look at it as an individual disk rather than a comparison to Season, it's pretty chill. I think that through the years lynch has remained constant with his flow, but each disk has it's own style. This cd seems to be more complex as far as lyrics go. I think lynch put a lot of heart into this cd and got more personal, rather than just seeing how sicc he can be. But that sicc rip still flows heavy on this, plus it's new lynch stuff, so I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Buy","review":"This seller is amazing!!

The CD software seems to install OK but then when you connect the recorder to the PC with the USB cable, the PC wants to install a driver manually. If you tell Windows not to install the driver (since, I thought, it was already installed off the CD), Windows doesn't recognize the recorder and the Digital Wave player software doesn't see any of the files on the recorder. On the other hand, if you do tell Windows to install the driver and manually point it to the VNUSB.INF file on the CD, it comes back with an error message and the Digital Wave player software still doesn't see the recorder. This is what it did on my PC at work; on my PC at home, results were even worse--it froze that PC so I couldn't even shut it down normally, but had to hit the reset button.

I should say that this is the original VN-480 not the remanufactured, and I do have a CD disk with it. I had to try several times to install drivers and also tried download from several Olympus sites. Eventually I did manual search of the CD and I got it to work but it shouldn't be so hard.Also the DSS player has some really awful functionality. You have to download entire folders from the recorder, you can't search within folders on the recorder, and you have to store the files in a specified directory which is not configurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good recording but terrible software ruins it","review":"The recording quality and functionality is all standard and as you would expect.However, the device does not integrate with the file system when uploading to your PC and you are forced to use the terrible Waveplayer.

It would not charge (looked like it was charging but then after several hours the charging light would blink indicating it was dead).However, the real issue is that in the Maxxum 7D this battery is a very, very tight fit. It was basically stuck in the compartment and barely came back out! When you're shooting and you need to switch batteries quickly, this is the last thing you need. It might work fine in the vertical grip (VC 7D) but I don't have mine yet to try that.So far I have not found an NP 400 battery that is as good as the original; I still get 300-400 shots on the original 2+ year old Minolta battery.

I've reviewed this novel on other services over the last months, but feel this book NEEDS its praises sung from the rafters--I was that impressed. At first I was cautious--the author is an actor for heaven sakes--but apparently he's been in the wrong business. Main Character, Scott Garrison, is a true reluctant Hero. Like Jason Bourne of Ludlum's \\"Bourne Identity,\\" Garrison is thrown into a savage situation with no way out except to engage the enemy and fight. And fight he does with incredible ingenuity, despite the crippling odds. Early on, Kizzier takes us back to a harrowing time in Garrison's life in which he must make a life-altering decision. The detail of these scenes is frightenly realistic and makes me wonder what misery the author has endured in his own past.

This becomes, through the connexion of the problem of the imagination (representation) and the reduction the central theme of his collabboration to the sixth Descartes' Meditation with Edmund Husserl. To connect this last theme with the development of his proper philosophy as a cosmology is the last step: this happens by the means of the relation between \\"Spiel\\" (game) and imagination, which is the phenomenological reduction.
