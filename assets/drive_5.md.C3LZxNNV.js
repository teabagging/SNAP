Finally, not a mention of \\"bling bling\\" on a current release. While many I am certain were hoping for a virtual replay of all of their favorite Clay songs sung during the American Idol competition, this set showcases what a nice voice this young man has. Sure, there is a tinge of \\"predictability\\" here. Then again, what did you expect? Sit back and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY FAN","review":"I love Clay just the way he is or should I say was because some producers or who ever went into the studio and took a special part of Clay away in this CD. It is a good CD and I will enjoy it but it could have been great if they had not messed with the essence of Clay. To the producers or remixers or who ever the quilty party is CLAY'S VOICE IS GREAT IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Ask For More","review":"Don't know what \\"Dork Rock\\" is coming from, a lot of the comments weren't even about the CD! I think this is a fantastic CD as do a lot of my peers, young and old. It really is a CD for everyone. Clay's voice is wonderful, he has a lot of range and there isn't a bad song on his CD. Usually, when I buy a CD, I have one or maybe, two tracks that I really like, but this CD doesn't have just one or two, they are all great!!! Definitely worth buying and listening to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointed","review":"Today is the \\"Perfect Day\\" - Clay \\"Touch\\"es us with \\"The Way\\" he sings. He \\"Shine\\"s in this CD. Clay definitely does not disappoint. There's a song on this CD that should appeal to anyone who loves music. Clay is no longer \\"Invisible\\" - he's a popstar with a wonderful voice and most importantly integrity ....and that's the \\"Measure of a Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC BEYOND WORDS!!!","review":"I had great expectations of this CD. It has surpassed all expectations I could have ever imagined. I don't recall when I have ever heard a CD and absolutely LOVED EVERY SONG on it. I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken's and I knew he wouldn't let his fans down. If you don't buy another CD this year, make sure you don't miss out on this one. It is worth whatever you have to pay for it. FANTASTIC!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Okay, in all honesty: I love this CD! I have it and listen to it all the time. Clay Aiken is a really talented and hot singer! Listening to his cd you can tell what an awesome voice he has! It's worth every penny and you'll love it. It's a must have for all Clay fans -- and even for those of you who aren't. Clay's one of the best singers out there right now and should have won American Idol. Why he didn't its beyond me, but right now it doesn't matter. It's all about his cd, his new single and his concerts!So BUY THIS CD!!!! You won't regret it. The best part of all is when you buy his cd you are supporting him. If you're a \\"claymate\\" and don't have this cd get it today. He totally deserves to be famous. And all of the songs on here are great for listening over and over! Plus (to all of the girls who have the hots for him): it comes with a really hot poster of him! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is a one of a kind!","review":"I love this CD. the song \\"measure of a man says it all!\\" There are so many people out there that judge people for what they have an not who they are. All of Clay's songs touch your heart! FINALLY someone that is in the spotlight that doen't dress and act like trash! He said \\"I will never do anything that I would that I would be ashamed of\\". There are not to many performers out there these days that can say that! He is a one of a kind! He has a truly loving and caring heart! Clay Aiken is what this world needs and this CD is the best CD I have heard in a LONG time! If I had kids I wouldn't be afraid for them to listen to it! Clay is the best! Keep up the great work Clay! And stay true to your heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, energetic and inspirational cd.","review":"I was very excited to get this cd and I was not dissappointed. Clay is a wonderful singer with a big clear voice with a very good range. What I liked most about this cd is that the songs deliver good messages and no dirt. I would say that this album is a mix of pop rock and inspirational. Some of my favorite songs would be:Invisible- fun, upbeat, and good lyric about not being noticed by the person you are attracted to.The Way- Wonderful, romantic and I expect that it will be played at a number of dances and proms.I Will Carry You- reminds me of the songs Bridge Over Troubled Waters and He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother with its moving and inspirational message.This is the Night- another romantic song that gives me the tingles.Measure of a Man- This song could easily fit in a gospel/inspirational album. Fabulous message in it.This cd makes me go back and forth between dancing and getting teary eyed. I bet you will feel the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT BUT ASTOUNDING!!","review":"While the song selection doesn't allow much room for Clay's awesome glory notes, his amazing voice shines through loud and clear! This album is definitely POP and will forever dispell the Broadway comments often hurled in his direction! Every song on this CD will pull you in...there are no losers here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man is a hit!!!!!","review":"I purchased the Cd today, I listen to it 6 times, it is a great cd, I was surprised at his sound and the type of music he chose for the cd... Great selection and mix of music... I believe this will be a hit for him... I like cuts Number 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,and 11. Great going Clay...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"My car's CD changer currently has The Beatles, The Who, Sting, Eminem, Coldplay and this CD. What all these artists have in common is artistic excellence in their particular genres. This CD let me smiling and speechless today. There's at least four #1 hits on this CD. This man can sing and its been said before but he is the next Sinatra. Amazing range and feeling and the songs are, for the most part, beautiful and powerful.Get this CD....you will not go wrong. It doesn't look like Clay is going to go wrong either :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Ever since AI finished I have been waiting for this album to arrive. Now that it has, it surpassed my expectations. I like every song on it. Clay's voice is amazing as always, and his song choices were right on the mark. I hope to hear many more albums from Clay in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A music fan","review":"I am totally blown away by this album! I haven't heard anything this great in a very long time. Clay has the most beautiful voice in the world, I highly recommend this CD if you enjoy real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"I CAN SAY THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CD TO COME OUT IN A WHILE! THEY DEFINATLY DID A TERRIFIC JOB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's amazing... his voice is spectacular... he syntellates","review":"(...) Clay is amazing. Ever since he sang 'Always and Forever', until the final notes of 'Bridge over Troubled Waters', I have followed Clay Aiken closely. I have eagerly anticipated his solo debut, and could not be more pleased. From the powerhouse ballads such as 'Run To Me' and 'I Will Carry You', to the more modern pop tunes like 'Invisible' and 'Perfect Day', Clay captivates you from the very first note until the last. Releasing his \\"Broadway\\" dramatics with \\"No More Sad Song\\", or his mellow voice in 'Shine', Clay is perfect all around. As a radio station said earlier this day, Clay will be the next King of Pop. This is surely the most anticipated, and the best male pop album of the year. Congradulations, Clay, from a devoted fan.~"},{"rating":"2","title":"What has been missing in music for decades!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love every song on this CD. Clay has proven himself to be be a powerhouse. What a voice and the way he sings Perfect Day absolutely hitting all those high notes. As for Broadway, Broadway couldn't handle what he would bring to the stage. His voice is so pure, so rich and I get chills with each song he gives us."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW GO CLAY!","review":"this cd was GREAT! there is definetly something for any age. i am 15 and just adore clay...and i think that his older fans would love this cd also. im going to be looking forward to when he can write his own...but this cd was just great even with other people writing for him. there are so many good songs and it just impresses me everytime i put it in! GO OUT AND GET THIS ONE! i bet ull love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is wow!","review":"Clay Aiken's voice shines on this CD!!!! I bought this and well, I have bought one for my mom for her birthday. She has not been able to put it down!! She has listened to it over and over. Thank you Clay for a wonderful album and I can't wait till the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I love every song on this album and think Clay will produce even better in the years to come. Go Clay!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Clay is an amazing new artist and this CD proves that he has versatiliy,range, and heart. His voice is so strong and he evokes so much passion into his songs. Also there are songs to fit anyone's mood whether your happy (When you say you love me, perfect day, invisible, shine) or sad ( No more sad songs) or feel in love (measure of a man, run to me, i will carry you). This CD was worth the wait and worth every dollar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"What a voice this young man has. Can't wait to hear the next one.

Thank you Mr. Aiken and RCA for wonderful entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"Great songs for a great artist. Clay Aiken is one of a kind. Brilliant vocal performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love it","review":"As the song song says \\"is this the way you measure a man\\"? If it is then Clay is A+ grade all the way. I was wondering if it was just the show or if he had talent, the CD proves it wasn't a fluke! Worth EVERY Cent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype","review":"Aiken's fans have been building up for months about how great and fantastic his CD's going to be and that it'll sell multi-platinum copies, et al. Well, Gold is a more realistic view for the simple fact that his CD is just okay. I heard the whole CD at a \\"hear it before you buy it\\" music store - and I'm glad I did. I was only impressed by the song that was originally released as a singles i.e., This Is The Night. Well, at least he tried, but I'd just as soon spend my money on Neil Sadaka's Greatest Hits or Country Sensation LeAnn Rhimes upcoming CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measure Of Bad Music","review":"Is the music business this desperate to go and sign this poor excuse for a musician to a record contract?A bad CD. Hey Clay, do us all a favor and retire right now, so our ears don't have to be polluted with this garbage any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"You must be joking. Clay Aiken looks like a fairy. Dresses like a fairy. Talks like a fairy. He looks like he is made out of clay. Ha! Ha! Voice is down right awful. CD is a mess. He is definitely a product of poor American TV and should not be given the oppurtunity to put out another wretched album. BLAH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Voice, But....","review":"Let me just start by saying that I am formally educated in music. Unfortunately, I have the exact same criticism about Clay that many (including Simon) have. He's got a huge voice, but he lacks emotion. He can hit high notes, his voice has a richness, but obvious Clay knows nothing of what he sings about. Song stylists are able to show off their voices and make the audience feel it at the same time. That's the sort of thing that separates the Wayne Newton's from the Bruce Springsteen's....or the Kelly Clarkson's from the Sheryl Crowe's. Mr. Aiken just doesn't have that. Screaming out some notes is not singing, it's just plain screaming. And that's the reason he was voted number two and not number one on American Idol. It's not enough to hit notes, make me feel it...I want to feel what the song is saying. Otherwise, seeing or hearing you perform is not worth the price charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the way I wisper your name when I'm asleep","review":"Does this guy tape record himself at night? For more grade school poetry, nonsensical statements, and Haiku's written by dumb people go out and get this CD ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"pls. try again next time","review":"Just a reminder to Clay. if you want to succeed in the business as a respected singer and performer i suggest that you work w/ only the best composers and musical arrangers in the business.I have someone like David Foster in mind. Dianne Warren and even Jim Brickman.I don't want to see your talent go to waste.Think about it boy. you deserve the best and work w/ the best in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"american idol is over rated, clay aikien is over rated, ruben studdard is over rated, the only good thing to come out of american idol is kelly clarkson, this album is crap, i hate to say it but its true, and hes turning into a diva. i got to admit he can sing better than justin timberlake and usher and all those other crap pop singers, but i just dont get why people like this dude. what kind of song is invisible anyway? i couldnt help but laugh hysterically when i first heard that song, it just doesnt seem to be him. if he sticks to more josh groban type of music, maybe i would like him better....the operea stlye would fit him pretty good. i dont mean to offend his fans, but truth hurts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one","review":"The material on this CD is terrible, and Clay's uninspired singing just makes the whole endeavor worse. The songs here are as generic and bland as you can imagine, and they contain some of the worst lyrics in pop music history. \\"If I were invisible, I would be the smartest man?\\" Poor production values don't help. Even the most enthusiastic pop devotee is going to have a hard time respecting this slapped-together piece of commercialism.Clay Aiken also doesn't do himself any favors with his bland and routine delivery. Clay has a powerful voice, and if he had a little more imagination and a little more artistry, he might have elevated some of this material. Instead, he seems to be relaxing on cruise control as he resorts to predictable phrasing and timing with frustrating regularity. No soul, no subtlety, no artistry.Start to finish, this is an obvious rush effort on the parts of the producers, the songwriters, and Clay himself. At least I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic CD - Measure of a Pop Star","review":"Love this CD. All the songs are great. My favorite song is ?When You Say You Love Me'. I listen to the CD over and over, especially that particular song. Clay has a great voice that I can listen to all day long. Hope he is around for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Barry Manilow","review":"I don't care for Barry. Sure Clay's a want to be but he doesn't compare to Barry. He lacks the cheese of him. Also you can't sing along with Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Extraordinary Talent Turned into Commercialized Trash","review":"If Measure of a Man is supposed to be good music, than Clay Aiken doesn't measure up.Who in the name of God got hold of this exceptionally talented singer and talked him into singing third rate songs in second-rate country rock style?!Who coached him into sacrificing his natural appeal and remarkable voice to accomodate the masses who pay for this kind of commercialized junk? This CD will offend anyone who knows and appreciates quality music - and Clay Aiken knows it.If he had sung any one of these two-bit songs just as he sings on this CD, all three American Idol judges would have laughed him off the stage and out the back door within 10 seconds.Popular does not equal good, and CDs like this show us why. Clay - please tell us you haven't sold your musical soul for an interlude of fame and fortune. Stick with what you really are - a man of exceptional talent, integrity and good taste.What a waste!- Lover of Good Music. Disgusted with this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull As Dishwater","review":"This album has got to be the most boring, unimaginative CD of the year. All of these five-star reviews are very misleading. I feel that most of them have been written by obsessed Clay fans who feel the need to heap praise on Measure Of A Man simply because \\"It's Clay!!!\\" Don't be misled! I wouldn't recommend buying this record for anyone as Christmas gift, unless you are trying to make an enemy. A better gift idea would be Speakerboxxx/The Love Below by Outkast, or Elephant by The White Stripes. Merry Un-Clay Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay ? More like mud...","review":"I'm sorry to every Claymate out there but Clay Aiken isn't really my type. He's annoying, whiny, and not meaningful. It seems like hes marketing to 5th graders and his mom. Invisible is NOT a meaningful love song, its just pure pop. If you want to listen to meaningful male vocals, I would suggest Coldplay, Keane, or Alexi Murdoch.I do think that Clay Aiken has a good voice for Broadway or theater, but when he produces an over the top pop album such as this, he's wasting his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore...ZZZZZZZZ","review":"While Clay has a great voice this album was a total bore. Every song sounds exactly the same and I am glad I only listened to the album and didn't waste my money. There are about two good songs off the album and I am already want to puke from hearing one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY DEFINITELY SHOULD'VE WON!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this CD and i think everyone in america should own a copy (or maybe 2)!Me and my friends have been behind clay since the beginning (well almost the beginning) and were so excited when he got back on in the wild card show. I was so excited when this CD came out. I love every song on this CD and listen to it 24/7 (more like 25/8)! This is by far the best CD i've bought in years. It was worth every penny. I cant wait for clays next CD! People of all ages can enjoy clay's music. Some of my favorites are Invisible, I will carry you, the way, when you say you love me, no more sad songs, run to me, shine, i survived you, this is the night, perfect day, measure of a man, and touch. Oh wait, thats all of them. I guess that's just one more reason to buy this CD. Oh and one more thing. Don't get me wrong, Rubens a great singer, but CLAY IS #1!!!... GO CLAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man Measures Up","review":"This musical offering was a superb display of Clay's versatility and powerful range. I keep changing my mind on which song is my favourite. I find myself humming bits of each song when I am alone or walking along the beach. My only regret is that it may take some time before a second album is released and I am already anxiously awaiting that event and will definitely pre-order. Measure of a Man is my all-time favourite cd to listen to and I'm 49 years old so I've listened to a few!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great First Album","review":"Dear Amazonians,I think Clay Aiken is a strong addition to the popular music scene. The combination of his youthful good looks and agile voice make for a great pop musician.On a technical note though, and the reason for my four-star rating, during the song \\"When You Say You Love Me,\\" we can hear Clay clear his voice at the two minute and forty-three second mark (2:43 on your CD player). This is a minor technicality though that I am sure Clay will overcome with his future releases. All-in-all, I think Clay Aiken is a very talented artist who will only improve with time.Go Clay!Take care,--Daniel"},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL American Idol!","review":"I knew this CD would be awesome before I got it but I was totally blown away! I can't even describe it. Clay's voice is totally amazing. I would reccomend this CD to everyone...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is...The Measure of a Man","review":"I have waited patiently for this CD to come out and I have not been disappointed at all. Every song on this CD is awesome. Clay is truly an amazing singer with soul and compassion flowing through his voice. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this CD. Now I can't wait for Clay to go on tour across America. America has voted, through the record sales, who the real American Idol should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST VOICE EVER!!","review":"This is the best music cd I have ever heard. His voice is the most amazing thing. I find myself comparing everyone that sings to him and he wins hands down. I would recommend this to anyone who followed the american idol 2nd season and heard Clay sing. You will not be disappointed!! In my 40 years, I can easily say, Clay Aiken is the greatest singer ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC Makes Sense","review":"I haven't had a CD that I haven't skipped tracks. Even if it's the best of. Clay Aiken had come up with BEST of CLAY on HiS FIRST RELEASE. It's combination of not just pop songs but mix of danceable tunes(Invisible), Country (Perfect Day), Oldies (I Will Carry You), Rock Ripped (No More Sad Songs), Sexy (Touch), Edgy and heart twisting(I Survived You). There is a story in every tract and Artist let's you be a part of that Journey. Fans and Avid Music Listener would not be disappointed. Why are you still reading.. GO BUY ONE and HEAR for YOURSELF."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEASURING UP!","review":"Clay's debut album is amazing. Every track is very good listening. There are fast, slow and mid tempo songs.

Just hearing this CD is uplifting. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"I knew this would be great. He has such an awesome voice. He can make any song great. This is the best cd I have purchased in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the CD....... I play it over and over again!!","review":"I absolutely love Clay's CD. I really like every song on the CD. When I got Kelly Clarkson's cd I skiped over a few songs. A few of the songs took some getting used to, but with Measure of a Man I wanted to listen to every song in it's entirety. It is so nice not to have to worry about the lyrics of the songs that my children listen to.They are 12 and 9 and they enjoy the cd as much as I do. It's about time someone has come out with some nice clean music that is in my opinion EXCELLENT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait!","review":"Clay sounds better than ever! I should buy another one for the car I can't stop listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"I followed Clay Aiken through the Am. Idlol 2 competition. His voice just completely blew me away! And it still does today! His Measure of a Man is a wonderful buy for anyone. There are songs on here that will touch your heart and some that will make you want to sing and/or dance. The one called \\"The Way\\" is so beautiful -- and Measure of a Man -- wonderful. I bought 2 CD's already and have requests for more for Christmas gifts. A great buy. You won't go wrong with purchasing Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken!My opinion is that the Amazon editor has missed a call on this one. It's a beautiful CD.And I can't wait for his new single to be released with Invisible & Solitaire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful CD from an Extraordinary Performer!","review":"I was anxiously awaiting Clay's CD and bought it in pre-sale. After hearing it for the first time, I bought several more copies for loved ones! Clay is amazing and the CD is absolutely wonderful! Devoted Clay fans will be extremely proud, and others will be impressed by the range of this album. I saw a review that stated it was wonderful vanilla -- but I say it's full of rich flavors. I can honestly say that every song is good, and most are ideal showcases for Clay's amazing vocal instrument. I will surely wear out both CDs I'm keeping for my own use! Thank you, Clay and RCA, for this wonderful CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"Each time I listen to the CD I find new things in the words and the music that pull me in. I purchased this CD on the 15th of October and have listened to it exclusively while in the car since. I will be playing this CD for along time to come.Clays voice is so refreshing and clear that all the songs come across with passion and strength. I would liked to have heard more of the same songs we fell in love with when listening to him on American Idol. Less pop and background singers..Just Clay and his strong voice and range to listen to. A Christmas special CD of all the old Christmas songs we grew up with would be a Classic and show off his fantastic voice. A special on TV for the Holidays with Clay Aiken singing Christmas tunes would be great also.I am already looking forward the next 10 or 20 CDS to come out in the future. He is now my favorite male vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"It's AMAZING how horrible this CD is. The truth needs to be told, and the other reviews for this CD up to this point are very misleading. Clay has talent for sure. It takes talent to dupe all of America into thinking you have a wonderful voice. Clay, I love you, you're my homey, but for God's sake.. stop making music. Or at least release it independently so we don't have to see and hear this CD everywhere we go. The first two tracks are disappointing. Three and four are boring, and the rest are just plain gut-wrenchingly awful. I'm sorry for all you Clay fans out there that will have problems with what I'm saying but please be honest with yourselves and boycott Aiken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the songs. They do not compliment Clay's voice.","review":"Sorry. This CD was a great disappointment. The songs are terrible. These songs are not meant for Clay's voice. He needs to sing better songs than whats on this Cd. Where's the power of Clay's voice. He needs to pick his songs carefully in the future. Very disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed....","review":"Clay has a fantastic voice. There is NO doubt about that, but the music seems forced and contrived. Maybe if I listen more I may learn to like it, but for now, I'm disappointed in the effort, not Clay's voice, the production..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clays Measure of A Man DOES MEASURE UP!","review":"Its evident after hearing the first few tracks that this is one man that will have a long lasting pop career. Think Barry Manilow (who Clay somewhat resembles) and Neil Diamond (sorry kids if you haven't heard of these guys ask your parents)Clay sings from the heart and you FEEL his music as you are listening to it. He may have been ripped off of the American Idol title, but he now has a certified NUMBER ONE in this CD which will be a huge seller. Eat your FAT heart out Ruben! In 6 months you will be all but forgotten. CLAY gets an A+++ for this work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of couse he's number one!","review":"Most Clay fans are buying from 2 - 10 copieseach to help boost his sells!

Yeah,he's number one all right!A one star rating!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little something for everyone","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD other than a great voice. What I got was that and a great mixture of ballads, mid-tempo songs and songs filled with angst and love. There is something for everyone on this album. Don't listen to reviews that say it is too vanilla or lacks even a hint of sexual innuendo. Listen to the song Touch and hear the sexy longing in the voice and the words. The only thing better than listening to this album would be to see it performed live."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD","review":"CLAY AIKEN IN MY OPINION IS THE AMERICAN IDOL. Clay is an awesome singer. He has proven that with his new CD. His songs are awesome. No matter what anyone say's Clay has an amazing vocal range. Clay you will go far.

There's not a single song on this CD that I would consider bland. Billboard said it was THE BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003, and I agree. This is a terrific debut CD. Clay takes every song to another level. He makes it look so easy.I would ignore the reviews that insult his looks, his fans, and his songs. They're all wrong. They're all insecure. They're all jealous. Aiken's got game!!! A lot of it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of Frisco","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you....Jack Wagner reincarnated. Or is it Michael Bolton? Either way, this sound should have died with the 80's. For those who claim Clay is a boy band extension, may I respectfully say: PUH-LEEZE! The kid has a nice voice, but this is not pop music. This is your mom's Kenny G with vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sad when \\"Invisible\\" is the best song...","review":"Wow, this is one of the worst CDs I've listened to all year long. Clay has talent, but I don't understand how someone could care so little about the music they're putting out. Cliched, soulless, derivative schlock. Doesn't he have even a little artistic integrity? Everyone involved with this album should be embarrassed.Oh well, I'm sure his fans will eat up anything he produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash Anyone??","review":"Clay is the right name for this boy because he has been shaped and molded all the way. And Aiken well that just describes how my ears feel after sampling this trash. I got this CD for my 13 year old girl for her birthday and it has to be the most over produced cleaned up lifeless bile I have heard since the first New Kids and New Edition cuts way back when.This whole CD sounds like somebody swept up the left-overs from every \\"Boy-Band\\" that came before and tried to patch it together with some cohesiveness. An absolute joke.That this has sold over 2 million is is ridiculous..but than again the very idea that C-rap has become recognized as a a form of actual music ain't saying much either.The success of this fellow has nothing to do with the \\"Measure of a man\\" but rather the \\"measure\\" of tolerance to rehashed garbage and \\"Measure\\" of outright ignorance to real music that the public has today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay's been stripped of his \\"soul\\"","review":"There is no evidence of Clay's soul in this collection of songs, which was such a part of his performances on American Idol. This recording is a \\"paint-by-numbers\\" pop CD that is utterly boring and a huge disappointment. Clay has been stripped of his \\"soul\\" in this CD. His talents are completely lost on this endeavor and he is capable of truly fantastic performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic","review":"Every song in the album is wonderful and he has such a beautiful voice. I never tire of listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in California","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what.................. he wont be big","review":"ok clay has a good vocie but come on hes ugly in the songs are the same'ol pop songs just think of him as another ruben good vocie but to ugly but one thing ruben can sing better in is a real singer with good song but clay sucks big time he wont be big so trust me on this one i know music in i know when i say this cd ant worth it dont buy it ant worth the money theres not even one good song on this cd this whole cd sucks so DONT BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bland","review":"I am a big fan of pop music among other genres but this album lacks a personality. Sort of like being stuck in a time warp and transported back to the late 90s. The songs just seem to blend together. It also appears as if Mr. Aiken is not too invested in his on product, he seems very detached from the songs.I also found the album overproduced. It lacks oomph and edge, in other words, I found it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!!!!!!!","review":"Clay Aiken does it again! This is a great CD and recommend it to any one with ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Listening","review":"I have never bought a CD where I lovedevery track. Keep changing my mind onfavorites. My Way should be a lovesong that is around for years. Givesme chills and makes me want to fall inlove. When You Say You Love me makesme dance. Listening to Measure of aMan I think these words should touchyour soul. Finally a singer singingsongs of love and longing without beingvulgar. Clay you should be proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT..LOVE IT","review":"Mr. Aiken's AMAZING VOICE and the beautifully written SONGS make this a MUST HAVE CD for everyone...There is a little bit of everything on this CD from upbeat love songs to moving ballads...Clay's voice really shines on \\"I WILL CARRY YOU\\", \\"INVISIBLE\\" and \\"TOUCH\\" have great upbeat tempos, \\"RUN TO ME\\" and \\"NO MORE SAD SONG\\" prove CLAY can really rock, and you just can't help but sing along to \\"WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME\\" which is my FAVORITE song on the CD... I recommend you BUY THIS CD TODAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Although the actual instrumental engineering leaves a bit to be desired with heavy-handed drum beats that at times over-shadow the singer. Overall, Mr. Aiken leaves you aching for more with this CD. His powerful pop ballads are chock full of interesting and stunning vocal creativity and even the weakest of the songs; he manages to pull off as only Mr. Aiken can do. If this \`rushed and hurried' CD by previous management group 19 sounds this good and is selling in the triple millions, I can't wait to hear what Clay's NEW MANAGEMENT team has in store for the upcoming year!!!Favorites: Measure of A Man, Perfect Day and Shine and Solitaire is the srtongest vocally by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is nothing short of a pure phemonenon!!!","review":"I have to say that I have been a little less enthused about music in the past 5 years. However, for the first time in years I am just blown away by the EXTREME talent of Clay Aiken. I have never heard anything quite so beautiful, than his voice, in all of my life. I love EVERY song on this CD. I got this CD when it first came out and I can not stop listening to it. From the second I get in my car until I get out, that CD is blasting in my car!! The enthusiasm that I have for this talented man's music is indescribable. I feel like a teenager again because his music makes me scream with absolute joy. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone because the intensity and electricity that exudes from his voice is miraculous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Voice, A Good Man","review":"This is THE CD to give for all Christmas gifts! Not only does Clay have an amazing voice, he is truly a good person who wants to help people.

In order, my favorites are: Touch, Measure of A Man, No More Sad Songs, I Will Survive You and Invisible. In my opinion, these showcase his voice the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't help it; I liked this CD.","review":"First of all, I would not have bought this CD if it were recorded by any one other than Clay Aiken.I like the guy; I think he's the \\"real deal\\".I actually like the song Invisible more than I thought I would.It is very catchy and I find myself singing it long after I've turned it off.I don't find most of the other songs to be outstanding or even greatly original. I do however enjoy Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs. Clearly Clay had a hand in choosing some of these tunes as the lyrics reflect on Clay's own professed religious and spiritual beliefs. Most of the songs allow Clay to showcase his beautiful vocals.BR>I would love to hear him do Solitaire and to hear Bridge over Troubled Water again. I wish that those two cuts were on this CD.I am looking forward to hearing more from Clay; original music and covers that really show what he's got.I wish Clay all the success in the world and am happy to do my part to support his future in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"clay has done better","review":"I like clay. But I was not to thrill with this cd. Rueben seem to be more impressive"},{"rating":"2","title":"measure of a man","review":"This is a fabulous cd. I can listen to it over and over again. Clay is a special, wholesome, and extremely talented individual who's voice is definitely a gift from God!! Sorry he was robbed of being named \\"American Idol\\" #2's winner. He so deserved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is so special","review":"There is something very, very special about Clay. I get chills when I listen to him sing. I can't remember the last time anyone's voice made me feel like that. I just can't get enough of him. This cd is outstanding! I love all the songs. I especially like \\"I Survived You\\". I find it hard to get through the cd as I keep replaying each song. I do wish they would have put \\"Solitaire\\" on this cd, but maybe the next one. I'd also love to see Neil Sedaka write and produce the next one. Clay, you're awesome, the cd is awesome! We love you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE CLAY!!!!","review":"I deffinitly love clay! And the album is pretty good. Well, CLay is wonderful but i am a little dissapointed at the way they tone down his voice. Plus, I am not a huge pop fan. But, I still get chills listening to this album. I hope someday he writes his own music and makes an album that is truly his. I think that would be the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The majority of the songs on this album are very poorly written; borderline cheesy.Although Clay's voice has improved even further since winning runner up on American Idol, these songs do not do his voice justice.\\"Invisible\\" is the strongest song on the album and is very catchy, but the album just nose dives after the 1st song.Being a huge fan of American Idol, I am extremely disappointed in Clay's debut album. His sales may end up being higher than Kelly Clarkson's or Justin Guarini's, but out of the 3, I'd have to say that Kelly is still American Idol's golden child.I'll pass Clay's cd onto someone else and keep Kelly's in my cd player. Too bad that Clay didn't receive the same quality of songs as Kelly did. Now I can only cross my fingers and hope that Ruben & Tamyra will not have an album full of poorly written songs like Clay and Justin have."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the music industry fears most!!!!","review":"A clean cut album from a TRUE clean cut artist.You can listen to this cd with anyone and not fear the messages like today's music.Each song can fit a person's past or feelings so well. Most of us have endured the hardships, love, and blessings that this young man sings of.Do not be fooled by the bad reviews by the industry paid critics and reviewers. They say this cd is bad because the industry fears Clay and his fans.The music industry says we all want to hear hip hop - rap - sex - infidelity messages. LOL GUESS WHAT??Listen up record producers. If this was true, tell me why Clay Aiken is the hottest thing in MUSIC today, period???His music is outselling ANYTHING put out by 95% of the so called stars today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man Measures Up","review":"I love Clay Aiken, and yes, I could probably listen to him sing the phone book. BUT, this album is truly fantastic, IMO. My favorite song changes daily, even hourly, and I love every track on the CD!! I can't remember this happening since Carole King's Tapestry, umpteen years ago! I love romantic, sing-along-able songs and this CD is loaded with them. Not enough edge, some critics are grousing?? Hey, there's more nerve-grating edge than I can bear in today's music world; give me more, more, more of this kind of music, and I'll buy as much as I can possibly afford, for myself and for gift-giving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I add more stars please?","review":"I would have to to even come close to what I feel is the best CD out this year. It's not filled with foul language, sexual innuendos, and you can actually understand the lyrics!!! What a concept!!! Clay's voice and emotion come through crystal clear on each and every track. While I've been a Clay fan since his Atlanta audition, I know people who weren't and they have listened to the CD and are now convinced. No matter what perception you may have about Clay, the man can sing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing CD","review":"It is such a welcome to be able to purchase a CD that not only is such a pleasure to listen to, but am able to understand EVERY word of each song. I do not buy many CD's today, as most of the music is just loud, unintelligible noises that all sound the same. This CD is such a \\"breath of fresh air\\" and also \\"no sex\\", but is still such a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"Clay is simply amazing! His powerful, crystal clear voice is shown on all cuts; I have never listened to a CD where I have liked every single track on it. My favorite song keeps changing daily. This CD is every bit worth the money to buy it and more. No wonder it sold double platinum."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"I love his voice. Clay always takes me there. I love every song and I can't wait for his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about. In my opinion Clay Aiken is a little overrated. He does have a powerful voice; however, the CD is mostly ballads and all of the songs sound basically the same, with the exception of Invisible which is a little creepy since it seems to be about a stalker. If you like ballads I would stick with Josh Groban."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn!","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"*1/2 stars","review":"I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as \\"Invisible\\", although some of the lyrics are weird (\\"if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room\\"), \\"No More Sad Songs\\", and the chorus to \\"I survived you\\". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle of the Road","review":"Invisible is the only song on this cd that is any good,my wife loves Clay,but I always tell her he won\`t be around long and neither will American Idol.as far as easy listening goes it is pleasing enough but don\`t look for any rock n roll here."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS ATROCIOUS!","review":"my God! this actually gets zero stars!!! how can anyone listen to this schlock?!?! clay aiken sounds exactly like the backstreet crossed with whitney houston. a CD full of sorry sounding pop hooks and soppy balladry is just absolutely aweful! if you want some good pop hooks and ballads, then get simon and garfunkle instead. and if you feel like some soppy balladry then get david bowie's \\"hunky dory\\"...just make sure you pass on this true piece of crap of an album...seriously, this sucks really really bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this be worse?","review":"Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total shock","review":"Don't belive the hype. 2 good tracks, one being the single Bridge Over Troubled Water. He is so talented but this cd is baaad. What happened? I loved him on the show, but the song choices are lame to say the least. Maybe the next one will be better. Better to burn than to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Material on this CD is below par!","review":"I was very disappointed in this first CD from Clay. There is still nothing wrong with his voice, which I admired from the beginning of his appearance on American Idol. But the songs on this effort are rather ordinary, if not downright boring. I would have enjoyed more covers of older or modern standards, such as the effort he made on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\". He deserves better management!! His voice talent deserves a far better team behind it. I hope future outings have material up to his capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!","review":"Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average \\"broadway musical\\" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having watched Clay really get deep in his singing on American Idol, I expected much more from him than he delivers on this CD. The arrangements are weak, his singing is shallow, and the songs all sound the same. For a person of such depth and range in his songs, this is a very poor compilation. I am vastly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"In watching Clay on TV, I was in hopes of great things from him in his first CD. It was VERY vanilla! Nothing spectacular...or stretching. I think he played it safe and I was hoping it sounded a bit better. I won't purchase it. I borrowed the CD from a friend and decided not to buy it. I think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"American idle is more like it...","review":"Clay Aiken has to be one of the worst singers ever to come off of American Idol. The songs on his debut CD are all predictible and sleep-inducing. Even William Hung is capable of making a better CD than this drab garbage. With boring singles like \\"Invisible\\" and \\"The Way,\\" I can't understand how Americans could make this guy a star. Please, Clay, if you insist on making more music, at least have the decency of doing a nice gay anthem like \\"I Will Survive\\" or \\"YMCA.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man cd","review":"I happen to love Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken! His voice is just so pure and just a pleasure to listen to!All the songs have a meaning to them that anyone listening could find something to fit their lives!I listen to this cd daily, that is why I have to have multible copies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next Steve Perry","review":"When I first heard this album with my headphones I went straight to \\"This is the Night\\" then \\"Measure of a Man\\". I love both of them. I played them a couple of times at a level I don't think alot of people would prefer. But it sounds outstanding with the music INIDE your head. I then played the rest of the album and was not surprised to hear that ALL of the performances were just as great. I'm telling you, Clay Aiken knows just when to deliver the knockout punch in any song he sings. I believe his vocal strength matches up with former Journey lead singer Steve Perry. I can hear Clay singing the songs, \\"Still They Ride\\", \\"Lights\\" or \\"Too Late\\". The man definately knows his craft. It's no wonder his album is already \\"DOUBLE PLATINUM\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"DHGM","review":"CLAY IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN YEARS. I just love his voice. It's clear and he sings soooooooo well. Love his album. I'm sooooooooo happy he sold over 600,000 in a week. Wish him the best in the future. I excited for him to do another album in the future. His voice is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Clay's voice & talent but NOT this CD.","review":"All the cuts are so similar and so boring. There is very little passion, emotion, or personality in this CD. Honestly, next time I am out of town in a hotel, I'm leaving it for the maid.I loved Clay on American Idol. I wish he'd done the CD with \\"Solitaire\\", \\"Buttercup\\" and others from the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointed debut album","review":"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I feel that with Clay's incredible range, he can do far better. This CD is too unimaginative and bland. I'm returning mine unopened. Sorry, Clay, better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Clay all the way","review":"I have been following Clay from the beginning and when I heard his song Invisible at the concert I could not waite for the CD to come out. Well it is finally here and I love it. He could sing the Gold Fish song and I would still love it. I think he has that Frank Sinatra make your heart melt voice. The writers need to get moving and write him some really great songs. If you like Clay you will LOVE this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid debut effort from the \\"skinny white boy\\".","review":"Don't take offense at the title, Clay Aiken called himself that in his first audition for American Idol. That was also when I first noticed his amazing voice.His debut album is full of catchy pop tunes. My favorite tracks are \\"the Way\\" (lovely ballad) and \\"Measure of a Man\\". My main quibble with the CD are the preponderance of 'love' songs. I realize that Aiken has quite a female following, but I like to hear songs about other subjects. After a while, the lyrics begin to sound the same. I'm a melody freak though, so I don't place as much emphasis on lyrical content. How many ways can one sing \\"baby\\"? It's a good first effort and I look forward to more variety from Aiken in the future. His beautiful voice deserves only the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Clay Aiken is going places noone has been in a long, long time. What a talent! What a voice! What a role model to today's youth.... thanks Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken Roxs!","review":"I am a big fan of Clay and once again I say the producers of American Idol made a big mistake...Clays single was great but this is 100 times better....defientley one of the best CD's of 2003! Every Track is great..My Fav's: Every Track!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD-the guy who gave only 1 star must be a retard","review":"This CD is really great. I enjoy listening to every single song every day. Clay's single was great and his album is even better. Keep up the good work Clay!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Obviously people voted for Clay Aiken based his incredible covers of good songs during the competition, and a teenager wouldn't have been too familiar with alot of those songs because they we're often classic oldies. But for some reason they have decided to make him put out this cd full of the kind of songs that teenagers will probably go for and is nothing like what he had sung to win votes and gain the oppurtunity to make this cd in the first place. So I lost out and I can't understand why they did that. I just hope his next cd has a wider musical range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing debut from a very talented young man","review":"I agree with the other reviews that Clay Aiken has one of the most beautiful voices in music today. But I am disappointed in his new album. He has been interviewed many times saying \\"I sing from my heart about things that move me,\\" yet, it seems as if every song sounds the same. I blame this on poor writing on and not on the vocalist himself. I am a HUGE Clay supporter and rooted for him throughout the entire American Idol competition, but I must say, this album does nothing for me. After hearing \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" I was expecting to be really WOWED by his debut album... I am bummed out this one didn't stack up to his single. I am surprised there are so many people impressed by this CD... I can't help but wonder what song I'm listening to when every track sounds like the same ol' same ol' to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment for a HUGE Clay fan!","review":"I was a HUGE Clay fanatic throughout all the AI hype. I fell in love with his voice and his personality and dashing good looks. However, this CD disappointed me. The voice that I fell in love with was his \\"live\\" voice, and I don't like his \\"studio\\" voice very much. I like 2 or 3 of the songs on the cd, but it makes me sad to give it a bad review, because I was looking forward to this cd since May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, great songs, no direction","review":"Finally the American Idol 2 after-race is over. Clay has made it to the finish. So, what does his new album has to give his fans? Good music, good vocals, but no overal direction. Sometimes a listener may be wondering if this is just a vocal exercise, to show range and vocal abilities of Clay. In the words of Simon -- \\"So what?\\".Neverthelss, I went out and bought the album and don't regret it. I am sure that you will neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy","review":"Clay is sooooooooooooo delicious. Everytime I listen to this masterpiece I like it even more!

Her physical beauty, her wonderful personality, her amazing voice, the awesome lyrics in her songs....and I could go on and on.But Clay Aiken is giving her a run for her money in all those areas !! His CD is 'Simply The Best' I've heard in a very long time.I have listened to it over and over trying to determine which one of the songs is my favourite. But I can't narrow it down...I LOVE all of them.I now have to go out and buy another copy for my car so that I can listen to it while driving as well.The CD is:C......Captivating !L......Lively !A......Awesome !Y......Yummy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Home Run for Clay","review":"When I first heard the CD I was surprised because it was not what I expected. As I listened to the songs I realized it was great stuff---a different style of music that shows he can do anything. As I read the other reviews I'm surprised at how many people, like me, were searching for music whose lyrics could be understood and which had meaning. For too long Pop Music has been filled with profanity and violence. As for \\"teenie boppers\\" and \\"Grannies\\"----Clay's fan numbers speak for themselves---We have the power now. Go Clay!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first CD. Well Done.","review":"I have been looking forward to this CD for a while and now that I have it, I am certainly not disappointed.

I am pleasantly surprised because Clay sounds like...Clay. But he also sounds like a genuine pop star and puts his magnificant voice to good work here. The Way is sensual and beautiful. Perfect Day is uplifting, and Measure of a Man sums up Clay to a tee. A great freshman effort here and I cant wait for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"The more I listen to Clay's new CD the better I like it. He has a beautiful voice and I could listen to it all day. You can understand the words as he sings them which is not the case for alot of other singers. I hope he continues to sing and make more CDs but most of all I hope he finishes his education."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOAM is Wonderful","review":"Mr. Aiken has a phenomenal voice. There is no \\"skippable\\" song on this CD at all--they are all spectacular. My wife and I both love the CD and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD!!!","review":"This CD is wonderful for every member of the family to listen to--together! Clay has done a beautiful job incorporating that beautiful voice with some beautiful lyrics and taking us into his world. It's wonderful that he can make an album that all ages can listen to without parents having to censor bad language, etc. The best way to listen to this album is to go into a totally dark room, lay down on the couch or bed with headphones on. What a personal experiences, listening to this glorious voice! I already own 4 copies and plan to buy more for Christmas presents this year. The Lord has truly blessed this wonderful man. THIS CD IS A MUST-HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing!!!!","review":"Measure of a Man is an incredible debut album from this exciting new talent. From the haunting title song to the romantic ballad The Way, the songs on the CD showcase the powerful vocals and beautiful lyrics that this \\"Idol\\" shows us in his every performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"electrifying\\" Clay, but \\"electrified\\" Clay","review":"The most enduring criticism of \\"commercial pop\\" music is that by the time the producers get done with their electronica and multiple tracking, the singer gets lost in the shuffle. Such is the case here. The Clay Aiken with the dazzling talent and soaring high notes that we loved on American Idol is buried in a sea of \\"production\\" so that the album becomes another of so many that literally \\"anybody\\" could have sung. I guess we'll have to wait until he's proven he can sell enough \\"commercial mainstream\\" to take the \\"risk\\" of a \\"Broadway\\" album, or to sing the the hard-to-sing oldies that he became famous for on AI.Love ya Clay, just not this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Clay's vocal range..","review":"Some other reviewer posted that people are saying negative things or critiquing his album just due to CNN's comments. Clay is not perfect nor is his record company but it is a great album and I find myself going to back to the orginal A I tapes I have just to hear him sing out the songs like \\"Everlasting Love\\" and \\"BOTW\\" to hear that amazing range. Thats all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to be Kidding","review":"For all those who compare Ruben and Clay, there is no comparison. Ruben won b/c he is a true talent. While Clay had to be \\"made over\\", Ruben is still Ruben. I listened to Clay's first 5 songs and had to turn it off. While he can sing other peoples songs well he cannot hold a tune to his own album. I was extremely disappointed, and would not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Give me a break. I do not see what all the fuss is about. I listened to this CD and although Clay sings well, the songs are boring ballads and they all sound the same. I agree with all the negative reviews from the media. This album is nothing to get excited about and I sure wouldn't waste my money on it.

Each song is painstakingly boring and just used as a vehicle for her to try and recapture the Idol glory days. If only this disc really were \\"Invisible,\\" then we'd all be a lot happier. The only thing more excrutiatingly bad than this is the fear that soon we will have Reuben Chubs dropping his CD.

This CD reminds me why I stopped listening to top 40 radio 10 years ago. \\"Measure of a Man\\" is proof that you can put nothing in a box, wrap it in pretty teenybopper wrapping, call it \\"great\\" and people will come running to buy it. Look, this nondescript, manufactured creature's CD has generated over 2000 reviews so far. Wow, alot of fools are buying this nonsense.YOU ARE SLAVES, WAKE UP!Every Brittany (Her initials are \\"B.S.\\" How obvious can you get?), Christina and Clay CD that you purchase pushes REAL music further and further out of the public's reach. Start reversing this trend by not purchasing this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANILOW \\"WANNABE\\"","review":"Okay, Clay Aiken may be a dork in person, but the fact of the matter is he won runner up in American Idol and can sing, and that's about it.When I saw him on American Idol, I was disgusted! Clay sings cheesy awful ballads that make you want to hit the \\"mute\\" button on your remote. What's even more disgusting is his God-awful wardrobe! The fact that so many teenage girls out there are so in love with Clay makes me want to vomit!!! This music is for nerds only! GET REAL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cd up for trash","review":"tried to listen to it again to give it a chance. still it sounded as disgusting as the first try.my only advice to Clay now is to make sure he completes his college degree soonest cos he may be back sooner teaching than he expects.i also wish him all the luck in his future endeavors.i know he has already lost several fans who can tell good music from bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, WOW, WOW","review":"beautiful, heartfelt, and the best voice in the world...this cd is absolutly amazing and your right 5 starts is far from enough..clay aiken, he finally came along and showed everyone what real music and talent is about.Im so glad that i can listen to his music, and its not like the junk you hear on the radio from people who cant sing.BEAUTIFUL there no other words to explain it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm mesmerized by each and every song!!!","review":"I have already listened to Clay's new CD 4 times today.

Because Clay is \\"cute\\"? Because he won a national karaoke search and everybody feels they must buy this because the media hyped it up so much? Because a bunch of writers and music producers (including Simon Cowell!)rushed him into the studio to sing over a bunch of generic songs written before he even appeared on TV? Or because he has a good voice? Do people who buy this kind of drivel EVER care about the music underneath it all?? Or the fact that this guy basically had nothing to do with the production or writing of this lame material? Have you actually listened to these laughable lyrics? DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MANY GREAT ARTISTS YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON BECAUSE YOU THINK THIS GUY IS CUTE AND HAS A NICE VOICE???"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE THE VOICE FOR BROADWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Clay Aiken's album is an absolute joke. The songs on this album are so lame and so cliche. I mean just look the first single \\"Invisible.\\" Usually labels put out their best song on the album first and \\"Invisible\\" is what they came up with? Give me a break. This song has no lasting airplay capabilities. Also, if this cd was the greatest ever, why don't they let you listen to the songs on the album on this site. The other albums that I've viewed on this site have the song available to listen to. That's because it suckssssssssssssssssssssss and they know it does. If people were able to listen beforehand, they wouldn't buy this horrible cd. One more thing what kind of title is \\"Measure of Man.\\" Barf!!!! Save your money people, please!!! The one star is for pitty, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 1st attempt","review":"With this being his first attempt It is very good for a new commer.

Granted, he is one of those performers who come across VERY well in concert. You will have the opportunity to skip from Invisible, to The Way, to Touch, to Run to Me, to I Survived You,....the list is endless and if you don't have the opportunity to make a concert....here it is!!! I like this CD because I can let it play all the way through and still be reliving the concert I was just at!!!! Sometimes (as most of his fans know), this is the FIX that gets us through the day. I defy you to go to one of his concerts and not come back wishing and wanting more!!! If you don't believe me, fine, don't buy this CD. He will stand the test of time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!!!!!","review":"I am a big Clay fan !!!! I traveled over 1000 miles to see him at Memphis and I was at the Charlotte concert.

He is a true American Idol!!! Keep up the good work CLAY!!! LOVE YOU DEARLY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"I really didn't like Clay on American Idol, I was a Ruben fan but this album is a good solid pop album. It has good catchy songs. My favorite tracks are \\"No More Sad Songs,\\" \\"I Survived You,\\" \\"This Is The Night,\\" \\"Perfect Day,\\" and of course \\"Touch.\\" Even if you are 205 all the way, you should still check this CD out! It is remarkably good and Clay has a great voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pop album of 2003...Billboard says so and I agree!","review":"Billboard Magazine has said this about 'Measure of a Man'...\\"Clay Aiken's \\"Measure of a Man\\" is the best pop album of 2003. Every song, every note is brimming with ambition and glory\\". have to agree with them! The songs on this album display emotions that many have experienced...the hopelessness of unrequited love in 'Invisible', the hurt and bitterness of a broken relationship in 'I Survived You', and the euphoria of new love in 'Perfect Day'. If this is just Clay Aiken's debut album, I can't wait to see what comes next because it will be hard to top this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I was so pleased with this CD when I listened to it.

This is the best CD I have ever heard, and I am 16 so i have heard a lot of different music. But ever since I saw Clay on American Idol, I fell inlove with him.

Ugh save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUNNER UP","review":"CLAY IS IN 2ND FOR A REASON. HIS PERFORMANCE DURING LAST NIGHT BILLBOARD AWARDS WAS SOOOO BAD, I DON'T THINK HE EVEN KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. CLAY IS STRICTLY POP. RUBEN IS SOULFUL.

Put the lousy production of this album aside, he sings worse than an amateur. His voice is sonorous, but the only thing he's good at is to show it, without any feelings whatsoever. Analogy: a fish that doesn't know how to use its fins to swim."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album proves he is a runnerup","review":"This Album is terrible. He took no chances. Forget the hype and this album. I wish the old napster was in business to save me from buying this album.

Go Reuben - NO Clay"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, So he's got a good voice......","review":".....Big freakin' deal!!! It doesn't make up for how much the music stinks!If you are reading this right now, that means you are probably pondering whether to buy this junk. And that makes you an idiot. How can you support something like this? This comes from a really bad TV show that is not even watchable unless your brains are mashed potatoes!Neil Young said it best when asked what he thought of Clay Aiken and the whole American Idol thing: \\"Well, he ain't Jerry Garcia.\\" Exactly. Jerry actually had heart and put emotion into his music.Do yourself a favor and go listen to some real music, not this goober completely butchering The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Disappointing","review":"A great voice impeded by dreadful songs, most written by a committee (it seems) and humdrum orchestration. Clay, please listen to GREAT songs by the master songwriters -- Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, so many others. You have the voice. Please find the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH, yuck!","review":"Not a very good album. Many of the songs put me to sleep half the time, and were just down right boring. In my opinion, Darren Hayes is much more interesting compared to Clay. If you want a good CD get something else, this one isnt worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to Broadway, please!!!","review":"While Clay Aiken does have an amazing talent for singing, he's album better suites middle-aged America instead of a younger, more \\"poppy\\" audience. I get irritated seeing people compare Ruben and Clay. They are in two totally different genres!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Extended, Boring Song","review":"Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTED AGAIN!","review":"Thank you Clay. What an absolutely brilliant CD. I absolutely love this CD and I honestly believe these songs were written just for him. It is a little hard to finish it though because everytime a song comes on I have to replay it so it takes me twice as long to finish it. This is a must have. I can not wait to see his video. This CD is worth every single penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when music used to mean something?","review":"I do.Now it is dictated, in part, by a whiny, COMPLETELY sub-par, snot nosed walking bag of talentless junk who only has a record because a bunch of people on Fox's lowest common denominator TV show.And the album is really bad, at that. It'll be really popular at dentists offices. Please, PLEASE, use your hard earned money to support real artists. I BEG of you. This is pop culture at it's most vapid. The tool didn't even win. Just because he can sing doesn't mean he has a personality, or creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay is too subdued","review":"I was so disappointed in this album after hearing Clay's beautiful voice on American Idol. It's like the producers were trying to force Clay into some pop mold. I kept listening waiting for Clay to really let one loose and belt out a song. Didn't happen. Maybe the next album Clay can be Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woohooo Bland Ballads","review":"Clay has a horrible voice (sorry obsessed Claymates,it's true) and this cd proves it. All the songs are generic and unoriginal, he brings nothing new to the music industry. His voice is so irritating and grating. A year from now (or not even) he will be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Clay knocked my socks off on American Idol, and I will always believe that he should have won. His interpretations of familiar pop tunes and standards were awesome. That's why the CD was disappointing. Comprised of unfamiliar tunes, and without his exciting stage presence, this CD is completely unremarkable. I'm sure it was popular with the teenyboppers (the CD includes a mini-poster), but his fan base is much, much broader. Clay, if you're reading, we'd like to hear more of your unique interpretations of familiar music. Pick a decade, pick an era, pick a genre. You have the potential to be a icon and not just an idol, but it won't happen with stuff like this,"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD","review":"Mesmerizing vocals, meaningful songs, and outstanding pop music arrangements is what this CD is all about. I love Clay Aiken's singing!!! I love this CD, and you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATHTAKING CD! INSPIRATIONAL & PASSIONATE!","review":"All of this and more from a man who has the voice of an angel. Clay hits a homerun with songs that affect you in everyday life.

Biding my time to preorder your new Christmas CD which will be out in October!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much a review of the CD","review":"k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song \\"Invisible\\"- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room\\". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay should have won the title, not Ruben....","review":"Clay's CD is absolutely awesome!!! I've watched American Idol both seasons, 1 and 2, (on #1 Tamyra Gray should have won, not Kelly Clarkson) (and on #2 Clay should have one, not Ruben). Clay has the most wonderful voice and range...reminds me of Harry Connick Jr....the songs on \\"Measure of a Man\\" are wonderful, especially \\"Invisible\\", but really all of them are his own style and he's very humble about it. It went double Platinum and #1 on the Billboard charts...GO CLAY!!!! Keep your CD's coming, and that voice you have is a pure rarity. God has found our next Sinatra of THIS century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, Great album","review":"I was prepared to love this CD before it came out because I love to listen to Clay sing anything. It's one of the few CD's/albums I've ever heard that I don't want to skip any songs, and have several favorites that I think would also play well on the radio, if given the chance. I've heard other reviews of \\"too sappy\\", \\"vanilla\\", etc., but I don't see that. Just good songs (don't all songs have cliches?) catchy tunes, and of course, Clay's powerhouse voice, which always makes me smile. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is not Clay's fault. It's because on a couple songs, such as \\"Run to Me\\", the background music tends to drown out Clay's voice, and THAT'S what I want to hear. Other than that, I would tell everyone to buy this album and I would gush about it, and Clay as I always do when I get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"First CD Purchase in Years ...","review":"I am very conservative when shelling out $$$ for new CDs and decided that Clay Aiken's premier CD was worth buying new. Now I find myself playing it over and over again. Three of the tracks stand out for me (Measure of a Man, Run to Me,I Survived You). I like all of the others, though one track has weak music/lyrics in my opinion(still, Aiken does an admirable job it). One of the best reviews I heard of Clay Aiken, by one of the guest AI judges, is that when he sings a song, he makes it his own. Clay has a sound like no one else and this CD has not disappointed me. I look forward to enjoying this CD for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man--AMAZING--Worth the wait!","review":"Amazing! I waited outside Kmart this morning to buy this...with wet hair and no make up. :) I've been waiting impatiently for this release, and I'll be the first to say that it was worth the wait! A refreshing sound and a \\"reach out and touch you\\" feel. I especially enjoy the mix of classic \\"Clay type\\" ballads with some new and upbeat songs. I really like all of the tracks but the title track \\"Measure of a Man\\" is my favorite. Buy this...you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!!!","review":"If Im being completely honest, while I have been a HUGE clay fan since the beginning, I was a little skeptical about his first album because I couldnt imagine what type of \\"pop\\" songs he would be singing. Now that I have it, I cant listen to anything else! It never leaves my CD player! I love every song on it! Clay has an incredible voice and each of the songs is completely wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First impressions are deceiving.","review":"I really was looking forward to the release of this CD and must say was a little disappointed the first time I listened to it. I liked Invisible and This is the Night because they were familiar but was hoping for other songs Clay sang on American Idol. However, after listening to the CD several times, I can't decide which song is my favorite. I listen to it over and over at work. The thing that I find incredible is that I never get tired of listening to it like I do my other CDs. It gets better every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Voice!!!!","review":"Clay's amazing talent truly shines through. None of the songs on the CD could ever be performed by anyone else, that I can think of, and sound this fantastic. There definitely is something magical about him. Absolutely love This is the Night, The Way, Measure of a Man, and Run to Me. If you are not a fanatical fan of Clay's and are undecided about getting this CD, I would recommend it - this is the kind of CD that you can leave playing and not hear a bad track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!!","review":"I think this is truly a wonderful CD. My favorites are Invisible, The Way, Shine, Measure Of A Man, and Touch.Clay is simply amazing; I believe his voice is truly amazing. But I also believe we have not heard the best that Clay could be. I agree that the songs on this album do not necessarily do Clay justice. Irregardless, I am loving this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing performance, substandard songs","review":"During the run of \\"American Idol,\\" I was just like most of you--riveted to the show week after week because of Clay Aiken's astonishing voice. On the show, he sang and excelled in a variety of musical genres. However, on \\"Measure of a Man,\\" the producers have done Clay a disservice by giving him only mediocre ballads to sing. I kept hoping for at least one uptempo song--or funky song--or even funny song, to display Clay's amazing range and playful personality. I guess I'll have to wait for a concert DVD to get a full-fledged dose of Clay to rival his AI performances, because this CD doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Did Clay Go ?","review":"Well I bought the record. I have been for Clay all the time but the record is not for playing a second time, and not because of Clays voice, but the material used. Where did the belting of the songs go, and the class of his defining of the song?I wish I could do an album and direct the music.He has a voice to be heard by all the world,as an ageless voice sings.He appeals to the hip and the hop and drop(oldsters), but please give us an album with his beautiful voice, and also ,I miss that smile at the end of his songs I wonder when he sang these songs if he had the smileat the end of the song.I am 67 and have wrote a review before but I am young at heart but the old songs and melodies of Elton, Sinatra, Johnny Mathis and Neil Diamond give us something to rememberlets try some of these on Clay ok,love you Clay ty for listening to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, yet disappointed","review":"I have been waiting for this CD forever!!! Finally was able to get it, and wondered, \\"Where is that booming, powerful voice\\" that Clay had on American Idol? The songs are nice, and he has a nice voice, but NOT THE CLAY that was on the AI program. I loved how he belted out his songs....this CD does not have that part of his voice. Disappointed in that, but overall, the CD is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Clay fan- unfortunately not of the album","review":"I love Clay's voice and I bought this album and I will buy the next. I think this album is overproduced and all the songs sound the same. I hope Clay's next album brings more personal meaning to his songs, and let's his voice come through more. I'm still a huge fan, I think his producers missed the mark unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOving!","review":"This CD is so great! Every song is so moving. While I was looking for Clay to show off his voice more, you definitely can hear it in every song. The songs are so clear and beautiful. I am really impressed with the songs, and it is refreshing to hear such talent. I am glad he stayed with what he did. Impressive and good buy for any Clay fan or music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"he gets better and better","review":"When I heard this I was like, wow! His songs are great, and I'll admit, he's not the most handsome person, so on his CD you dont have to look at him. Oh, and today, everyone's voices are digitally remastered so they sound better, like * cough cough* Hilary Duffs *cough cough* but not Clays! he sounds just as good live as on his CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"Clay Goes Beyond!Beyond anything you heard on AI, Clay shows his real talent. 'The Way' gave me goosebumps in the same way that his rendition of 'This is the Night' did when I first heard him sing it. Hopefully, he is hear to stay. I love his voice. If you stumble a bit on the first song, keep listening. It is the only one that is tentative in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Expectations","review":"A great variety of songs. There is something for everyone.I am listening to this album instead of my car radio..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic As Expected. GO CLAY!","review":"I ordered 4 copies from Amazon and hate to give any away as I planned so will buy more to have one in every car and room. It is absolutely amazing and please don't listen to the remnants of Ruben's fans who are rating Clay badly because they are still disappointed that \\"their\\" hero will go nowhere.Every song is outstanding, just as Clay is and it is overwhelming that he can do so fantastic on so many songs in such a short time. Keep up the good work Clay and millions are rooting and supporting you. Was at the Houston and Dallas tour and the experience will be remembered a lifetime. Alainapoo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every cut on the album is great!","review":"There are very few albums where every song is one that I want to listen to over and over. Clay's voice is beautiful and he should have many hits from this CD. \\"Touch\\" is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claymation Is a Big Disappointment!","review":"I was so looking forward to Clay's first full cd. Wow, what a disappointment.... very bland and no excitement in any of the tracks. Only 12 too... what a cheap trick! His glow is sure dimming if this is the best he can do. This is the Night was the best and he repeated it on this album... He could do so much better... Whahhhhh Guess I expected so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!","review":"Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called \\"Clay nation\\" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big Clay Aiken fan and anxiously awaited his full cd. Unfortunately, this cd was not what I expected. Apparently, this was a rushed job because none of songs really appeal to me. The cd is bland, uninspiring and totally not what I expected. I expected more and hopefully his next cd will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agreeing with RB","review":"I agree with RB from Delaware. Most of the songs are pretty good on this album, although Clay's voice is not the same as it was on television. I sure hope they aren't trying to change his style of singing. I'd recommend it to anyone who's ready for a change and a great singer - simply because Clay is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I think it's such a shame that an enormous talent like Clay Aiken is pigeon-hold into making an album like \\"Measure Of A Man\\". Aiken's voice is soaring and wonderous throughout this disc, but the lyrics and arrangements of each track, excluding \\"This Is The Night\\" and the title track, are downright insipid. Think Backstreet Boys go Broadway. Clive Davis, the album's head producer is a bonafide hitmaker, but even he has to hang his head in shame at allowing this drivel to be sold to Aiken's fans. From the interviews that I've read and seen on TV featuring him, Clay seems like a decent human being, and has a voice that will mealt your heart. But, I strongly advice any serious music lovers to avoid this disc and wait for something more mature and stronger musically from Clay Aiken the vocal wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headache, anyone? Thanks, but no thanks.","review":"Well, this has to be one of the most disappointing releases of the year. Actually, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't that disappointed, but to fans of Clay, I will warn you that this CD is not what you would expect. Clay sounds more robot than man on this debut effort, and I do mean EFFORT. He is a good singer, but he belongs on Broadway, singing show tunes to the elderly who can revel in his youth and energetic manner. To the average listener, this CD is no more than a sad recycled mess of false emotion. It wouldn't matter so much if it were on Broadway, because the show distracts you somewhat, but I would be careful putting this disc in your CD player. I got a headache after the first song. Anyone want to buy a used copy? I might have to take the scissors to it otherwise..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's CD is wonderful","review":"Buy it and listen to it once and you will never want to turn it off. The songs are wonderful, and the way he sings them will move you in many ways. I was brought to tears by \\"The Way\\", it is so beautiful. Finally an artist who will not compromise his beliefs and delivered a great, personal debut album.A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay vs. Ruben...stop already","review":"These \\"reviews\\" have turned into a Clay/Ruben forum..I don't think that should be allowed here.

Clay has one of the best voices I have ever heard and it comes through loud and clear with every song on this CD. Buy it...you'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start","review":"Lets face it. The music industry would have NEVER discovered this young man. Gangly, southern, loves his mother... But he truly IS a pop star. This album proves it. The songs sound a tad bit over-produced and there really isn't an original 'feel' to this CD, but for some reason, my wife and I can't seem to get enough of it. We think because the CD underscores and carries the sincerity that shone through during his metamorphosis on American Idol. He's the long-shot that won (albeit second, he far outshines the rest). And this album is a winner of sorts. We'll buy his next one so we can continue to enjoy watching him grow and change as an artist. Just like he did on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True MEASURE OF A MAN","review":"We have here a True Measure of a Man. This CD just shows what a great voice Clay has. He appeals to ages 7 to70. He has proved everytime just how versatile he is. I can't wait until his next single comes out Solitare/The Way. I have already pre-ordered and so should you. Lets give this young man a huge Hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"music that moves you","review":"I hadn't watched the American Idol show, but when I heard a song on the radio I had to have the cd. I was not disappointed.It is completely entertaining.Hard to believe he is only beginning his career.His songs seem heartfelt as if he were a seasoned veteran of the music business. I found myself moved and inspired. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL TALENT!","review":"My daughter eagerly anticipated the release of Clays CD, and I must admit I'm hooked as well--How refreshing it is to have a young pop star that [doesn't use] vulgar lyrics,condone violence, drugs, etc... or has sold out! Unlike most of todays CD's, this work contains several songs that are excellent, and could become big hits-In fact, I like ALL of the songs! Several of the songs give me chills, even though i have listened to the CD a dozen times...the songs grow on you..and that voice~~~its just something special! Clay, thank you for helping me believe there are good, decent people among our youth~!This young man is a great talent, and role model for my kids.Today's singers could learn alot from this kid.I will buy his work anyday.Hurray for Clay! *****!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Gives Me Chills","review":"I waited for so long to get this CD and I had hoped that it would be what I expected, but it was so much more. I love every song on it and I guess my favorite changes from day to day. Right now my favorite is THE WAY. I think it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I wanted to write this letter and really blast the critics but the more I thought about it I realized that that isn't the CLAY-WAY. I understand that we can't expect every body to love it like Clay's true fans do but we just have to stick behind him and let him know that the people who truly love him are estatic about the CD and we are so proud of him for sticking to his beliefs and not letting the producers talk him into compromising what he believes in. We want more of the Clay we love, and we will stick with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This cd is the most breathtaking music with the most amazing voice I have heard since Elvis. Thank you Clay Aiken, for bringing such joy into my life! You have a great stage presence, your articulate, and your all thats good in this world. Thank you again from a huge fan who loves you and your cd! Keep them coming and I cannot wait for your tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-produced junk","review":"Simon Fuller has done it again, taken an average mediocre-talent and turned them into a media-made powerhouse of hometown glory and over-promoted love ballads. As with former Idol stars Kelly Clarkson (who was the runner-up and ironically had a better selling album) and Justin Guarini, Aiken's album is filled with a rare uptempo ballad, a medium tempo moody ballads and crooning slow colorless ballads. Even his linear notes are all-too-predictable, thanking his family and God -- sure to make any middle-aged housewife or grandma swoon.Overall, Aiken's \\"Measure of a Man\\" undeniably shows an aspiring talent at work (there is no denying his voice), but the lack of creative inspiration or even -anything- out of the box perhaps shows that Aiken hasn't actually measured up to the man he could be quite yet.If you're an aging house-wife or a grandparent you'll absolutely love this CD, but if you have any musical taste whatsoever you'll avoid it completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"All's well that ends well","review":"After waiting for months to get this album I was a little disappointed with the opening track \\"Invisible\\". It didn't sound like the Clay we have all come to know and love. The first few tracks sounded a bit \\"over-produced\\" and lacked the style that makes Clay special, but as the album progresses, so do the quality of the recordings. After a few listens to the album, I've found that every song has something special to offer whether it be Clay's vocals or the lyrics or the music itself. One thing I enjoy most about the album is that it has more of a \\"rock\\" type feel to it on many of the tracks and doesn't fall strictly into the \\"pop\\" genre as most people come to know it (eg. Justin Timberlake, Justin Guarini, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Debut!","review":"After listening to the entire CD about 6 times, I am completely in love with each and every song! I have to admit that wasn't my initial feeling after the first listen, but these songs (and THAT VOICE) just grow on you. I can't get enough of it. My favorite is the title song.I agree that I'd love to hear Clay make a CD with some of the classics that he does so well. Maybe that's next. For his debut album, however, it couldn't be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi platinum CD!!!!!","review":"I love every song on this CD. It's an exceptional change from the nasty, derogatory music being churned out by the cookie cutter pop stars. Clay Aiken breaks the mold and amazes the mold maker. He delivers to the heart. Each song touches you on a very human level. True to himself, this is Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Angelic voice shines thru!","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this album for ANY Clay Aiken fan! I have watched Clay from day one, when he entered that room with Simon, Randy and Paula, and declared himself the \\"American Idol\\". In my opinion, he IS the American Idol! I could not wait for this album to be released and I am NOT disappointed! The first three songs are wonderful---one of my favorites being \\"Measure of a Man\\", the title song of this CD. This is only his FIRST album and I predict the next to be even better! Congratulations, Clay, for the release of your first album! I look forward to watching it soar thru the charts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC","review":"From the very first time that I heard Clay sing on AI2, I was in awe. I fell in love with him. I am drawn to him like a magnet. When this CD came out, I got it right away. In a few days I knew every song by heart. This is a great CD. Clay really shows what he has got and man does he got it. I recommend this CD to everyone. My Husband is not a clay lover but I find him listening to my Clay CD in the car at times. So even the most burley men like Clays singing. I look forward to the next Clay CD and hope it is soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Clay Aiken!!","review":"This album is awesome. It has something for everyone. Pop and a little R&B. Even though Clay did not win American Idol, he lost over Ruben Studdard. Hello! How could he have? He has more music selections and styles than Ruben ever did and besides, I like Ruben and I like his album \\"Soulful\\" but, Ruben, you can do better on albums and songs if you take the chance that Clay has taken on \\"Measures Of A Man.\\" Go Clay! I LOVE this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all based on what you like...","review":"Personally, I find the reviews on this site to be Clay haters arguing with Clay fans, and vice versa. What I think needs to be done, is take a step back, and look at this CD in a different way.Do you like this CD? Obviously if you hate Clay, there's no way you're going to like this CD and that's that. If you love Clay, you aren't going to hate it.Look at it like this. This CD is all Clay. He puts his message, personality, and voice into the music. If that is what you like, then like it. If you don't, you don't. Don't be biased either way. Look at it from the middle point. We aren't getting anywhere arguing.Clay fans, buy this CD. You'll adore it.Clay haters, don't. You'll dispise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pop Album - Best Male Vocalist","review":"Ignore the people who say that he should have sung more adult songs. These are ADULT songs. I appreciate the tone of the album. I'm glad that the CD is filled with new material. IT'S GREAT!!! I think the album has the ability to appeal to all ages if you have an open mind. It's not bubblegum music. IT'S THE REAL DEAL!THIS CD SHOWCASES CLAY'S VOICE IN WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. His voice is so flexible and it's evident with the song selection.Don't listen to the people who complain and whine about the song selection. It's terrific.BUY CLAY'S CD. YOU'LL LOVE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"DoNt BuY ThIs Cd","review":"this cd got more credit then it should of........in other words this cd sux...when i watched american idol he was the worst person on the show....i was so glad he didn't win he has no talent.....but when he started making an album then i was even more disapointed because he didn't even win and he has more fame than Rubin who i think was lots better....so if u read this don't buy it.....its not worth your 13.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of Music","review":"The entire concept is just bad. I don't care how much this guy whines about his hard life, he's not deserving. He is wasting tons of record label space that could be occupied by true, creative, artists. The whole idea of a country picking the next big pop star from a TV show is just sad. It's a shame children will grow up thinking this is good. Radio is forever gone, hang the DJ.JB"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO CLAY","review":"Yes, there is no question about Clay's talent. That's a given. However, this album just doesn't show it. His singles were fabulous and then they disappoint us with this album. You can't even tell where one song ends and the next begins. It's all the same stuff. C'mon now~give the man the songs that he is so capable of delivering with spine tingling sensations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Drab","review":"I'm a big American Idol fan so I bought this CD. But if you are not an obsessed die hard of Clay Aiken...you will be disappointed. I think he should accentuate the twang some more and go after a country audience. This CD was nothing but schmaltzy, drab, and mediocre. So don't listen to all the raves without realizing that Clay's nutty fans think he's the second coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA","review":"I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broadway Clay","review":"I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIMPY!!","review":"Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......\\"CLAY NO WAY\\"!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd proves why Ruben won","review":"This cd is hurrendous. Ruben is SO much better. Want a good cd - check out soulful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD: Measure Of A Man by Clay Aiken","review":"To me, nobody sings better than CLAY AIKEN. His voice is so entertaining and enjoyable. CLAY AIKEN can sing anything. This CD is my favorite CD that I have ever owned. Please buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To The Stars","review":"I can't get enough of this CD. I play it every day, many times a day. I hear the next single will be \\"The Way\\" with \\"Solitaire\\" on the B-side, both perfect choices. Clay's voice gets more unbelievably beautiful every time I hear him. I was worried about this CD catering more to what passes for popular music today, but, thankfully every track is a gem and remains true to Clay himself and his fans. My favorites are No More Sad Song, The Way, I Will Carry You, Run to Me, but it's really hard to pick favorites because they are all so good. I simply cannot wait for a brand new full CD of Clay. He and his voice are a winner in every sense of the word...and don't forget he just won American Music Award's Fans' Choice and a Billboard award for his single, This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Waters. As Diane Sawyer said, \\"He's on a rocket to the stars!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY is FANTASTIC!!!!","review":"What a GREAT cd!!! I love listening to Clay over and over and over again!! WOW!!! Great job!!!! Thank you so much for making this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a first album","review":"I love all the songs on the album and its a great first album. I feel the song \\"touch\\" is probably my favorite and then the next would be \\"The Way\\" and both would do very well on the charts if released as a single. Clay definitely does sound different than A I and in some aspects I miss that amazing vocal range he has which is clearly not expressed as much on his debut CD. All and all the CD is very good but I hope for this next album there are songs that have more of a range in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Voice","review":"Clay's debut cd is a fine first effort. However, it would have been a steller debut had more of the songs sounded a little more different from each other. At first listen it was hard to know when one ended and one started. Also, I was hoping for at least one roof shattering over-the-top showcase for that powerful voice of his. The single \\"Invisible\\" is a great pop song that deserves to be heard on radio, but I think mainstream radio may not embrace it due to the current hip hop domination and there is not a rap artist to be found. AC radio should add it without hesitation though. With all that said, this cd is definately worth a listen. He has a great future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed myself completely!!!!","review":"I listen to this cd last night, and I have to say that I think its very good, especially for a first full CD. Mr. Aiken could sing my grocery list and I would be in heaven. Yes, there were a couple of songs which didn't immediately hit me, but with a couple of listens under my belt I enjoyed the heck out of this CD. I say - congratulations MR. AIKEN!!! And remember you can't please all the people all the time, and who would want to? Stay true to yourself, your beliefs and I have no doubt you will go as far as you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!!","review":"Did I mention GREAT? Clay does such a wonderful job on this album!! I love it!!! All of the songs are so well sung, and the music is GREAT!!! I am so happy, I will be buying more for Christmas Presents for my friend and my kids teachers!! My 8 year old daughter loves Clay and she wants her own cd and poster!!!! Thank you so much Clay!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't skip over any of them!!!","review":"I often buy Cds. In almost all cases I will skip over a few songs that don't appeal to me. This is the first cd in a very long time that I can actually say I like all of them. Even though this cd is considered all \\"pop\\" it has a continuity to it that doesn't happen very often. Each track is unique. There is an easy flow within this album,yet you get the feeling that each song is different.I honestly can't tell you which song I like best.....I think that is a matter of personal opinion. For a debut album I feel this one will appeal to many for various reasons. I don't think you will be disappointed ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AWESOME!","review":"The first time I listened to this CD, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't really the same type of thing that Clay was doing on American Idol. I've listened to it non-stop despite this fact, and I have to admit it - I love it! There are some really cool songs. I love upbeat \\"Invisible.\\" \\"No More Sad Songs\\" is probably one of my favorites, it reminds me of a powerful Paul McCartney ballad. If you have the McCartney CD, 'Flaming Pie' and enjoyed it, this seems kinda similar, but DEFINITELY more powerful and something you will not get sick of as fast! I also like the fact that there are songs that you can relate to that avoid negative images that the record companies try to impose on us as listeners. We can always trust Clay to only give us what he knows we REALLY want. THANK YOU CLAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awesome!","review":"Forget those bad critics' reviews. This cd is awesome. It's trendy without being too overly-commercial. The songs are great, and for once it's nice to have a pop album out there that's not all about who's sleeping with who and all that stuff. The songs have some powerful meanings behind them and were well chosen. (For example, 'I Will Carry You', 'Shine', 'Measure of a Man', 'When You Say You Love Me' (my personal favorite. :)) It may not show off his voice as much as American Idol did, but considering that he still is more talented than other artist out there and has already more than proven himself on American Idol, it doesn't pose much of a problem. :) I think this cd was well done. Buy it and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN IS AMERICA'S IDOL: IDOL FOUND...GAME OVER","review":"Clay Aiken is indeed America's Idol, regardless of the outcome of the American Idol TV show. Everybody knows CLAY AIKEN actually won the competition, and his records sales, fan base, and popularity prove it. Clay Aiken is extremely talented and has proven that he is able to do a whole lot more in the entertainment industry and education industry than the other Idol contestants combined. Clay Aiken's amazing and incredible voice shines on this magnificent CD. The songs are very entertaining and exciting to hear. I am a music major, and I believe that the great songs on this CD and Clay Aiken's spectacular voice make this CD the best CD by a debut artist ever. CLAY AIKEN is the ultimate Idol and ultimate singer and ultimate entertainer and so much more. Idol Found..Game Over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is fantastic","review":"I love all the songs on this album and that is saying a lot for me because I am very critical of much of the music that is out there these days. Clay sang his heart out on these songs and I especially liked The Way and I Will Carry You. I hope some of the other songs besides Invisible get some airplay. Love that Clay.....my American Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever","review":"Clay Aiken and the team at RCA have outdone themselves with this album. It is the most enjoyable Pop album I have ever listened to. This music and Clays voice cover every good emotion one can think of. The arrangements are superb and Clay's voice --well I just can't find enough wonderful adjectives to describe how I feel about it.In my opinion this is an album where you don't want to skip any of the songtracks but will want to listen to them all over and over.Bravo Clay--Your \\"Measure Of A Man' certainy measures up. I wish you all of the success that you might wish for yourself, and if this album is any example --that success is guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!","review":"I love all of Clay Aiken's Music. I don't understand why he didn't win American Idol since he sold quicker than Ruben and I believe he made more sales too. I love his voice and it's magnificantly captivating from the first word of every song. I'm trying out for American Idol this year and hopefully I can live at least half way up to him if I get on! I love this CD. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Voice, but kind of Generic","review":"Don't get me wrong; Clay has an AMAZING voice. There's a reason this guy was #2 on American Idol. But his songwriters need a shot of creativity. His lyrics, though heartfelt I'm sure, are about the same generic topics that every pop star sings about: love and loss. These are generally great topics, but not when it's the whole CD. I hope his next CD, if there is one, will have more variety concerning his song topics. I'm still giving this CD 4 stars because his voice just blows the majority of the faults away. I'd buy his Christmas CD if I had the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"No skippers on this cd! I want to listen to every single song--each one is better than the next! This has got to be one of the best cd's I've heard in a very long time. I hope this is just the first of many cd's in my Clay Aiken collection. I'm very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im a Claymate! (not really, but i still love this CD)","review":"Clay's CD went double platnum the first week- that really says something about it! I bought this CD the day it came out and i love it! Invisible is an awesome song.. and it is something different for Clay's voice. The Way is another one of my favorite songs... This is the Night is still one of the best songs on the CD even though i always heard it on the radioa million times. I also like Perfect Day and Touch alot. But my absolute favorite song is Measure of a Man! This song sends shivers up your spine.. from Clays breathtaking voice. Wow! I just about named all the songs.. but thats because they all rock..My only complaint: They didnt have the lyrics in the booklet thingy.. its very annoying.. i dont think RCA puts their lyrics in the book.. they want u to waste your time and look them up.. bcuz kellys cd didnt have them either.. lol..meh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appeal to all audiences!","review":"Besides being a very talented vocalist, Clay Aiken shows he is versatile and in-tune with today's music. This easy-on-the-ears music will make you get up and dance or reminisce with a smile on your face. I can honestly say there isn't a song I do not like, and this artist will be around for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best CDs of the year","review":"This CD is the best!

Clay is bigger and better than American Idol. He is the new king of pop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken","review":"When you're truly looking forward to a CD being released, you can build your hopes up so high that you feel let down when you finally hear it. My expectations for this album were not met - they were exceeded!! Every time I think my love and respect for Clay can't possibly grow any further, that's exactly what happens. The one thing that probably stands out most about this CD is its ability to make you totally unable to choose a favorite song... they are all so INCREDIBLE! In true Clay style, he goes above and beyond \\"the bar,\\" putting all of his efforts into a creation that does his fans oh, so proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different.","review":"Measure of a Man isn't a typical CD, in my opinion. Clay can sing very well, and strong background music isn't needed to cover up anything. The lyrics are clean, beautiful, and well-thought out. I think the CD is brilliant - a very nice change to the usual stuff that comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OUTSTANDING CD FROM START TO FINISH","review":"WOW!! This cd is outstanding from start to finish! Every song is great! I can't even pick one song that i really don't care for. Good job Clay....your first cd is worth 5 STARS. Buy this today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay delivers!","review":"Clay delivers on his Freshman CD. His voice, choice of songs, and his interpretation are all inspired. Anyone who would like a refreshing change from what is usually played on the radio today would be well advised to purchase this CD. Clay is currently appearing on several venues, including the World Series and the American Music Awards. If you are undecided, catch him on TV and you will agree that the man can sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I've been flipping through the songs on Clay's CD that I just got. Wow~ I still can't get over his amazing voice. If you are thinking about getting this CD, DO IT~~! The lyrics are awesome and the whole CD is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"I absolutely love Clay's new cd!!!

Both this cd and the single are unbelievable!Happy listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Voice and CD ever","review":"This CD is pure gold and I recommend this masterpiece and it soothes the ear and soul. It's the best CD ever and he should have won the competetion. If you don't like him you will because this CD will make a fan out of anyone, this artist should winn so many Grammys and I hope he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have looked at quite a few of the reviews posted here. I bought this CD and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is so refreshing to hear someone actually singing a tune instead of screaming, rythmic talking or hurling obscenities. I have a very varied taste in music and appreciate, country, pop, classical and even quite a bit of rock. This is a very mellow CD with enjoyable tunes and meaningful lyrics. I hope Clay is able to maintain his morals and his style as there are quite a few of us out here in a wide range of age groups that enjoy his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational!","review":"This young man is the greatest voice to come along since Sinatra. For a first album . . . or for a fiftieth . . . this one has it all! Best of all the Idols and a great talent . . . he should become a mega-star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In regards to: \\"Clay's Claymates Attack\\"","review":"Everyone could go round and round whether Clay Aiken's CD is worthy or not but it all comes down to ONE thing...we all have our own opinions on music and the types of music we choose to listen to. As for radio stations denying playing any of his songs....well, just one little tidbit to think about...there are some songs on the radio now that I could care less about hearing but they still have the chance to be aired on radio. So why shouldn't Clay's song? Little hint: If you don't like the song playing on the radio at the moment--flip it to something else. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Play fair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy measures up!","review":"I bought this CD for my 12yr old daughter who is a big fan of Clay Aiken, and I have to say that I'm hooked as well! How refreshing it is to hear a performer that isn't a pig..., foul,violent, druggie or has sold out to the recording mecca's! Easily the best new artist I have heard in years,Clay's \\"Measure Of A Man\\" delivers and you won't be dissapointed. I personally have listened to the CD a dozen times, and ALL the songs are well done.I honestly like all the songs,[many give me chills with that voice] and feel many of the cuts could be big hits. This CD is probably destined for greatness. I will buy this guys stuff from now on, he is an impressive young man on and off the stage, and I'm pround to say he's a good example for young people today..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Measures Up!","review":"This CD is composed of 12 wonderful pop ballads, that exploit the breadth and depth of Clay Aiken's amazing vocal talent. From the opening song, \\"Invisible\\", to the pop-country tune, \\"The Way\\", the Beatle-esque \\"Shine\\", \\"This is The Night\\", and the final song, \\"Touch\\" (suprisingly, a Justin Timberlake-style song which Clay makes his own), this CD is pure ear candy. Kudos to the producer and those behind the scenes who pulled together this entire set of songs for Clay's debut CD. It is fresh and pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZON.COM IS BEING UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I don't understand how Amazon.com can allow \\"reviews\\" with vulgarities and obvious intentions to slam the artist rather than reviewing the cd, to be posted. Is this how Amazon.com wants to be portrayed? Trashy because it allows trashy \\"reviews\\" to be posted. This is outright irresponsibility especially when children may visit this site!Why does Amazon.com even bother to state \\"Please be sure to focus your comments on the album's content. Read our review guidelines for more information\\" when it isn't responsible enough to check before it allows posts of this dispicable nature to be put up. I am deeply disappointed!Having said all that Clay's Measure of a Man is an excellent cd and no intentional slams of Clay or his cd will make fans of Clay to change their minds. In fact, I know of many people who are not even fans of Clay and they love this cd. A great cd is a great cd, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong debut from the man with that powerful voice","review":"Finally, after over a decade of lackluster singers, Clay Aiken has arrived! His debut album, Measure of a Man, is unarguably one of the best albums of 2003. This album does not disappoint from the opening song to the last. Clay delivers every song to near perfection. His powerful instrument, his voice, resonates through each track. You will find it very hard not to listen to it, from beginning to end, over and over again. If i had to sum this album up in just one word, that word would have to be \\"outstanding\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken","review":"This album is all we have been waiting for and can be listened to by all. I bought enough to give for gifts and didn't even wait for giving them out, just had to let everyone hear them NOW. All the ages, from pre-teen up to this older lady love this man, Clay Aiken and his high ideals show through. We appreciate as fans what he has done, to make his album family friendly as he did the Idol show on tour. This is a Star, make no mistake. He will be the greatest along in a world that has ruined music for anyone that wants to hear actual music. Listening to some of the things on radio is just too darn tedious, as some is just noise and other is plain garbage. Not so with Clay Aiken's music. Thank God for Clay Aiken."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a talented man!","review":"This is an excellent album and the music has surpassed my expectations of Clay Aiken. He gives out his heart and soul in each one the songs. This is one album that can put a smile on my face and it gives me joy. It is fun and spirit lifting to listen to this album, \\"Measure Of A Man.\\" \\"Invisible\\" is my favorite with many others are running a close second. None are lower than a third place finish. I like it better and better each time I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One More Comment","review":"I have already rated and reviewed this album...........the best one of 2003!! But I have one more comment to make to the person that said great singers are only those who write their own music and lyrics. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley............shall I go on?! They didn't write hardly any of their music. They had people write for them. Why? Because they were the greatest interpators of a song and song writers lined up to have them sing their songs. Clay is the next one in line!! And whose to say he may not write some of his songs in the future?! Some of you people need to understand what music is all about. Just like a book or a movie its all about what we enjoy on an individual basis. If its not your taste in music you don't need to write a scathing review, just say its not your cup of tea and keep your biased opinions to yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This CD is undoubtedly the most impressive CD I have heard in years. Aiken truly delivers on his debut album. A great mixture of ballads and Pop/Rock songs make this CD a must-have. Aiken's voice is crisp and clear, flawless and fresh. He certainly has proven he can sing anything given to him.It's great to finally have someone in this era who can have a positive impact on the young and old. He is truly an American Idol. I don't know who said you have to promote \\"sex, violence, and more sex\\" to be a successful recording artist, but Aiken has shown you can make it as a respectful person. Cudos to Aiken for staying a role model for all!!! I look forward to his other projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken Rocks!!!","review":"I LOVE his new album! I knew that there was no way he could disappoint with a voice as beautiful and as powerful as his! MY FAVORITE SONG IS \\"THE WAY\\"!!! I hope RCA makes this his new single! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE every song on this CD. I have never been so pleased with an album in my life. I totally respect Clay for taking a stand to have his CD made his way. After all, we fell in love with HIM, HIS style, HIS way. RCA doesn't need to change him, just give us Clay as he is! Some critics have referred to him as \\"Gourment Vanilla\\", in that case, gimme a triple scoop! :)I LOVE YOU CLAY & WILL SUPPORT YOU ALWAYS!!!Hugs,Shawna Wheeler,Central MaineSeat #207 on the Clay Train"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!","review":"Although I am not one to normally take the time to share my opinion on things like this, I would have to say I feel I wanted to add something to the list of rave reviews. I love this CD! Although I agree that I would have liked more than twelve songs, the songs included are wonderful! Sometimes with something new you are drawn back by one or two songs hoping that they may \\"grow on you\\" but each song on the CD is great in my opinion. There was a great review given by Billboard on this CD, it will be interesting to see how it does. I personally feel this music is refreshing and a great choice over some of the trashy lyrics out there. Good luck to Clay on future endeavors......it is nice to see good things happen to good people and I love to listen to that awesome voice! My three year old also requests Clay Aiken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATHTAKING","review":"Clay and his songs have to be the best of the best that we have had in YEARS. I can even listen to music now with my children and grandchildren listening and don't feel ashamed. Clay Aiken is truly a breath of fresh air, a new lease on life and we all should be PROUD that finally, a true , non-tattoed, non woman chasing,non drug taking & non sex addict , nice young AWESOME Artist that really cares about people but still has that shy sex appeal and morals has emerged!!! THANK THE LORD!! IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!!CLAY, YOU DID THE WORLD AND RCA PROUD AND THANK YOU RCA FORRECOGNIZING THIS AND PUTTING HIM ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST!!!!!His mother Faye and his grandmother are to be commended!!!HE IS WHAT THE \\"MEASURE OF A MAN\\" STANDS FOR!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL THE BEST","review":"I have reviewed this album before and have not changed my mind at all - it is absolutely the best music out there.

Incredible voice and music will appeal to all age crowd. Congratulations Clay.....you deserve the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rising Star","review":"You know that an artist is popular when he garners so many reviews from so many people that love and hate him but this guy is a rising star!It took a lot of guts to get up in front of a panel of judges to audition for American Idol and then even more guts to sing in front of Simon and the rest of America!This album contains songs from different genres of popular music so there's something for everyone. I personally love them all! Give it a chance. I'm sure that you will NOT be disappointed.We gave Clay a chance and look where he is now!And for those of you who keep saying that he's ugly, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and see what's inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE ARTIST CLAY AIKEN","review":"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AS SOON AS IT HIT THE STORE AND AS SOON AS I LISTENED TO IT I LOVED EVERY TRACK. IM SICK OF LISTENING TO THE STUFF THE DISC JOCKS THINK ARE GOOD SINGERS. RAP AND THE YELLING AND CURSING FOR SHOCK VALUE TO SELL SOMETHING AND CALL IT TALENT. I LIKE ALL TYPES OF MUSIC AS LONG AS THE SINGING IS GOOD AND THE MUSIC IS GOOD BUT SO MANY POP AND ROCK STATIONS DONT KNOW WHAT IS TRUE ARTISTIC WORK ANY MORE. IM NOT SAYING ITS ALL BAD BUT TOO MUCH OF IT IS. CLAY WAS WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO ON THE SHOW AND EVEN BETTER ON THE NEW ALBUM. ITS RARE TO FIND AN ALBUM THAT ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT CLAY HAS DONE IT AND I WILL NODOUBT BUY EVERYTHING HE PUTS OUT IN THE FUTURE.I CONTINUE TO LEAVE THIS CD IN MY CAR PLAYER AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T MEASURE UP","review":"This CD disappointed me. I was expecting more from Clay but I guess this is what happens when you rush your work. I hope his next one is better because this one sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even one star to be honest","review":"This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst recording to come along","review":"in a long time.This has got to be a joke. Please don't wasteyour money on this CD. It's not all what somereviewers on here are saying it is. They areobviously Clay's fans trying to convince the worldthat he has a golden voice. The guy can sing, butbelieve me so can a lot of people. He released thisthing too soon and should have selected better songsto sing. Measure of a man just doesn't do it for me.Sorry Clay, this one flopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"On behalf of Randy-Paula and the producers of american Idol I humbly apologize for besieging America with this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invisible is the only worthy song","review":"This CD is just full of rockish country same old stuff. I really do not think clay makes a good pop star at all and this CD proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"It's easy, there're only a few possibilities why you like this album:1. You're a little gal in your early teens, and u think he's, well, cute.2. You know zilch about music. You're trying to be a victim of the mushrooming commercial music that I'm so sick of.Did u ever feel a rush of blood oozing to your heart. NO? Then his songs probably dun impress you much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll tell you why he's bad!","review":"Clay Aiken... why is he so big? Answer: he was on American idol. Did he win? Answer: No! Then why is he bigger than Ruben? Answer: it's a miracle! Number one, you have to admit, he looks sort of like a clown. Two, even his feet are huge! They look like a joke. But, I realize that this has nothing to do with his singing. What do I think about his singing? Awful! Every song sounds the same, and if he and everyone else would only realize how NORMAL he really is, you'd know that nothing of his is worth buying. If you want some real music, go buy Michael Buble's debut album, there's a guy with REAL talent. Clay Aiken is just a screaching clown that somehow scored a record deal. I will give it one star only for the fact that there is an actual CD in a case, that someone had to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"UH OH","review":"UH OH CLAYMATES!!! Clay's album has fallen out of the top twenty sellers on Amazon.com!!! Quick, better buy ten more copies to get him back up there!

I haven't heard a voice like his in my whole life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a Clay Fan","review":"I was a Clay Fan until I hear this karoake music. This album does not take any chances with this self imposed pop idol. Hecame in second and now I can see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad music","review":"Clay Aiken has talent does he? I've got an idea... maybe he could put his talent to good use and make real, interesting music. Sounds good to me; I don't know about you. Oh well, just another failure in popular music today. I guess there's nothing to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I really hoped this would be fabulous, but it just isn't. All the songs sound the same. Same tempo, same back ground and back-up. RCA or whoever told Clay to sing all the same type of songs was way off base. When done live, one song only, then Clay does come through as we know him. Where is \\"Unchained Melody\\"? One of the songs that got him to the top two on Idol should have been included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but...","review":"The measure of a man is more than three inches!!This is manufactured pop music. It has no soul. It was put together by a studio to be sold to the masses... It was purposely designed to be offensive to no one, therefore it was put in a box. Did Clay write these songs? They all follow the same pop music formula... Amateur songwriters at RCA must be stamping out hit songs by the thousands, all with cliched lyrics.. Now they can stamp out pop stars who have nothing to say and no reason to be famous.Tori Amos, Madonna, Christina.. They write their own music and have something to say. When they do a cover, they have enough taste to choose something powerful and relevant. They don't sing schmaltzy, sappy cookie-cutter pop songs. Buy records from people who have the balls, creativity, and imagination to make a work of art, and not just do what is accepted. Support the leaders, not the followers, and make a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lepo.....","review":"In Hawaiian, this means Dirty, dirt, or filth, I think this word best describes this album. I bought this album thinking I would hear a wonderful singer and voice, but the only thing I can say is that screaming monkeys at the zoo sound better. All of his songs sound the same, kind of like a broken record. \\"Invisible\\" and \\"I Will Carry You\\" sound like the kind of screaming and moaning you'd hear at a mental institution. It seems his music only appeals to 4 to 14 year old girls, who have all the time in the world to sit in front of their computer and pine eternal about Clay's music. Perhaps when most of them grow up, they will realize what a waste of time this guy is. If you want to hear great music....listen to Iz Kamakawio'ole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too syrupy","review":"Reminds me of buble gum pop too much. I hate it. It was one ofthe worse cds ever. I am gonna sell it and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Enjoy hearing him on TV","review":"I really like clay Aiken but I found this CD \\"Measure of a Man\\" very boring. I was quite disapointed with some of the songs and the album in general. I enjoy watching and listening to Clay on the TV. I also think he is a very sweet man and I like his singing just not this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"clay hot man","review":"Dear Mr.Clay,You CD is a great CD. You voice is plesant to here. You very talentd singer. You hot man and not fat like the Rubin dude. I wish you look and hope make another grate CD soon. You win all Garmmys. Bye bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have they done to this poor man?","review":"The first time I saw Clay on American Idol, in his audition, I said to myself \\"theres the winner\\". The first time I listened to Clay's album, I said to myself \\"theres a winner who has been turned into a junky commercialized pop-culture phenomena, exploited with traditional sappy songs that were handed to him by writers, and oversung in a way that only a person who has sung 100 songs on TV that all sound exactly the same can.\\"Poor Clay- in a small dose, he has a fine voice. Heck, he could make a really good Broadway performer with his ability to belt 'em out. It's prefabricated crap like this CD that makes me want to spew.A star for Clay's talent, and one for pity. This album truly deserves no credit, because none of it came from the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD in years","review":"I have read all the reviews, but did not write until I read Jaan's review. All I can say to the so called music critics and Jaan, GET OVER IT, Clay is here to stay. It was very obvious from Jaan's review that he/she is a fan of ?????? and someone wants to hurt sales of Clay's upcoming new release.Measure of a Man is wonderful because you can actually understand the words and the range of Clay's voice is incredible. I agree with other reviewers that MOAM gets better the more you listen to it.Clay is a powerful singer as shown in the duet with Ruben on the AMA's. They were the only singers to get a standing ovation from their peers.My favorites are I survived you, and Touch"},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing, clay should rethink his songs","review":"my wife and I bought this cd over the weekend and the one word that comes to mind is depressing. It has none of the great tunes I expected from the likes of clay. he was always known for his use of ballads, but come one, how many songs does one need about losing your love or making it on your own without you....blah blah blah.I expected some powerhouse tunes, and wish he could have done some music for perhaps an upcoming Disney movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland pop crossed with Broadway wannabe","review":"While I love a few tracks on this CD and admire the writers and producers involved (Darren Hayes, Desmond Child, Cathy Dennis, Danielle Brisbois, Aldo Nova), almost every song sounds the same. And Clay has this annoying habit of \\"finishing\\" each and every song as if it were performed live. Maybe it's just me but I kind of like (or am used to) fade outs in pop songs. I definetly like Clay's voice and there are standout songs that actually effected me (the title track especially moved me) but I have to say Kelly Clarkson's debut CD is head and shoulders a better produced collection than this middle of the road, unoffensive, generic collection of milquetoast. I expected more from Clay after his first single. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits \\"those notes\\", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song \\"This is The Night,\\" other then that, I would not have rated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocal Excellence","review":"\\"Measure Of A Man\\" is an unbelievably good CD. Clay continues to prove that no matter what song he sings he makes it sound great.This Album is a perfect twelve for twelve with all twelve recordings on the CD being excellent.If you are a fan of great music and vocals you will want to get a copy of this superb CD!!!!!!!!!!!!One other great CD you don't want to miss:\\"Blue Skies\\" - Diana DeGarmo"},{"rating":"2","title":"an enjoyable pop album","review":"In all honesty I'm not a fan of the whole American Idol thing, but I did get sucked into AI2 just a bit. Yea for Clay! Moving on.This is strictly a pop album. No earth shattering lyrics, but plenty of catchy tunes and choruses. Clay does a wonderful job of singing this material. In a way Clay reminds me of Rick Ashley from the 80's because I didn't expect that voice/power to come from that person. Anyway, I have been enjoying this ablum. It's nice, mellow and light hearted. Good for those laid back moods or wanting to relax.Obviously this album is not for everyone, but give it a chance. It may grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"Not sure what all the negative responses are about. Are you listening to the same CD that I am? This CD is awesome. There isn't a track that I don't love. If folks wanted to hear remakes of old songs, then they need to buy the American Idol CD. Clay outdid himself with this CD and I look forward to the next one. Now way are you Invisible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hun, Clay is sooooo lame","review":"Hun, the CD is nothing special. It is not an essential CD like the Beatles, Supremes, or Aretha. He will be a one CD hit wonder huns."},{"rating":"1","title":"a singer who knows music","review":"I thought I would give my ear to the sample cuts from this cd of Mr.Clay Aiken and I must say that I am so glad that I did not go and waste my money on the total cd. Clay, darling, the cd is bad. Do not believe the 5 star reviews that you have recieved. These people don't actually know music and they are not being sincere. Take what you have done and learn from it and do a better job the next time around. Your voice is wild and out of control. You are putting too much emphasis in getting your point across to the listener. I feel as though you are still feeling that you are in a competition. You lost. As I said, take this experience and learn from it. If you can't do any better, then shoot for Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious debut","review":"Silly, syrupy lyrics throughout and, surprisingly, the vocals are completely uninspired. This can't be what Aiken wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pop singer","review":"Ditto ats27. Clay's voice is indeed beautiful, and he has magnificent range for lead vocals in a broadway musical, or for easy listening. Tone him down, he is not a pop singer. Stop trying to make him something that he is not. Clay, Harry Connick Jr. did a magnificent job just being himself, and so will you. That is, once you realize who you really are musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do to him???","review":"After listening to the first few songs of the album I've been waiting months for, I had to look and make sure I picked-up the right one. It doesn't even sound like him, which is ironic since most of his audience liked him for the way he sounds!!! The songs could use some help, but at least they used songs by serious song writers, such as Desmond Child. Let's just hope that Clay can hang around enough to go his own way and sound the way he did before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down","review":"I expected better from Clay. This CD is just an example of Clay not being Clay. Why change? You have a great broadway, caberet voice Clay. Stop screaming and please step away from the pop music. It just isn't you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame! What a waste! What sabotage!","review":"This CD is a spectacular disappointment. Clay has a huge, pure voice, and this CD works hard to cancel it out. Overproduced and underbalanced, every song is marred by a pervasive, tinny whitenoise, as if the drummer was told to keep the cymbals hissing through every song. This fuzzes up Clay's pure, clear tone, and cancels out every nuance of his emotional and musical resonance. It's as if the producer/arrangers didn't trust his voice to carry. What idiots. Clay seems like a smart kid; hopefully he's smart enough to choose another producer for his next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"How embarrassing.","review":"I have never bought a worse record. (And I have about six or seven hundred in all.) His voice has been produced out and the songs are as unmemorable as they come. Absolutely horrible.Whoever is handling his career - which must be over after this fiasco - has taken a perfectly decent singer and turned him into muzakChristmas is coming. Unfortunately, I know no one I dislike enough to foist this thing off on.Anonymously, of course. I wouldn't even want this CD in my trash bin, so I am going to have to dump it somewhere far away in the dead of night. Otherwise, the trashman might find out that I had actually spent my hard-earned money on this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Measure","review":"I will prepare myself to face the wrath of other Clay fans, but I think this CD is a disappointment.Clay's voice has been watered down on most of the tracks (about 3 of them sound something \\"like\\" Clay). This is probably an attempt to attract the crowd Simon thought Clay couldn't attract; but the producers/writers may have garnered Clay new fans at the expense of the old ones.I do not think he would have sold one million pre-sale copies had many of us heard the entire CD. This CD is Justin Timberlake lite (and that's no compliment).No Diane Warren or Sedaka style songs. Someone should have listened to his demo CD (or AI for heaven's sake)in order to put together a debut worthy of Clay's voice.If this continues, I will be an ex-Clay fan. Or, should I say, I will remain an AI Clay fan, forever waiting for him to come back to form.Anyway, I know many of you like the CD, but for me, what a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This CD proves without any doubt why Clay has his popularity. He is an amazing singer and true entertainer. People may be jealous, dazed and confused but Clay is a winner no matter what you people may say. Hell, Clay has gone triple platinum. Can Ruben say that, I think NOT! Ha! Ha! Who did you get your info. from. Jealous Mother Fu*kers trying to have you cake and eat it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Clay Aiken's bombastic, over the top singing style is bad enough to make Baby Jesus cry. If you're not a tween or a demented middle-age soccer mom, I recommend you pass on buying this album.Patooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"Clay Aiken has an outstanding voice, but it isn't showcased here. This is another bland pop CD full of predictable top 40 songs. I wish him all the best, but I certainly hope his next effort will reflect his amazing talent and show more imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Rising","review":"Those who would lessen the validity of this growing talent with a voice that, although not at its peak, is clear and powerful ... are at question. Despite the attempts of a popular \\"timely\\" magazine to point out the flaws it did not succeed with me. As to that matter of saying the buyers of this CD will fall into the $20,000 to $30,000 category not only insults this groups ability to know what is good, but insults every other buyer. This buyer likes music from the classics to classic rock groups (those would be the ones with real and lasting talent). What is wrong with a record company that thinks keeping the music clean and with class is a recipe for failure. Though direct comparison is not intended, it is a good thing Frank Sinatra didn't know that good music meant failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful First Album","review":"A showcase for Mr. Aiken's exceptional voice, this power-pop album will have you singing along in no time. Every cut a potential Top 10 hit, there's something for everyone here, from the power-chord-filled ballad 'Run To Me', to the Beatle-esque 'Shine' and 'Perfect Day', to the country-flavored 'When You Say You Love Me', to the breathtakingly beautiful love ballad 'The Way'. A tiny disappointment for this fan: Mr. Aiken's lower register is barely in evidence. Still, that doesn't stop this album from being 100% en-JOY-able."},{"rating":"2","title":"White boy soul emerges from the shadows...","review":"How refreshing it is to hear someone sing BIG again! While there are some uncomfortable moments on the album, Clay has definitely shown us what he has to offer the music world. One can't help but feel the urge to grab up some Steve Perry/Journey albums after listening to this. We haven't heard a male voice this soulful since Captain Big Voice (Perry) left the scene. Hopefully this is just the tip of the iceberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun music you can share with EVERYONE","review":"Finally, good music without sex and sleaze to sell it. Clay's music isn't deep or thought-provoking, but it's fun and sweet, and just a lil bit sexy. It brings a smile to your face and warms the heart. Plus that voice. Ugh, it's like buttah! MOAM is a beautiful insipring track. Definately my fav! The album has a real 80's feel to it. Can't wait to see what he whips up for his second album!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Incredible, and Amazing","review":"I am from Canada,and I have listened to Clay's CD all day today. He is going to be a star. As Elle said, \\"CLAY AIKEN IS HUGE\\" and they are right.I love all the songs on this CD. I find one of my favourites is \\"When you say you love me\\"I recommend this purchase for everyone!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN, DON'T WALK, TO BUY THIS CD!","review":"Clay Aiken has delivered on his long-awaited first full-length CD. This is a great album, one that kids and parents can enjoy together. Clay's brilliant voice soars and the songs are tailored made for him. My personal favorite is \\"Perfect Day.\\" This is a song begging to be a hit and will be if it gets radio play. We have waited decades for Clay Aiken and he has not disappointed us. Clay has the ability to find the matrix of a song and make it his own. He is a breath of fresh air in an industry that badly needs it. My advice: Run, don't walk, to buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Matter of Spellling","review":"Does it matter how you get there? It's impossible to say if Aiken would sound different atop the virtual Mount McKinley if he had worked his way up and wrote his own songs. I think it would, because the sameness of the tracks are as alive as echoes in an anechoic chamber. How do you spell \\"sucks\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job Clay!","review":"I really enjoyed being able to listen to a CD for a change and actually be able to understand and relate to the words of the songs. At times, unfortunately, Clay's voice seems to be obscured by the music----too bad, his voice is phenomenal! Great job Clay! Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Honestly the guy can sing. Out of 12 songs, I would say more than half are excellent, and the others are worth listening too. Most cd's have 2-4 decent songs out of 12-15, however this one tops them all. If you think the cd could be better, I disagree. Everyhting in life could always be better, you cant change that. As a first Clay Aiken Deput album...?? well It Rocks. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!","review":"All I can say is, Clay Aiken has a wonderful voice and every song on this album is a delight to listen to. Usually when I buy an album I will have a few songs that I really like and the others are just okay but that is not so with this album. I love every song! This guy can really sing. His voice is strong and clean. I can't wait for another album to come out by this young man! I purchased one copy and a week later came back and bought two more for gifts and another one for me so I wouldn't have to keep taking the CD from my car to my house.To young and old alike, I have just two words to say--buy it! You will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's debut proves he will be around for years ...","review":"This album is an excellent \\"POP\\" album - EVERY song on this album has a great melody. You will not have to hit the skip button on your cd player. Of course you will have your faves - My faves are Perfect Day and Touch. Another thing that makes Measure of a Man special is the fact that Clay just doesn't sing the songs - he puts \\"FEELING\\" into it. I loved the little surprises that I heard through out the album. For example the song \\"When you say you Love me \\" has a country feel to it.All I can say is buy the album - you will NOT be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album...","review":"...becauseI love the sound of Clay's voiceI love the passion that comes through his music - it is clear that he feels what the songwriter feltI love that the songs are complex and intelligent - not some coked-out-can't-handle-more-than-10-words-in-the-lyric-or-I-lose-attention-deficit-syndrome musicI love that soaring, wonderful, lusty voiceI love that I find myself dancing in my chair/car/home while I'm feeling the musicI love that I don't have to listen to the \\"Thanks, but I've already heard them a million times and I'm tired of them\\" oldies to hear music that makes me want to sing alongI love Clay's spirit and scruples and sexinessI love that Clay fulfills a need that the music industry has been lacking for the last several yearsI love his voiceClay makes any song he sings sound better.If you need more reasons, I can give them...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"Love the new cd.

Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"how do you measure a man?","review":"Oh my gosh...how incredible is Clay? All of the songs on this CD are incredible. Each song is a reflection on experiences everyone has and can relate to. Whether it be being in love, falling in love, or declaring your independence from a broken relationship and moving on. They are all here and Clay puts everything into each song. He is one of the most refreshingly cool voices to come on the scene in years and we are all the better for it. At least we can now hear other songs besides \\"This is the Night\\" which is still good but most people were eagerly awaiting something new and have they gotten it!!!! One has to wonder why he needed a talent showcase to break into recording when he could have done it on his own. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than Expected!","review":"As the mother of a teen who is a big Clay Aiken fan, I picked up this CD yesterday for her. We hardly ever buy music CD's anymore because there are usually only one or two good songs on them - and I expected this one to be the same. WRONG! Nearly every song on this album touched me in some way - I especially liked the song \\"Shine.\\" This album is filled with very good music that a parent doesn't have to be concerned about their children listening to. And as for the big Clay Aiken fan in the house, she is thrilled with all the songs - the title track seems to be her favorite so far.Too bad the lyrics to the songs were not included along with the liner notes. Guess the producers decided to go with the fold-out Clay Aiken poster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"clay you deserve something better than that","review":"I just tried listening to the cd again and still could not find myself liking anything in it. they all soumd alike and boring, the arrangements are so horrible and mediocre and for anyone used to good music this just doesn't make sense.In fairness to Clay who has an awesome and powerful voice, you do not deserve this crap of songs and i hope that he would look into these seriously. please realize that the fans are a varied bunch from the teenyboppers to the older ones with very discriminating tastes. i happen to be one of them, and though i loved all of the AI2 performances i was really expecting something that would be appealing and enjoyable. sadly i find nothing here that makes me want to listen to it again and again.I hope the second cd will be of better quality w/ good vocal and musical arrangement, better songs that would showcase Clay's singing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay please dont become so commercial!","review":"First let me start by saying that clay was y favorite American Idol, I thoght, and still think, that he should have beat Ruben, Now he very well could have been a member of the bubble gum band N Sync .the One Star is for clays great voice, the lack of the other 4 stars is for his giving into that teeny bopper sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled and Reused","review":"Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His \\"so-called\\" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New material","review":"I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice, Empty Soul","review":"Admitedly, he has a mesmerizing voice. HOWEVER, he still lacks the ability to have a grasp of the nuances and emotions to be shown in each songs that he sings. He's a born singer but he needs to get all the technical skills in singing before he could be labeled as the 'American Idol'. Unlike Clay, Josh Groban, though not yet fully polished too, could easily control his 'pianissimo and forte' and melt your heart. You don't have to worry if he would make any embarrassing kinks in his performance. As another comparison, Kelly Clarkson's performance is so firm and solid. She's qualified to be a true artist, while Clay isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was going to love this album, but didn't","review":"I really enjoyed Clay on AI2, was one of the first in line to preorder the album, and was really looking forward to receiving it. However, I was very disappointed. Not so much in Clay, but in the song selection. In fact, when I have it on, I have noticed so many of the songs sound alike, I have trouble identifying which one he is singing. They don't have the \\"inspired\\" feel that his voice can deliver. After listening to the album several times now, I'm giving up. I doubt it will hit my CD player again.I hope Clay has a long career and reaches a broad audience base, but in the words of Simon Cowell, \\"It didn't do it for me....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Voice","review":"Like most CD's that I purchase, there are songs I like, and songs that are just okay. The difference with this CD is Clay's voice. He could sing the Alphabet and make it sound great. Two of my favorite titles are Measure of a Man and When You Say You Love Me which has a little country flare to it. Go out and buy this CD. There is no other voice like Clay Aiken's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"devoted fan","review":"This is the best CD....I love all the songs. To pick a favorite it changes all the time...right now I enjoy \\"I Survived You\\" and \\"The Way\\". What a great job by Mr. Aiken. Refresehing to have an entertainer that can actually sing and does not have to use any foul language. Mr. Aiken certainly has hit the music world in a way that was much needed. I for one have been waiting for a great voice and someone with such great morals is just an added bonus. I love that Mr. Aiken is so intrested in helping others. I hope he continues his music career at least for now but I also hope he does what he wants to do!!!! I await the next concert (fortunate to see him already and he was awesome). The crowd response to Mr. Aiken is amazing. God Bless you Mr. Aiken and keep up the awesome music for your devoted fans!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked!","review":"There was not one song on this CD that impressed me. I expected more from Clay Aiken. His voice was drowned out by the music half the time and the lyrics did not capture my attention. In other words, there is not one track that I found myself humming or singing later.I force fed myself the whole CD just to get my monies worth. I was very dissappointed. Not worth buying. Hopefully, his next album will be more entertaining or at least bearable. I am a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!! :)","review":"Clay Aiken has got to be the BEST singer in the world! I LOVE this dude! His first CD, 'Measure of a Man', was absolutely AWESOME!! It includes hit songs such as 'Ivisible', 'The Way', 'When You Say You Love Me', 'No More Sad Songs', and 'Measure of a Man'. Not only are all the songs on the CD an awesome showcase and display of his voice, but they are all appropriate; no cussing or inappropriate references. I'm so proud that of him for being clean and staying true to his values. Kudos for Clay! Go out and buy this CD today! You will not regret it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - sorry","review":"I went mad for this guy during the American Idol trials! Sat down and watched and cheered each week; all excited when the album came out and more importantly arrived in Ireland! But when I listened to it; he didn't sound at all like he did in American Idol.I think his song choices on this album left a lot to be desired. Where were all the brilliant songs he sang on the American Idol show? That's what I wanted to hear, that's what I would WANT to hear if I went to see him live in concert.But other than that, I wish him well and hope he takes note of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 decent songs, rest of it-blah","review":"I like \\"Touch\\" best, \\"This is the Night\\" & \\"Invisible\\" are also pretty good, but I'm over \\"Invisible\\" by now. The rest of the CD just runs together for me. I get no feeling from Clay, although he has a good voice, he has little emotion and tends toward glory or held notes to impress. My least favorite of the 4 idol CDs I own, even Justin's gets played more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad music at its best","review":"this is the worst album i have heard since barry manilow . clay did a snow job on the american people witrh this crap he put out songs with no meaning at all. give me back my money clay. kelly clarkson was far better then this junk that no one wants to listen to. go back to georgia red clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horridly overproduced and carbon-copy crap.","review":"My husband purchased this for me since I fell in love with Clay's voice on American Idol...how very disappointed I was. Soulless and drenched in over-production, his voice comes off as perfect-pitch robotic. Think of it as air-brushed to perfection, which is certainly not a good thing. It sounds like every other pop album out there, including his AmIdol cohorts. Ugh. Pure rubbish.I know that I am going to get a very low mark from people reading this, but dont take my word for it. Take the words of the 100 people here on amazon.com selling this crap for $2 a pop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back in the studio and Try Again","review":"I agree with the woman who reviewed this album. It just sounds like Backstreet Boys and Nsync music recreated in 2003. Been there done that. Clay needs to step his game up if he wants to last in the music industry any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is the measure of a man","review":"This cd was awesome, i love clay...everything he does it just amazes me more and more. I would have loved to see more of the range that he possesses but its all good. I love you clay, keep on going strong!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken is a hometown hero","review":"Clay Aiken is a hometown hero because he stands for something. He knows who he is and will not back down from his beliefs. I like how he is not using sex to sell his CD's. This is truly a CD for people who enjoy pop music, hey its for people who enjoy all kinds of music. I congratulate him on his first CD and hope it goes platinum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely voice","review":"Clay Aiken's new CD is going to be a classic. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Those of us who have heard his demo's know what a wide range of songs he can sing - beautifully. Measure of A Man has brought music back into my life. There are very few offerings these days of enjoyable music.It is rare when you enjoy more than 2 or 3 songs on a CD. On this CD, I love every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLATINUM BOUND - NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!!!!","review":"This is the best CD I have ever listened to in some 20 years and Clay's voice is just wonderful!! It's refreshing to listen to a CD that is not full of \\"sexual overtone and vulgar\\" type lyrics. Clay Aiken certainly delivers on each and every song on the album. There is not one song on this CD that I skipped over. Billboard was right when they said that his CD is \\"THE BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003\\". The other critics who gave unfavorable reviews don't know what they are talking about. The more you listen to the entire CD, the better it is and after just listening a few times, you easily pick up the words and can sing along (can't say that with some of the other \\"stuff\\" that is out there)! I highly recommend that you buy this CD. I can't wait for other CD's by Clay Aiken. Way to go RCA and Clay Aiken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"What a refreshing break from the majority of today's popular music! I also like the fact that women and girls of all ages are drawn to Clay. It's a nice album by a nice kid. The songs are not phenomenal, but I'm sure in time Clay will be able to choose better material to showcase his talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN!!!!","review":"WOW! Thank you for this wonderful cd! I truly enjoy listening to Measure Of A Man so much!!! Excellent cd, looking forward to Solitaire coming out with The Way in late January!!! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to the party","review":"I never watched American Idol and I rarely listen to pop music, but I clicked on this CD one day and listened to the clips just to see what all the fuss was about. I liked what I heard, bought it, and I have played it every day since then. There's just something about it, there's not a bad track on there. Is it the most well-crafted, lyrically sophisticated CD made this year? No, but it is entertaining, catchy, and let's face it, Clay's voice could make the phone book sound good. There isn't anything that is going to appeal to everyone. If you like what you hear from the clips, you're going to like the whole CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MAN HAS BEEN MEASURED","review":"After listenting to this CD since 10/14/03 numerous times daily---I enjoy each song every time I listen to the CD. \\"The Way\\" \\"Run to Me\\" \\"Shine\\" \\"Touch\\" are my front runners right now but I enjoy all the songs. Why is Clay so intesting--his eyes, his mouth and his incredible voice!! Can the guy sing-YES! I saw Clay in concert during the AI tour--he has that quality that comes out and WOWS the crowd and holds you thru each and every performance and he has done the same with his first CD! I will continue buying his music because of his wonderful qualities!!!You go CLAY! And if you have not heard him sing \\"Noel\\" on the Holiday CD you are missing probably the best verison of the song I have ever heard!!! Makes you want to stand up and shout to the heavens!Clay measures up in every way as a true entertainer in every way possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS EXCELLENT!","review":"I gave this CD five stars because of Clays incredible voice. I will concede the fact that the production and the song choices could have been better. Nevertheless, Clays voice is so AMAZING that any shortfalls in the production and material is easily offset with Clays musical prowess. There are however, some excellent songs on this CD, such as The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man and Shine.DONT LISTEN TO THE CLAY HATERS THAT COME HERE ON AMAZON AND GIVE THIS CD ONLY ONE STAR! Those people are just haters of good music and they are trying to persuade you not to buy this CD. Also, granted some of the five star reviews may be from \\"Claymates\\" but that does not negate the fact that this CD is really good.BUY THIS CD! It is entertaining and fun. Isn't that why we all buy CD's, to be entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"clay- not all hes craked up to be....","review":"he sings good, but he sings bad songs, the only good song is The Way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous effort","review":"Clay Aiken needs to take a seat. His 15 minutes of fame has ended and it's a wrap for him. He should stick to doing broadway tunes and not Pop. His album is a sad attempt and i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone... not even my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckiness!","review":"This geek reminds me of a watered down Elton John except that one thing, real talent. She he can sing but at leased Elton John wrote his own songs. Clay's voice sounds a lot like Elton's but too bad his 15 minutes of fame are up. He will always have the words \\"American Idol\\" written beneath him which is why he will not go far. He is an Elton John-wannabe like Kelly Clarkson is a Mariah Carey-wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja vu (like a bad dream over and over again!)","review":"Wow! Can you hear it?? Listen - listen very carefully! The music here is the same as Kelly Clarkson's album, only with different lyrics and Clay singing instead of Kelly! Can I sue somebody??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped mediocre debut","review":"There is no artistry is this first endeavor. Some of the lyrics are painfully odd and Aiken's delivery lacks depth, texture, nuance, finesse, and diversity. Yes, he is a guy who can sing, but he is not an interesting singer. He is certainly not original, nor do I get a sense that there is any real emotion behind the delivery. I feel like I'm being sung at rather than sung to. I admit to never being a fan of glory noting brand of singing, and Aiken only solidifies that conviction.I didn't find him interesting on AI and he is even less so on this debut. Aiken has proclaimed that he is not an artist, just a guy from a reality show. So far, he's confirmed the limitations of his musical aspirations.As for his sales. Well, McDonalds sells alot of burgers... that doesn't make the burgers any better quality. Nothing's wrong with those who enjoy a fast food burger, please enjoy, but don't insist it's filet mignon."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED","review":"Pointless CD unless u like badly sung ballads that have no meaning worst thing everdo not be persuaded by these \\"claymate\\" people they are biased and know that clay does infact stink they just can't except it if u know wats good for u STAY AWAY FROM \\"MEASURE OF A MAN\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Real music..","review":"I thought it was great...I actually liked every song track on it....What a great person & a wonderful voice...Looking forward to his next Cd....Finally a Cd where I can understand the words & one that I can listen to around anyone!!RLK"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It So Much That I Bought A Second One!","review":"Well, I really did not know exactly what to expect from this CD, but, being that I am a Clay Aiken fan I had to have one. Not to mention the one that I have bought here at Amazon.com.. I played the CD and then played it again. And I have to say that I am happy with all the tracks on it. As a matter of fact I am having trouble deciding which one I like best. I did decide however that I would like to give this CD to a few friends of mine for Christmas gifts, so it was back to the store for me. I think that this is probably the best value for my music money spent in a long time. I thank you for the opportunity to express my opinion and review this CD. I hope all that purchase Measure Of A Man will enjoy it as much as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's star continues to shine ......","review":"What can I say about this amazing guy? He just never stops amazing me. It seems with each song he sings ... each interview he gives ... he just gets better and better. Measure Of A Man is a perfect example of this. Whether it's upbeat cuts like \\"Invisible\\" or \\"Touch\\" or wonderful, touching songs like \\"Run To Me\\", \\"The Way\\", or \\"I Will Carry You\\" ... it's clear Clay has the voice, talent, and personality to be the next big thing on the music scene. Although never having met Clay, I am so proud of all that he's already accomplished (You go, Clay!!) ... and look forward to seeing his star shine on, and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's CD Surpasses Expectations","review":"Wow, Clay's new Cd is even better than I thought it would be!He is my favorite new artist and his amazing voice touches my soul. Every song on this CD is good. Great job, Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"After just listening to a few clips of this CD on the internet made me want this one. Now after hearing the entire CD, I am soooo glad to have one!!!! Clay's voice is truly remarkable, the lyrics great, and the music is beautiful. I recommend this highly, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow what a bomb","review":"i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I don't think this guy sucks completely but he is pretty overrated. I read articles saying that he is the next Elvis Presley. Hahahaha, that's funny. I can see him being the next Richard Marx but he's never gonna be up there with the king.Triumph The Insult Comic Dog said it best...\\"Ruben or Clay, which one to pick? It's like choosing what puddle of vomit to lick\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I put this cd on and my dog started howling. As if there was a full moon. This CD is horrible. American Idol is stupid. If any of these clowns had an iota of talent, they would have signed to a label already ( See Kelly and Justin movie- that movie made about half a million at the box office!). I looked at the notes on the CD. He didnt write one song? So basically someone picked all of these songs for him. This CD makes me wretch. Also, dude is kinda ugly for a teen idol. In fact all of the winners and runner up are horrible looking. WTF?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will agree","review":"I broke out in a cold sweat listening to this album. I don't like this album and you will surly agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measuring a Man? Not high on my scale","review":"I believed that Clay would be someone who could bring something different to the table. But in fact his album is everything thats wrong with the pop world. The songs are bland and he is trying to appeal to one group instead of his entire fan base. The songs are very meh and so contrived you would have thought he recorded them yesterday in the car. This album is not what the record industry needs to spruce itself up. Barry Manilow and Micheal Bolton already reign the Adult COntempory charts why do we need more cheesy pop songs??? This is an album controlled by the makers of American Idol, not a record company. Its a shame that the other idols have respectable albums even if they are not blockbusters. Measure of a Man is strictly produced to make money not to be a sensation. It would be nice to see some crativity in this! very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd week sale percentages tell the whole truth!!!","review":"Honestly, this cd is not worth buying at ALLLLLL! Clay Aiken may be #1 again on the charts , but look at how much the sales percentage dropped off ( 60+ percent is the percentage.) Wow!!!that's a big decrease in sales. I guess all the so called \\"claymates\\" could not afford to buy in the multiples like they obviously did the first week of sales, or realized that he's not worth going broke over!!! Nice try though \\"claymates.\\" Better luck next time, if he's lucky enough to get one. One star for pitty!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Not only is clay really ugly, he sucks. Radio stations are saying his 1st single is the only song that isn't annoying and \\"easy listening\\" for the older people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay Aiken will not be getting any this Christmas.","review":"Clay, Clay, Clay. Knock it off. Seriously, you are getting on America's nerves. You didn't win American Idol, and you don't deserve to release this album. What's really annoying is that there are only positive reviews of this album on Amazon.com. Hopefully Amazon.com won't censor the freedom of speech, and the freedom to let you know before you do a stupid thing, that this album is a disgrace to Music as we knew it. The only reason one should buy this album is to discourage someone else from buying by publicly setting it on fire or by letting your friends listen to it... a word of caution: listen near the toilet so you don't have far to go when you have to throw up."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO CLAY!!!","review":"This Album is a wonderful collection of beautiful songs by an outstanding performer. It is so wonderful to have a CD where I love every track. My Way, Run to Me, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man, When You Say You Love Me are especially great! Buy this CD if you love Adult Contemporary pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift of Music","review":"What a wonderful gift I received on October 14, 2003. Clay Aiken, Clive Davis and all others associated with Measure of a Man are to thank. As are those who voted Clay Aiken into the CD making business. Thank you.I won't waste time reiterating the many five star reviews. I do, however, want to make my own statement by saying that Clay Aiken's breath-taking voice fills every song with passion and sincerity. This is the most enjoyable new music I've heard in a very long time. If you purchase this CD and listen with your heart, I'm sure you will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's voice shines through","review":"Reading the reviews it seems that many are based on the like or dislike of Clay or the continuation of a Ruben/Clay competition. Get over it! Ruben won the AI contest, they are both talented singers and their styles are different. That said, my critique of the album is that the songs are a little weak, overly orchestrated in some cases and some hokey instrumentals in other cases. Clay's voice, however, shines through and overcomes the weak material and the little time that was taken to put the album together. If you are sentimental and romantic at heart, like ballads, like to sing along, love Clays voice ... or any of the above, you will like this album. It just makes you feel good. Despite its shortcomings, I couldn't give it less than 4 stars since I love it and listen to it at least once a day. My favorite is The Way co written by Enrique Iglesias and hopefully we'll see some more like this on the next album ... stronger songs to match the depth of Clay's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Has Gone Too Far","review":"To Pearl Jam Lion, I really don't appreciate being threanted withmy life because I like a particular artist, or a different typeof music that is obviously not the music you enjoy.It is peoplesuch as yourself that help make this a more freightening planet.So I have forwared your \\"review\\" to the Center for Hate Crimes asa possible person to watch. I also forwared it to the Center forPeople with Eratic and unusual Behavior. There is also an agencyfor terroristic threats by person or by proxy, especially overthe internet. So I am glad you got printed and you have yourselfa nice little day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only American Idol worth listening to","review":"This album will not disappoint. I am not a big fan of Clay Aiken but I ended up enjoying the album; you will never hear more beautiful songs as softly sung by him. He sings in a voice that is smooth, mature- and he can really soar when he wants. This is a great \\"feel good\\"album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop playing this CD","review":"This week I keep thinking up reasons to spend time in my car so I can play this CD over and over. I'm not sure what I expected but this isn't it. This is so different from American Idol music. This music is fresh and new and filled with Clay Aiken's beautiful voice in all its range and power. I can't stop smiling. This is the future of pop music. There are a few tracks where I wish the background production was scaled back to let that pure voice shine through, but all in all I am surprised and very very pleased. More More!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Measure of a Man","review":"After listing to this album I can give it nothing but high praise. I think that Clay Aiken is the voice of reason that our world needs right now as so many people are affecting our children and how they see the world. This album is positive, upbeat and fun with a positive messgae!! Way to go Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly disappointed","review":"I have to say, I too am one of Clay's \\"older\\" fans. (Just under 38). He has been labeled as a broadway kind of singer, and the tunes he sang on American Idol were true Clay (belt-em-out) style. I don't hear this on this album. I do like the album, but it wasn't what I expected. I would love to see him do another album, maybe of some show tunes or the like. Don't get me wrong, I could listen to him sing everyday, all day. It just doesn't get any better than that voice... Would love to see Solitaire on the next one. Also got to say I'm loving the articles. Way to go for standing up for yourself and who you are, even though I loved the belly shot on Rolling Stone. I do give you some serious credit. Fighting the big boys can't be easy. Keep the albums coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Clay Aiken has a voice that touches my heart and soothes my soul. I love every song on this CD, so it's a tough call to name a favorite when they all gave me chills...and a few brought tears to my eyes. \\"Run To Me\\" is so very haunting and beautiful, and \\"Measure of a Man\\" and \\"The Way\\" are both touching and tender and exquisitely performed. An awesome debut, well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's CD","review":"I honestly didn't think the CD would be as good as it is. I did expect great, but this is awesome. First time I have listened to a CD all the way through. Even if he didn't write the songs, he sounds like he means every word. Excellent Album!!! KEEP IT UP CLAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You definitely want to buy this CD...","review":"I read the first few reviews on Clay's CD and I think that the CD is really good, because every song on there is good, not just the first three. and that's hard to find. Clay showed a lot of magic on the competition of American Idol in his voice and that was toned down on the album which wasn't so great. The songs on the album are absolutely clean, the only word that Clay uses that's sort of slang is \\"baby\\" and it's rarely found throughout the album. It's a very family-friendly album and I feel like I can listen to this for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREAM RISES TO THE TOP","review":"It is evident that the previous reviewer who uses profanity - totally uncalled for - has used this forum to simply bash Clay. He has not purchased the CD nor listened to it. Let's grow up and use this for the reason it is intended - to review the CD, not bash the artist.The CD is awesome, and as time will tell, cream always rises to the top....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars!","review":"I am crazy about this cd. I got it today. Thanks Amazon for your quick service. My favorite songs are Perfect Day and Shine. They are brilliant songs with a beautiful message. Clay's voice soars in strength and sicerity. Don't miss this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is so awesome!","review":"I thought Clay's single was good, but this is the best cd ever! Ofcourse I am and always have been a huge Clay fan, ever since i first saw him, but this cd blew me away! I love Clay Aiken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations","review":"This CD is amazing! As if Clay's voice wasn't sensational enough, you can really tell how hard he's been working on these songs. You would think he's been professional his whole life! This CD is a must have. Clay is the American Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Icon","review":"Clay has one of the most moving and true voices in music today. For the true Clay fan and those who love good pop music, this album will definitely not disappoint. Clay's talent shines on songs like \\"The Way\\",\\"Shine\\", and the title song. He's got crossover appeal and a voice that speaks to the heart. I cannot wait to see how fast this album goes platinum! Applause!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the Measure of a MAN!","review":"This Album is awesome! Measure of Man has a catchy beat, as well as Perfect Day. Invisible is fun. Touch has the best chance of getting radio play. Hearing This is the Night reminded me why this single was the best selling of 2003. I Survived you, an anthem to anyone who has had a broken heart. Shine is fun, uplifting. The Way, an awesome love song. (one of Clay's Favs too!) When You Say You Love Me, sounds a little country but good! Clay is absolutely incredible! I love you, CLAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Does Wonders with Even Lesser Songs","review":"I rarely like all the songs on a single CD, but I genuinely LIKE these songs. I particularly like \\"Measure of a Man\\" for it's message, but moreso for the sincerity Clay puts behind it. \\"Touch\\" is also a favorite of mine.Clays voice and phrasing are flawless. If I had to criticize I'd have to say the production value in the music itself could be taken up a notch or two to shine as much as Clay's voice. I'm hoping Clay has more control of his second project. I'm getting my money's worth out of this CD though.If you're having a bad day or a good day just put in \\"Measure of a Man\\" and your day will get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Clay Aiken is just amazing. Really, he is. This whole CD is just KICK BUTT and shows how much better than Ruben he is. Clay's voice is just magical and outstanding. And I really love his whole transformation from geek with an amazing voice to heart-throb with an amazing voice.This CD is a must have. You will definitely enjoy it. I listen to his songs repetitively and yet I never seem to get bored of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a great CD? This is it!","review":"When was the last time you purchased a CD and loved every song on it? That long huh? Clay Aiken's Measure of Man is filled with outstanding songs. Once you listen it will be hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to it would be between track 3 or track 10, The Way and Perfect Day. I purchased this CD after reading all the reviews, and it hasn't been out of my CD player since. This is a must have, you won't be disappointed, you will be glad you bought this one. His brilliant voice is truly remarkable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of the best pop CDs of 2003!!!","review":"\\"Measure of a Man\\" is truly one of 2003's best pop albums, thanks in large part to its brilliant production, fabulous songs (not a clunker in the bunch), and, of course, the amazing voice of Clay Aiken.Hard to pick a favorite, but the title track is worth the price of the album in my opinion.As I write, this CD is #1 on the charts. Clay, you are destined for a long and successful career, and this wonderful album is just the beginning!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"At first I was just neutral about the CD. Some songs were great while a few I felt were geared to the teenie bop generation. After listening to the CD about 50 times so far..(Im addicted to it)...anyway, after listening to it so many times Ive gotten to the point where I love every song on there. Some songs dont fit in to any particular genre but there are some that will be played on the radio and a lot Im sure. This CD is well worth it. He is so talanted. My CD player broke last night and Im feeling the effects of withdrawel as we speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 months later.....","review":"I bought this cd immediately because I watched some of AI2 and was mesmerized by Clay Aiken's voice. Truthfully, I didn't expect much at first, as it seemed to be a hurriedly put out album. (I expected it to be cover after cover.) But, the first time I listened to MOAM, I was impressed! To those who criticise the lack of \\"edginess\\", you can get all the \\"edginess\\" you can bear from some of the rest of those \\"artists\\" out there....So going on two months later, where is that cd? In my home, my car, my husband's car....you get the picture. Clay should win a grammy for this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken \\"Measures\\" up to expectations","review":"This album is excellent and I would recomend it to anyone who has any sense of taste in music. Clay delivers an exquisite debut CD with powerful vocals and lyrics. A great buy and well worth the few dollars required to buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"Clay is magnificent as usual and I love everyone of the songs on his CD. He has a wonderful voice and it really shows on the album. I have had it one day and have listened to it over and over. Can't get enough of it. Wonderful guy with an awesome voice. Go out and buy it, you wont be dissapointed. A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN IS JUST FABULOUS!","review":"THIS CD IS VERY ENJOYABLE. CLAY AIKEN IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR COMPARED TO ALL THE GARBAGE PLAYING ON THE RADIO THESE DAYS. CLAY DOESN'T NEED VULGARITY,VIOLENCE AND HALF-NAKED, SLUTTY WOMEN TO SELL HIS MUSIC. HE HAS NATURAL, BORN-WITH TALENT THAT NO ONE CAN TOP! THANK-YOU CLAY FOR YOUR WONDERFUL VOICE AND ROLE-MODEL ATTRIBUTES! YOU ARE A GIFT FROM HEAVEN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Clayton","review":"Finally a CD that I love \\"ALL\\" the tracks. I hope this is the first of many to add to my collection. Awesome, beautifully done! There is now hope that music will be music once again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave american idol in the past and just listen","review":"I have never been a fan of american idol but heard the song \\"Invisible\\" on the radio and loved both the song and the voice of Clay Aiken. I went out and bought the cd and it is full of amazing songs. I think people are putting too much emphasis on where he has come from and need to listen to the music's lyrics and hear what he is trying to tell you. I thought each song was beautifuly sung and appreciate the message and work from the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I've been waiting for this CD for MONTHS...and it was NOT a let down! I LOVE IT! It's SOOO AWESOME...I don't hear one thing wrong with it whatsoever. It's worth every star...and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay makes us proud!!!!","review":"Anyone that knows the type of person Clay is from what we have all read, heard or just know deep down inside, will see that this Album is perfect for Clay. Each song has a different beat, they are all wonderful clean songs. They are about love and life. Clay hasn't let me down, he makes me proud of him. I loved each song. I can't say which one is my favorite because they are all so good. The music from Clay is going to be different, and special. Refreshing from all the hard, dirty music you hear now a days on the radio. That is how I feel about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True American Idol Ever!!!","review":"This is one CD that I can listen over and over again and still get chills. CLAY Aiken Has a God given Gift He is amazingly talented and very Sexy. For the Person who was negative about Him just to boost Taylor Hicks and His CD there is no need to bash the True American Idol Clay Aiken just to get Your point for Taylor accross. I too Love Taylor I was part of the soul patrol and I do have Under the Radar and while it's ok it pales in any comparison to any of Clays CD's. Buy Measure of A Man and any CD Clay records You won't be sorry. He is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Has a Voice","review":"Mr. Aiken can sing. Something that seems to be rare with so called pop stars these days. I love that I can listen to this CD and understand the words to every song clearly. The power in his voice is unsurpassed by anyone in recent years. Every song on this CD is great. It would be impossible to pick a favorite. I can't wait for his next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Artist","review":"I love Clay Aiken, and I am a die-hard fan...I guess you could call me a \\"Claymate.\\" The CD is really good, but I really would have liked to see some better-known writers (such as Neil Sedaka, who has said he would like to write for Clay) write some songs for the album and help to show off Clay's power and range. He does well on the songs here, but I know he's capable of better.A note to the negative reviewers: Most of you, I think, are either jealous of Clay of have nothing better to do. If you're going to write such horrible things about Clay, you should be doing something else with your time. You don't need to just blatantly come out and say \\"Clay sucks.\\" It insults your own intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I am an avid fan of Clay, and in my opinion, this cd did not give justice to his talent. It was a big disapointment. The emotions and the magic were just not there. I hope RCA realizes that its the golden voice of Clay that gains admiration, and that they should not change Clay's style of singing, as his voice in this cd is just mediocre. I could not even believe that it was him who was singing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Debut!","review":"This is a very polished CD-Clay has done an amazing job! Every song is quite good. I feel that anyone unfamiliar with Clay would be impressed with his smooth,soaring vocals. A very classy CD to be enjoyed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My wife and I are huge Clay fans. We were both very disappointed in the songs on this CD, with the exception of the title song. The background percussion was often overpowering. We also didn't like the \\"boy band\\" type songs on this CD. The only thing that is positive about the CD is Clay's amazing voice (to the extent it can be heard over the background noise)! We hope Clay's next CD will be produced by Neil Sedaka and focus on Clay's wonderful voice, with only minimal accompaniment."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth waiting for","review":"I bought the cd and have listened to it many times. Clay doesn't disappoint. If you liked him on AI and if you liked his single; you'll love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Voice","review":"I knew without a doubt that I was going to buy Clay Aikens new CD before it even hit the stores. This man could sing nursery rymes and it would sound amazing. His new CD is more than amazing. I listen to it over and over again. The songs on this CD are worth singing along with and the music is worth dancing too. Clays new CD is awesome for date night or when you just want to relax alone. I predict hearing some of his music in movies. Both my daughter and I love this CD and I bet you will too! Way to go Clay, thank you for this awesome music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! A MUST BUY!","review":"Every song on this CD is good. I can't pick a favorite song because I love them all. There is such a good variety as well. You won't be disappointed when you buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN IS AWESOME AND SO IS THIS CD!!!","review":"This is a GREAT CD for Clay Aiken, the best tracks on this CD are Track 1 Invisible and Track 6 Run to me. I think he will have number one hits with both. The whole CD is great and it shows Clays talent and his versatility as an artist, they really did a good job with this one, Clay I Love Ya!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Clay!","review":"If I read one more scathing review from some so-called music critic I am definitely going to have to start cancelling some subscriptions! This is a great, great album! It's so nice to actually be able to understand the words and Mr. Aiken's voice is just incredible! I went to work today with the lyrics running through my head and a smile on my face! I am so tired of critics trying to categorize Clay's music. I'm probably the last person who expected to be so connected to Clay's music. Two weeks ago I got a speeding ticket on the way home while listening to Aerosmith! There's just something so wonderfully refreshing about Clay and his music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait!!!!","review":"LOVED IT! It was worth the wait. Clay's voice is amazing! I can't wait until his next CD. I especially love Measure of a Man and Invisable..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay Should Have Stuck with the Ballad Type Music","review":"Don't get me wrong.....I am 100% Clay fan....but....this CD was a disappointment. The songs are more teeny-bopper type of songs. \\"David Cassidy\\" re-visited. His choices of music on American Idol suited him much better. Hopefully his NEXT CD will bring him back to that format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"I know this guy's considered \\"(...)\\" or w/e by alot of people but I'll be honest, I'm a teenage guy and I actually liked his first single, it wasn't half bad. This new song \\"The Way\\", just sucks. And the video doesn't help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe how plain this is!","review":"I am in shock at the blandness of this debut CD! I don't see the real Clay Aiken in the production at all. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Hits/Some Misses","review":"Clay Aiken has an amazingly awesome voice. He can be powerful and passionate, playful, rocky, and sensitive and soulful.Hits:InvisibleTouchPerfect DayThe WayNo More Sad SongsRun To MeMisses:I Will Carry You-This song has a good message, but it's lost in the monotonous tempo and forgettable sound. It's a very boring and unmemorable song.Shine-This song has the worst lyrics of them all. \\"Hey Butterfly, open your weary eyes\\". It totally drowns out Clay's voice and makes him sound like someone he is not.Possible Hits:I Survived YouMeasure of a ManWhen You Say You Love me"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time and money","review":"Oh Great just what America needs, another souless, overhyped no talent John Mayer wannabe. I haven't and won't buy this cd but workong in a record store I had to check it out and see what all the fuss was. The songs are poorly written and meaningless. Clay himself sounds as if he belongs in a highschool production of Grease. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you actually like this kind of drab souless music just pick up John Mayer's new cd, at least he sounds like a talented singer rather than a aspiring drama queen with a sore throat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"CLay Aiken is the best - his CD is fabulous and he is so much better than Ruben Stoddard. He is a genuine American Idol,handsome, cute, loves God, wholesome, and a really nice person. I only hope he stays #1 forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd is great - but he's better in person","review":"To those of u who critize this album, you haven't heard him since these songs in person! His voice is so powerful I can see why Randy said \\"where is that voice coming from\\". The Way is great as is Touch. Invisible is catchy and is what he is identified with.He sings beautifully - so talented - and will be around for a long time. Go see him!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He has a Decent Voice but He ain't no RUBEN!","review":"first of all Clay Aiken has a decent Voice but make no mistake about it Ruben clearly was the Man Vocally of the two.Clay has this Safe run of the mill Material which He shouldn't be doing so soon.but then again considering what Rod Stewart has been doing with His Last two Projects then I think Clay should have done that instead.Rod needs these Songs&Clay needs to do what Rod is doing.nothing on here has Knock Out written on it.very Bland&dry.Clay deserves better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay's Voice Should Be the Music","review":"I absolutely love Clay's voice, and I couldn't wait for the release of this disappointing debut. But the nuances of his voice that make it so phenomenal are hidden underneath the \\"music.\\" I would rather hear Clay singing acappella or singing just about anything other than these songs. Why cover up such a beautiful voice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect","review":"As always listening to his voice gives me chills! Its not his fault,but I could only give him a 4 out of 5. The producers and song writers stole the other point. Clay is so talented. He has proven over and over he can sing any song...so why dont the producers and song writers give him better material? Some of the songs are a little on the \\"bubblegum\\" side. Clay is a grown man and needs more grown up songs. The last thing I want for him is to see him not taken seriously because he is being produced for a quick dollar with the teen generation. He is too good for that. He needs some songs that are going to get airplay on adult stations. I would have liked some soft rock songs. \\"No more sad song\\" and \\"Perfect Day\\" just might make it. Dont take this as a bad review...on the contrary I would recommend it to everyone. I have not put it down since I got it the day of release. Its worth the money and aside from the few bubblegum songs the CD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy","review":"Before I begin I must say that I'm a fan of Idols. However I only watched the final show of the American Idols in which Clay was a contestant, so I really didn't know much about him.Why did I get this cd? Well from what I saw he had potential. And I must admit that I was right. This cd is perfect for a gift for someone who is a fan of Idols. Clay has an amazing voice. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Well it's a good cd and all, but it doesn't have that gold quality. Don't get my wrong, I play this often when in the car but there's not a great variety between all the songs. 'Measure Of A Man' is definitely my favourite!If you're into this light-hearted, catchy music then you'll be right at home here. However if you want something deeper I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I don't regret purchasing this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the greatest!!","review":"I waited so long for this CD and it was so worth the wait!!! His voice is so soulful. I love it!! This CD is so great and his voice makes every woman's heart melt. He is the American Idol winner!! His voice The songs Great! Great! Great! Buy! Buy! Buy! It is worth every penny. Thanks Clay for having the voice and the talent for making me excited about music again!!! I can't wait for CD #2 and your tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barry Manilow meets Neal Diamond","review":"This is a huge diappointment. The producers of this CD should be publicly flogged. Clay's fans love his strong, booming voice and ability to pound out ballads. You'll hear NONE of that on this CD. I am amazed that producers with decades of experience wouldn't understand that fans want to hear the full range of Clay's voice. Instead, what you will hear are a bunch of sappy, run of the mill pop tunes that will uninspire. Save your money and buy some old Barry Manilow cd's. At least you'll get what you are paying for. Let's hope, on his next CD, that Clay is allowed to sing the way we all know that he can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than expected!","review":"Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"EGAD!!!","review":"Listen up and watch that video for \\"Invisible\\" to see what pre-fab crapola Clay Aiken is up to. Remember when U2 had a spontaneous street concert and were shut down by the police? Well, Aiken's video for \\"Invisible\\" wants to convince us that his song \\"Invisible,\\" which isn't about much, has such political relevance and cachet that the police and a HELICOPTER have to suddenly rush in and hold the fans at bay. It's all calculated, guaranteed to provide his voice -- which deserves better -- to seem dangerous, although that danger has been carefully accounted for. Oh, Clay's not dangerous, except to ask people to open up their wallets for a song that is designed by a hit factory and make it SEEM politically relevent. Thanks a lot, Clay. If you were invisible -- oh wait, you already are."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHA!!!","review":"HAHAHAHA!!! Poor little Clay fans, all whining and crying because Clay didn't get any Grammy nominations! You wanna know why he didn't get any nominations? Well, it's really quite simple...he doesn't deserve any credit for releasing this piece of garbage CD!!! If you really think this album is one of the best of the year, I feel sorry for you because you are missing out on a lot of other music that actually is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's Editorial Review is pretty much correct!","review":"With the exception of Clay Aiken outselling Ruben Studdard's debut album, everything else is an accurate description of MOAM in the Amazon Editorial Review. Ruben's Debut album will not be released until December 9, so, your facts are wrong there, however, an easy mistake since a lot of the 5 star reviewers have said over and over themselves how many albums Clay Aiken has sold over Ruben. What this information has to do with a CD review is beyond me.The remainder of the Editorial Review is an excellent review of MOAM. Definitely gives the consumer real information instead of the excessive spammed 5 star reviews that have been written over and over by the same group of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst thing a musician could be----boring","review":"Clay Aiken is the kind of polished but staid crooner that fills so many hotel lounges.His voice is absolutely unremarkable, he takes absolutely no risks, and his music absolutely sends me off to sleep.The best word to describe this CD is 'ponderous'. Like any of Clay's songs, its so holier-than-thou it makes you want to gag. At one end you have rap thugs talking about pimps and hos and crack deals and AK 47s, and then this guy comes in from the other side, blindfolded, and then goes on and on about how good and pure and untainted and sweet life is...........Hello Mr Aiken, or should I call you Saint Aiken, do you not see how wicked the world actually is? And you just want to close your eyes and sing all your meaningless sentimental platter to a world that has already seen so much?But enough said. Don't buy this CD. Save your money for some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG! This is really, really awful","review":"I finally put myself in front of the thing, and listened, and I raelly wanted to enjoy it even though I figured I wouldn't. And my instincts were right - this is nothing but pop pablum, and not even well sung or well produced pop pablum.Musically it is totally uninsteresting - all hooks and psuedo-poppish melodic lines that fail to compel me in any way whatsoever. I was happy when the music ended.If one must listen to pop music (and I'd suggest that you please expand your musical horizons) you can do way, way better than this guy.He really does follow in the footsteps of 'NStink and Backstreet Boys - continuing the flood of crap into mainstream America.Yuck!There is some (though very little) GOOD pop music. Not surprisingly, Clay Aiken is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why do people like this fake music that is written by people other than the person who is actually singing it? This American Idol stuff is uncreative and for impotent minds. Reality that lacks reality. I lisetend to a few songs on here and sure Mr Aiken is a good singer, but there is no way I will buy into this facade. I will only listen to real music, and what I mean by real music is musicians that write and perform their own songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD is so amazing, I've been listening all weekend to it! Clay is such an astounding singer, and this is a really great album! The songs are just so perfect to listen while doing anything. My favorite songs on it are probably invisible, I will carry you, when you say you love me, run to me, and perfect day, but i absolutely love all of them, it's hard to pick. support clay and buy this great album!!!! A billion stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Air","review":"How refreshing, a true must buy for all Clay Aiken fans. Every song is a bankable future hit. Great start to a hopefully long musical carrer for this American Treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars only because I'm in a nice mood.","review":"I guess the big questuin is: can he sing? He is technically proficient, but that's not enough in my book. He's just another cookie cutter singer in a sea of mediocrity. He's got the chops but there's no feeling or passion behind it. The music he's given doesn't help matters either, but then again the cliche lyrics suit his voice just fine. What makes artists like Bob Dylan and Tom Waits so endearing is not their vocal prowess (or lack thereof), it's the personality they infuse their music. Give Clay \\"Visions Of Johanna\\" or \\"Blue Valentines\\" to sing (I know, Don't give him ideas) and the songs would be rendered lifless and as exciting as a used kleenex. Songs like that you can't merely sing. You have to give it something special and I don't think Clay would be able to hack a real song like those. He's just another singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Television Trash","review":"Is this what the music industry has turned into? As if the zombied brain dead haven't ruined it enough for those of us that know how to turn off the television. Music is about capturing the intangable, not fashion makeovers for the poor little geek. Explore artists with creativity and not this junk that is being spoonfed to the masses. You know you'll just end up using this CD as a coaster in 2 months anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Have always liked Clay Aiken, but the songs and Clay's singing style all sound the same. It is an extremely non-versatile and very boring effort. Compared to Kelly Clarkson excellent Thankful CD, Clay himself should be \\"thankful\\" that his fans helped him debut at #1. \\"Measure of a Man\\" is truly a disappointing CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Amazon viewer dared give an HONEST review","review":"Why don't you people shut up your attacking of ever honest reviewer and actually listen to this drab piece of junk. So Clay can sing and he seems to be a nice guy. That does NOT make this mess a good album. It lacks everything that makes for a good album like originality, emotion, oh and how about having the album reflect the singer. This album has nothing to do with Clay. He didn't write one single word and therefore it is nothing but kareoke, which is exactly how it sounds. You obsessed people need to get a clue. Clay is not the messiah, he isn't even a real musician. A good singing voice alone does not an artist make. There are hundreds of equally talented singers out there doing commercial jingles. Clay got lucky by being noticed by a tv show, however a tv show is all this is. Real music fans will NEVER fall for this"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a buncha grade A suckers.","review":"What a great marketing scam. Create a show and sell cd's. Have no talent normals perform and destroy last weeks hits. Have audience assume that high pitched squeling is some form of singing. Have audienec choose the lame singer of choice, choice becomes poster boy for crap pop, and audience buys millions of record from said crap singer. If you call this music, you are a very lazy human being or a very gullible young person. At least crap pop singers like britney did work hard to become a pop poser, but these hacks just won a contest. But hey, I'm not wasting my money on this, so if you're the sucker than I hope you enjoy this illusion of music. The television producers are laughing all the way to the bank. Laughing at all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"clay has a nice voice, but all of his music sound a like, of course his fan's don't think so, even if it sounded horrible they would buy it. but moam is a thumb's down for me, maybe next time he can show more emotion's."},{"rating":"1","title":"clay's CD","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. Clay has a good voice, but this CD wasn't as good as I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fan of Clay Aiken would Love","review":"If you liked Clay Aiken's style of singing on American Idol, you'll love his first album, \\"Measure of a Man.\\" It's packed with songs that fit his character and reveal the force of his voice. You quickly find your favorites, but also the other tracks mysteriously have the power to grow on you as you listen to them the first or second time. You'll go from \\"liking it\\" to \\"what would I do without it\\" as you listen to it over time. Fans of vocalists alike with this American Idol show-stealer will embrace this CD more and more as the years go pass - it's a definite great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Singer --- Bad Album","review":"Aiken initially surprised me with his voice on the American Idol show. I listened to Ruben Studdard's \\"Soulful\\" Album as well as Aiken's effort. After listening to both, I purchased Ruben's Album and was extremely satisfied. While both artists have great voices, Aiken's album was full of boring tunes suited for Hotel elevators. I wouldn't recommend this album. Hopefully, his next CD will consist of stronger material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic Review from a Gift Recipient","review":"Hello, I was given this CD by a co-worker who wanted to Clay Forward with proceeds to go to the Aiken Foundation. I tried to be objective and as one who listens avidly to Streisand, Groban, and I am also a New Yorker who attends Broadway Plays, and the Opera, I was very optimistic. Clay Aiken is still young and has time to develop his voice. I was not impressed by this disc at all. It is light and popsy and not a very good first showing. I wish this young man luck in the future, he'll need it unless he gets better production help. If not, maybe I will catch him in one of the Broadway shows that I attend. He is at least THAT good.Thanks for the CD Sylvia."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss?","review":"Invisible is a great song, the best song on the cd. The rest is just blah and sounds the same. Clay has a very nice voice, but this cd is just plain boring. Broadway Clay could never have become a recording artist without the AI hype. He's certainly no Josh Groban, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameful.","review":"shame on all you pieces of crap for feeding the well oiled machine of manufactured pop crap.......i hope you all realzie that clay's lyrics and beats were all written by 40 year old men......im not disputing that he has an excellent voice ......but so do miillions otheres..........the only reason hes popular is because america is a rotten pool of television..........i love QUALITY television........which is so so rare...........but by watching American Idol and prompted this garbage to number one on the charts..........you are destroying artists with actual MUSICAL talent who can play there instruments......my only comfort is that this douche bags 15 minutes will soon be over.......anyways..........support bands with some talent........thank you for your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Boring","review":"Living in Australia we are in the middle of our first series of Australian Idol so I was very curious as to what Clay Aiken actually sounded like so brought this CD. I found the majority of the CD rather boring. I do already own both Kelly and Justins CD's both of which I find alot more entertaining than Clays.Clay's CD seems very radio friendly and MORish which I spose alot of people would like but I found that maybe I needed the Hype of American Idol II to enjoy him more."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are a nation of morons . . .","review":"It's hard to believe people buy this schtick. Between Mr. Aikens' overly dramatic singing and the really middle-of-the-road songs, there isn't anything here worth hearing more than once. Mr. Aiken might make a decent interpretive singer if he had more experience and better material. Maybe next time . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unhappy competition","review":"This album is wonderful. I can listen to it for hours, and I'm 65 years old. Please be cautious in believing critical reviews, as some people are unhappy that Clay's album came out before Ruben's. I'm sure Ruben's album will be really great also."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album in years !!!!","review":"I hadn't purchase a cd in years , this one is so worth it , the music, the voice, everything is so much more than i expected.

However, the more I listen to it, the more I like it.The choice of songs are not good enough though..... they don't really show his ability ... but I still give the CD a 5 stars... because Clay's voice is just sooooooooooooooo amazing....... I love listening to his voice.... Clay is a truly great singer!!Just hope he will pick better songs for his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Pop Fluff","review":"I was so disappointed with Clay's new CD. Not with Clay himself - I have been a fan for months and will continue to be so - but with the songs. Clay's amazing voice deserves a better showcase than these hastily written, one-dimensional tracks. I had heard a rumor that one of the songs would be Clay's masterful performance of Neil Sedaka's \\"Solitaire\\" - but it doesn't appear on the CD. It's the best performance I've heard from him, but apparently it wasn't \\"mainstream\\" enough for the producers.I hope Clay will be able to shed the \\"American Idol\\" moniker that is following him so insidiously. He is not your average pop star, but unfortunately this is your average pop album. Clay - and all his true fans - deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from a Great Artist","review":"This cd is truly worth the wait!

I usually by Country. Well suffice it to say, I will be buying everyone of Clay Aiken CDs. This CD is Phenomanol and will defentially be a HIT. You can feel/hear the passion coming from Clay as he sings each and everyone of these songs. It is a Must Buy for anybody who like honest to goodness Rock/Pop Music or for that Matter everybody should by this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man measures up","review":"Measure of a Man is one of those rare CDs where every single song is worth listening to!

The true World Idol has made a name for himself with this debut album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful album","review":"I had to stand and wait at 7:30 this morning for the Meijers folks to re-fill the sold out section for this album, but it was worth it.I love the songs on this album, and I love Clay's voice. The hard part would be to decide which song should be released to the radio next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost two months later & This CD is still the best!","review":"I bought this CD the day is came out. I still play it 3 or more times a day. My kids love and my 90 year old grandmother loves it. Clay's voice is really beautiful, it's to bad that you have Ruben fans on here trashing it just to make Ruben look better. How disapointing for Both Clay and Ruben. If you want to hear some music that is clean and will just put you in a good mood this is the CD to buy. I can't wait for his next CD to come out, I will be the first person to get one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pop Album","review":"I became a fan of Clay while watching American Idol 2. On his debut CD, he has shown the world that he is not just the \\"runner-up\\" but a true artist. His first single \\"Invisible\\" is very radio friendly and has a great tempo. Each song shows off Clay's incredible talent and no one can deny that. I would have to say that this will silence any critics out there. A great POP album overall!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut Album","review":"I've listened to this CD over and over and it gets better every time. My favorites keep changing every day. Today I woke up humming \\"Perfect Day\\". Yesterday, it was \\"The Way\\". My tastes in music cover a wide range and I don't expect Clay to cover them all. So if you only like hip-hop, rap or hard rock you won't like it. But if you like listening to a beautiful passionate voice sing love songs, pop ballads and light rock this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's CD Brings me to Tears","review":"And yes, that's a good thing. Prepare for the words and his wonderful voice meshing together to bring you to an emotional high. Clay music stands out amongst a field of untalented, precocious garbage foisted upon the public.The only small fault I could find is that the studio recordings mask the power and timbre of his live voice. Yet there's not a bad cut on this album.I expect it will be the years best seller. Go Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly AMAZING.","review":"For the first time in my life, I have listened to a CD all the way through (multiple times!) and loved EVERY SINGLE SONG. The album? Clay Aiken's \\"Measure of a Man.\\"Some critics bash Clay for not singing the typical pop song about sex and drugs (although I have to disagree with the sex part... \\"Touch\\" is pretty hot :D), but honestly, what's so wrong with having MORALS? I think it's awesome and admirable. Everyone can respect Clay for this album, and he really IS making a revolution in the music industry.For the record, I'm 18 years old; I'm a member of that Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera generation. Haha.I highly recommend this album to EVERYONE, Clay fans and Clay hatahs alike. :) It's uplifting and beautiful... very inspiring, emotional, and passionate.HOORAY FOR CLAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"Clay's voice is effortless, true, and glides through each song like silk. He is being true to himself, and honoring his fans. Randy Jackson said it best; it's THAT VOICE. That's all you need to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"This man's voice is even better than I remember it from the show. Some of the material is a little trite, but Clay's soaring voice and interpretation make it rise above the fray. Clay paints his lyrics for the listener - committing to every word. I really enjoyed the simplicity, albeit, Christian overtones of Measure of a Man, the confidence in Run to Me and for some reason, I can't get I Will Follow You out of my head. If this were the 80's or 90's, he'd easily have 3 or 4 solid singles from this album. Sadly, non-melodic rap music has driven more soothing sounds from the radio. Let's hoping some radio stations are willing to take a chance on Clay....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stuff","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. All the songs on it are great and it has been worth the wait. Congratulations to Clay for producing such a spectacular album. I enjoyed listening to every second ot it! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken Measures Up","review":"Wow! The new album is incredible. There is not a bad song on it. Clay sounds better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Measure of a Man","review":"I couldn't wait for this cd to be released and I wasn't disappointed in the least. Each and every song will bring you to tears, they are that good. (Bear in mind that this is coming from a huge John Lennon fan - but one who has already seen Clay perform with the American Idols this summer). Invisible is as good as it was on the tour - but my personal favorites are The Way (co-written by Enrique Inglesias) and Perfect Day. Both will give you chills. Love you Clay. You are a tremendous role model - continue to be the wonderful human being you truly are. A fan - Diane Casserly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and thrilling to listen to","review":"I like this CD more all the time. The best song is \\"Measure of a Man\\", so touching and beautiful. I also like \\"The Way\\", and eagerly await the video of this. Clay's voice is beautiful throughout the album, and he shows facets of his personality that I never knew were there. I appreciate the fact that 3very song is a new song, and that there are no \\"covers\\" like in Ruben's debut (which I hated!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing voice...","review":"I knew we had a winner the first time I heard his voice in the auditions. This CD is amazing and I listen to it constantly. I just hope he has another listen to all year CD coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This is a awesome CD from a \\"A-list pop star! Beautiful voice. You will want to pick up Solitaire CD also. All these negative post from people who never bought or listen to the CD are funny! Makes you wonder why they are even here posting."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS THE BEST!!!!","review":"OMG... if you don't have Clay's CD you MUST get it! All of the songs are so beautiful and it shows off Clay's voice perfectly. My personal favorite is Shine and Measure of a Man. (Also I would recommend that you get his new single with Solitaire :) )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken does it again!","review":"This is the greatest album since \\"Dizzy Up A Girl\\" by Goo Goo Dolls. Clay is so natural at singing, it's like he sings like we breathe! Also, people who leave bad reviews, weren't really Clay fans to begining with, because anything Clay sings is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This CD is absolutley excellent. I adore Clay and I don't know of any other singers with such a pure, and REAL voice. I just hate how singers today are for image. Clay's not about image at all, even though his has improved! Anyway, my favorite songs are The Way, I Survived You, and Measure of a Man. The Way is SO romantic, it's perfect, he sings it beautifully. Then I think that I Survived You is about how his biological father abused him when he was a child. It was obviously very sad, but it made me think. Then Measure of a Man was very good too. I definitley suggest you buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD I have ever owned","review":"Clay has one of the best voices I have ever heard. He puts emotion and thought into every song on this CD. Every song is exceptional and different in it's own way. You could listen to this CD non-stop for hours and never tire of it... Here's to Clay's long, prosperous career, ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"He proves who the true winner is!","review":"Clay Aikens debut cd is beyond outstanding. Each and every song you can feel him sing, as if he was singing to you. He is 100% talented even more so then i a true clay fan even though. The songs Perfect day and Measure of a Man combine true vocal talent and true writing talent to make perfection. There is not a single song on the cd that is skip worthy. It is amazing and Clay truly proved even though he might not be made for stardom he is talented and i would listen to him sing the alphabet because he is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I was a HUGE Clay fanatic after all the AI hype. I watched the show religiously and was completely in love with Clay and his voice. And I was very excited when his full length CD came out.But, I was rather disappointed with it. It is a bunch of cheesy \\"love\\" songs. I can honestly say that the young Clay fans will probably love it, but I am thouroughly disappointed with it. I like the song Measure of a Man, and Invisible is kinda catchy (but kind of creepy, like a stalker song). I just expected more from Clay. I still think that he has an amazing \\"live\\" voice, but I don't like his \\"studio\\" voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"another American Idol disaster","review":"Why don't you people buy albums by REAL artists and REAL singers, not these prefabricated generic posers.Try listening to the Aislers Set, the Clientele, Belle & Sebastian, or the Shins.NOT Clay Aiken. Not N Sync. Not Justin. Not Brittney. I'm not trying to be a music snob here, but this guy is about on the level of somebody singing the national anthem at a high school football game. He stays in key but has no feeling or uniqueness to his voice. And he looks a little too much like that banjo kid in \\"Deliverance\\", if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Material for a Stellar Singer","review":"What should we do with Clay Aiken's amazing vocal abilities and unique style? Apparently, tone him down, give him barely passable bubble gum pop ballads (with laughable lyrics), and do everything the studio can to make him sound as generic as possible. Clay, find new handlers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me this is a joke.","review":"You've got to be kidding me. I've got a 12 year old brother that can sing really loud and smile a lot. Can he get a record deal? Straight to the top of the list as WORST RECORD OF THE YEAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same Clay","review":"I had to turn the bass all the way down and turn the treble all the way up just to find a glimpse of Clay's voice. This album just has too much clutter for a great voice like his. I guess I will just have to wait until the corporate excutives get out of the way for Clay to find his voice again. They must have thought that the music was more important than his voice.Can I get my ten bucks back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's Measure Of A Man is a hit","review":"I have this cd since it's release in October of 2003. I wasn't surprised that it's quality, in my opinion was only mediocre. I expected that from all the American Idols that were going to record.Loving Clay's voice from the start, I felt a little disappointed in the cd. He is truly capable of so much more. However, as time moves on, I am finding that his voice is still hypnotic and pure on this cd and it has grabbed my heart. I was hoping for more dramatic vocals, but in contemporary music, this display of his voice is really top notch.I am happy to say that Measure of a Man has become one of my favorite cd's! I can't wait for his next cd, which I am sure will spotlight his talent in again, a very different way. Bravo Clay...your cd is just great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever!!!!","review":"This is the best CD ever!!! Clay is so gifted!!! I never get tired of any of these songs!! It's impossible to skip one song!!! My favorite songs are Invisible, Run To Me, Perfect Day, and Measure Of A Man!!! Any one who does not own this CD needs to get it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is like a breath of fresh air","review":"A co-worker kept saying how great this CD was and how great Clay's voice was and that I would not regret buying this one, and she was so right. What a talent this young man is! I just can't listen to it enough.. Although its hard to pick a favorite out of all the awesome songs, I would have to say track #10 \\"Perfect Day\\" is my favorite. But you will find yourself singing along with all of them. Great job on a debut CD. Clay Aiken's voice is phenomenal, and he is what today's music needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"Clay has an incredible beautiful voice, but the song selections are annoyingly boring! I found myself skipping each sound alike song until I reached the start of the CD...I want my money back. Clay, your CD sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Well many people have made this point. This album was rushed. Clay's voice is just fine, but this album takes no chances. in a word it's \\"boring\\" It is as vanilla as vanilla can be. Clay and his producers need to remember what got him here..Clay is a soft and easy crooner. What do we all remeber Clay for??? The song,\\"Don't let the sun go down on me.\\" Face it Clay, you're the next Barry Manilow...and what's wrong with that? Barry is still touring and his records are still selling. So Clay, take some time, find a good composer like Josh Grobin did and sing what you do best, don't sing what teenagers want because you know what my friend...you're past that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have heard all this before","review":"Ever buy a cd and say this sounds familiar? Yep, this is one of them.

I have decided to PAY IT FORWARD!!! and give everyone I know \\"Measure of a Man\\" for the hoildays. What better way to pass on the joy of listening to and becoming emmersed in the awesome sound of Clay Aiken!!!! I feel it is one small thing I can do for mankind--- I suggest we all do the same!!! Happy Listening!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"american idol fan","review":"I though this cd wasn't bad for a first one. I would too like to hear more of his voice, but it seems that no matter what songs he sings, it can melt you heart. I don't have any kids of my own, but this is the type of cd that anyone at any age can listen to without having to worry about the ratings. Good job. He will just get better and better with more experience.Oh and for those of you who are looking forward to Ruben's cd, I heard rumors about it that I'm not sure are true, but many of you might be dissapointed in that one too. I heard it was going to be alot of hip hop type songs and not the soul songs that everyone is expecting. I hope this is not true, but if the cd is anything like the song he sang at the concert, it will definately be more hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUBEN WHO.....??????","review":"Clay's debut album is an awesome album. It does not show his range but it indeed showcases his amazing voice. Definitely a #1 album for Clay! And this is only the beginning. One of my favorite on the album is \\"When You say you love me\\" co-written by Enrique Iglesias. That's interesting.GO GET IT! It's well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaiting Arrival But Heard All Songs","review":"I have yet to receive my MOAM + 1 but since I have heard all the songs, I will give this cd a 5 star. I have listened to this cd everyday since its release and I have over 3000 cds. It says something about this cd and that is, it is that excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job!","review":"I received this CD as a gift at Christmas and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised how good this recording is and enjoyable to listen to. If I had not received \\"Measure of a Man\\" as a present, I have to admit I most likely, would not have bought it. Only having gained my knowledge about Clay from the constant media barrage during the \\"American Idol\\" frenzy and having only seen the final episode of the contest, I really had not heard much from this singer before the CD. I do admit I was impressed by Clay during the \\"Idol\\" finale (and, yes, he clearly deserved to win as Ruben, although a seemingly nice fellow, sings out of tune). \\"Measure of a Man\\" is a solid collection of pop rock and a nice showcase for Clay's pleasant tenor. His voice, though a bit generic, shows some good stylistic touches that really help to elevate the quality of the material.A good job by Clay Aiken all around and a very listenable CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazon. com please read reviews before posting!!!!!","review":"It is Amazon.

Not only does he have a voice from heaven but is an all around nice guy. What I love the most about this guy is that he's not afraid to be himself. He doesn't follow the fads and raunchy behavior the music industry is so used to. Clay is so unique, refreshing and is a joy to listen to. I am a fan forever!!! I absolutely love his voice, music and of course the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music fan from Va.","review":"This album of Clay's is the first album that I have bought in a very long time. I think that he has got one of the most amazing voices that I have ever heard. I enjoy every song on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks a lot","review":"I can truly say that my CD player saved my life. For a short while I regretted I couldn't at least listen to it, but I now realize my self-sacrificing CD player had better judgement than I do.For the record, I live a cardboard box. My only possesion was my CD player. I invested my begging money in this CD, I put all my faith in this little disc to keep me happy and to keep me going. So what happened?I'll tell you what happened.I put this hard-earned CD into my precious CD player, and you know what happened? The CD player's tiny crummy LCD screen started flashing obscenities at me, and then it exploded, melting plastic and battery acid all over, and ultimately burning my box to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Far Away From This One","review":"Only the Clay-maniacs will like this one. It is simply horrible. I give it two stars, being generous, because I like Clay and I think he can sing. The material is bad. Did they MAKE him sing these poorly written songs? If you bought the single 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' then you bought the best of Clay, this I am sorry, is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay, buddy what happened?","review":"Yuk! is about all I can say. I loved Clay on the show but this cd sounds like one 50 min track. Save your money and get a copy used if you must. They are here for $4. If you bought This Is The Night/Bridge cd single, then you got the best. These people saying Amazing! 5 stars! must be with the Arista marketing team. They must be getting paid to log on reviews. Clay is great and Clay can sing, but this cd has three good tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I never watched American Idol before this season (Season 5), but when I saw Clay Aiken doing \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" in the season finale, I was captivated. He seemed aloof yet sexy, and I wanted to find out more about him so I decided to go back to his album. I was disappointed to find that not a single song he has recorded conveys the same personality I saw onstage - where is the mystery? Where is the charm? Where is the feeling? These songs are nothing better than manufactured, assembly-line pop drivel and even from what little I've seen of Clay Aiken, I know he can do better.Guess I'll just have to get my \\"Idol\\" fix from the original music Taylor Hicks has recorded - if you want to hear a finely-crafted, well-written, beautifully understated album along the lines of what Clay SHOULD have done, check out Taylor's \\"Under the Radar.\\" It is simply amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for P2P","review":"Let me see were should I start. Once again my room-mate actually went out and brought this c.d.(why). All I can say is come on america, people out there actually like this dude. I like to tell it how it is and this c.d. blows. From the start to the end of this mess is like pouring salt on an open wound. He sings like a girl and looks sick. What I really want back is the time I spent losing my life listing to this crap. I also see that he doesn't have to much talent, there are only like 2 songs on here. That is why I love P2P so much. Overall I think clay should be soaped up and made to sing in a prison shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm waiting for the day...","review":"when Clay Aiken is freed from his American Idol contract and gets to do some real music.The only cool songs on this album are This is the Night, No More Sad Songs, and I Will Carry You. For the most part though, this album is a mixture of bubblegum pop and Broadway - ...which should never be mixed because everyone knows Clay Aiken dosn't want to be a pop star/teen idol. I don't believe his real fans want him to be one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMM","review":"Ummm, he sounds good and all but some setbacks. The first song sounds good but when listening to words it sound awful. Like someone else said it sounds like he is stocking a girl.

What Happened?","review":"I like Clay and bought the cd, but save your money and download the songs from the show, they are MUCH better. He is so good and this cd is so bad. What happened?

In this business everyone knows it is not just about how many albums you sell it is about longevity which people seem to forget about and please believe me when i say clay most likely did not doany writing. so who's really getting paid the songwriter of course. So don't let sales blow your mind understand most of that money went back to the record company. And i am not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewww Eyeflutter!!!","review":"Ewww last night on Billboard Awards, Clay was doing that gross eye-flutter thing again! Ick! I bet he was pretty sad when Beyonce beat him out for Female Artist Of The Year. This CD is horrible and so is Ruben's. American Idol stinks. Listen to the Foo Fighters instead, you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"1.5 million people can't be wrong!!","review":"Well this is a great cd...and it seems to me that selling the most albums and having more appearances is the REAL TEST of who is the AMERICAN IDOL!!!!

This is a can't go wrong, must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Aiken Disappointed in Measure of A Man","review":"I am still a fan of Clay Aiken because he has a beautiful voice. However, the song selection, style of his \\"made-over\\" voice was disappointing. I was looking forward to hearing that smooth sexy voice of American Idol songs he sang. It was not there. Whoever decided on these songs did no justice to Clay Aiken. Maybe next time... Sorry Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boy has range does he not??","review":"Wow...I loved Clay all through American Idol and I love him even more now. Everyone is talking about \\"The Way\\"--beautiful, yes...i love how vulnerable he sounds on the whole CD. He really seems to feel what he sings. The song that sent chills up and down my spine was Run To Me. Clay is AMAZING on this song. I also love I Will Carry You and I Survived You. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was beacause of Perfect Day. The only problem I have with the song is the word \\"day.\\" It just doesn't seem to fit...I don't know...I just don't like listening to that one. This is the Night...wow...amazing. He's gonna go far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Wait and Speculation!","review":"For all the times that the release was delayed, and all the speculation on the title, what the songs would sound like, and all else, this album does disappoint a Clay fan. Clay has this amazing ability to pour so much emotion into whatever he sings, he pulls you into the song. This is especially true if you have seen him perform a song live. And despite the critics trying to pigeonhole his fan base, he appeals to everyone, and the songs on the CD do just that. I have no way to pick to a favorite, its different each time I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cd that you can listen to all the way through many times","review":"This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way\\" also loved \\"Touch\\" (sounds like Marc Antony),and \\"Perfect Day\\" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked \\"When You say You Loved Me\\", very catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I absolutely love this c.d. Clay's range is just amazing, and he proves that he is truely a winner. Some favorites on the album are Invisible, I will carry you, Measure of a Man, and Perfect Day. You would have to be insane not to enjoy this c.d. I will always be a huge supporter of Clay because he has proven himself to be an oustanding singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!!","review":"My house is full of Cd's that collect dust on the shelf. This one won't. Every single track is a master piece all it's own. I don't skip any of the tracks because they are all great. I love the title track Measure of a Man. Clay's voice is so unique and enjoyable to listen to. He has such a smooth sound that is so refreshing. You can actually understand the words and don't have to turn down the volume so the kids don't hear bad words. I hate to hear a 10 year old singing along about \\"doing it\\", but you don't have to worry about that with Clay. Thanks Clay for a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars cuz hes ok I GUESS","review":"u know that INVISIBLE song? he strikes me to be a stalker..lol this isn't really a song to sing to if u know the message behind the song....LOL scary!...im not a fan of the American Idol show but i luv to hear about the cheap cheap hilarious people that go on the show like william hung....LOL NOW THAT KILLS ME..really clay aiken i dont know what to say about you but that invisible song really makes me think twice about you"},{"rating":"1","title":"AND YOUR AMERICAN IDOL IS...","review":"not Clay Aiken. I am so sick of all of these people saying Clay Aiken is the \\"Real American Idol\\". If I remember correctly, HE LOST. Did you hear that people? HE LOST to Ruben Studdard by over 100,000 votes. I personally like Clay, I think he is extremely talented, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy. However, this album is just horrible. It's slow, bland, and just boring. All the songs sound the same, and the lyrics to \\"Invisible\\" are just a bit disturbing. I hope on his next outing he will have better material, he deserves better than this stuff. If you want to hear American Idol at it's best, go pick up \\"Free Yourself\\" by Fantasia. She's the best idol of all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay please dont become so commercial!","review":"Let me start by saying that Clay should have won first place on American Idol, He was a thousand times better than everyone else and has a voice that far surpasses his peers.That said, this was a lousy effort on a first release, Clay became what Simon wanted all along..COMMERCIAL. He did not remain true to himself and that to me is a very sad thing, I am extremely disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalker Love Ballad?","review":"\\"Invisible\\" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:\\"If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight\\" and \\"I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make\\". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh, Clay.","review":"No doubt, Clay has an incredible gift. And I'll admit his single \\"Invisible\\" is a nice change on Top 40 radio. However, he would be better served on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do me a favour!","review":"The bloke might have a good or even great voice but this pile or arse does him no favours at all, Im afraid I have no respect for pop puppets who allow themselves to be pulled in all directions and sing dire crap like this. He would have done better for himself and have more credibility if he touted himself to the record companies and worked his way up the traditional way, appearing on American Idol is the lazy way to achieve fame. Youre better off listening to Robbie Williams, hes a guy whos been to hell and back making a name for himself and deserves respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measure of a BOY!","review":"What a disappointment. I love Clay's voice and was really excited about this CD release. His latest single, \\"Invisable\\" will disappear fast!... what a bad song. This CD certainly doesn't live up to the quality of material he is capable of singing. Sorry... I listened to this CD 8 or 9 times and it just didn't get any better. I sold it on E-bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"love him","review":"Clay is truly the american idol and shouldn't have lost. This is worth your money for this fine mans TRIPLE PLATINUM ALBUM!! now Ruben cant beat that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is the true definition of a man","review":"This is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. I don't skip any songs. My favorites are Invisible, The Way, I survived You and Measure of a man. Everybody in my family likes at least one of the songs on this album. Clay you get an A+++++ for this album. I can't wait for your next one to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This album is better than I expected. Clay has an extraordinary voice and the songs on this album showcase that voice. I like all the songs and listen to the the album straight through. Usually with other artists, there are songs that I skip. I highly recommend \\"Measure of a Man!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"The more I listen to \\"Measure of a Man\\", the more breathtaking it becomes!! Each song shows the incredible voice of \\"Clay Aiken.\\" It's a CD that I would highly recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is a great album for a young artists first. You can hum and sway to the music. Clay has a wonderful voice and it should be \\"showcased\\" better than in pop rock songs. I know he will mature and his next album will include songs that feature that voice like it did in his rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Waters."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty much awesome","review":"I couldn't wait for this cd to come out, and I bought it right away. Clay's voice is amazing, but some of the songs are kind of lame. Maybe if he wrote his own songs, they would be better. Overall though, Clay's voice is fantastic and the way he sings the songs is really touching. It's a great album with a variety of music types, and completely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginnings","review":"I listened to this superb CD all the way to Walter Reed and back home. I found myself singing along with Clay Aiken even though I didn't even know the words yet. I particularly liked No More Sad Song, I Survived You, and Perfect Day. The tunes are catchy, Clay's voice is heavenly, and he has just the right amount of passion in each song to make it work. I do think that some of the background vocals and music could be toned down, but it didn't ruin it for me. I liked the CD more each time I heard it. It's a great beginning CD for Clay and just the first of many for this incredible young man. You Go Clay!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of a Man","review":"I love eveyone of the songs on this CD. The voice of Clay Aiken is refreshing and mezermizing. I'm amazed that in this day and age with the stuff that's out there that an album such as this is even possible. The music and words are beautiful and very reminiscent of music from the 80's. There is actually hope for music today, thanks to Clay Aiken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pass This One Up","review":"This is a first, truly a first....The FIRST time I purchased an album that had NO throwaway songs. Every single cut is fantastic. Some are edgy, some are inspiring, some are lyrical, fun and upbeat... But all are just beautifully pleasing to the ear (and the heart). Clay Aiken... you sure deliver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I gave this cd 2 stars and I was very generous. Clay has alot of things to be thankful for, mainly the vicious hatred of Ruben which translates into super stardom for him. Just today this runner up had a sandwich named after him at a local restaurant. If Clay was just a young artist just starting out and there was none of this controversy, there is no way this cd would have gone double platinum. I do like the single invisible, but it is not good enough to carry the entire cd. He needs more depth to his voice and to learn that he does not have to scream on every song. These songs are a collection of mushy love songs one blending into the other.I wonder how he feels knowing that it is not his talent that has sent his career sky rocketing, but a very generous case of affirmative action. Anyway he will get richer while we all continue to hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I ever imagined!","review":"I love this CD! I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. Touch and Invisible are my most favorites! Anyone interested in listening to a golden voice, try out Clay! Judge for yourself. Everyone has their own favorites, and Clay outdid himself here for me. When You Say You Love Me is great as well with even a country feel to it. I have never had an album before where I liked ALL the songs like this one. Awesome debut I want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Clay?","review":"Wow, this album is a HUGE disappointment.#1 This does not sound like the same Clay that we fell in love with on American Idol, He sounds like a half rate Boy George.#2 The production is awful, it sounds as if he is being backed by karaoke tracks.#3 Where is the soaring, clear and beautiful voice we know he once had?Shame on those who were in charge of letting this cd be released in this condition.It seems as if all the hype is put into the show, then all care is forgotten when it the time comes to record an album. Welcome to the real world Clay, I hope the next album supports your wonderful talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is a singer with an amazing range....","review":"and I wish that no back-up singers were used, as his voice stands alone, and doesn't need any \\"enhancing/help.\\"I hope on his next album Clay will sing more acapella songs, that have a wide range to show off his voice, without any back-up singers and loud music. I want to hear the real/raw voice of \\"Clay.\\"You're still number one with me!Clay, I wish you all the best, please don't let Hollywood \\"corrupt\\" you. Stay your humble self.Blessings to you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay Aiken... where are you???","review":"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stoppingnumbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in aWestend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even \\"Solitaire\\" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Unless you like syrupy power ballads that all sound the same, I would save my money. Mr. Aiken is overrated and over-hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"THERE ARE NO REAL WORDS THAT REALLY FIT THIS YOUNG MAN. HE IS WHAT I HOPE MY THREE SONS WILL ONE DAY BECOME. \\"GREAT\\" NOT ONLY FOR THE GOD GIVEN VOICE BUT FOR THE PERSON THAT HE IS. I JUST HOPE HE WILL STAY THAT WAY. SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS REVIEW BUT ABOUT 10 MILLION WHO HAVE WATCHED THIS BOY BECOME A MAN RIGHT BEFORE OR EYES WILL. THIS ALBUM HAS BOUGHT SO MANY PEOPLE BACK TO THE RECORD STORES BECOUSE CLAY KNOWS THAT THEIR ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO INJOY MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE JUNK THAT IS PUT OUT TODAY AND SHAPE OUR CHILDRENS MINDS. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL PUT THIS CD DOWN JUST THINK ONE DAY YOU WILL BE THE PARENT.THANK YOU CLAY FOR BEING YOU. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY TOUCHED MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVE CHANGE THE WAY MY BOYS NOW FEEL ABOUT WHO THEY COULD BE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Talent","review":"Here is a guy with an exceptional voice. What is he doing singing boring, emotionless music that could be sung by countless no talent others on the BMG label. I hope the guys at BMG can rent David Foster to help Clay to get it right next time. Clay could be as good as Michael Buble or Gosh Groban if only he had someone who could bring out his incredbile voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's Measure Of A Man truly measures up!","review":"I am a HUGE Clay Aiken fan and I am excited to tell all the people around the world that Measure Of A Man by Clay Aiken is an AMAZING CD! MOAM is the ONLY cd where I liked EACH and EVERY song on the CD. Clay Aiken is THE role model 4 all children, teens and young adults out there, I know that he's my role model! :) Buy Clay Aiken's cd!!!!!!!!! This CD is TRULY worth listening to!!!!! I can't wait until Clay comes out with another CD. His voice is amazingly powerful and sounds great! My favourite songs are Measure Of A Man and The Way. All of Clay's songs speaks to you in a different way, and this CD gives personal inspiration to everybody out there. This CD reminds everybody of why they wanted him to win American Idol! But, true role models don't need a title in order to be the best! :) Bye Clay Aiken's Measure Of A Man! It will be the best CD you will ever have! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true American Idol -- WOW ..","review":"Having followed the success of Clay Aiken from American Idol, I can truly say he is absolutely incredible. I've not only enjoyed his live perfomances on/off the show, but have been playing this CD continuously since purchasing it on the release date. It's a rarity these days to find someone with not only enormous talent, but who is also true to himself. I love each and every track on this CD and feel Clay shine(s) (also a great song), through every one of them. Let's hope he re-releases his older demos! Amazing voice, amazing person. A big THANKS to Clay for such an enjoyable accomplishment. ~Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Or should I have said, should have been better. Clay Aiken was one of the perfomers from AI2 that I fell in love with. What happened to this new CD is anybody's guess. All I know it that this wasn't up to Clay standards and probably should not have been released so quickly. I liked Measure of a Man but that was about it and even it was lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best CD!!!","review":"I think the Measure of A Man CD is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased in terms of versility and enjoyment. It has some great break up songs, a couple with a light Christian flare, total melt down songs of devotion and a sultry, sensual ballad that will keep you hitting repeat.....that would be track 12!!!!! Enjoy, I love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH PREACHING THEY DO","review":"This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed!!","review":"I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he \\"curled my toes\\" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up","review":"Ok, before you click on the button that says my review was not helpful, hear me out. I like Clay. I was rooting for him every single week on American Idol. And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.The weakest song on the album is \\"Measure of a Man.\\" That's pure dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Try","review":"This is at best, a good try for a first CD. But, I was somewhat dissapointed with the selection of songs as well as with the vocal arrangements. The vocals could be a lot stronger coming from a talented singer, such as Clay. I think a lot of people are buying this CD and making a lot of hype because they are glad to see someone who does not fit the mold make it big. I'm sorry, I have to agree with the critics. \\"He should stick to show tunes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing personal at all....","review":"...Clay has an amazing voice...very clear and strong. Honestly, I just don't like the songs or his style. It's not that he can't sing. I guess he just doesn't sing the music that I like to hear. I was given this CD as a gift...why?...I don't know. It was a gift from a secret pal and I guess whoever pulled my name at the beginning of the year doesn't know me very well. If you like Clay's kind of music, you'll love this CD because he sings it well. Me? I guess I'm just more of a typical R&B fan. Love Ruben's CD...love Tamyra's CD...love Kelly Clarkson's CD...but just couldn't get with this one. Nothing personal. I probably just never should have listened to it. My bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please - the cheesiest, fame-seeking man in the USA","review":"this album could NOT be worse. There are many good singers that come out of the Idol shows - Kelly Clarkson has a soothing, big voice that gives me a shiver up my spine everytime; Will Young has an individual voice that really shines and impresses me; Tamaira Grey is not the best but still has an amazing voice; i think Guy Sebastian is also brilliant, so is Michelle McManus; and, of course, the new American Idol has - in the top twelve - at least six good singers: camile velasco & fantasia barrino are my favourites, and Diana, La Toya, George and Jennifer are also very impressive - but Aiken is not a breath of fresh air, his songs are all very camp and he thinks he's a unique man just because he's singing about love, but he is terrible. all the songs sound the same, and have way TOO much meaning, if you know what i mean. I am amazed at how many Americans buy his cd and think its good. your advice is to stay way away from this musical disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay for England!","review":"Just to inform you that we have great taste in music from England too. This is truly a wonderful album. Not one song dissapoints and all the tracks showcase Clay's fantstic vocal abilities. I may have had to import this CD from the American site but beleive me it was well worth it. This guy has serious talent and it will not be long before he is the big international star that he deserves to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken is a Gem","review":"I can't understand why some people are bashing this perfectly wonderful CD and the immense talent of its singer. What do these so-called \\"critics\\" (or \\"bashers\\") think real music is -- someone rapping in nonsense or screaming inaudible and offensive lyrics?? Clay Aiken is a breath of fresh air in this day and age and deserves the accolades he receives. Everyone with the money should spend it on this perfectly wonderful album -- not waste it on the mainstream of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN ROCKS!","review":"I bought this cd along with clay aiken's single Solitaire last week. He has voice of an angel and I love how articulate he is when he sings with such passion from his heart and soul. WOW don't miss this one, he is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS WON OVER!!","review":"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about buying this CD at first. I hadn't watched AI 2 but had heard by word-of-mouth and various reviews/articles about Clay Aiken. I also heard \\"This is the Night\\" and BOTW and was impressed. I bought the CD and was instantly won over!! THIS GUY CAN SING!!! How refreshing it is these days to hear someone like this in contrast to other music in the mainstream. All of the songs on MOAM are fantastic. I LOVE IT!! SO WILL YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO GOOD FOR WORDS","review":"Do I like this CD? You bet I do! Like most of the reviewers here I play it everyday and have yet to tire of it. Clay's voice resonates its way right into your heart. However, the is one point that I would like to make here and that is - Regardless of whether Clay Aiken ever sings another song, records another album, wins or loses, receives another award, applause or accolade and regardless of whether he receives good or bad reviews, it in NO WAY diminishes from the Measure of this Man!!!!! He and his album are awesome! Clay stands alone and apart from the rest. Thank you Clay Aiken and Thank You God for this gifted and talented individual. I am sooooo grateful and I am eagerly awaiting your next and next and next albums. Way to Go Clay and Happy 25th Birthday!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Effort","review":"While I cannot say I absolutely love every song on this CD (because a couple of them sound similar) and would ideally rate it 3.5 stars, I can say it's got a few very good tunes on it, which makes it worth buying. \\"Invisible\\" is easy to listen to, and the title cut, \\"Measure of a Man,\\" is one of the CD's strongest efforts and my personal favorite. If you never got around to buying his Idol single \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" w/ \\"This is The Night,\\" they're included here and are an added bonus. Basically enjoyable and a must for any fan of Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive","review":"Before I bought this cd, I already knew Clay had an amazing voice--but WOW! Beautiful ballads, especially \\"Measure of a Man\\". \\"Invisible\\" was a great first single that got a lot of radio and tv play. No offense to Ruben, but Clay's single was much more popular, and I think he should have been the winner. Good job, Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Heavenly","review":"I love every song. Each song is so unique and versatile in melody that I play it several times a day. Can't seem to get enough of him. Also bought the Christmas cd. Best songs are from Clay and Kelly, all the rest are ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay \\"Touches\\" my heart and \\"Shines\\" in his debut album,","review":"I am a part of those \\"deeply-out-of-it\\" who recognize great music from this most remarkable man. No, I don't fit in any of those demographics but I am head-over-heels in love with The Voice and The Man. He's not a sell-out, he stayed true to his convictions and we get an album that I enjoyed very, very much.I love \\"The Way\\", \\"MOAM\\", \\"Perfect Day\\" and \\"WYSYLM\\".BUY THIS AND BE PART OF THE REVOLUTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical cash-in","review":"Sorry, but this album is probably the worst I've heard all year. It's so bland it's impossible to distinguish one cliched, tune-free track from the next. The cynicism of Simon Fuller and the whole American Idol team is exposed again - they knew that Clay's first album would go multi-platinum however useless it was, so have made no effort whatever.They clearly have no interest in developing Clay as a long-term artist. If they did, they'd have given him some good material so people would come back for more the second time. Here in the UK, the first Pop Idol winner Will Young has just had a massive success with his second album - in part because his first one was actually good, and the public were not duped into buying a half-baked CD like this which isn't worth the plastic it's packaged in. It will be interesting to see what Clay does next - if I were him, I'd start writing my own songs. Whatever his talent, they couldn't be any worse than the ones on *Measure of a Man*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was disappointed","review":"All the songs sounded the same. Sappy twiny ballads. I heard he had a great voice yet heard nothing spectacular in this cd. I could just bought an all love song cd of various artists and gotten better satisfaction. I would not recommend this cd to anyone with musical taste and it will put you to sleep. Go back to the drawing board Clay and try again and maybe with some feeling and variety this time. I should have known it would blow considering how fast he put it out my dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measure of a man........Clay Aiken","review":"I had waited for a long time for this CD to come out and I was really looking forward to buying it. I'm no young kid (age 69) and think he has a beautiful voice, however, I was so disappointed in \\"Measure of a man\\"! I was hoping he would have some of the songs from \\"Idol\\" or at least popular songs that I had at least heard before. I still think he has the most beautiful voice that has come along in a long time, but I'll tell you, before I buy his next CD, I'll sure make sure to look at the selections of the songs before I buy it!! I think he should pick his own songs next time instead of letting other people!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"measure of a man=1 star......clay aiken=5 stars and more!","review":"Clay has an amazing voice! and I voted for him on AI, but this album just doesn't makes him justice, yeah this songs, well some of them have meanning and thats great but the beat and just the flow of the album is way too slow(and I love ballads and slow stuff also fast stuff) and this kind of pop music trying to be contemporary is just not for him, he is a true sing a true artist and he has an amazing beautiful voice, but this album is just not for him, maybe 'Invisible\\" I think it's the only one that kinda makes him jsutice but the rest no, sorry Clay I'm sure you'll make it huge with ur next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment in Claymation!","review":"Wow what a disappointment! All the advance hype and Clay sure doesn't deliver with this cd. No excitment, no wow knock me over.... very bland. If he wants me to buy again he needs to really put some zip into it. This is The Night was on this cd and it was still the best maybe that's why he made a single out of if. And only 12 tracks......very very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad","review":"I see why clay was'nt nominated for a grammy, this cd is not grammy material, this cd is strickly for those who have bad taste in music, all though I think clay has a desent voice he need to get better writers for his music...but I guess all that matters is his fan's are happy, however Kelly, Ruben and now Fantasia there the real product, getting a million dollar contract is the icing on the cake, that's how you can tell the winner's from the losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This cd is very disappointing...His voice is not used to the fullest extent at all. He compromises his voice, it's computerized, and his values on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why people.","review":"With Clay's over-the-top, bombastic vocal stylings and his elvish looks, the Pop Idol franchise plans to take over the world.Really people the album sucks, let's face it. And may I offer a suggestion: instead of buying 500 copies of A Ton of Crap, donate some of that money to some of Clay's favorite charities.And one more thing, if I was invisible, I'd burn every copy of A Ton of Crap and destroy all the master copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM A TRUE MUSIC FAN","review":"I know good music when I hear it and this debut by Clay Aiken isn't good music. Additionally, I read in these reviews that someone believes Clay is receiving 1 star ratings because of his Christian beliefs. Hello, he has a POP album and I had no idea he was a Christian and I think most people reviewing wouldn't associate Pop with being a Christian. If this is the case, shouldn't Mr. Aiken be singing for the Lord instead of Pop music? Looks like Mr. Aiken is a sellout. I purchased the album based on his AI performance and all the 5 star reviews here and it is a let down, I feel totally defrauded by all this false hype that has been going on. Most of the five star reviews here are false, don't believe them or you'll be turned into a sucker as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ug!","review":"First of all, to the reviewer below me who called him \\"a true American idol\\"--no, he's not. Even I know he lost, and I don't even watch that show. Next, his song \\"Invisible\\" is one of the worst I've ever heard. It shouldn't be \\"If I WAS invisible\\"; it should be \\"If I WERE invisible.\\" Plus, if you were invisible, you'd \\"Watch me in my room?\\" Mommmmy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"I can't believe the rave reviews this CD is getting! I bought it because of the great things people are saying about it. I am terribly disappointed. This CD is not any good. The songs are \\"bubble gum\\" era, on most tracks the orchestration and backup singers are too loud and you can't hear Clay, the songs are not memorable and most of the words to the songs are really stupid. More importantly, they failed to listen to Simon's critique of \\"picking the right song for your voice.\\" None of these songs are right for Clay. I can't believe Clive Davis produced this CD. Maybe I was expecting too much from a first CD, but my opinion is that this CD stinks. If you want a good CD, buy Bette Midler's new CD or a Josh Groban CD. Immensely better and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh? :-\\\\","review":"If there was a way that i could give him less than 1 star, or even something in the negative numerical region, that would be it... cause uhh, this cd is DOODOO... why was it i couldn't even listen to the first 5 seconds?

Clay \\"Shines\\"","review":"I have been anticipating this CD for quite some time and have to say it is even more than I had hoped for. It is an absolutely fabulous work by one of the most talented entertainers I have ever heard. I think there is something for everyone here. Clay's beautiful voice in ballads, \\"Measure of a Man\\" is so heartfelt. There are some great up-tempo songs, \\"Invisible\\" and one of the best surprises for me \\"Touch\\". I found myself dancing without even knowing when this song came on. Can't stop listening to Clay's debut efforts. Looking forward to following this exceptional artist and person for many years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i'd rather pour acid into open cuts than buy this cd...","review":"i strongly recommend that anyone who ever considered purchasing this cd, spend your 15 bucks at arbys, because this cd is garbage. i used to love clay aiken, i even voted for him, but his ego is too large for my liking. this cd honestly would only appeal to deaf people, merely because they wouldnt be able to hear it. i almost fell asleep listening to it, every song is the same. maybe clay should consider flipping patties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD of 2003!!!","review":"Clay Aiken is at his absolute worst. If you're going to spend hard earned $ on a CD don't waste it on this one. You can't even dance to this garbage.

Claymates, Clay belongs on Broadway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next Time Pick Better Songs","review":"He just had to rush to beat Ruben to a street date, and boy can you tell it. You will be disappointed in these cookie cutter song choices. Clay can sing but I would rather have a cd of the songs he sang on the show, these are really bad. Believe an honest review and not a Clay-fanatic. There are three good songs on the cd (one being the Idol cd single This is The Night). After doing every daytime show, morning show and Jay Leno, he should sell a million copies easy. Remember a million people saw Gigli too. Buyer beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Bolton Jr","review":"WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!!

Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music?

Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing.

I HIGHLY recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Measure of a Man\\" MEASURE UP FOR ME!","review":"I received this album and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. The lyrics have romantic depth and an edgy, catchy beat.Each time I listen it seems I notice something new to appreciate.Just as I think \\"The Way\\" is the best song...another has me reconsidering. This has happened so often that I no longer try to choose.They all do it for me for a different reason. No need to skip over any of these songs!I am off to order another for the Car! GREAT ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing!","review":"It took me a few times before I could honestly give this CD a five star rating, but it is worth it. Clay is so refreshing and is filling a music void. I hope he will continue on and reach his potential as a singer. We could use a few more like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Thank you, Clay Aiken, and it's about time. Your voice is a rhapsody in a world of tone-deaf producers. Every song in \\"Measure of a Man\\" has a wonderful touch of newness. The sound is fantastic. My personal favorites are \\"I Will Carry You,\\" a musical accomplishment spiked with Clay's soft tone, \\"I Survived You,\\" a blend of complex words and a nifty tune, \\"When You Say You Love Me,\\" a catchy, bouncy melody, and \\"Invisible,\\" a yearning yet upbeat piece that constantly runs in my head. I am very happy with this buy, excited about the next, and maybe someday hearing Mr. Clay Aiken record his wonderful range and style with a full orchestra background."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY AIKEN = FANTASTIC SINGER","review":"WOW!!! I recently went to the Independent tour Starring Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken. I love Kelly, went to see her mostly, curious about Clay though. Clay knocked the ENTIRE audience over with his voice, charisma and personality! WOW!!! I just bought this album because of hearing/seeing Clay at the concert!!! EXCELLENT!!! A MUST BUY!!! Also I was really amazed the concert was 90-95% CLAY FANS!!! Yes, Clay is huge and I can now see why!!! Thank you so much Clay!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's CD a Piece of Dark Chocolate","review":"MOAM is well-orchestrated and extremely well-sung pop music. I defy anyone not to enjoy the blending of those two elements, especially on \\"Run to Me\\", \\"Shine\\", and \\"Perfect Day.\\" The uniqueness about Clay Aiken's voice is that he can lift you to the heights of heaven with it.The only odd thing is the undercurrent of darkness in the lyrics. Clay can absolutely bring someone to giddy joy with his voice. The subtle angst in the songs seem mismatched, yet the whole production is well-executed; imagine if Hanson smeared on a little dark make-up and collaborated with The Cure. That and the loss of the warm rapport Aiken had with a live audience on AI2 can be a little jarring.Yet overall, the CD charms you with its own uniqueness, and there's no reason why you wouldn't buy one for your friend, and a second one for you when the first one gets too scratched from overuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Received the cd yesterday, listened to it many times. Not usually a fan of pop music but have to say this is the exception.Clear, precise lyrics and catchy music combine to make an enjoyable audio experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measure of this Man!","review":"The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand!

Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is a must have!","review":"A very nice surprise and excellent music. This album shows off the many vocal talents of Clay.Great Stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"I've been a Clay fan from the start. I can't help it, he's just got a voice that makes me go gooey. I got this cd when it came out. I can't say I love everything on it, but I like it all. \\"Invisible\\" is a catchy tune that gets stuck in your head, it's fun. \\"The Way\\" makes me fall in love with my husband all over again (see we're not all teeny boppers LOL). The music content on this cd is not something I'd be afraid to play in front of my 3 year old (who loves to repeat things!). I'd recommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear a fabulous voice, even if all the songs aren't the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"<<<LOVE IT>>LOVE IT>>LOVE IT>>>>>","review":"Clay is #1..No doubt about it..A Star fo sure.This cd is the #1 album of 2003 for a good reason...CLAY AIKEN AND HIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE!! thats why!!

WE LOVE YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2003","review":"I am amazed at the number of reviews posted for this album. It has become my favorite and plays once or twice a day in our house and/or car. Actually, had to buy two as my CD changer loader/ejector is broken and you have to unscrew the top, and do all sorts of gymnastics to get CD's in and out....it was easier to buy another for the car. This is an album that gets better with age, it grows and grows on you. It is an album to sing along to, an album to play softly in the background and an album to listen to with headphones. All the songs are good, I don't skip ANY of them, which as I (and other reviewers) usually do. Measure of a Man and The Way are probably my favorites, although Shine is marvelous - well, darn - they are all marvelous and I hightly recommend this CD to all ages. I eagerly await more albums from Clay and predict his career will be spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"I am enjoying this CD and find I am listening to it several times a day. The songs are addicting and I find myself singing out loud. Some of the songs are just fun to listen to and others can touch your soul. I highly recommend Aiken's \\"Measure of A Man\\". A++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS INCREDIBLE","review":"Clay's Measure of a Man CD is wonderful. I usually buy a CD and end up skipping 3 or 4 songs everytime I listen to it, but not this one. I love every single song. Clay has an incredible voice. My 4 year old loves him too. We get in the car and he says \\"Mom, please put Clay on\\" and I am only too happy to do it. He is a great role model, and we need them today. And he is singing music that anyone can listen to and love, from my 4 year old to me (34) to my mother (I'd better not say). Thanks, Clay, for being real! and for sharing your beautiful voice and attitude with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay","review":"Clay strikes a bigger hype than any of the American Idols and debuts his first album which is just amazing! Clay is a talented, sweet young man with many ambitions for the future.His voice is so strong and will carry you track to track. My favorite song on this album is \\"I survived you\\"My only complaint to this CD, is that many of the songs sound the same. However, clay did a good job vocally on the songs, and many people will enjoy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean, not boring music.","review":"I have kept trac of Clay since AI. I Cannot get enough of his new wave of music. He has a very unique voice and is very talented and pure. His voice shines and his personality only makes him more interesting. A bold approach by him to capture an audiance that is tired of the garbage that is being put out there by so called singers of now. He is showing that there is a huge market for a less blatent sexual market of music needed for a huge demogragraphic. But at the same time he captures the , can I say Hotness, that is there without being crude . I can see him going very far with a very needed new/old concept . Can I compare him with Frank Sinotra with a twist of new wave. He sings with a flair that from young to old, each drawing there own conclusions from his lyrics and making them their own feelings and meanings of each song as they perceive them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't regret buying this album","review":"I have had Clay's album for 2 1/2 months (since it first came out), and I have to say I don't get tired of listening to it. Some say this album doesn't have anything special on it, and that it doesn't show off the range of Clay's voice. I have to disagree with those who find fault with the album. Clay has a phenomenal voice, and I am sure that we will be hearing much more from him in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better Every Time!","review":"Altho I Like Ruben very much I was disappointed that Clay did not win top billing on American Idol. I eagerly awaited the release of this album and I was worried when I heard the first critics opinions. They talked of how boring it was. I bought it anyway and I havent regretted it from the very first time I played it. I cant say that there is a song on this album that I dont like and the more I play it the better it gets. I can only see Clay getting better from here as he got better with each and every American Idol Show. If you like Clays voice this album is a must have and play it often to get the full pleasure from it. It definitely Gets Better Every Time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!","review":"I can't get enough of this marvelous CD. I have to admit I play it over and over again, every day. It is mesmerizing.To those who say the album does not reflect this singer (i.e., he is not a song writer so he doesn't know squat), I say WHO CARES? How many artists out there today actually write their own songs and have lived every word of them?? To naysayers who do not believe a good singing voice makes an artist, well, I think there are about two million people out there who would tend to disagree with that assumption!!I have news for all of you doubters. This IS real music; music that has been sorely missing from the airwaves for years. So,you'd better get used to it - Clay is here to stay.AND I, FOR ONE, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS MUSIC AS LONG AS HE CHOOSES TO GRACE US WITH HIS REFRESHING STYLE AND MARVELOUS VOCAL ABILITIES!Buy Measure of a Man and see for yourself what REAL SINGING is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice - Feel good romantic songs","review":"At last an artist who can actually sing. Love this distinctive voice and enjoy all the tracks on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! A MUST HAVE!","review":"This album is incredible! It has been too, too long since an album has been made that is packed with all #1 hits. Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man will revolutionize the music industry. His pure, amazing voice is brethtaking. This album is a definite MUST for all Music Lovers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD!!!","review":"everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!!","review":"I have to tell you I'am one of those that only buys \\"Best Of\\" CD'S...I hate to spend the money to only listen to 1 or 2 tracks..With this CD I have listened to every single song from the first time!

The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Surely the developer of the game had to notice that the tower would not stay on. I also notices that the bushes (or whatever they are)do not attach where they are located as shown on the box and they will not stay attached either. If I glue everything on, it will probably be o.k., but why wouldn't the manufacturer have just made the connection for the tower more durable? Toy is actually fun and hold my childs attention, if you can keep it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"We were very excited to give the Titan Tower to our son for Christmas...and are now very disappointed.

But, the tower doesn't stay on and I took the advise of someone that reviewed the item and crazyglued the tower on to the base. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product if you can help it.

This item was on his Christmas list as one of his \\"big\\" things. As I was putting it together \\"for Santa\\", I was very disappointed at how poorly it was made. The sections wouldn't stay together at all. The little rockets/missles barely shoot out of the thing. In the back, there is a trigger thing that is supposed to launch the little car. Well, it barely touches the car at all. Not only that, the instructions were bogus and not very clear. For the money, you'd think it had lights and noises etc... Nada. My son was really disappointed. So, if you're child is wanting this try to discourage it. My son still plays with it but it's really not worth it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure This Actually Works","review":"I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling.

Cheap, low thread count t-shirt. When ordering these rock shirts, be sure to ask the seller what kind of shirt it's been printed on. If you're like me, you like to keep your rock shirts around until they get nice and faded. The DELTA shirts won't last that long. The eact same thing happened with a new RIde the Lightning shirt, and I'm a little frustrated.

The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Special Book","review":"It does not matter if you are interested in Struts. This book is written with a view to the ideas behind Struts and in any MVC architecture for a web framework.

Ted Husted is a writer among writers in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imcomplete and poorly written","review":"I have purchased and read alot of programming books, and by far this is one of the worst prepared books I have seen. The author drags out the developement of a simple login system over 4-5 chapters. Thank God he provided the code on the web server, as he only give complete code listings on certain classes, and leaves the reader to piece together other classes. After chapter 5 I put it down and went back to the ORielly series were I actual learned something. The book has the information in it if you can put up with the repetive approach and fragmented code. Please re-think and re-write. Not a book for the first time strut user."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL LET DOWN - FULL OF ERRORS","review":"Book is incomplete and full of errors, even simple errors where toString is in the code and not used properly and throws an error - he left off the \\"()\\". And we are supposed to learn from someone who can not use toString? The code from web site does not compile per book instructions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this, no matter what the paid-reviewers say. This is one of the worst written book, code fragments and no full listing of code. The site provides code that does not compile correctly with vague insrtuctions as if it were going to actual work. Stick with O'Reilly series. Please Ted Husted, find another profession.....

I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary Stuff!","review":"Not impressed with the Authors' writing style, at points it really puts you off.

It looks like that the information is gathered from various sources and put together without explaining the important details. It tells an overview of the struts but fails to explain how and why.

The book is well written, but has some mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Java Architects","review":"This book is extremely useful for Java Architects that need to design scalable web applications. The author did a very good job describing all the proper design patterns that should be used in the presentation tier. This book appears to focus on the most important architectural issues in web development such as integrating the presentation tier with the business tier. I was also impressed with the author's ability to clearly defined how the new generation of struts design patterns should be used when building scalable web applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer worth reading","review":"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Bad Book","review":"I've read it over and over and I can't understand anything. Struts Html Tags are glossed over without examples. Just 2 lines on how to use the tags but the object/bean that it refers to is left to your imagination. If you understand the javadoc that comes with Struts then this will be clear to you but then you don't need a book.

For one just starting to work with Java technologies I found use of the book detrimental to learning Struts. (I had been told it was not a bad reference.) I would have given it a lower rating had the review interface allowed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on Struts I've seen","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. I had already bought another book, but felt it had many gaps. I borrowed Struts in Action, read a couple of chapters, and was very impressed.

All in all a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most, but no Struts book seems to cover it all","review":"When I needed to learn Struts, I went first to the online doc, but found it wanting. I then went to the O'Reilly book on the subject, assuming it would be as good as other O'reilly material, but it just wasn't. I did my due diligence and picked Ted Husted's Struts in Action, and I haven't regretted it at all. It covers what needs to be covered, in a methodical logical fashion. Sadly, this is more than I can say for most tech books, not just the ones on Struts. Virtually every Struts book I looked at covered some things I didn't want to know about and left out stuff about things critical to me.

If Peary didn't think it was issue 80 years ago, why is race still an issue? This is the question that forms an undercurrent to the story in the book. Someday, perhaps, we'll talk of Peary and Henson's exploits, and the word \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" will only be relevent when disussing seal noses and snow...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an author out there?","review":"Why doesn't someone write an adult book about Matt Henson?

If you don't end up loving it, you're at least guaranteed to think it's pretty funny.This is just one of those records you can't really intellectualize. You hear it, you love it or you hate it. It's all about fun fun fun and, for me, took no work at all to enjoy or \\"get into\\".For the late 90's, this was a very bold album to produce. So much pressure is put on electronic artists to sound absolutely new and completely groundbreaking, and this record isn't only tinged with 80's influences-- it often sounds like it was made IN the 80's.Most of these tracks are wonderful, I only find two to be unlistenable \\"Soft Machine\\" and \\"From: Disco To: Disco\\".

You could definitely do worse. Also, it is consistent. So if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 80s were crap, this album is good","review":"What I remember about eighties music was a few good singles here and there with a nice sound but rubbish albums. Darkdancer is like all the good bits of the 80s with better production and done by someone with some musical talent. Although there's some good pop songs on this album, others unfurl subtlely, even majestically. Nostalgia aside, what makes the record good is the music itself. Now that I think of it, there's loads of 80s compilations coming out at the moment. I hope this doesn't mean a full-on revival is on the cards. The charts in the 1980s were poor. That's that. It's not clever to like it now; at least Le Conte or whatever his name is has some skill so I'll let him off. A good albom.

Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective). The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil. In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story. But, I would look for one of those, first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf","review":"The story Beowulf should be like a role model for other books.

For one it seems on the cover of the book and the review on the back the whole book would be about Beowulf fighting Grendel, but that is only half of the book.

The picture and description didn't really show the product well when I ordered this rather pricey item. I took the weight out of the box, looked at it, and put it back in. Probably will donate to some worthy cause. I ended up going to a big box retail store and just buying a non-adjustable weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good features, some bad.","review":"The ability to adjust the weight of this product is great. The BIG disappointment is the velcro strap, which I can't believe will last long, especially as I begin to add more weights. I think this product would have been far better if the ankle weight came with an adjustable strap with a plastic buckle closure. Then you would adjust once and just simply buckle the strap when you put it on. This feature is especially critical when you're trying to put the weight on your \\"bad\\" leg and struggling to get it snug with the long unwieldy velcro strap. I can not recommend this device with this strap mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"too large","review":"I tested this product out on 3 different cats.

It was the last Clapton commercial release I acquired. I can only ask myself how I let this gem slip through the cracks. I agree with most reviewers that \\"461\\" and \\"Slowhand\\" are better recordings. However, the disappointment listeners feel with this album is a testament to Clapton's brilliance. By any other artist, this recording would be getting far greater accolades. However, Clapton fans are used to over-the-top, superb recordings on a regular basis, rendering us spoiled. I submit that an \\"average\\" Clapton album is superior to many musician's best work. My favorite song on the album, written by EC, is \\"Hello Old Friend.\\" Simple and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of Rock'n Roll","review":"Excelent songs among outstanding musicians such as the members of \\"The Band\\" and Bob Dylan.

The idea--of mostly Latino women coming together to discuss the vicissitudes of life--is original, but the novel just sputters along. Part of the problem is that the dialogue is reduced to idle chatter and the narrator remains aloof and--do I dare say it--boring. The reader never gets a sense of how the advice of the Latino women influences her life in any deep way. The writing, also, is a disappointment: flat and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious reading","review":"I minored in Spanish, was an exhange student in Madrid and embrace many aspects of Latin culture and devour lots and lots of Latino and Hispanic Lit. The idea for this book had so much potential, but the novel just doesn't work. It's hard to believe or get into the voice of the narrator, Claire, an adult young woman character because she comes off girlish, shallow, and wholly boring, and the Latina characters were just too superficially written to retain my interest and were unbelievable because they lacked depth and human oddities and characteristics that make characters in literature so memorable. The women either come off too saintly to believe or stereotypical. The concept for the novel was great, but the writer fails because this novel doesn't have ironies, interesting drama, complex personality contradictions within the characters, a fresh or provocative writing style, believable epiphanies, or any treats the reader can take away with her/him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet my expectations","review":"I was soooo looking forward to reading this book but it just didn't do it for me. I was intrigued by the meetings of women of various generations and the Spanish (food) theme--just the right mix for me, so I thought. It just dragged and never made me feel involved or care about the characters. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite SciFi of all time!","review":"Works on many levels, but it can be read as a great adventure like Ivanhoe or Treasure Island. Religon mixed with science and technology; where is the line between them? What direction can the corruption of absolute power take, when that power is life after death! What could be done, if one could live a thousand lifetimes? What would you do to live just one more lifetime? The most disappointing thing to me, is that the author, in my opinion has never come close to equaling this book, but then, no one else has either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Story","review":"I picked this up a few days ago and have briskly read through the entire novel since then. This is undoubtedly an epic masterpiece. It is one of the best science fiction books I have read to date. The main strength of the novel is a strong story with an excellent setting. The world is one of ancient religions, literal god-like beings, and advanced technology hiding under the mask of supernatural power. I will not spoil the story but will only say that it is told on an epic Lord of the Rings type scale. The allusions to Eastern philosophy and religion is pretty awesome too. For a sci-fi novel the characters were pretty good. They weren't great like in a Dostoevsky novel, but they weren't completely one-dimensional as is the case in too many sci fi novels. In all, it was masterful. If I ever become a sci fi author, Roger Zalazny would be one of my primary role models."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dissent. I thought it was tedious.","review":"It just didn't hit the spot for me. I found the whole religious thing to be irrelevant. The exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across as being dated to me, a bit of a hippy/60s thing. And because of that, I was not really motivated to suspend my disbelief. It all seemed like magic rather than science, and therefore just a bit silly. If the story and the characters had resonated with me, maybe I would have liked all the battles and action at the end, but it all came across as a bit Bruce Willis-esque.I did like the line \\"the fit hit the Shan\\", though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to \\"old earth\\", even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about \\"sam\\" or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone through 2 copies - Can't wait for the Kindle edition","review":"I read roughly a book a week. This is one of my favourites. I've re-read it enough to have two copies fall apart. It's a challenging read, but a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man who would oppose the Gods.","review":"Combining his wonderful characters with his subtle senseof humor, Zelazny has created another great work. In Lordof Light, Mahasamatman (drop the Maha- &amp; the -atman and call him Sam) opposes the technologically created Godsbased on the Hindu pantheon. Like an abstract painting, every time you read this book something new is seen, felt,or experienced. This book is another example of why Zelazny one of the greatest sci-fi writers of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Him \\"Sam\\"","review":"I recently reread Lord of Light. It is even more incredible than I remembered. It left me wanting more though-- a book twice as long-- a sequel! There is so much left to be told-- that could have been told. I guess that's the mark of a great book. Everything that makes Zelazny great is in this book-the philosophy, the adventure, the fantasy, the science fiction, the gods and the humans evolving into higher states, corruption of power, Light and Death, and lots of engaging characters. I loved Sam of course, but Yama steals the show! Tak is great-- as is the wiley Ganesha. So many twists and turns and surprises await just when you think you see what's coming. After all the imitations, this book is still fresh and free and full of wonder.I think this must be his greatest book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and nearly spiritual; classic scifi epic.","review":"While similar in premise to some of his other tales of worldshaking technological demigods, this book has some additional moral elements. Zelazny offers them plainly, evoking a feeling of religious historicism that makes some of the shinier platitudes more appropriate. He achieves this with decorous dialogue and a marvelous and nearly timeless portrayal of technological 'miracles' that are unfathomable to the hairy-knuckled masses. The sympathetic and chain-smoking antihero is also present, driving the archetypical story along a delineated route of demon-dealing and decadence. Zelazny's wordcraft is excellent, and this book should be well received by all but the most technophiliac of science fiction connoisseurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"I have read thousands of books, including all kinds of literature, but I am nearly sure that this is the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book","review":"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and Zelazny remains one of my favourite authors. His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found \\"Eye of Cat\\" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in \\"Lord of Light\\". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s. This novel has a permanent place on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking ride","review":"This is Roger Zelazny's masterpiece; a highly imaginative thing of beauty, Lord of Light tells its story at break-neck pace which will appease even the most easily bored reader. The language is fluid, often times poetic, and ultimately a feast for the senses. The story spans many years and depicts the epic struggle of one man who could have been god, against all those who now rule the world with an intolerant fist. Technology is precious, and hidden from the general populace who are forced to live in a sort of perpetual Dark Age so that the gods they worship may continue the turpitude that is their tyranny. The Hindu religion is used to exploit its followers and the pinnacle of its precepts--Reincarnation--degenerates into nothing more than a bargaining chip to further accentuate the gap in power. Roger Zelazny is an innovator without equal and one of the most important science fiction writers to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written","review":"Not a single word or moment is wasted in this book. The characters are real and interesting, the setting fascinating, and the plot compelling. Nothing could improve this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be considered a literature classic!","review":"This book is not only one of the best Sci-Fi/ fantasy books, but a work which compares well with those considered contemporary classics. It is as if Terry Gilliam and Kurt Vonnegut got together to combine the story of Buddha and the rise of organized religion at the same time. If you enjoyed \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" by Vonnegut, I think you will really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for every collectiom","review":"This book just cries for a continuation. once started it is difficult to put down. I am lucky that i have the orginal paperback edition, that despite many readings is still in good condition. It helps if you know a bit about Indian religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential in any serious sci fi collection","review":"Any Hugo/Nebula Award winner is always worth reading, but Lord of Light stands out even in that illustrious list. Have bought it at least half a dozen times since first reading it 25 years or so ago, as keep lending it, not getting it back. Can still quote chunks of it. The scope is huge, the writing is elegant and spare. Wish I'd written him that fan letter way back then.

I am now in my early forties and have recently reread Lord of Light. It is still my favorite book. It is thought provoking, full of colorful characters, and as is often the case in Zelazny's books, it has a reluctant hero/protagonist (Sam/Buddah) whose primary attribute is his humanity. Ultimately, Sam's heroism is demonstrated by his ability to convince his peer's of their own ties to humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"This novel involves mythology, yet again. Zelazny really liked writing about that stuff, it is not very hard to spot that.A group of highly evolved and powerful posthumans on a planet, are viewed as gods by the other, standard human type denizens.Being gods, of course there are conflicts, petty squabbles, one-upsmanship and trickery.The mythology in question is Hindu, this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent novel about Hindu gods on another planet","review":"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the \\"gods\\". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Maybe I would have loved this when I was in college? My 13-year-old son turned me on to this book. He loved it but to be honest, the first half of the book seemed to be intentionally confusing and unexplained. I was too tired to take the rest of it seriously. I sped through it slowing down to wonder about the significance the character spouting the sermon on the mount near the end. I'm giving it two stars to show my lack of enthusiasm in the first reading. Since my son liked enough to get the hardback for his 'best books' collection, I feel bound to give it another chance some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle","review":"This story was a joy to read. Centered on the characters, and their choices in a conflict of their own making, the narrative does not let any of them off easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Stars for Sam","review":"My only regret is that it ends. Once I entered the rich world created by Zelazny, I never wanted to leave. I have read and re-read this masterpiece of science fiction, and my time has always been well rewarded. But I can't help envying any person who had the chance to read it for the first time. Just as the Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Asimov's I, Robot, Gibson's Neuromancer, Card's Ender's Game and other works were ground-breaking works in the genre, Lord of Light is a timeless classic that must be on the shelf of any SF lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Takin' Back My Name\\" Hardly Ike","review":"In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person.

This is the other side of the Religious Culture Wars that we've heard so much about in the last years -- but this is the history of the side that has not claimed its length and depth. Find out where liberal religions have come from. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barhaiya! Really excellent","review":"This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents \\"Hindi as she is spoke\\". I would not say that it is \\"better\\" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating guided tour. Highly recommended.","review":"This devotional is a terriffic, fresh approach to reading through the Bible in an overview or summary format. Each day's reading (using a modern translation) is accompanied by brief and informative text from Brenda Quinn or Philip Yancey, and then 1 or 2 questions to ponder. Both Quinn and Yancey have a reader-friendly, intelligent manner of writing that invites one to think rather than telling one what to think.Makes a nice gift book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fantasy I've Read Since The Hobbit!","review":"The entire Albion Trilogy is awesome and \\"The Paradise War\\" sets the stage for the adventure of a lifetime. I first became aware of the series through the music of Jeff Johnson (Ark Records) and Brian Dunning (NightNoise). The Trilogy of instrumental Celtic Music based on the Lawhead books was so tastefully done, it enticed me to find the books. I was not disappointed. All I can say is, everyone that I've ever suggested these books to that read them - loved them! You have got to read these, and might I suggest you hunt down the CD's too! They are great soundtracks to set the mood for great reading!\\"Hear, O Son of Albion: Blood is born of blood. Flesh is born of flesh.

I really enjoy the mystical and unknown. The way Lawhead puts it together is amazing. He makes me feel that I am there and part of the action. I really enjoy how he adds another story in part of the story itself too. I have read the sequals and they are all awesome. This was the book that started it for me though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Maybe the first book about which I can honestly say , I couldn't put it down! The way the story unfolds and resonates with the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ is remarkable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First-Person Historical Fantasy","review":"I got this book for free as a limited-time offer for Kindle, so I might be a little biased. That being said, I still think it's worth either buying or renting from the library. What's unique about it is that it is largely told from the first-person perspective of Lewis, an American college student studying at Oxford University in the UK. Lewis, following after his friend Simon, enters into the world of Albion which is styled after Celtic history and mythology. Many people are opposed to the book because of its Christian themes but I would say give it try anyway. It's a refreshing and unique take on historical fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing story!","review":"I picked up the Kindle version of this book when Amazon made it free for a limited time, and I'm so glad they did (it worked out for Amazon too, because I purchased the other two books as soon as I finished this one). I had kind of fallen out of reading for pleasure and just bought the Kindle. This was my second book I read on it and I loved it so much that I've been reading like crazy ever since. Lawhead totally pulls you into the world he creates. The characters, environment, battles, and problems are all well developed and you end up totally engrossed. I'm glad it was a trilogy and not over after only this one book.A great read for any fantasy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly enjoyed","review":"I randomly picked up this book while down with the flu and ended up reading the whole trilogy over three days. It truly kept me entertained and interested.I am not Irish and know little about Celtic lore, so some areas didn't excite me as much as other reviewers mentioning interest for the particular history. And while the story line and tale was enough to keep me reading straight through, it isn't the most amazing writing I've come a across4 stars = definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I loved this book.

So predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, why such good reviews?","review":"Another series created out of the idea that a run of the mill dude discovers an alternate world, where he all a sudden becomes courageous and forgets his past.

Lawhead is one of my favorite authors, and books like these confirm why. His attention to detail is amazing. Usually I skip over background to get straight to the action in books, but I found myself relishing every word in much of this series. My only complaint is that in the first hardcover printing, I believe the artwork on the covers to be out of order.

Sections of each book in this trilogy are excellent and quite enjoyable. However, there are longer portions that are awkward and tedious. The writer also commits a number of literary sins that drag the whole down. In the first book, there is the character of the professor. He is quite flat and is what is known as \\"the author's mouthpiece\\"--a set-piece device used to conveniently convey information that the author has trouble working in otherwise. The professor has at least a couple long monologues that reek of the above device.Although there are worthwhile sections, I recommend you avoid this title and pick up something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and entertaining","review":"The best complimentI could pay this book is that I want to read the sequel. The book inexplicably overstates ours welcome in some areas only to rush through others. I almost wish this first volume had been split into two more comprehensive books. Overall, an entertaining and rewarding read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"For those who love Celtic fiction, this is a must have. At times Lawhead suffers from mid-book doldrums, and this book is no exception; however, this is probably my favorite Lawhead book.

It has none of the typical angst you often see in today's teen characters. There is no romance. A Coming of Age is more like a SciFi Crime Drama, a mystery set on another planet with twists and turns so complex I was always on the edge of my seat.One thing I found refreshing was the lack of over-explanation. Zahn left it up to his readers to interpret subtle clues about the plot and alien terminology from the context.

The actors maintain their interesting persona's, but with poor support from poorly written, obviously hastily written, LACKLUSTER STORIES. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT COMPARED TO SEASON ONE! One wonders if the original writing staff was replaced, and a new group of writers had to come up with something over the weekend. Other readers my not agree with my assessment, and if not, I am glad they are happy with their purchase. I returned mine, as I, fortunately, found one of my DVD discs to have a pixel defect.

Although I loved the first season, it was more of an introduction to the show than anything else. The second season allowed for more exploration of the characters and the story lines, and did so remarkably well.I never thought I would like a 'Sci Fci' show, but this really isn't. It's not more 'out there' than Lost or Fringe or any of the other shows on basic networks.

Trying to put the discs back is a real challenge. This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery).

Ms Tapping's acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn't improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season).

It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I found this book on special for 5 Australian dollars so I picked it up. I didn't get around to reading it for a little while but I should have never bothered in the first place for a few reasons.The book is too focused on the american economy and had very little information which could be linked to Australia's economy.From the first page it presented itself as a very bland read, giving barely any encouraging information for anyone wanting to expand on their finances.

John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read by Two Excellent Breeders","review":"This authors of this book really needed the assistance of a professional writer!

Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

I was awed-- it's amazing the way that the author was able to construct such a completely unjust society, and then turn around and make such a compellingly strong case in its favor. (Saying any more would completely give away the ending to the first book!). A must read. The truly amazing thing is that, after searching for this book for literally eighteen years, I have found it to be every bit as powerful and provoking a read as it was all those years ago... it's lost absolutely NOTHING over the years, unusual for a science fiction book to seem fresh and relevant after so many years.

It had never occurred to me that there could be sequels, so I was delighted to find this trilogy at Amazon and finally read the rest of the story.

Unfortunately, after Made Man No Limit fell off. Silkk is quite simply a copycat. There is not a unique track on the album. The tracks seem to be copied from previous Cash Money albums. Silkk annoys me because sometimes he is trying to be a thug and on other occasions he is preaching nonviolence and doing boy-girl collabos. Which one is it Silkk?The only real rappers on No Lmit were C-Murder, Mac, and Soulja Slim. Unfortunately C-Murder and Mac are on lock down and Slim is no longer with No limit. You should hear Slim's new album Years later a few months after. He said that he saw Silkk in a victoria's secret catalogue! P should give it up. He can't survive without Mac and C-Murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like C-Murder and Mac, but this guy is wack","review":"Silkk might want to consider playing basketball if the continues to make CD's like this. Charge it 2 da game was good , but this is hoorible. The only two tight rappers on No Limit were C-Murder and Mac and they are both locked up. I suppose having guest artists like Trina and Snoop Dogg would make the album better, it does make it better but they can't save it. There are a few decent tracks here. The track with Krazy and C-Murder was good, and the track with Trina was cool too. The problem is, Silkk can't rap. Maybe Soulja Slim will have to lead the label. P and Silkk are not doing too well."},{"rating":"1","title":"he has not matured as an artist","review":"After seeing Silkk on 106 and park talking about how he had matured since Made Man, I thought this CD would be philosophical and superior to Made Man.

On this cd that song is \\"What's Heaven Like\\". In This crazy mixed up world It's good to know that rappers can relate to God, even though they always appear to be bad guys.

I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc. I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.I have recently read \\"What Dreams May Come\\" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story. (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).There were still a few times while reading \\"Book of Dreams\\" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, \\"Wow, is she for real??\\" But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense.

I love the Resident Evil series, but this one sucked. Your AI partners are not very intelligent, they run around and don't listen to you when you need them. Normal mode is actually more like a \\"hard\\" mode. You can't really pause the game as it is live and the monsters come get you anyway, even when your in your inventory screen. The online option has been disabled so you can't play with other people anymore.It was just a hassle to control three people simultaneously, two of which never listen anyway.The only good thing is the scenery and surroundings. Also I liked how zombies could run after you if they wanted, instead of always dragging themselves around. Other than that, I really did not like this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't come with a case","review":"I mainly bought this game so I can complete my Resident Evil collection, but you only get the actual game disc and not the game case.

Outbreak File: 2 had a nice improvement. The ability to somewhat walk while aiming was nice. You no longer have to standing shooting while waiting for your doom. Some of the characters now have their own items that are just for them. That was a NICE improvement. The levels are a little more hectic now, but the alternate endings in Outbreak 1 were much better. The online play is good, if you find some good people to play with. I didn't mind not having voice chat or anything like that, it was good to keep the game somewhat realistic. It would suck, if you heard a deep manly voice coming from one of the female characters. Also people would just talk about other things besides what's going on in this game and it'd be too much like a chat room with zombies. I give this game a 5 out of 5, a definite must have for any REAL Resident Evil fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame to the Resident Evil name","review":"So much for hoping Capcom would have learned it's lesson from the first Outbreak game. Nothing was improved in this chapter. This game still has the same stupid A.I. and annoying real time window that made the first game horrible. Not to mention the characters' audio and text often times don't correlate. Zombies popping up at random times just helped to compound frustration levels. Probably most disappointing is the lack of suspense and creepy atmosphere that made many Resident Evil predecessors so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, fast shipping","review":"This thing arrived five days before the original estimated delivery date and even one day before the Fed-Ex date. Rolled nicely in the box without folds or crunching that would cause roll marks in the nap. Fits great on the dash in my 96 Camaro. The only thing to mention would be that where the dash drops to the right of the instrument panel the binding sticks out slightly further than anywhere else. Could only be on my particular piece, as I do not know if they are bound individually or machine run. Overall a great buy and worth every penny. I purchased this because my main dash plastic has several cracks and the dash mat was less than half the price of a new main dash panel and of course, less work. Best improvement to the car to date!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy install? I don't think so.","review":"I ordered the Dashmat under the premise that it was an easy install, being mechanically retarded this appealed to me....lol...I'm sure it would have been easier had the velcro that came with it actually stuck to the dash. I did what the instructions said, clean the dash thoroughly with a mild solution, NO Armoral, my dash hadn't seen Armoral in 10 years in fact. So after fighting, sweating, and swearing over the non-sticky velcro I found myself at the auto store looking for industrial strength velcro.

If you only bought the book with no accessories as I did, you are pretty much out of the loop as all the pictures and examples include his products. His system may work, but why not be up front about it? Just tell us what is going on, and if you are like me and already have invested in a really good (Starrett) protractor, pass on his book and get a more straightforward guide to installing trim.I also agree with others who think the reviews are fishy.

What it had that the current edition has much less of was an exhaustive collection of allusions to classical literature and mythology. This made it indispensable if you were reading 19th Century literature (or earlier), where allusions to these texts were not only more common, but went unexplained because contemporaneous readers didn't need the explanation. The current edition has cut much of this - admittedly obscure - material, presumably to make room for items of more contemporary appeal. \\"Brewer\\" was at least as much fun to \\"dip into\\" with nothing in particular to track down as it was for reference use.

I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says \\"Elbow\\" and not this sport version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elbow Brace","review":"The Futuro Tennis Elbow Support is a good value.

This is heavy music powered not only by jazz funk but by an otherworldliness that only Miles Davis could create. This is heavily influential on anyone from DJ Spooky to Tortoise.

It's well made but not too expensive. The only drawback I can see is that has little wheels on the sides that engage the floor when downward pressure is applied. That's probably to keep the attachment from being pushed so low on its bristles that it pushes dirt in front of it, and in fact I can say that the wheels do not affect the suction.

My current cable cutter is a basic straight edge cutter, and it does the job well, but sometimes the cables slip out of the jaw since the blades are straight. So, with this curved jaw, I was pretty excited (as one can be for a hand tool).My tool arrived today and I decided to test the cable cutter out on a piece of shielded 1/8\\" stranded wire. First attempt, EPIC FAIL!!! It cut through the plastic sheath and only one piece of the wire strand was actually cut through, the rest, just bent at the point of contact.What's worse? The blade on the bottom jaw got chipped. Very disappointed in this tool, when my generic wire/cable cutter can do the job at half the price. Tool looks well designed and strong, but the blade edge is way too thin and fragile. This tool is being sent back to Amazon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality tool","review":"I only tried a few test cuts, but upon examination of the tool, it's definitely a good quality cutter and you can't go wrong with these. The only drawback is it's slightly smaller than the typical 9.5\\" cutters sold by Channellock or Greenlee so I would imagine you won't get as much leverage using this 1 inch shorter cutter. I also tried the Channellocks though and really can't tell much difference with cutting (my test cuts were on 14-3 romex) between the two brands. However, the smaller size can also be an advantage because it's lighter and smaller so takes up less space in your toolbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"have to use two hands","review":"you have to use two hands, because the jaws do not open far enough to get the wire in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor cutting quality","review":"These cable cutters are just about worthless. I purchased them to trim bicycle cable shielding and cables. They barely do either of these, when trying to cut shielding it simply folds the cable in half and then jams. I have tried different holding positions and placement of the shielding in the cutter, with simply no different results. They will cut the cables themselves if you get the placement perfect. They have chipped already and will probably only be used in situations where I don't care about having a clean cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i ordered!!!!!!!!","review":"Ordered this product expecting to receive what was shown on the picture but got something different.

It skipped very quickly about 4 times but it didn't interfere with the entertainment value. Whoever cut this show up though, did a very poor job. Too many 3 second close ups and then going from scene to scene. Too many crowdshots also. All these great guitarists and their solos were so poorly put together by the producers. Bad job.

The music is in the vein of \\"Old Loves Die Hard.\\" This CD, however, is a bit lighter overall and even more prominently features B. Palmer's somewhat flowerly yet pleasant vocals.In my view, the 2002 re-master of this CD is just plain poor. The bass is too heavy and dull, and the sound lacks brightness. Increasing the treble, manually, will help the music to shine. Also, the bonus track is merely an edited version of the last tune on the CD, so its inclusion is hardly of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book / lousy ebook","review":"downloaded the book and immediately started to suffer from kindle freeze. it completely locked up my kindle. took a lot of effort to get back in but as soon as i deleted the book kindle performance was back to normal. other reviews dont metion this problem so im mystified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader From Texas","review":"I thought it was a superb read.

The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring. When I first read the book, I had heard great things about it, but when I read the book, I was very disspointed. Take my advise, don't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good first half -- extremely dissappointing end","review":"I really enjoyed the first half of this book.

I think it had a very disappointing end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Beneath the Seas","review":"I first read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea more than 50 years ago. It was, and still is, a first rate adventure tale. Jules Verne combines action, oceanography, biology, and a bit of philosophy in this epic story.

The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this book!","review":"Don't get this book unless you are five years old!

Nice illustrations, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Verne's Best.","review":"Note to all first time readers. This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, \\"far ahead of its time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"This is one of Verne's best books. It is full of scientific and technical/technological details (I had to use several encyclopedias/dictionaries to find some words' meaning), historical references - no doubt Verne researched the topics thoroughly. It is also humorous in places but certainly entertaining and serious on every page. As the story progresses you will discover Verne's view on society in sentences like \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\" As for the storyline, you will never guess what happens next. Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, nice binding, difficult translation","review":"The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard to understand.","review":"I gave this book this raiting because it was hard to understand.

It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine. This book is very exciting because they are always going on different adventures. The book makes me think about when I first road on a sailboat. In the beginning of this book they are sailing on a boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a good book but it gets boring at times.

Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great aid to the real story.","review":"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story.

I think some of it has to do with the fact that the lines were off on some of the sentences throughout the book which made it more difficult.

Remember that this novel was written well before submarines were commonplace and even before the mechanics of submarine bouyancy were fully understood.Can never go wrong with a Jules Verne novel. He is the embodiment of the word science in \\"science-fiction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible narration","review":"The narrator should have a European (french) accent.

I suppose it's unfair to judge it my modern standards, but I will anyway. I found the policy of our heroes attempting to kill any animal they possibly could more than a little disturbing: when the book mentioned dolphins and sea otters the thought that flashed through my head was \\"talking stag\\". Not only that, but the book's bloody boring! It consists of many vague, unfocused, and quite unconnected episodes that never evoked any interest whatsoever. I would not have finished this book if I hadn't been reading it for a class.

The book might say something like, \\"The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius.\\" You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a trial to read","review":"I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"....","review":"Personally, I enjoyed the book tremendously. The author dived into the action pretty quickly, and it took me just a few pages to get to the excitement. By the way, I'm reading the unabridged version, so correct me if I'm wrong. I would have preferred more action-packed scenes and adventure in the book cos' on the whole, it was pretty stale........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dull through most of the story","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews in the sense that there are four or five scenes in this book that get your heart-pumping. Unfortunately that accounts for about a quarter of the book. The rest is full of detailed descriptions of sea life that would appeal to the most passionate environmentalist. The story was interesting, but you have to plow through a lot of boring text. Have a pot of coffee ready!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Printing Choices","review":"I am not commenting on Jules Verne's writing, but rather the format of this particular edition. From the outside, this edition is very nice; as other reviewers have noted, it's great to have the map on the front cover. However, the print inside the book is VERY small. I'm not sure what the publisher was thinking; I've never seen a published book with type this tiny before. The pages are also larger than the average paperback, and the combination of big pages and tiny type gives me an instant headache. Avoid eye strain and buy another edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book.","review":"The book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a really disapointing book.

I would not recommend this book for people my age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all classics are great---obviously.","review":"I read this out loud to my three children when they were young, only one stayed around till the end.

Weird huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful packaging - but the translation is terribly flawed.","review":"For those who, like me, have found great pleasure in surrounding oneself with great literary works, the Easton Press edition books seem to have a lot of draw. However, it has been my experience that many of their novels by foreign authors can be found to contain older and flawed translations.This specific Easton Press contains the Mercier 1873 translation that edits out 25% of the original text. The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century. Happy reading.Peace, Ben"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Stuppendous!","review":"This is the most fantastic book I have ever read!Jules Verne really brings the book to life!

The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book rocks","review":"ok its a good book with a plot that a 3rd grader can understand i know this because i read it in second grade so a 3rd grader should have an easier time. and as far as the word that someone complained about you need to read context clue plus they are not that hard. this is a good book and show the predictions that Verne made. like scuba diving and nuclear power in the 1860's. and btw thats scuba diving with tanks of oxygen and thin wet suits to keep you warm truely he was a genious. i would buy this book read the whole book 3 times during the year but only when i am boged down or i have trouble with my studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poetic Masterpiece","review":"Jules Verne is one of the most captivating and poetic writers ever in existence. All of his novels are complete masterpieces, but this novel is the best one I have ever read. Its intricate plot line and complicated writing style make the novel seem both romantic and adventerous. Although for some the writing style may be too round-a-bout, I find it completely matches the story-line. The unusual adventure needs a writing syle to complement its exciting subtleness, and Jules Verne does just that. Read this from cover to cover and don't skip a word, because each and every one is of significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome classic book.","review":"I'm halfway through this book and I found it great. I just can't give up reading this book. Verne is uncomparable. I think it's one of the greatest classic novels by him. I wish I could go on an underwater adventure like this. I brought the version that is translated by anthony bonner. I tempted to buy a different hardcover version which is more costly, but i ordered this edition at last.

If I wanted to hear his old cds then I would pull them out of my cd case. Every time an artist puts out a cd, in some way it reflects HIS experiences in life. Not his fans.

From \\"Back at One\\" to \\"Still the One\\" to \\"One Last Cry\\" and \\"Anytime\\"... loved em all. If you're hoping for anything remotely like those, you'll wish you hadn't spent the money. It's such a shame that I have to not recommend this album, but it just doesn't shine. I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to \\"his roots\\" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy. And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio. It sorta reminds me of later efforts from Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston where they stopped delivering the kinds of music their fans wanted and instead did their own thing. What a shame, and what a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short shelf-life!","review":"I seem to be having the same problem as everyone else. I bought this DSL modem mostly to get UPNP support for my Nintendo Wii. Worked great for the first 6 months, but I noticed lately it can't connect to the DSL provider or when it does everything crawls and eventually it looses sync. Sadly, I had to replace it with my old DSL modem (SpeedStream) which works perfectly (so I know its not my phone lines or other problems). Also, I noticed the Zoom DSL modem heats up pretty bad, wondering if theres a connection between that and its failure rate.I would definitely find another DSL modem, especially after reading all the other posts regarding the poor reliability issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best used for target practice","review":"Horrible horrible horrible! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get \\"No response from wireless router or access point\\" And it takes me an hour to get back on, just to be on for 5 minutes, then I have to start all over again.

Wireless seems to work well. NAT functionality seems good. However, within minutes to hours, the connection to the CO slows to a virtual stand still. Cycling the power makes the problem go away for a while, if you can put up with doing that every few hours. Firmware upgrades so far have contained empty and unrealized hopes of fixing this problem. You may feel like you've been taken advantage of by the manufacture if you buy this modem after reading on the box how wonderful the product is."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be a good product, but Verizon made it junk","review":"I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company. It was to be \\"combatable\\" to DSL Verizon. Not so said the phone company. You have to by from us, they said. I battled this unit for a month. It changed my IP so many times and would lock up. Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon. One would say, \\"Its the phone company's problem\\", then the phone company would say, \\"Its the modem company's problem\\". I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system. It works great. Buyer beware. It does not work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm looking for a different router","review":"I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've had this item for 3 months, the support people don't know how to handle wireless connections, they keep referring you to the manual... and give you no directions...

It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The \\"story\\" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book","review":"Did you know that the writers/performers worked all night on Tuesdays? Or that Lorne Michaels was a dysfunctional father figure? Well you'll be reminded about every fifth page of this yawner.

If one is looking for a detailed narrative, this book probably is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I've watched the show for years and thought I knew a lot about it, but this book took me backstage and behind the scenes in such cool detail I quickly realized how much more there was to the story of this show. These guys managed to make all the years of the show entertaining and revealing, and I really liked the fact that I could pick up the book, turn to any page, and find a great story to jump from. Probably the best book on a TV show I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating","review":"An incredibly comprehensive history of SNL, from just about every single person who made it happen: the cast, the writers, guests, etc.Whether you still love the show, hate it, or are ambivalent, this book is for you. I found it particularly nice that everyone involved, particularly the comedians, take it seriously here. No one is \\"on\\", no one tries to be funny, everyone just opens their hearts and reveal what they truly feel. I have a (new) huge amount of respect now for Bill Murray who I never thought could take ANYthing seriously - here he is incredibly serious, fortright, and reflective. His thoughts impressed me the most.All the highs and lows are covered. Reflections on lost cast members are respectful and touching.This is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for fans of SNL","review":"I'm a big fan of SNL, so I was quite excited to get into this book. It did not let me down. The reading is very easy, and the format facilitates the transmission of information one wouldn't normally know: the writers, actors, producers, etc. do most of the talking here in short interview snippets, filled in occasionally by explanations of context from the authors of the book. It's a great situation, which allows for memorable moments like Will Ferrell saying Chevy Chase was the worst host he ever worked with. It's fascinating stuff, and I'd recommend it to any SNL fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Delight","review":"If you, like me, have been around long enough to have enjoyed SNL since the beginning (of course with cable reruns, this includes nearly everyone), you will enjoy the behind-the-sceens look at how this long-running cultural event comes together each week. I have loved this show even when it was rotten, because I sensed that the cast and writers new it stunk too. This book confirms my suspicions and provides great insight to the creative process that makes SNL mostly good, sometimes bad, and always unique. Terrific book. An absolute page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is for book 0595237983/// More Towels by Grant Jarrett","review":"i hope this review finds it's way to the write place..I enjoyed this book/found it thought provoking and moving<sprinkled with a fair bit of humor and real life drama.

I bought 4, so if my family is reading this, you'll have a good idea of what you are getting next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"You may think that a book about Saturday Night Live would be fun or perhaps even entertaining. Well this one is not. I hate to disagree with the other reviewers but the book was just huge, boring list of commentary. These authors should not be acclaimed for throwing together a scrapbook of things that other people said. I COULD HAVE DONE IT MYSELF AND SAVED $26! The worst part of the book is looking at the pictures of the authors. They look duller than the book itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overated","review":"When I began to read this book, I was expecting a superbly written historical account of the Saturday Night Live television show, and instead got nothing more than a plethora of transcribed interviews with people associated with the show.When I began reading this book, I was hoping the authors would include a listing of all of the people who have graced the show as regular performers, or one of all of the guest hosts, but none such information was offered.Apparently all it takes to write a best-selling book nowadays is a tape recorder, and a word processor, because that is all this book is comprised of.A court stenographer could have written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Book","review":"The subject could not be more interesting -- a fascinating show with many interesting characters.This book is an abject failure however. Overwritten, dull, and self-indulgent it cannot hold the reader's interest.I was totally disappointed in this book. These so-called writers could have and should have done a far better job with the material. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honestly Subjective History","review":"All history is subjective, of course, but here you get to see what historians are up against when they try to reconcile dozens of conflicting views to try and tell a story. Wisely the authors don't try to tell the story of Saturday Night Live - they let the participants' words speak for themselves, so you hear from those who loved it, those who hated it, and those who, as time has passed, see it with more objective eyes. I would have liked to have heard from some of the missing names: Charles Rocket, Eddie Murphy, etc., but I can only assume they chose not to participate. (The authors don't explain why they aren't represented, or what their interview methods were. I would like to have seen comment on both.) All in all, though, it's an excellent overview of the show's history in the words of those who were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. With so much talent, they put out this?","review":"Given the reputations of those involved, especially Shales, this is a hellacious disappointment and certainly not worth the hardcover price at any discount. They couldn't even get Murphy to talk to them and, given that he saved the show, that is a major problem in a book of this size and alleged scope. O'Donoghue, who was viciously brilliant, is reduced to a parody. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out from reading years of tv commentary or watching the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love It or Hate It","review":"I try to remain neutral about this topic, because of the way that SNL has changed over the years. What was once a dynamo on Saturday night and what changed it to a mediocre program, to one that is still trying to find itself, given the politics of the Hollywood games and players. This is essentially an oral history of the groundbreaking show from the early days to the present. Nearly 600 pages of interviews from the writers and comedians who made the show what it is, and the book includes gossip as well as tributes to deceased cast members likeBelushi, Farley and Hartman. A lot of crude language and anecdotes. I don't know what they're there. Maybe someone thought it was funny, but it detracts from the overall book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayed up all night reading it","review":"This is a terrific oral history of the show. Gives you a sense of how it got off the ground, the insane competition for performers and writers to get sketches into the show, and gossipy stuff like politics, obnoxious hosts, and drug use. Reflections on the deaths of Belushi, Gilda, Farley, and Hartman are tremendously moving. I started this book at about 9:00 p.m., did not put it down until 6:30 a.m. the next morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"The best 'dish' on one of the best shows ever! The most interesting parts, I thought, was when reading things from the writers' perspectives... the unseen, unheralded talent behind it all. (Just an opinion.) Highly recommended.Also recommended - NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too long","review":"I agree with whoever wrote that this book was way too long and unorganized. I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.The format makes for an odd read. You get things like someone rapsodizing about what a \\"beautiful person\\" John Belushi was a couple paragraphs after someone reminiscing about the time he set stuff on fire and passed out in a drunken stupor. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Days I'll Never Get Back","review":"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"All opinions","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and felt like I got an insiders look into SNL. The book allowed everyone to say their peace and give their side of the story. It was interesting to see all of the dynamics from the executives, to Loren, to the writers and the actors. I felt like i could really form my own opinion based on the testimonies of the people involved. It was an easy to read format with little blurbs from each person involved in a particular topic/cast/year. The writers would all a paragraph here and there to help transition between topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting behind-the-scenes look at SNL, but I got bored","review":"If you're a hardcore SNL fan who is interested in learning the history of the show, this book is for you. If you want to read about what happened the behind-the-scenes--the sex, drugs, and so on--this book is for you. I liked the way the people involved told the bulk of the story. I loved the first 25-30% of the book but then it felt like I was reading the same story from one season to the next: this guy did these drugs, this woman was sleeping with this guy, this one wasn't too popular with other cast members ... and then that season ended and another began. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IQ - Great live album","review":"Not many reviews for this one so I thought I would talk it up. It is a great 2cd set with good sound that gives you a good mix of material. 4 songs from each album with Peter Nichols and a few from the Paul Menel years. Peter sings the Menel songs very good IMHO. This is a great prog rock album and if you haven't heard IQ before it is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"I have been in an insatiable mood lately for new progressive rock music buying CDs on a daily basis. I have uncovered some superb new bands such as Riverside, Abigail's Ghost, Frost, Phideaux with the first two named bands being absolutely exceptional. I was encouraged by other reviews to try IQ and this album particularly as being an exceptional and representative example. I think what one reviewer said sums it all up. IQ have managed to be what they are because they simple outlasted everyone else. I was sorely disappointed with this album for its total lack of anything original and new. Musically its fine progressive rock but it is not original. Yes it is Genesis, come Marillion etc. but one thing it is not is anything like Seconds Out. Overall I found the album flat and uninspiring...sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics made easy!","review":"If you thot the classics were difficult and boring, well think again! This books bring them alive, and provides a beginner's understanding of just what the classics can mean to anyone. This book is both educational, as well as inspiring - even to anyone on a desert island for the past 50 years. I only wish the opera offering(s) were more extensive;maybe Zorn and August should write a similar version exclusively for opera - I wish they would. This text was required reading for a summer school class at our local Clark College, but it has become a key volume in my meager musical library, and will be referred to often."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Butchering of a Great Story","review":"There are so many departures from the story the book tells.. I won't even bother to list them.. I suppose there are some who might enjoy the movie but having read the book first I was thoroughly disappointed. The makers of this movie vainly attempt to spice up a great story with everything the story is not. They try to make a war movie out a book with only one battle scene.. they try to add a romantic twist to a story without any romance at all. As a Christian there are sweet elements of this classic story that are so muddled by all the additional fluff in the movie as to make it completely worthless. If you are interested in the movie because you loved the book, you are looking in the wrong place. You won't find much of anything resembling the book in this movie. I purchased this movie against the recommendations of reviewers like those found here.. Don't make the same mistake.. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually stunning but story adulterated","review":"The movie captures the look and feel of Narnia and many scenes are beautifully blocked and filmed. However, the movie's creators tampered too much with the actual story. This is a flaw not because they \\"should\\" or \\"must\\" copy the books exactly;we all recognize that some creativity may be required to retell a book's story as a smashingly good movie. This, they failed to do. The ridiculous attempt at a love story between Susan and the Prince was embarassing. And turning Miraz the usurper into the first acceptor of the new land was totally unnecessary and ineffective. News flash: There is a reason these stories have stood the test of time and been read and re-read by children and adults, generation after generation-- they are good stories! Don't mess with them unless it's absolutely necessary and is done effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable","review":"90% of it was not in the book. Strong misunderstanding of the book or it's themes.Basically this was a scifi channel movie (ie terrible) with better actors and special effects.Whoever was responsible for this movie should be tied to a pole and whipped, then allowed to go back and play dungeons and dragons by himself in the basement.They could have found someone who could resonate with the book and bring it forward in a new light. Instead they found someone who felt a need to make it a nonstop meaningless sequence of stupid fight scenes.If the movie is only 10% based on the book, don't use it's name. Try and sell your sad movie on it's own merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous","review":"As many others have said, the unnecessary deviations from the book were just horrible. Why not just make up a new story about Narnia that Lewis never told before ?The character relationship development was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriatingly Inaccurate! 10 Thumbs Down","review":"*** Infuriatingly Inaccurate! *** Die Hard Narian Fans take heed to my advice and don't even waste your time on this movie. For example Disney thought that it was ok to allow Prince Caspian to KISS Queen Susan ( Attention Disney: That NEVER happened in the book! ). There are a number of other inaccurate happenings in this movie, but I will not waste your time to list them all ... This movie is in my own Top TEN most hated movies of all time. I REFUSE to buy this version. I will not waste my money on it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It deviated a lot from the book","review":"Really, the title of my review is my review. The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me. I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added \\"love interest\\" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there. That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian. sigh. A very pretty movie though - I loved the river god - just sadly altered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia strikes again!!","review":"Some sequels do not carry the intensity and glory of their pilot movies. This movie definitely does. The main characters are all back and they are involved in an attempt to restore Narnia to its formal glory. The action is top notched and the story grips you from the beginning. The blu-ray version looks great and the sound is crisp and intense. Although some of the movie is not actually in C.S. Lewis' novel, it still stays true to the story line and fans of the beloved series will love this movie. I can't wait until the third movie release. Bring it on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blu-ray Quality","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" in blu-ray format.

I'll be getting it soon myself when I get the money to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince Caspian - Book #4","review":"This was a great movie, although not quite as good as the first one. I would still recommend for those Narnia lovers to buy it, just be prepared to be slightly confused from the skipping of books and information. It all makes sense at the end, but you may have to watch it several times for everything to fit with the first movie. If you've read the books, it's no problem, except if you're like me and haven't read the books since you were in 4th grade. Still good though, love to see where the kids end up."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"When The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came out I didn't want to see it. I practically learned to read on the books, and they have remained favorite annual re-reads. As it turned out, I had no choice but to see it, through my work, and I was amazingly and pleasantly surprised.So I decided to see Prince Caspian too. Again I was surprised, but this time I was surprised by my disappointment. Did not follow the storyline at all. A lot of noise and violence, that was my main impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie for Older kids","review":"This is a great story about the classic battle of good versus evil. Well written, beautiful views and adventure to keep kids interested. My kids also like the talking Narnian animals. If you like the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, you will like this also. The next one is the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, another well loved \\"Chronicle'' in the series:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Repeating the formula of the moderately-better \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"I love CS Lewis and the Narnia series. This movie was better than the first, I downgraded it one star because they deviated from the books, I understand why they did it, but it will make it harer in future movies to stay true to the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the first movie","review":"I had never read the books, but I really enjoyed the first 'Narnia' movie. Seemed like a pleasant mix of child literature and fantasy writing, and that movie was a pleasant surprise (part 'Harry Potter', part 'Lord of the Rings'). This new one isn't nearly as good though; the acting seems more stilted, the story isn't as interesting, and the religious overtones are much more prevalent. I was looking forward to this, but can't recommend it others"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince Caspian","review":"With More Action and Violence in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian I would say this is one of the best Narnia Movies I have seen. I do wish it had more of adventure like the first movie.About 85% of the movie was one big battle. It doesn't beat The \\"Lord of The Rings\\" Trilogy in action, but it does have more creatures. As a movie critic for Prince Caspian, I give this 4 out of a possible 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"The disc was a region 1 and i cudnt watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If that is another cute fantasy film with Disney-esque animals and wise-cracking, snogging, contemporary teenagers (\\"Sorted!\\"), plus some soft-cheesy music at the end, then this is your movie. If you want something that Lewis might have regarded without horror and despair, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"This movie is absaloutley awful, the acting was so bad, it made me cringe in my seat. This is one example where they should have completely recasted. It was also upsetting when it decided that it wanted to be \\"Lord of the Rings\\" with all the screenshots and battles. I love the books, the Chronicles of Narnia are one of my favorite series, and the previous adaptation of \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" I loved, but this strayed much too far from the book. The reason the four children slipped by with no acting ability in the first one was because their roles were not so serious. I mean, here they are killing other human beings without even flinching! Susan just whips out her bow and shoots trained soldiers off their horses with the nonchalance of getting out of bed! I tend to be very hard on movies. If you can sit through terrible unconvincing acting that makes Vin Diesels \\"Fast and the Furious\\" look like \\"There Will be Blood\\", than it's a mildly enjoyable time at the cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie","review":"My son and my neice and nephew fell in love wiht this movie.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that supposed to be irony?","review":"Not only was this a poor followup to an initial success in the first of the Narnia films, but it would be a dreadfully poor stand-alone film. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, and while the original cast did well, the additions just left no memorable trace. The story, itself, felt like it wasn't well fleshed out, or the editing wasn't properly done resulting in a plot that felt forced and an audience that didn't care. The film was beautiful to watch. Its landscapes and CGI were stunning, on par with the first film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service","review":"Classic 3-disk Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian:I can only comment that the disk came 2-3 days after my order, so it was really delivered fast.Due to the combination of many situations over the past month we have been unable to watch the film, outtakes, etc. I'm sure the quality will be excellent, and I look forward to a breathing spell to watch it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used DVD","review":"I have always been afraid to purchase used products online in fear of the condition I would receive them.

This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages.

I still remember when my aunty first bought me the Chronicles of Narnia book collection. Once I started reading the first book, I couldn't stop and read the entire series in about a day and a half. Now that Prince Caspian is out, there are only five more to go. The next one is called Voyage of the Dawn Treader which will be just as good if not better than its predecessors. The only junk thing is waiting for it to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Movies","review":"First of all, is this movie for kids? Maybe. Most scenes are. However it would be good if parents would see this movie beforehand, because some of the action scenes are intense.I loved this movie from start to end. I'm 23 years old, and I have read the Narnia books, and I thought this adaptation blew the book out of the water! EXCELLENT! The director really knew what he was doing on this movie. I loved the first movie, but this one is much much better.There is a lot of action scenes that are done very well, and are very breath taking whenever you see the different creatures in Narnia in battle.There is plenty of comedy, action, adventure, and also a love story. It has a little bit of everything. I don't think they are going to beat this movie with the other ones however. I think this is Narnia at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Sells out","review":"Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two \\"bland\\" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.I thought it was about time someone mentions these points."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Disney's Best","review":"Movies don't get much better than this! Excellent casting, plot, special effects, you name it. And all this with one of the least popular books in the Narnia series. My family, for one, is very disappointed that Disney has dropped the funding for the third movie in this series, \\"Voyage of the Dawntreader\\". I guess Disney's original vision for good family entertainment has taken a back seat to profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"This sequel is greatly inferior to the first movie. Where the first one had an interesting story, nice atmospheric environment with the ice world, and a sense of awe, this sequel is almost nothing but fights and chases. Very dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better action than the first","review":"On the whole, the film is quite good. It features excellent action, well choreographed battle sequences, and solid CGI work. The storyline is believable for the most part. The only major complaint from my sister is the \\"octopus\\" kiss at the end. I agree that it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the film. Other than that, I encourage you to see Prince Caspian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Narnia movie in fact I own it. Prince Caspian was nothing short of boring to me & my husband. It was far removed from the book, just a glimpse of Aslan & numerous senseless battle scenes.

The choice of actors is excellent and the CGI mixed with the live action is completely cool. This is one of the few fantasy movies that makes for beleivable looking characters out of the non-human races. The first movie was great and followed the orignal story so well, and the follow-up did not fail in its mission either. The children have grown as have their characters and it is wonderful. The story from begining to end is intrigueing and again, follows C.S.Lewis' story so well, that I would defintly tell anyone to get this for their collection. A wonderful movie for anyone of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, I respectfully disagree with some of the other commentators. I don't think this movie was particularly good. It was considerably violent -- Despite the caution taken to not show much blood, innumerable people/creatures are killed, even by our heroes. But the non-stop battles don't serve to advance the plot much, and there is poor, if any, real character development. While I loved the books and enjoyed the first movie, sadly, I could hardly wait until this second installment was over. Hopefully they'll do better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince Caspain!!!!!","review":"I didn't like this movie, I LOVED it! I thought it was just as good as the first one and I am really loking forward to the other 5 in the series.

The focus should be on Lucy following Aslan, yet this is a very good sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disapointed","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book, but found almost no similarities between it and this movie. The plot was completely wrong. Prince Caspian is described as a child in the book. His uncle speaks to him as though he were a small child, certainly not a young man. Aslan is very minor in the movie, which takes all the power right out of it. All the battle scenes are ridiculous. They changed almost everything important. The only thing they were on target with is they capture the essence of reepacheep perfectly, but other than that this movie is a huge waste of time, if you love c.s. lewis. Maybe you would like it if you never read the book. But honestly the book is much more interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment and where is the book?","review":"I thought \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was brilliant. I could not wait for this movie to be released in theatres. I waited two and a half years for this film and I was disappointed. I thought that there was hardly anything from the book at all. There was way too many things added in this film like the battle at Miraz's Castle, Susan and Caspian being in love, and the White Witch almost coming back to life. None of those things happened in the book. In the last movie at least they tried hard to stick to the book, but in this film it seemed like there was no effort for that at all. I also did not like the addition of certain creatures like the giant walking trees. If you have not read any of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, then maybe you will like this movie, but if you love the books you may not like this film at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and wanted it for my iPad to see over and over again.

I'm big into movies and always buy blu-ray, especially when it comes to animated stuff. Younger kids might like it just as much, but I didn't at all. I was kind of lost in the beginning trying to remember where the last one left off, so it would be a wise decision to watch the first one right before watching the second one. Wish they would have made it more exciting and better overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord, what rubbish","review":"I realise this is a childrens film... but it's dire. Like scream out loud dire. And long enough to make you wonder 'why did I just waste a significant part of my life to this?' The first half is pretty decent but then come the battle scenes. Moronic tosh. Oh so many pregnant pauses - mid battle - while people stop and gaze in to the distance... so many blatant copies of Lord Of The Rings scenes but without the style or competence... so many opportunities to kill the bad guy which are not taken... I walked away from the TV multiple times because it was, well, so crap. Frustrating crap at that. Avoid at all costs and watch LOTR instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - stick with the 1st movie","review":"I purchased this for my 11 year old son for Christmas.

However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel","review":"This 2nd installment in the Narnia movie franchise picks up one year after the end of the first movie; in England time. When our four heroes return to Narnia, it is actually a millenium later. But the ensuing movie is just as exciting as the first one, with even some romance thrown in at the end. Like any good fantasy movies, Prince Caspian has several grand battle scenes, creatures of various species interacting with each other in English, great swordfighting, and some double-crossing, both by good guys and by the bad guys. All in all, a great 2+ hours of movie-watching experience. Some of the movie does take part in the night, so turn of the lights while watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well done sequel!","review":"We bought this DVD[ASIN:B00005JPH2 The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian] right before the holidays. So far, my family has watched at least half a dozen times. On one of our 7 hours drive to a ski resort, my kids (13 and 12 yrs old) watched both of the Narnia DVD (White Witch and Prince Caspian) back to back. They really liked both DVDs, though my daughter think that the first DVD (White witch) has a prettier Narnia (snow, everything).The Prince Caspian DVD add a bit Shakespear drama to the story. The actors are very good, especially the one playing Miraz.Highly recommend this to any Narnia fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"This is a great and fun family movies.

Action, drama, suspence and even an unexpected romance. But the thing that really blew me away was the originality.It wasn't The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe all over again as most sequels are. It is so much more intense and in-depth than the first one. The feeling, aroma andpresence is a whole new concept. Even the majority of the charaters we've never seen before (with the exception of the Pevensie children, Aslan, Hunger, Thirst,and yes, the White Witch). Now I know the producers didn't write the original story, but isn't that the delimna of all modern age movies? C.S. Lewis deserves much ofcredit for this masterful production as he was the one who started the legendary chronicle. Prince Caspian was definatly the best movie of it's time and I give itfive stars as it deserves. After all isn't Narnia supposed to be magical?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narnian History Rewritten by Hollywood","review":"I gave this installment of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" two stars only because of the special effects. The story really departed from the book and could have been much better had it followed the book more closely. In the book, Prince Caspian was a young boy, NOT an adult. The Disney folks only made him an adult so they could work in a love interest with Queen Susan. I don't object to a love interest in a movie if it belongs. In this case, it was totally uncalled for. Finally, too many scenes were taken out that were in the book. For example, Aslan's romp with Bacchus and the Mynaids. Other scenes were substituted that were not in the book at all, such as the over-long battle scene in King Miraz's castle. In this installment of the Narnian Chronicles, Disney has rewritten history. For shame, Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"C.S. Lewis has to be rolling over in his grave, as this pathetic adaptation abandons his story early on and turns into a smarmy, boring CGI exercise. Pointless battles, pointless special effects, flat characters, ridiculous dialog and no sense of wonder at all. The film invents half baked soap opera subplots that go nowhere. I can't imagine a worse film adaptation. Prince Caspian is the weakest of the Narnia books, but it is a jewel compared to this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis or Andrew Adamson?","review":"Apparently Andrew Adamson thinks he can tell a better story than C.S. Lewis. Saying this movie is \\"based\\" on the book by the same title would be using the word \\"based\\" very loosely. While there are some commonalities between the two, probably 80 to 90% of the movie is comprised of material not in the book. If you are watching the movie without having ever read the books then it could be called a decent story. However, if you are expecting it to re-tell the story of Prince Caspian, then you will be greatly disappointed.Once again, Hollywood thought they could improve a story by re-making it, and once again they failed. A prime example . . . the added \\"romance\\" between two of the main characters. This was the worst addition of all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caspian falls short","review":"It is unfortunate that there was not a \\"C.S. Lewis\\" fan club to keep an eye on these movie makers like the Lord of the Rings fans did. There are many beauties and strengths of the Narnia series so far, but in Caspian, the departure from the novel changes the story in an extremely unfortunate way. There is no real justification for the filmmakers' changing the story, it is change for the sake of change. They could have adhered more closely to the book without losing anything. Caspian was my favorite book of the series, and the movie is terribly disappointing. Peter and Caspian were allies, not antagonists. For the sake of \\"high concept,\\" the filmmakers have pretty much gutted the story. Good luck with all that. We are stuck with this version now, in the sequence. The actors continue to be good, but the story has been altered for no apparent reason. Sorry, I wish I could have liked this more. There was a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I waited anxiously and patiently for the video release of Prince Caspian. As someone who has read the whole Narnia series, I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Yeah the special affects were cool, and most kids will probably like the movie.

Lewis' high creativity fell short.This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.Fun times.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie for everyone","review":"I love the second it was great and a good movie for the children to set and watch.

There were a few bothering scenes as when Caspian and Peter would fight, but Susan's character was great. At one point it reminded me of Legolas fighting and Lucy looks so grown up and her character's growth from the first film is very nicely done.

As I read it I felt like Toad was a \`Prodigal Son', who came back only far enough to receive acceptance, then returned to his bad habits till he was in trouble again.It reminded me much of myself, playing at being Christian before really giving Christ all areas of my life. Like Toad I would repent, but then not really change.Rat was wise and resourceful, Mole was tender and caring and awe-full like a child yet also very wise. Badger is like a wise mature old mentor or guide, sent to give direction, and lead one to find one's own purpose in life.Yet the mix of Animal and Human society just did not make sense to me. It felt like a badly planned Narnia novel. It did not explain how the animal and human worlds came to interact and share a language or culture.But over all it was a fun read even if dry in some spots.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Abridged","review":"I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely.

A totally beautifully illustrated rendition it is (though it really is hard in my mind to beat Ernest H. Shepard's wonderful Rat, Badger, Toad and all!). The reason for the 1 star is two fold. One, it's an abridged version. Yes, I know it's for consumption by younger folk. I was, however, maybe 4 or 5 when it was first read to me. Why do we continue to sell our children short? The biggest reason though for the poor rating is that several chapters have been left out.

Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters.

I thought his views and ideas for education being both theoretical and practical for black america and the Islands were revolutionary, and if they had been implemented throughout the South one can only think America would be a much better place as the Booker type institutions may well have gone some way to eliminating on mass, much of the black poverty associated with the southern states.

So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting?

Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him.

As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"New title for the book: Boredom on Denali","review":"I found the author to be overly dramatic and dreadfully overused tired cliches and crude, offensive language. She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krakauer Lite","review":"I have to agree with others reviewers that Kocuour's ego is a huge obstacle in reading this book. I'm reminded of people who in conversation do nothing but bad-mouth others to compensate for their lack of confidence. Everyone else is weak, unrefined, stupid, or otherwise worth mocking. I'm stuck with the passage where she gets mocks a fellow climber who has brought a book to read about jet airplanes. That's the depth she goes to in her pettiness.The story itself is interesting and should be compelling, but getting past the author's tone soured the reading experience for me.I have many mountaineering books. Ones I'd heartily recommend are Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman's \\"The Boardman Tasker Omnibus\\", Jim Whittaker's \\"A Life on the Edge\\" and Peter Potterfield's \\"In the Zone\\". These authors not only write well, but can convey the challenges and trials of mountaineering without narcissism. These books all sit proudly in my bookcase. Kocuour's book is in a cardboard box in my basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Try This at Home, Kids...","review":"This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact, it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts, Jon Krakauer, and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it \\"the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest\\" shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up, enjoy it, and do something really stupid.Hint: If you liked this book...if you really found it exciting...stay home!(1 star, in honor of the book's value as kindling, and because there is no lower rating.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best lesson learned","review":"Scrolling through the reviews of Facing The Extreme, it is easy to pick out, from their words, the type of climber I would choose to climb with and those I would not. Kocour's mean-spirited book clearly gives climbers and women a bad name In fact, the best lesson to be gleaned from the chronicle of this arrogant and self-serving woman is: choose your team members as carefully as possible whenever possible. The most insightful comment made by any of the reviewers was the one who said he would not want to be roped up to Ruth Anne Kocour. Who would?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing arrogance","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers' criticisms of Kocour's writing style and her contemptuous attitude toward other climbers. I would add that for her to refer to her experience as \\"extreme\\" shows her complete lack of credibility as a climber. Ms. Kocour was bored, cold and scared, and her feet got cold -- that's all. Meanwhile, others died in the same storm. If you want to read about an \\"extreme\\" experience on Denali, try Davidson's Minus 148 or Waterman's In the Shadow of Denali. I also second those who recommended the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm left feeling sour...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Mountain but a flat book","review":"What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to \\"Facing the Extreme\\" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A can't put it down book-- taut, inspiring, frightening","review":"One of the ten best adventure / mountaineering books I have ever read.

Ruth is awesome too. Aside from being in the death zone at 17,200 and thinking that she might walk off the six thousand foot drop while shoveling snow off her tent at the ice shelf at 14,200, my favorite part was when she said that Bradford Washington has the first ascent of Mt. Denali. Thats awesome. To set the facts straight the first ascent was in 1913 by walter harper as a member of the hudson stuck expedition. and bradford WASHBURN has the first ascent of the west buttress in 1951. This is an awesome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenille writing style.","review":"After reading Jon Krakauer's book, I had to have more! Unfortunately, I choose Ruth Ann Kocour's book, which reads like an account of a life-threatening adventure as told by an adolescent.

And while I appreciated some insight into how bodily functions are handled on the mountain, a more mature attitude would have gone a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too fundamentalist, with not enough Sun Tzu","review":"I chose this book out of sheer desperation when I was looking for a good investment book on Holidays.This book is so far slanted toward a fundamentalist approach that I believe the author thinks Graham and Buffett are gods.

Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep.

This rendered the whole table useless.It surprised me how such a defected part could get through the manufacturer's quality control. You don't need any fancy tool to discover it. Looking at it would suffice.Finally I chose to fix it myself. It was not very difficult for me, just taking off the 6 screws that hold the bars, realigning the bars to the correct position, and then put the screws back in again. The extra 20 minutes work was still worth it, comparing to repackaging the whole set, the hassle to ask for a return, plus shopping for another table.The quality of the table (other than the misaligned bars) is OK.

It's a lot easier to understand the complexities after you have a vision of the overall concept inscribed in your brain.I also like the way the author has alternated discussion of the basic facts with discussion of methods and experimental results. It breaks up the monotony of fact after fact. And the exhaustive references appear to be up to date considering the date of publication.My only criticism is that the book deserved better copy editing and/or proofreading.

The original is more in line with Taylor Dayne's \\"I'll Be Your Shelter\\"- which I still feel like Anastacia still sounds like a lot. It is more rock in vibe and that is carried onto the remixes by Jason Nevins. The Mixshow mix(5:35) and Global Radio Edit(4:16) are great but the full length mix is only available here on the US cd single. The house mix keeps the guitars going through the more club friendly beat and that is good .

I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value.

The Atlantic wrote: \\"A pleasantly subversive little book, guaranteed to undermine your faith in the almighty statistic.\\"The fact of the matter is that when proper, statistically sound data gathering and analysis methods are employed, the statistics not only do not lie, but they also reveal the nature and extent of the errors inherent in the results.I know - among other things, I'm a professsional statistician.In fact, it was my profession in statistics that steered me into network analysis, which is a statistician's dream world. Large corporations must figure out where the bottlenecks reside, and how to combat them in the most cost-effective, time-valued, long-term manner.To do this properly, it takes an individual who knows Finance, Statistics, and Networks.Bottom lie: Statistics themselves don't lie.

It was written in 1954 so half of the fun is looking at salaries and other data from that time. Huff points out with goofy pictures but sound logic how you can be hoodwinked by the use and abuse of \\"averages\\" and a number of other ways that statistics are quoted. I use it to make sure that in my work I'm not fooling myself or misinterpreting numbers and charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"improved with age","review":"Who said numbers have to be dull?

Almost every day I see a Gee Whiz graph which makes something look like it's skyrocketing out of control before I check the scale. Then it turns out that a 5% or 10% bump looks like 600% to 1,000%. The trick is to abuse the visual impact of the graph.A company might cut wages 30%, then later increase them 30% and claim that they have restored the cut. Huff explains why this is actually a 9% pay cut! This is one of many weapons in the statisticulator's arsenal.Huff, aided by Geis's amusing and revealing illustrations, teaches us how to defend ourselves from statistical abuse, by showing us how the tricks are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Statisticians don't like this book - what a surprise!","review":"For someone who has not read this book, the disparity in reviews is probably striking. Those literally looking for a statistics course, or especially statisticians, will be disappointed. This book is about understanding and interpreting statistics from a practical standpoint. Ignore the statisticians - they are being sensitive about how their work is abused. Ignore the students looking for a statistics book - that isn't the intent of Huff's work.This is one of my favorite books of all time. It helped me become a much more discerning consumer of news. This book is intended to help you better comprehend stat's that are thrown at you to make a point - which essentially means all stat's. Unfortunately, many times this is done is disingenuous ways, and this book will help you see through such foolishness.In short - buy this little book. It is one of the best book values you will ever find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"It's nice to read a book like this. There is a very light tone through the book. And it's a short book, incidentally. You will finish it in about 2 sessions.I was happy to see that I'm not the only person annoyed at the way graphs are shown, with the bottom cut off to dramatize changes. This is only one example out of several. You woul be able to figure out some of these yourself, but not all of them. One was a bit deep and I had to read it a second time to understand what the falsity was.I recommend this book because it imparts valuable information in a readable fashion. Statistics are everywhere, and you absolutely must know how to separate the chaff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and humerous look at how logic is used illogically.","review":"This book is so good that I've loaned it out to others on three seperate occassions (to students who raved about it)and haven't gotten any of the copies back. I provided copies to my children as they entered middle school so they could gain a clearer picture of what the numbers in the newspaper meant. It's a clear and humerous look at how we, as a society, tend to use logic in the most illogical ways. That \\"numbers never lie\\" is a myth laid to rest. While the examples are old (I did own the original at one point)the concepts they illustrate are still pertinent today.

A great book to have upon the shelf as a ready reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to lie with statistics","review":"I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still True after all these years","review":"I have been buying favorite old classics to refresh my memory. The results have been variable. Parkinson's Law stood out as one that had amazingly held up. Huff comes close. His slim book nicely exposes many of the all too persistent tricks used to misuse data. He provides a good catalog of the obvious, but still employed devices to mislead. In this political season, we can all benefit from recalling these ancient tendencies.

Even if you have done some of these tasks before I think you can adapt the suggestions and learn something new.I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good portrait of people working together","review":"Robert Putnam dissected what might be the fraying of American community in \\"Bowling Alone\\". Here he and co-authors Lewis Feldstein and Don Cohen look at 12 examples of community.It's quite interesting to see how, for example, branch libraries became social hubs in Chicago. The vignette of CraigsList is dated only a few years later and, in any event, it is difficult to accept CraigsList as as true example of community. It may have been in its earliest days, but is certainly not now. The depiction of Portland may be a bit blindsided in that Portland's activists seem to be against anything and everything, more like Babbit's than enablers of any kind.On the whole, though, it's an interesting collection of community endeavors. Not truly a complement to \\"Bowling Alone\\", but rather a standalone effort.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected...","review":"This book was fair...not as good as I expected though. The music was at an intermediate level but the arrangements could have been a lot better than they were. In general, I like the arrangements from Gary Dahl because they sound more musical. I am a professional accordion artist and in order to make these arrangements sound good enough to the point where I would feel comfortable performing them in public, I would basically have to re-arrange them myself...which defeats the purpose of buying a book of pre-arranged accordion songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, upbeat romance","review":"Jack Dakota found out that he has a son from an eight year old liason.

And being as how she knows more about ranching than Jack, he keeps her on to learn ropes.Not too much angst, but an attraction that keeps growing stronger despite the differences that should keep them apart.Hallie teaches Jack about the everyday running of a ranch and how to relate to his son, Ethan. Jack teaches Hallie to loosen up and enjoy some womanly pleasures and how to act in company.And little by little Hallie's brother, Ben changes for the better and slowly a family is melded together through their supportive trials.Definitely recommended - thoroughly enjoyable but ah well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wallet","review":"We were very disappointed in this wallet for the amount of money we paid.

The peg is covered with velvet, so it won't scratch the instrument. The flute does, however, have some wobble as the peg is a bit smaller than the interior of the flute. (If you look at the headjoint, it can move several inches back and forth due to the extra space around the peg.) Although the wobble can be a bit unsettling, I'm still confident in the stand because of the weight/solidity of the base. Would be perfect if the peg were slightly bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not crazy about the appearance of the yellow guard, but works well.","review":"Very sturdy and does a good job of holding my flute like it's supposed to.

I own the show and am familiar with the music, but decided to buy the third one first to get past some of the more listened-to background music.

This is a sound track for any real anime/Kanno fan out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanno, amazing as always","review":"In my opinion, Escaflowne has the best soundtrack set of any animated series; all of the Escaflowne soundtracks are amazing and you wouldn't be disappointed if you had only one to choose from. That being said, this one is my personal favorite as it contains what I consider two of the most beautiful songs in the entire series (\\"Farewell\\" and \\"Arcadia\\") plus a couple of performances from Maaya Sakamoto (whose voice is also divine). If you can get your hands on a copy, I strongly suggest getting this one. And while you're at it, check out other works composed by Yoko Kanno - she's simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information","review":"Firstly, Escaflowne is a great classic anime, and one of my personal favorites. The visuals are a bit dated (1995), but what made the show was the plot, the world, and the audio!2nd, All of the Escaflowne CDs are incredible. Especially lovers only (a 'best of' for the series), and the movie soundtrack. This is all due to the work of Yoko Kanno (Cowboy bebop, darker than black, Macross, RahXephon, among other greats). Escaflowne may be my favorite of all her work, but everything she touches turns to gold.Lastly, the CD Info, because it is often hard to find the correct information:The Vision of Escaflowne OST 3Yoko Kanno19961 Short Notice2 Arcadia3 Epistle4 Farewell5 Aoi Hitomi6 Perfect World7 I Recomment Instincts8 Scrappy9 Shrilly10 Revenge11 Illusion12 Blaze13 Fatal14 Hikari No Naka E15 Again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book....lots of local information","review":"A great read for any Minnesota sports fan.

It is however good at misleading the 3 Stooges fan into thinking that he or she has found a gold mine of 3 Stooges material at a great price.

Specifically, the documentary was sort of interesting for tidbits of information I wasn't aware of but was produced horribly. The mic on the narrator was pushed right up to his mouth causing too much proximity effect and you can hear the plosives clipping on the VO track. I'm in audio and this is basic, audio recording 101 stuff, folks. Even the stuff I thought was mildly fun was not worth putting up with the hours of utter dreck to experience.

I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time.

If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand, then I would suggest the Boston Recepter. Both are available through Amazon.comI don't work for any of these companies, but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio, I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one.

At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much. Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too. When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on, it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot. If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that isn't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep. It's a little pricy for what it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful jazz","review":"One of the most wonderful jazz CD's I've purchased in the last few years. Ms. McRae takes the genius of Monk, removes the edginess without detracting from the spirit of the music, and rolls out knock-out after knock-out. I wouldn't have thought it possible, frankly. The supporting quartet is terrific. I can't imagine any true jazz lover being disappointed in this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen captures Monk","review":"We know the feel of Monk. When we walk down a rainy 1 am night, scatting Monk standards, we know the feel of Monk. Mcrae makes those doos and das into lyrics without changing the sentiment we had all along. And with ole' George on bass, bringing up the bottom along with Mcrae, well, two stars just for the names. Great songs, great interpretation, great album- -NV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"Noone delivered a lyric better than Carmen and no singer understood Monk as well.

While this would be nice, unfortunatly that is just not the case. Scientists can take a drop of blood and determine if its owner is Asian, African-American, European, Jewish, etc. If there is no such thing as race, then how is this possible?This book was used in a biased anthropology class that I took for my BA. I only bought it because I was forced to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biology As Ideology : The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This book will cause you to think in new ways, even if you don't agree with the author. Lewontin's main point is that despite the fact we think science is an objective discipline, its questions topics considered worth researching are in fact biased by the culture in which we live. It's an interesting concept to ponder for those interested in philosophy, science, or the philosophy of science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty morning crunch.","review":"I am partial to the Familia Swiss brand for my museli, but this is my favorite crunchy style.

The downside is that it is very loud, looks like a child's toy, and it is a lint/hair magnet. However I would still recommend this product. It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe isn't gonna realize what it is unless you tell them. Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for sore muscles!","review":"This product is good to your muscles after a long hard day.

It has all the digital effects you need in a cam corder with the ability to take still shots at a touch of the button. The dv tape is small and easy to carry around. It holds both the digital pictures and the video on the same film. This makes it easy to record in both modes when at an affair. The result is a video record with 5 second sound bites when still shots are used. Comes with a good grouping of transfer methods from firewire to svideo to infra red. Movies can be quickly loaded onto computer and easy to edit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great picture quality and compact","review":"I bought this for distributing family videos.

An interesting triangle between Emily, Lee and the ghost. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so, so....","review":"Just didn't care for this story.

Keith Tenniswood of Two Lone Swordsmen fame demonstrates his solo credibility here with his superb debut album.Combining breaks and beats with smooth, simple melodies, Tenniswood brings all that is good about electro music together.What made the songs on here even better are the beautiful electronic, ambient, pulsating and shimmering walls of sound Tenniswood creates behind his songs. Fans of Two Lone Swordsmen will know what I'm talking about, and Tenniswood uses this skill to great effect on this album.An excellent, consistent electro, breakbeat album, with strong hints of electronica and IDM.

Why? because my teacher Dr.Mines (Jeanette Mines) wrote it. Before I read it I figured it would be bad if she is making us read it, but once I started I had to finish it, I couldnt put it down. 14 year old Jeannie falls in love with 16 year old misunderstood bad boy Sam. Despite all the warnings she dates him. It seems from the moment she met him her life has changed and together they are spinning out of control. Will he take her down with him or can she save him from himself? I dont want to ruin the end so Ill stop here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confrontational in a good way","review":"This is a great little book on purity. I read it in an hour and couldn't put it down. \\"The Purity Principle\\" gets \\"in your face\\" on the issue of sexual purity, speaking directly, but not inappropriately about the slippery slope that is sexual sin and practical ways to combat it. The engaging message was so vivid and powerful that I immediately ordered two additional copies so that each of my sons could have their own.My one reservation about this book is that it does not give enough help and hope to the person who has already seriously fallen and needs help getting on the right track. I am concerned that such a person, rather than seeing the power of a gracious God to restore them, might feel that they are too far gone for a meaningful recovery after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for these legendary indie-rockers!","review":"Once again, Versus is able to capture the very essence of what indie-music is about. In the \\"Afterglow\\" ep, the band proves their competency in their ability to write unforgettable songs.

Versus proves that they are real muscians."},{"rating":"2","title":"as always VERSUS continues to shine","review":"\\"afterglow\\" is just another example of fine craftsmanship and pure pop hook laden melodies.i personally find versus one of the most inspiring bands i've ever heard. go see them live, you won't be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This account of Edison Marshall's own hunting experiences willmake you feel out of place in today's world.

Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE False advertisement","review":"This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it.

But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters.

I have lost 38 lbs in 8 weeks using this wonderful cookbook (OK so the first 12 lbs were water and yes I have been exercising). The receipes are tasty and that makes a big difference. You learn a new way to cook without using butters, oils, high fat and high colesterol ingredients. Many items are complete meals without needing side dishes. I particularly like the baked french bread, stuffed peppers, baked fish, and Southwestern stuffed squash. Dieting is not my favorite activity. Food is good. My doctor's advice was to loose weight.

I was not disappointed, Robert C. Ruark is a Masterful Wordsmith. I savored each word as a \\"Right before You Go to Sleep\\" read, the book was the High Point of the Day on a number of days, it always provided an exit into sleep after what lately have become stressful days. This should be required reading for anyone who hunts, it provides a distinct familiarity for anyone who has hunted. I felt that, I know that, I was Touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safari Memoir","review":"I enjoyed this book. Ruark honestly describes his fear as he faces the dangerous game animals of 1950s east Africa. If you are a hunter you will appreciate this book.

This is one of the better ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film but track down the (easy to find) uncut version!","review":"Many Takeshi Kitano fans hate this film but I actually find it to be his most enjoyable. If you liked Sonatine, then you will like this. However this is the American version of the film and it is HEAVILY CUT AND EDITED! Poorly cut and edited too may I also point out.

I saw a different Takeshi Kitano movie a few years back which was much more stylistically interesting (can't remember the name, but it was a Japanese film), so I know he's capable of making an interesting film. This isn't it. This film is a terrible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL RIP OFF!!!","review":"After purchasing this item and getting charged about $40 AUS postage the DVD was not compatible with Australian DVD players.

You are better off taking your chances with Ebay!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind numbing violence","review":"This movie is about a Japanese gangster exiled from his homeland and forced to flee to America. From the moment he sets foot on foreign soil, his orgy of violence and destruction begins. If you're a fan of action and violence, this movie has plenty of both. The film portrays the extremely violent lifestyle of Japanese gangsters. Unfortunately that's about all it has going for it.Much of the time the plot seems disjoint and unconnected. Music is lacking. A lot of the time it was difficult to understand what was going on. I can only recommend this to gangster movie aficionados."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moment of Zen","review":"This is supposed to be an artsy movie about the yakuzas and their activities in America. However, it\`s not more than an average, empty thriller that\`s neither exciting nor funny, let alone creative or original. Takeshi Kitano, who both directs the picture and plays its asian main character, is devoid of charisma while he acts, using the same facial expression the whole time. There are lots of useless moments of pointless violence here, which try to have style and edgyness but fail miserably (Tarantino does it much better). \\"Brother\\" is a tedious, unengaging waste of time and is quickly forgotten. Meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series.

How high should they be and why?)- No information on how to create Mel's mix (I'm not sure what she used for her soil, she never said)- No information on where to put the raised beds in your yard (Should you look for a shaded area? Lots of sun? Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel."},{"rating":"1","title":"even the stray cat outside wasn't interested!","review":"Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats.

When you hear the words, \\"Would you like to know more?\\" just say \\"No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, \\"I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!\\" I replied, \\"Probably better.\\" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs.

There is nothing in Mormonism that is \\"covered up\\" - everyone is free, and encouraged, to learn as much as they possibly can! What the missionaries teach is the truth - the basic beliefs of the church. If you study them, the other controversial topics that come up have little relevancy to what we actually believe and what we practice. I have studied many religions and I've found that even among \\"mainstream\\" Christians there is a wide range of beliefs.

Each song has its special thing and the duets harmonize in every way. The origin is no doubt the Spanish linguistic zone, but at no time there is too much of Spanish guitars or any other cliché. Short, this is an intelligent mixture.Towards the end there is a fantastic increase which I had not expected. The sound is harder, guitars are more dominant. There are two additional tracks, which are worth buying the full album.Ultimately the collaboration with Francesco Sondelli is something special, what means that Shery is able to convince in Italian language, even if only for one song.Hopefully we hear more of this special Guatemalan singer.

We love reading but give us a break. Lord of the flies must have been written by another author. We do not recommend this book unless you need help falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"This student failed to enjoy it","review":"A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever you do, don't buy this book","review":"Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like confusion....","review":"This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped!","review":"I don't think Golding quite got the hang of the early humans he was using as his subjects! There is far more to them and far more interesting and exciting things about them that simply were missing in his story. Not a bad read, but did not come up to my expectations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Opportunity Missed","review":"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Plot.....","review":"But at some points there is just way to much to take in. Although the plot is very interesting and the characters and scene are well developed, you have to be very dedicated to reading this novel. In some sections it can be very difficult to understand what is going on at all. Unless you are prepared to read pages over and over again, you may want to try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Should've Known Better\\" makes the CD","review":"I spent literally years tracking down \\"I Should've Known Better,\\" the mid-80s Euro-hit, because I had never learned the singer's name.

The rest of the album is good, but I Should've Known Better is one of the best pop songs ever recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going on Here?","review":"This is the kind of record that gives jazz a bad name. Russell Gunn, a young trumpeter of note, here offers a set of mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given a fresh reading. Instead, what we get is esoteric, virtuoso, insider treatments. Yes, there are some stunning moments, yes, the fine assemblage of 20- and 30-something jazzers play their butts off, but it generally comes across as cold and academic: ideosyncratic, listener-unfriendly set-pieces. Where's the warmth, the vitality, the craziness that make jazz such a surprizing and engaging music? Not here on this disc, I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatchaman is G-Force and beyond!","review":"Gatchaman is the latest incarnation of what most people knew as G-Force. The characters are nearly identical to their 70's G-Force counterparts with a 90's look. The macha designs are excellent, the action is fast paced. The only problem is that the American voice actors didn't do justice to what was happening on the screen. I've only viewed volume 1, but so far it looks to be a great trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Condor Joe Rules!","review":"Condor Joe is the most human and endearing character of the show.

I fell in love with this book after the first page. I was amazed with Wagner's writing style. His poetic descriptions make the characters and the world he writes them into come alive.

But they talk to Grandpa on the phone and find out that he'll still be around on holidays, they'll visit him in his new apartment, and he's getting a pet.

This got my attention since i did not play it that much when i first got it. The fact that this has Nguyen Le on guitar sort of sends this to dynamic, electrified and 'swing & be bop'' influenced territory. I know some of Fresu's work tends to be a bit calm. And although there are contemplative pieces here the 'fast' ones are the ones that really catch your attention as they are played SO well. Kept my attention all the way through. Eclectic, European 'Ecm - tinged' and very slight fusion tracings makes for a very interesting and joyful listening experience. Excellent sound too!

Bart sez: Ay Carumba - Get it man or eat my shorts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near Simpsons highlights","review":"Unfortunately these episodes date from the first 2 series, which were nowhere near as clever, inventive, subtle and hysterical as the later episodes. I really wouldn't bracket any of these as SImpsons classics, having seen maybe 200 episodes. 2 Cars In Every Garage is probably the best, marking the first appearance of a 3-eyed fish (a great insight into the surreal humour of the show's authors). Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes. I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contact from another world.","review":"I believe this book is true but it did not all happen as Aura wanted.

Before buying this product, I went online and read several posts that said that they had issues with the product being too tight. Surprisingly, I find this product slightly big, even though I bought the right size. This might be related to the garment not feeling tight enough, but I also measured myself before and after I put in the garment and found that I did NOT lose inches. As a matter of fact, I was the same even after I hooked myself up on the smallest setting. But maybe that's because the material of this garment is a bit on the thick side? Not sure.

I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight. However, the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs, they hung loosely.

Wore it under a saronge and too tight shirt to a wedding last night - felt like a Barbie doll. Gotta love a product that allows one to not only fit into, but unabashedly wear all of the tight clothes in one's closet while making the bulges disappear, but also corrects one's posture. Of course you know, standing up straight and tall makes the boobies stick out further too, hence, the Barbie doll look.

My son tried to open it, but struggled mightily with the packaging. After a few frustrating minutes, I took it away from him and tried to open it myself. It was amazingly difficult, espcially considering the age group that this product is intended for. What was even more disturbing was that in my own frustration to open the box, I cut my finger open on the plastic! Thank goodness it wasn't my son's finger! If it wasn't so disturbing I would have laughed at the irony that I was injured by a toy supposedly promoting safety.All of this preceded our discovery that the product as a whole is quite poorly made (the outfit is already falling apart).

Children's books should not seem as if they were written BY children."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview","review":"\\"The Mission\\" provides an excellent high-level overview of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The book is about a girl named Patty that tries to save a German Soldier. One day her dad finds out there is a German named Anton in his house and forces him to leave. But then, something bad happens to Anton. The sheriff questions Patty and she finds out what happened to Anton.At first it was a boring, but now that I&#65533;ve read it I like it. My favorite character is Patty because she could relate to me a little because when Anton died she cried and when my great grandma died I cried. I gave this book four star because it is filled with happiness like when Patty found Anton again and sadness like when Ruth had to leave and it is a very good book. You should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a very real and powerful novel.","review":"This book was excellent. The charecters are very real. This book focuses on love and hate becuase Patty does something so incredible. She does something that will forever change her life. I would tell you but then I'd ruin the book. Ruth is also a great charecter becuase she really adds to the whole novel. This novel was sad yet I want to read it again and again. Patty (to me) is a true hero and at the end of the book I though to my self.....\\"you go girl.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"this book was amazing and truly touching .

Its about this girl named Patty Bergen who lives in Jenkensville, Arkansas. Okay, now these WWII Nazi prisoners come to stay at a pison thing nearby, and one of them, Anton Reiker escapes. Now Patty fell in love with Anton, and supposedly, he loved her too. But then, he ran away from her house(not willingly!), and Patty accidently admitted to sheltering and hiding him. I must admit that the ending was a bit disapointing, but then, it leaves the way for the sequel, which I want to read. I reccomend this book to people over the age of 14(don't ask me y). Overall, as I said before, its pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer of my German Soldier","review":"Summer of my German soldier, by Bette Greene, is a very well written book! It is about a girl named Patty who is very depressed because she feels the only person that truly cares for her is the housekeeper, Ruth. Her father tells her that she's not important at all and life would be a lot better without her, and her mother only nags her consantly about her looks. This is during WWII and there have just been German prisoners taken to her hometown. She meets one of them, Anton, and has fallen in love with him. I can't tell you anymore, or I will have given too much away! I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a mix of romance and suspense. I hope you enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read For Spainish","review":"Would it ever be excepted during World War II for a Jewish girl to befriend a Germain? How about a Nazi? This book is all about breaking the rules and following your heart. Patty comes from a family where the only person who loves her is their maid Ruth. But, that all changes on day when she is working in her father's shop and some of the POW soilders come in and she meets on who is not like the rest. He is handsome, smart, and extremely liturate. After that one time meeting all she can think about is him. One night she sees' him going and trying to hope a train and see calls to him and he comes to see her. She then hides him in her garage.

Or will she save her Germain soidier?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of all Time...","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 (I am 19 now) and I read this book every summer. It is one of my all-time favorites! This book is the story of Patty Bergen who lives in Arkansas during WW2. Her parents are mean and cruel to her and the only person she can find acceptance in is her housekeeper, Ruth. That is, until Patty meets a German soldier hiding from the authorities in her small town. His name is Anton Reiker and he is not a Nazi. Patty hides him above the garage. Their relationship is brought about by Patty's feelings of rejection by her parents and Anton is looking for someone to love. I do wish at the end, though, that Anton had hit Patty's father! This book will bring tears to your eyes as you read the story of Patty and Anton friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Book","review":"I read this book for a class. I thought it was very good in most ways. I thought it could have ended better, like she got out of that boring school. But overall it was good. You should really try it. It discusses a lot of important issues. I recommend it, but it's not really for some people. There's not much action except for a few beatings. And there's a bit of romance. If you think it sounds like your kind of book, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Novel!","review":"This Novel, Summer of My German Soldier, is an interesting book. It is about a girl named Patty Bergen, her small home in Arkansas becomes a site of a camp keeping German prisoners during World War II , even though she is Jewish she begins to vision, a nazi, Anton not as a Nazi but as a true friend. Anton escapes from the camp site and Patty takes responsibility for him, feeding him, clothing him, and even sheltering him. Only one person knows this so far and that person is the house keeper, Ruth. She keeps him in a shelter on top of the garage, one time even Anton once risks his life to save Patty from her father. This book is a treasure to keep and once you start reading it you will not put it down. I also encourage you to buy this book, and also I'm looking for the sequel to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject Poorly Developed","review":"Reading the back cover, I had high hopes of this novel. However, what could have been a thoughtful, ironic, heartwarming story quickly became plotless and one-dimensional. Do Patty's parents really possess no good qualities whatsoever? Is Anton really the saint he seems? This novel makes no attempt to answer any of these questions, and that's what makes it so painful to read. Patty, who is clearly intended to be the endearing heroine, comes off as a know-it-all with a total disregard for rules and boundaries. Also, doesn't a seemingly romantic relationship between a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old feel questionable at the very least? Add this to the fact that there is absolutely no conclusion, and we have a recipe for one terrible novel. I could go on for ages, but here's the bottom line: do not waste your time with Summer of My German Soldier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I detested this book. I felt the actual story never quite matched up with its admittedly interesting premise. The character of Patty Bergen seemed feeble and weakly developed, and I never understood the inexplicable hatred the entire world, excluding Anton and Ruth, seemed to have for this girl.The whole \\"love story\\" plot was laughably unrealistic, due mainly to the age difference. The most frustrating thing about this book is that it could have been so much better. The whole irony of a Nazi and a Jew falling in love during World War II has so many options for a good plotline, but instead the story seemed to spend a good majority of the book wallowing in self-pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story with a Tooth-and-Nail Heart","review":"This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad book.","review":"Not only was this book poorly written and boring, it teaches children bad moral values. It sympathizes with traitors and liars, and is highly unrealistic. I don't reccomend this book to anyone. This book was not sad or upsetting.

This book is pointless and boring. undefined characters, pointless details, FICTIONAL information on WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"Summer of my German Soldier is one of my favorite books, and I've read a lot. It's the story of Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl living in Arkansas who protects an escaped POW Nazi. It may sound a little unrealistic, but the characters and emotions in this story were so real.

Any one who fought with the german army were nazis. and thats all. six million jews died because of people like anton reiker. anton may not have been evil but he fought along with nazis. and its alot like hanging with the wrong crowd. if u hang with drug dealing gang members u gotta pay also. for all of you people who think this book is a classic, maybe u should go see saving private ryan or schindlers list. maybe that will change your mind about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too sappy!","review":"this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful novel for everyone of all ages!","review":"After reading SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, I would definetely recommend it to young adults and adults alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor resolution","review":"As the book progresses, the storyline builds until, at the end, it goes straight down.

Characters are only developed in terms of their reactions to each other.

The climax was not all that exciting for me, especially since my brother and sister have talked about it and read it. The descriptions of characters were little, partly because of the book's first person narroration.

I'd just gotten braces, so having a great new book to read was a small comfort. The story is about a misfit named Patty.

Although she's Jewish, Patty loves Anton dearly and hides him in her hangout over the garage. Against her will, she must let him go. The ending was a cliffhanger and paves the way for a great sequel(check out the reviews to see if Mrs. Greene delivered). I identified with Patty because I'm an outcast too.

However, after reading through some online Infiniti forums I decided to give it a try.The rack was simple to assemble and mount, looks great, and holds our two Cannondale Quick 6 bicycles perfectly. It feels very stable and the bikes come on and off in seconds.Most importantly, I am not what one would call mechanically gifted, yet find it so simple to install and breakdown this rack. On the first try it took about fifteen minutes; now it literally takes under two minutes for installation and removal. It is also very stylish looking. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I did a lot of looking before purchasing this rack. I ended up buying it at a local bike shop because I wanted to see it first. I have a Honda Accord coupe - 2 door - and the fit is just right for the car.

I had borrowed a three bike Saris rack from a friend and decided to get one for myself. I only needed a rack to carry two bikes so thats what I ordered. When it arrived I was taken aback by the fact it wasn't quite like my friends although it looked exactly like it in the online picture. It only had one upper arm rather then two like my friends. Over wise it was identical. I almost sent it back but decided to try it out instead. Glad I did because my concerns about stability with just one upper arm was quickly dispelled. Great rack, rock solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"The Bones 8095 is a credible rack. There are no adjustment settings or application charts to tell you how to install the rack. The car fit charts are minimal.

The cam buckles work very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Engineering","review":"Used this rack on a thousand mile trip and the bikes didn't budge.

Did not handle girl's bike frame well so purchased a bar that connects from seat to handle bar stem. This solved all problems for the girl's bike. Wish I had purchased the 3 bike model. It has 2 upper legs and 2 lower legs. I think this would have been a more stable model. The 805 straps tightly to the car but the bike support arms have considerable wobble in them and cannot be made tighter. I do like the ease with which it attaches to the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"Since I drive a hatchback ('04 Pontiac Vibe) with room for a couple of bikes in the back, I don't have a ton of experience with bike racks. I recently moved 300 miles to another state, and I needed that space for boxes of stuff. I considered buying a roof-mount system, but the minimal amount of use didn't justify the rather high buy-in price for such systems. A relative loaned me a used (not sure what brand/model) rear-mount rack, but I was pretty apprehensive about the low quality and instability of the loaner rack. I picked the Saris for its blend of affordability and stability, and I was not disappointed. It weathered 260+ miles of interstate and a good chunk of bumpy city roads without any problems. I loaded a heavier, steel-framed Surly Cross Check nearest the vehicle and a lighter, aluminum & carbon Trek road bike on the outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rack but .....","review":"This is a very good rack once you get it set up. It takes a good 30-45 minutes to set up this rack initially. Once you've done it the first time, subsequent installation will only take 5-10 minutes. This rack doesn't come with anything, all accessories have to be purchased separately; for such an expensive rack, I thought it would have been nice for them to include some extra Velcro straps to tie down your fork or something.The rack itself is very sturdy and I feel my bike is always secured. The rubber feet left no marks on my trunk lid or bumper. I only wish there was a way to lock the bike and rack together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyed the Paint on my Spoiler Fin","review":"I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my Bike","review":"The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack.

When it arrived, I was disappointed to discover how big it is. Even when folded, it takes up a lot more space than other racks. Since I have a small car, space is important to me and I don't want a rack that won't fit in my trunk or my closet.Also, the straps required a lot of effort to adjust and I could never get it really tight.There are better racks that are much cheaper, so I would recommed looking elsewhere. I exchanged this rack for an Allen Ultra Compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Finally I found bike rack that fit for my car 1995 Toyota Celica.

It's very sturdy to carry my two mountain bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid on Cross-Continental Road Trip","review":"I hooked this rack up to the trunk of my 2007 Camry, strapped in a couple bikes, and headed West to Seattle from Chicago. I had absolutely no problem throughout the entire road trip and both bikes arrived safely :) The rack seemed extremely solid and barely moved even at Montana highway speeds. The outermost bike definitely sways a little more than the inner one, but i think that is just the natural flexing of the support arms. The rack was easy to put on and the bikes stay firmly in place using the built-in straps. The only thing Saris forgot is a way to keep the front wheel/handlebars from swaying. I fixed this using a couple short pieces of rope through the spokes and around the frame.Overall: super secure rack that can survive 2000 mile road trips"},{"rating":"2","title":"great bike rack","review":"I am using this bike rack at least once per week and I have really gained confidence with this bike rack. This is a great product. Set-up is fairly easy. The bikes feel very secure. Sometimes the straps are slightly difficult to unhook but at least I know that it will be difficult for the bikes to come off. The bikes have minimal movement while driving - at first I was concerned as I haven't traveled with bikes before but have since grown comfortable. As long as the straps are tightly fastened there is no need to be worried. I use elastic straps to keep the tires and pedals from moving and to prevent damage to the other bicycle. Truly a great bike rack... solidly manufactured and a lifetime warranty to back it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched paint on car","review":"I have used the bike rack 10 - 15 times, properly installed, and it has scratched the paint on my brand new car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saris Bones 2-bike","review":"A little hard to figure out how to put on the car at first, but I love it otherwise. Holds bikes well above the road and is easy to take off and put on once you get past the initial set up. Also, this thing does not move at all after it's all cinched down. The bike stays exactly where you put it and you don't have to worry about it shifting while you're driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"It fit my Honda Prelude perfectly","review":"I have a lightweight Fuji road bike and had no problems installing this rack on my 01 Honda Prelude.

There are illustrations to help you through some of the harder set ups. This grow book comes with online product support. Can you believe it?? ??There is where you should be going.

The author thinks he knows everything and that his book is the definitive work on the subject. That is a bad combo. When you have that attitude, then you are no longer open to new methods or opinions. Any book, in this day and age, that has 4 chapters on soil and only one on hydro is better used as kindling. Setups are poorly explained, there are few pictures, and it yields more frustration than crops."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE's MY ORDER","review":"Been over a month ,still no book, it's a simple order, it's just a book.

Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality & service","review":"My Panasonic over-the-range microwave only lasted 1.5 years before it died on me.

Though they are identical, there is one big difference. Megan is born with a rare disease that causes her to feel no pain. In the hands of a lesser writer, this plot could easily have turned predictable, but Heuler's writing is anything but predictable. This is a story about how something that everyone takes for granted--that is, the ability to feel physical pain--can, by its absence also cause a person to feel such disattachment to the human condition that they also suffer the grief of being unable to experience emotional pain. I found this novel dark and disturbing. At times it had the feel of something Stephen King might have come up with, and that is certainly a compliment in this reader's opinion. If you enjoy exploring the darker sides of the human condition, then you will find this book to your liking. A fine novel, and worth the time and money invested. I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps for making informed choices","review":"I have converted to Judaism in order to have a single faith marriage. Though this books additudes were a bit outdated towards interfaith relationships and does not recognize the wide spread intermarriage phenomenom, the author has a good handle on the issues affecting the Jewish identity.

I thought I'd gain some insights to the world of fashion (an area of life that I'm not famailiar with) but I was very disappointed. Nothing but nothing in this book had to do with fashion, the fashion business, nor the intellectual exercise that goes into fashion. This was simply the rambling lifetime memories of a well respected player from the fashion field. Childhood, young adult, married, Europe, here, there, everywhere... if you like name dropping (and I admit she did drop some impressive names) - this book is for you. If you're looking for some insights into fashion and/or the fashion world, look else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"There's nothing like autobiographies, especially when written by people who are/were so excited and enthusiastic about their lives.

We instantly recognize it, but it cannot be defined. It is when something or someone is fully alive, harmonious, true to their essential nature. D.V. has this glorious characteristic. Her evocation of the 1920's to 1960's is priceless and more valuable than any history book. She is so true to herself, honest, larger-than-life, and filled with strong opinions without being narcisisstic. D.V. shows that style comes from within and that fashion is just a tool. I adore this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"If you decide to buy this CD, please see the movie first.

The melodies are strong and he sounds great! Particular stand-outs include \\"Someday Out Of The Blue,\\" which is the first single, \\"Trust Me,\\" \\"My Heart Dances,\\" and \\"Friends Never Say Goodbye.\\" A few more EJ tracks would have been better than the instrumentals included at the end of the album. Overall this is a fine body of work. The first single is probably the catchiest of the songs on this release, and a good follow-up single to this one would be \\"Trust Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted a soundtrack not an Elton John record","review":"Some of the other reviews are correct, this is a great Elton John record. But I didnt buy it to listen to Elton John, I bought it to get the music from the movie.I am very disappointed. While Elton John is indeed a good artist, that is not why I wanted this. The makers of this cd have cheated me and anyone else who is a fan of the movie. They have set this up as a soundtrack to get your money, but instead it is nothing more than an Elton John music.Which is why it only gets 1 star from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Songs Say So Much","review":"What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie.

I can't take it anymore. It's just the same old bit, over and over and over again. Disney wants to sell some new-age, sentimental, genderless, ahistorical fairy-tale ripoff and they have John come up with the sappy soundtrack so that he can parade himself around at benefit dinners for another year or so until the next Disney assignment. Please, for the sake of humanity, desist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocket Man Where Are You........?","review":"Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the \\"I think I can still write a hit\\" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost as good as i hoped","review":"I was a little disappointed because as much as I love EJ and Randy, their duet was not as good as the one in the movie. \\"It's tough to be a God\\" is a great song.

I had planned to perform a musical freestyle on my horse for a huge charity fair with this music but had to change my plans and use another selection as it takes weeks to compose the choreography and practice the timing with the horse.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another stretch of Elton's talents!","review":"Though \\"The Big Picture\\" was more of an atmospheric album to listen to and not a chartbuster, \\"The Road To El Dorado\\" Soundtrack is an exeptionally unique mix of songs I've never heard Elton create. The upbeat \\"El Dorado\\" is one of the best Elton songs in the last 5 years. Without judging Elton by his style of writing and earlier works, his songwriting is so different in this album that you wouldn't believe Elton could've possibly written it. This just proves the vastness of Elton's songwriting talents. Elton's voice is in fine form, and this CD is a must buy for not only Elton fans, but those who want to listen to an album that's both unique and creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville!","review":"\\"El Dorado\\" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like \\"Circle of Light\\" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of \\"El Dorado.\\" There are no ballads like \\"Can you hear the love\\" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although \\"It's Tough to be a God\\" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly, but good anyway.","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Elton John, but I loved this CD! I was hoping for more of the music from the movie itself, especially the Kline/Branagh version of \\"It's Tough to Be A God\\", but I was very happy with what I got. I do hope that Dreamworks releases another CD, with more of the score and the Kline/Branagh song, but I'm still very happy with this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected!","review":"I was disappointed to discover that this is not really a soundtrack from the movie. The only thing this CD has in common with the movie is the song titles. I would have preferred a combination of Elton John signing some of the tracks and the voice talents from the movie doing some of the others. This CD is more like Road to El Dorado set to elevator music. 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful bag but terrible material!","review":"I absolutely loved the appearance of the bag. The colors are beautiful and the bag has a lot of compartments but it unfortunately has two huge problems:1. the main compartment opens on one side which makes it hard to open and close and calls for tugging at the zipper2. the material along the zipper to the main compartment tears too easilyI have had this diaper bag for no more than a month and the bag is already completely torn at the zipper. The great thing is that JJ Cole has great customer service.

The book looks like it was printed from Google Books on a home printer. It is missing half the book and all the pictures and the pages and paragraphs are not formatted properly. If you own a printer you are better off printing the PDF from Google Books. I am forced to return this book, even though I've been looking forward to reading it for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Manson kix","review":"Here is a simple but fantastic song that is a lyrically blunt statement about the ridiculous drama in so many people's lives, and how one can get caught up in trying to live up to these supposed standards of society. Shirley Manson has said it is a reflection of how she thinks and speaks in real life.Though there seems to be a hint of reverb in both of the live tracks, they are the main reason to own this single. Only Happy When It Rains is such a great song and it rocks even more live. ...On a side note, Shirley sang \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" much differently on the Garbage/No Doubt fall tour of 2002. Take advantage of any chance you get to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Brokaw glosses over a very important subject and shows his political colors readily. It is unfortunate that the same subject has not yet been treated by a more serious and professional author."},{"rating":"2","title":"good retrospection","review":"Tom Brokaw has wriiten quite a good book using the common men and women as the forces of retrospection. Of course, he only mentions people he knew or came across in the generation, missing out a lot of others.The only comment I would like to make is that Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr should not be included or mentioned. Schlesinger was an historian but to me, he never measured up to the greatness of William Prescott, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Arnold J. Tonybee or Barbara Tuchman. He didn't seem to have fired a single shot or shed a drop of blood during the War. His work at the OSS during the War was quite hazy and murky. I am quite disgusted with his biased and one-sided opinion of the Kennedys"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I was excited to finally get my hands on this book to read it and learn more about the generation I know least about. However, I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Brokaw repeatedly tried to point out characteristics of that generation that I clearly did not see and that I have seen many times over in other generations. When he states that the integrity and work ethic of that generation is not seen today, I am offended and appalled. That kind of position is not only wrong but harmful. The parents and youth of today have not had to deal with a draft- to no fault of their own - however they have had many other obstacles to face that did not automatically make them heroes. I was angered and disappointed by this book. It was neither informative nor inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I started to read \\"The Greatest Generation\\" in the hope that it would contribute to World War II history. I really cannot say it did. I also found it to be repetitive. I also challenge the notion of the World War II generation being the \\"greatest generation\\" because of the patriotism it displayed. We have had individuals display similar patriotism throughout our history, especially since World War II. A recent example is Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal Safety who give up millions to join the Army Rangers and gave his life in Afghanistan. I also find it interesting that Mr Brokaw admires the World War II generation for its patriotism yet objected to his fellow journalists wearing the American flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"greatest?\\" now wait a second..","review":"Now, I don't want to downplay the importance of WW2 and all the heroes, known and unknown, that contributed to the efforts of that struggle.. But to dub them the absolute \\"greatest\\" is an insult to both older and younger generations. What about the Revolutionary War or the Civil War, or WWI for that matter? What about the founders of our country who fought so desperately on the American frontier long before any of us were born.. Being 19, i belong to a younger generation, one that doesn't (at present) have any large scale wars to fight, though I'd like to think we can still amount to something and not have to live forever in the shadows of our valiant elders."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be required reading of every high school student","review":"This book made me smile and made me cry.

What about the generations of men and women who formed this nation, built the states, towns, farms, died on the battlefields of the Revolution, War of 1812 and Civil War, and more. In short, what about the very people who made it possible for there to even be an American WWII generation? In my opinion, the WWII generation earns a different title: The Most Arrogant Generation. Remember they also gave us the Cold War, McCarthyism and Segregation. It was also men of the WWII generation who \\"led\\" the nation into Vietnam. (Some leadership!)Actually, what I think Brokaw meant to say, is that the WWII generation was the last great American generation. What a pessimist!

This from a generation that never gave a thought for its own children, that trashed their parents until - surprise, surprise, they realized they're growing old, too. So now, all that is old is wonderful, when 30 years ago, all that is young was wonderful.So, while the baby boomers make themselves feel good, yet again, it'll be up to the generations after them to clean up their messes.More books like this will start pouring out as baby boomers realize their own mortality and start searching for ways to make themselves look better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations unfulfilled","review":"My father served in Europe during WW II. Like many other G. I.'s he returned home with a foreign-born wife. It was very disappointing that there was no mention of soldiers and their war brides in this book. The individual stories are good as far as they go, but Brokaw trivializes them with the same flowery comments repeated again and again. Some celebrity stories such as Art Buchwald's were very entertaining, but other celebrity names were mentioned without an account of the individual's experiences. Would you call that name dropping? I agree with all the other reviewers who liked the stories but found them pooly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Generation, Lousy Book","review":"Don't bother reading this book.

The individual excerpts on Bob Dole, George Shultz. etc. was especially interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and Boring","review":"I preface my remarks by saying that as a foreigner and as a citizen of a pathologically 'neutral', state I have no first hand or cultural knowledge of what it must have been like to live through a War as catastrophic as World War II. However, part of my motivation in reading this book was to get a greater sense of the 'home front' aspects of war and since I like Mr. Brokaw's tabloid style of journalism I felt I was on to a winner. Although eminently readable as expected, there was, after Chapter 3 or so, a sameness to each bite-sized vignette that eventually lead me to discard the book in annoyance. I never finished the wretched thing ! In short, repetition is Mr. Brokaw's greatest sin and while he established firmly the decency, ordinariness and patriotism of the Greatest Generation, he did them no great service by effectively imbuing them with an undeserved tag of 'Boring' as well !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuppie View of WWII Americans","review":"Unfortunately, this book is just a series of repetitive \\"snippets\\" that really does little to tell the story of this generation. I am about Brokaw's age and my parents and their brothers and sisters numbered 17 in total. I have heard all the stories, and have three uncles buried in Europe. I found Brocaw with little talent (this book could have been done by a mediocre college sophomore) and a love for \\"Brocaw\\". Never have I seen a \\"talking head\\" lever his TV exposure to the extent this guy has. He, like a lot of his generation gave little, reaped plenty and are looking for legitimacy via the accomplishments of their parents.Also, please note he put his name on every other page.

Other than that the stories were shallow and uninteresting, lacking depth and insight of the effect of the war on these individuals. Let's face it, post war prosperity brought these veterans the success they enjoy today. I don't think it had much to do with their military experiences. Joe Foss was not revered by South Dakotans to any extent and throwing Al Neuharth in was really clutching at straws.Really it was the parents of these WWII veterans that were the sacrificers, the moralists, the conservers, the workers, the survivors that should get the credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr.Brokaw found a light switch,and turned it on","review":"My Dad jumped on D Day, 82nd Airborne(Devils in Baggy Pants}was wounded before he landed and spent the next few mos as a POW.As in Mr.Browkaws book these men never really talked about their total experience but I could sense it remained with him the rest of his life.Id like to thank Mr.Browkaw for reminding the rest of us what a true hero really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Individually - neat stories.

I also understand why I am the way I am and what these qualities that were passed down, did for me in my life.

If it weren't for the struggles and heroism of that generation, we might not be here today. The reviewer I refer to writes, \\"if Mr. Brokaw and others think that my generation hasn't faced death, despair, fear, illness and poverty, he and they are not truly connected to the world in which they live now.\\" To this reviewer, I must say that the current generations of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers do NOT face such struggle on the same massive level as those who lived (or died) during the Depression and the World Wars.

All in all, I felt obligated to finish the book (my mother raved about it, but then, she is one of \\"those generation\\") but I wouldn't recommend it or read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, easy to read and great publicity...!","review":"Grateful to read in print actual accounts of Veterans.

With this book, Brokaw manages to transplant all of these attributes to writing. As if poor and occasionally self-conciously florid writing did not make this book poor enough, Brokaw, as any mass-media ninny would do, focuses on truly trivial aspects of World War II, e.g., the experiences of \\"victims\\" -- women, etc. In the process, he completely eschews any meaningful tribute to what WWII was fought for, what any serious treatment of the subject would not leave out. The result is a thoroughly banal presentation of the most heroic and momentous event of the twentieth century. But, this is what I should have expected from a television newscaster. Churchill's \\"The Second World War\\" is still (by far) the best history of WWII, personal or otherwise. Is it any coincidence that WWII's greatest hero was also its greatest historian?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"greatest\\" in my book.","review":"Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Generation","review":"Is interesting, but quite repetitive.

I agree with Brokaw's point that those who went to war (pacific or europe) are the generation that built America and modernized it. The generation which offered its unconditional love and service to the United States and ran to her aid when she needed them. This generation (now in their late 70s or 80s) came home from the front lines and contributed to the re-construction of a country that suffered from the New Deal, Great Depression and other problems of the 1930s. This book attests to the greatness of that generation and should be on every young man's reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Story Already Told","review":"I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and shallow account of the ordinary heros WWII","review":"I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts.

I am a proud American, and one who has studied this period of time quite extensively, and this definitely WAS the Greatest Generation indeed!

While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over. I think the book needs to be toned down and put in its proper perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a short story, too repetive","review":"The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names.

Brokaw is a poor writer, and a lousy editor. Although there are undoubtedly great stories to be told here, Brokaw manages to reduce the life stories of the greatest generation to tedium. It just isn't worth wading through the muck for the occasional nugget of good story.As a gift for someone of the WWII generation, this book might make sense. Otherwise, a person's time would be better spent by reading a WWII book from someone else. Or perhaps by watching \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" again.Skip this loser, and the loser sequel.

Listen: I'm a Boomer. My parents had nothing -- nothing! Everything I have, I've worked damned hard for! And I had the common sense to stand up and speak out against Vietnam. Ask the Greatest Generation how they spoke out against McCarthyism, racism, intolerance, bigotry and the like. This is a revisionist view of history -- the winners pounding themselves on their backs, and looking down on everyone else. Tom Brokaw should be ashamed of his lack of journalistic objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly, terribly disappointing","review":"Brokaw has managed to take wonderful raw material and produce a book that would not challenge a junior high school student.

Unfortunately, he makes his point with a sledgehammer, telling sapppy stories with the same theme over and over, spoon feeding you the point, in case you somehow missed it. Grandma and Grandpa were great, generous, self-sacrificing gods and goddesses, and here are a thousand treacly repetitive stories why. This book condescends to the reader, unfortunately, probably with all good intentions but annoying results.

This was the last bigoted generation. Bigotry today exists in smaller and smaller pockets, hangovers from the generation Brokaw prostrates himself to. My older friend tells me that she likes working with younger men than her own generation because she gets treated like an equal instead of a subordinate. Says it all really - the greatest generation doesn't even like itself. Is Tom Brokaw out to make a buck with the old \`it were better in my time' malarkey, or is he stupid? Given that he is already very wealthy, and has never before struck me as an idiot, I'm going for the only other option - he wanted more limelight. By the way, the book was repetitive.

This generation has gone too long underappreciated as useless old farts by the Boomers, Xers and the latest generation. We forget that they built modern America thorugh their sacrifices and just plain old determination. While one might quibble with Brokaw's claim of this generation being the greatest (how about the revolutionary war and civil war gens), they are unquestionably the greatest alive today. Brokaw chronicles in easy-to-read vivid vignettes the lives of an assortment of WWII vets from all walks of life. While one might yearn for a bit more detail on the transition from wartime sacrifice to peacetime production, its still a must read for putting the accomplishments of this great generation into perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teleprompter journalism","review":"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"This book is appallingly written, brazenly self-promoting and transparently biased to the left. It is full of cloying rhetorical questions (\\"They never shared their lunch with a starving Japanese child,\\" supposedly characterizing younger Congressional Republicans -- how would Brokaw know who they'd shared lunch with, anyway?) and laughable self-contradictions (in a book that purportedly applauds the old-fashioned values, he criticizes Dole for being out of touch with the younger generation's self-absorption in his presidential campaign). Whenever he can work it in, he slings it to the Republicans, those meanies who care about no one but themselves.

While taking nothing away from accomplishments, why are they the \\"greatest generation?\\" No generation of Americans has ever failed to answer the call to arms and perform in less than spectacular fashion. Are the Americans who fought the Germans and Japanese somehow superior to those who fought in WWI or Vietnam, or the Civil War? Did it take more courage to parachute into France than Vietnam?Let's not forget that the WWII generation also returned home at a time of unprecedented growth and oppurtunity. Not so for vets of other wars, especially vets of WWI and Vietnam.I suggest that anyone interested in books of this type try \\"Citizen Soldiers,\\" or \\"D-day,\\" by Stephen Ambrose, or any one of the scores of far superior books offering accounts of WWII vets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks style.","review":"While I know Brokaw is a newsman and journalist, too much of his linear style effects what are otherwise compelling stories of those who lived and fought for this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"I couldn't even finish this book which says a lot because I hate not finishing what I've started.

The book was a wake up call for me.","review":"It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly underwhelming","review":"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself.

You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very simplistic telling of a few stories from WW2.","review":"This book is written in the same manner as the news is read on television, in little sound bites. There is not much \\"meat\\" in the brief stories included. Brokaw chose to include political correctness which made me wonder why he called it \\"The Greatest Generation\\".

If you could have seen the look in my father's eyes as he relived some of his best and worst memories. If only I could have had an autographed copy of the book. I will settle for a picture of my father and me as we talked with Tom about his days growing up in So Dakota and his love for the brave soldiers that worked so hard to maintain the freedoms for all of us.

It is totally devoid of emotion. Brokaw generates no real sympathy for his characters and the result is much like reading a dull history book filled with statistics.

Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's \\"The Good War.\\" Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated and undereditied book I've ever read.","review":"Redunencies throughout, scant attention to fact, e.g., no mention that WAAC (Women's Auxilliary Army Corps) preceded WAC; no mention of Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, the first commander.

I take nothing away from the experience and hardhships of the generation of Americans who suffered the depression and WWII. That surely is a 5-Star story and my parents lived it. But this book is not that story. Instead I find cliche's and stereotypes. For sure, the last 50 years of American history has been one of accomplishment and success. But it is easy to forget that this was largely because the rest of the industrial world was in rubble after the War, and America had a special opportunity to excel and grow. - - I feel alarm bells when any group of people are described as special or superior. This type of thinking has resulted in too much suffering in our world. I suspect the reality is that Brokaw is laying the groundwork for a political career.

One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the \\"greatest generation\\", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"What is so special about this book?

I am taken aback as Brokaw decided that in his godly manor that his father, and his fathers friends were the numro uno. Every generation has its fair share of heros it is horrible to pinpoint one generation to this and cover up what really needed to be said, that we lost thousands of men and women to a cause that needed to be fought. But recent events change the outlook of WWII, September 11 has shown the world that we as a country not a generation are the greatest, WE as a country not singled out retired folks who did do a great job, but in the book it failed to show the real deal it glossed over too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy was highlighted","review":"The copy recieved was not as described.

I saw Brokaw on the talk shows and had high hopes for The Greatest Generation. But the author's dry, uninspired writing style made reading more chore than pleasure. I soon found myself skimming. I can recall only a few of the chapters. As a more readable subsitute, I recommend the similar book by Studs Turkel called, I think, The Good War. It was told in the words of the subjects themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Generation did not get the Greatest Author","review":"The Greatest Generation they might well have been. The stories are compelling and diverse, However, Mr Brokaw's writing style is an abomination, His prose is dry. He does not trust the reader to be able to draw the significance or irony of the events descibed, rather he is compelled to tell the reader: \\"This is significant. This is ironic.\\" He holds the readers hand rather than setting them free to think about the lives and to appreciate their beauty. I think only bright pink highlighting of the sentences would have been more annoying. All and all, a great topic, great lives but an overbearing and boring presentation. Apparently, Mr. Brokaw is not content to be a reporter but feels it is necessary to be remedial reading instructor as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brokaw is better on television.","review":"The Greatest Generation is pretty good, considering. I mean what can one really expect by way of literature from over paid, telegenic, media stars? I enjoyed the references to Howard Stern. Too bad Brokaw didn't give Stern his own chapter.

Sort of like Tolstoy meets Dr. Seuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair picture of the depression/WWII generation","review":"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal.

The I-Man should stick to politics and sports; book reviews are not his strength. I really liked the concept, and couldn't wait to read the book, particularly after having seen recent video interviews of WW II veterans, and Saving Private Ryan. About 25% into it, I had to take a break. There is nothing exciting or revealing here - just the very basic facts, folks - and that doesn't make for five stars. It really is too bad, because the premise was good, that is, telling the stories of the greatest generation. But it's all surface; there's no depth, and, therefore, no interest in the people whose stories are being told.

The stories are well written and thought provoking. The very fact that these people came home and did their best to be good citizens and make good lives without complaining speaks volumes about that generation. Now we saw soldiers crying about having to leave their families during Desert Storm. Do we think it was any easier for the generation during WWII? This book shows us how \\"me centered\\" we are. Another thing, now soldiers came back from the Viet Nam or Desert Storm wars and blame everything on their military experience. The WWII generation sucked it up and went on with their lives. They got over it. Makes me sort of ashamed of the way my generation deals with life experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a 10 hour Nightly Newscast","review":"Tom Brokaw (and a squadron of 'helpers') produced a bombastic, windy book that is a disservice to the superb stories that he is trying to tell.The book is at its best when Brokaw lets the individuals tell their own stories, with a minimum of his commentary intruding. The peoples' stories are poignant, vivid, and worth reading.The problem is, you have to wade through Brokaw's creaking prose to get to the good stuff. Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories. Rotten job of trying to package them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite; just capitalizing on \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"","review":"For gripping stories of WWII, read \\"D-Day,\\" by Stephen Ambrose. These \\"up close and personal\\" stories grew monotonous. Most significantly, Brokaw gave short shrift to the sins of this \\"greatest\\" of generations. While I appreciated the discussion of our nation's treatment of Japanese-Americans during the war, full treatment of this generation's rampant racism, sexism and post-WWII national arrogance was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion.","review":"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sound Than Substance","review":"I picked up this book intending to like it. \\"Saving Private Ryen\\" had predisposed me to a certain nostalga for the WWII generation, as had Dole's 1996 candidacy. Disappointment followed. The title, on reflection, is hyperbolic: was this really the greatest generation in all history, or even American history? Greater than the Civil War or Founding Fathers' generations? The stories are well-written, and interesting. The whole is not as great as the sum of the parts, however. I came away with the impression that this was another 'last good war' book, and thus it covering old ground. -Lloyd A.

I lived through the \\"Blitz\\" and had acquaintances killed and bombed out of their homes. When I spoke of these experiences with my five children as they grew up, I could tell by their reactions that it was not one to dwell on. The book I found to be not that interesting.

However, shortly after reading the first few stories, I was deeply disappointed. I have utterly lost all respect for Mr. Brocaw's journalistic ability. The book is simplistic (written at about an 8th grade level), repetitive and boring. It feels more like an article from People Magazine than any sort of historical record or work of literature. Devoid of facts and details, it contains very little of anything else.The generation he is writing about deserves a better tribute than this.

Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place.

You will come away feeling great about your relatives who lived during this time. This book answered many \\"Why\\" questions. If you have been lucky enough to live in a close family, this will give you the reason so many familys are close, and what true family values are all about.

In \\"The Greatest Generation\\" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant and moving example of what we have lost","review":"This incredible book made me take a good long look at myself and my generation, known as Generation X.

As I have just really found out. I read this book voraciously, and found myself in tears, but could never put it down. As a matter of fact, I felt that twinge of sadness as I found myself at the last page. I am purchasing three more copies to send to my younger cousins. I hope they get as much from it as I did.

This is an absorbing read about our parents & grandparents. Tom Brokaw writes as he speaks, with fluent, descriptive insights. Cogent details set the scenes of the stories of this generation who, three score years ago, readily gave up their futures to either go to war or do the support work for the war effort. Here are the youngsters borne from the ashes of the War To End All Wars; gaining in years even as their nation & those around the world first soared in the post-war hysteria only to plummet later into the Great Depression.

While the flavor of appreciation comes across as very real in this book I was hoping for a more acedemic and researched direction. I was dissapointed. The generation of the 40's deserves this book for the gratitude that it heaps on them, though I don't agree they are quite the saints as they are protrayed. Not much substance...Please some historian/writer follow the idea and write a proper book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up, Brokaw.","review":"Evidently, the good news anchorman has been watching a little too much Saving Private Ryan lately. Naturally, the book gloats with little restraint over this generation's stance against fascism, neglecting its evident shortcomings as a nation half-governed by Jim Crow laws, or the social preception of the proper role of women as being confined to the household. Simply utilizing the fact that this generation took such actions that would easily have been undertaken by any sane people under these circumstances as an excuse to decry other generations as less worthy is grossly unfair. Yet, given Tom's journalistic background, his embellishments is hardly surprising.

I wanted to read more about their experiences and I felt the interviewer let a lot of good stories slip through his tape recorder. We are treated to a lot of boasting about how honest, hard-working and long-suffering this generation is. Clearly, there are other interviewers/writers who handle this same territory better.

No, his generation is no better or worse than any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, all this just to sell books","review":"Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the \\"Greatest Generation\\", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the \\"GI Generation\\", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the \\"Silent Generation\\" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression.

The WAC began with the WAAC - Womens Army Auxillary Corps- which converted (with the necessity of WAAC members being sworn into the Army), and became the Womens Army Corps. Brokaw consistently and incorrectly refers to it as the WACs -both in the text and in the index on page 412 of the book.

It covers reversal patterns, gaps, support and resistance, consolidation patterns, trendlines and channels (by Edwards); and then goes into stock selection, stop orders, how to build a chart, and the practical application of those patterns and how to use them in your trading (by Magee).

Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry.

By early 1917 the BEF had developed a new tactical system based on fire and movement much like that of the stormtroopers, and which was to continue to be the basis for infantry assaults until today.This book brings together a series of articles by a range of writers to analyze what the British did during the war.

Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak. I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration.

To classify this book as a 'western' is to diminish not only the story but the excellent prose that Ms Gloss has given to the reader. Lydia Sanderson,the heroine of this story, is an example of the thousands of women who settled the western United States,surmounting extreme conditions, with or without a man. This story is told from the thoughts and perspectives of human beings in a time when words were important and not just 'bantied about' without thought.The book gives one, in this high tech day and age, a sense of the real and important, in daily living. It puts ones feet back on the ground and gives a new perspective to our lives.

Only on the Maurice Joshua remix of 'So Good' does the music show any signs of joy and life.

How can we when they are shoved in our faces at every possible moment, even when they are supposedly taking a break! So until they decide what they want from their careers, they will still manage to be a cash cow for their fans. Elsewhere, these remixes are far from anything good. Just another sad piece of plastic which isn't worth the time of day...Why don't they just take time off, I mean really take time off, and come back with something that is a good album?

Now we get live albums, useless Holiday recordings, and shoddily-made remix releases. This album falls into the third category, and as far as remix albums go, the results are catastrophic. Predictible hip-hop remixes of singles we've heard a zillion times before abound, while the FEW house mixes are as flat as soda left at room temperature for hours. Listen, nobody says you can't do a remix album, but give the listeners some variety and a groove. I actually like Destiny's Child, but after \\"The Writing's on the Wall,\\" their music is getting more and more vanilla.

None of the remixes made the song any better, in my opinion. And the glaring horrible \\"Dot\\" with its caustic tone and scathing chorus that informs people who don't like Beyonce to \\"Shut Up!\\" In addition, the verse contains the self-pitying line \\"Just blame it on B-E-Y-O-N-C-E.\\" Making it difficult for the listener to empathise with her at all.The tender \\"Emotions\\" suffered most of all from Beyonce's over the top singing and the funkifying it went through to be called a remix.

Then the contraversy began, they were changing members like someone changing underwear. \\"survivor\\" was ok. This remix is one of the worst remix/greatest hits product on the market. Everyone has heard most of them on here. This is something that had to have been thrown together at the last minute. I'm not saying that they are talented. They can better than some vocalists out there, but Beyonce' overdoes it sometimes. We have been forced fed these ladies for the past year. Take some time off because you've \\"worked\\" so hard to get where you are. To add the DC3 drama, the latest rumor is Beyonce' and Kelly really are \\"sisters\\".

When I went to the bookstore I was excited to find a novel based on the Klondike and was able to get through about 3 chapters before I realized that I was forcing myself to read only because it was a work by London. The descriptions of incidents are choppy and bland, the conversations are dull and forced, and the manner in which London moves from scene to scene leaves the reader thinking wait, did two pages just get stuck together and I missed something??If you want to read off the beaten path London I suggest you read John Barleycorn (amazing, I felt the heat from the coal furnace) or South Sea Tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy 883476028965 instead.","review":"As anyone can clearly tell from the reviews, this bundle (which is three existing DVDs shrink-wrapped together with a sheet of paper bearing the \\"cover\\" image rubber cemented to the front -- not a space-saver) only contains the rated cuts of FEAST II and FEAST III.

Besides his exciting arrangements, he was an innovator. When other bands used a tuba, Goldkette use a bass. And while other bands used a banjo, Goldkette had a guitar player. Another reason Goldkette's arrangement are recognizable: jazz violin solos. Many bands simply had the violinist in the background playing the main melody. Goldkette had Joe Venuti fiddling away. The only drawback to this recording is the haphazard use of noise reduction. Sometimes it's not there, other times it's in full force, and that causes a distraction from the great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the '20's Roared","review":"This disc contains a brief history of great music from the '20's interspersed with embarassing schlock that would make a mother wince. Most people will buy it, and justly so, to hear Bix; however, after listening, the discerning buyer will be happy that he has heard Steve Brown, a very under-rated musician, at his best. Frank Trambauer carries his friend Bix, either through direct inspiration or with wonderful counterpoint in several of the songs. Some of the cuts, like I Didn't Know, have been mastered through a string telephone. But carping about the sound when you're listening to history, or complaining that Chauncey Morehouse was only permitted one high-hat and a snare in the studio, and thus criticising his drumming seems tawdry.This is a great addition for both jazz neophyte and discerning collector of twenties memoribilia.

The sound quality of the remastered titles is superb and not only my husband's favourites were on it, but also other titles, of which we did not know the existence.

The book has sat on the bookshelf unopened (and lost and buried) for almost 30 years, when I rediscovered it, this time turning immediately to the back for the last chapter on \\"The Cellar.\\" Pellegrini advocated a philosophy of grow your own, make your own, drink your own wine (which applied to food as well). Now, as I winemaker myself ([...]), I relished reading his musings on winemaking and life.

So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book. Also, even when you try to figure out what all the symbols mean- the pronunciation that you end up with sounds nothing like the danish word.

It's all luck, no strategy or ability to impact how the game moves or progresses.

I wouldn't even rate the educational value of this game very high, as by the age of 4, kids can already count, discern directions, and read symbols. The game isn't worthless, just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair, and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children. As this game has small pieces, though, it wouldn't be feasible to play this game with children in that age range. I don't recommend this game for 4+.

We take it on vacations and to parties, even while we waited for a table at a restaurant. It's unpredictable and changes every time you play it.

You never know who is going to win until the end, because even if you run out of mice early, there is a chance someone might have to pass you their's. The last person with mice wins.

You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more.

The game can drag on and on...ughh. Our boys played it once and that was the end of that!However, they LOVE the other games I bought. They've gotten far more enjoyment out of Hiss, Pirate Pop Up, and Slamwich (we play the simplified version of Slamwich).

I make bento lunches for my son and my family more often with the Neuro Fuzzy. Any sushi dish must start with perfect rice. We use Tamaki Gold rice in our neuro fuzzy.It's a small investment for happiness, family meals, picnics, and perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Unbelievable: It died 14 months after purchase","review":"I would of given it 0 stars because it died 14 months after I purchase it(right out of warranty). I would have thought that for such an expensive product that would be more durable or have a longer warranty such as Cuisinarts 3 year warranty. I know that the main reason that people buyer this rice cooker is to make rice in it. But for $150 it really should have a slow cook and steaming function. You can buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker from Panasonic with both of these features for less and Panasonic rice cookers last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"no-stick layer was chipped after one year of use","review":"I love the features of this rice cooker.

I am very picky on the rice cooker that I use. I had thought that Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy would give me the best cooked rice. However, I am very dispointed. First, this rice cooker takes forever to cook. I mean twice longer than a regular simple rice cooker. Why? Because it requires 120V while we all use 110V. I dont know why the manufactur does that since it sells to U.S. Second, the texture of the rice that it cooks tastes as good as a $30.00 rice cooker. Third, the cooker use battery. Battery will die. I regret I spent $150 on this rice cooker. I should have bought the most basic one, the one that causes about $90.00. The store doesnt' let me exchange either since I already used it. Well, I just have to live with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Rice, Quirky User Interface","review":"I'm guessing that for Japanese, this user interface is easier to navigate. For Americans the interface is quirky and the manual is a bit hard to understand, something like all Japanese products used to be when they started to get popular. But once you learn how it works, you can get perfect rice any time and that's worth a lot.The one REALLY annoying thing about this device though is that you can't tell how many minutes are left to cook until it's nearly done. It may be because it doesn't know, but all you have is some time estimates in the manual. This can be a problem in meal planning, but it really does a good job on the rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Zojirushi product","review":"I am Asian and I have had many rice cookers of all sizes and quality. I chose Zojirushi brand because of its known name and quality. However, I am surprisingly very disappointed with this rice cooker/warmer. It is actually the worst cooker that I have ever had. It is slow in making rice but the worse is that it can't keep rice warm in the warmer mode. Rice dries up within few hours and its dry as a corn flake by the next day. I am very disappointed and I would not recommend this product.I ordered and replaced inner lid set for my rice cooker (approximately $15 including shipping) which I ordered at Zojirushi website and it seems to be working better and keeping my rice warm and moist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock out with your Rice Cooker","review":"I love this rice cooker. I mean it. My wife and I are doing really well but if this rice cooker decided to come alive I would totally drop everything else just to be with it. It plays music when you set the timer and again when the rice is done. Even kung fu ninjas would bow in respect to this awesome rice cooking machine. Oh and did I mention that it can keep your rice warm and edible for DAYS at a time?!! And it seriously cooks all kinds of rice.

The rice came out perfect and very soft and moist during that time. Now the cooker cooks the rice dry and hard like any other cheap rice cooker. Though we cleaned the lids and maintained it well, it's like one of those cheap cookers now; you just have to guess whether to add more or less water to get good rice.For the price, I expected more especially when you can get basically 5 or 6 decent cookers at Costco. In the end this machine will be like any other machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for oatmeal","review":"In addition to rice I use this for cooking Irish oatmeal which is a bother to cook on the stovetop because it wants to foam up/boil over and stick to the bottom of the pot requiring you to stand over it for 30-40 minutes. The Zojirushi, however, can be set the night before and in the morning you have perfectly cooked oatmeal and little mess.Less hassle in the morning than instant! I can hardly believe it. Used it for about 6 years now. My favorite kitchen gadget.Edit May 1 2009 - About 10 yrs old and still going strong. The internal battery (that keeps the digital clock going) still works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding! bit pricey at amazon...","review":"I love this rice cooker, it lets me eat rice whenever I want, with its timer settings. Not only that, it has appropriate cooking settings - perfect for any kind of rice cooking. I personally like semi-brown rice, so I just put rice in, set the timer for 7am night before, then eat the rice all day for all my meals.I also saw this rice cooker at 99 Ranch market for 120 dollars so maybe it's a better deal than Amazon. I got 25 off for this from amazon but if you can get to 99 ranch, get it there instead if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine","review":"I love this unit.

In the past, I've used Hitachi and National rice cookers that basically just heat up and cook the rice. This Zojirushi cooks the rice very evenly. I prefer my rice soft yet still resilient and the normal setting does that. It also keeps the rice from drying out if you leave it to warm.

Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rice cooker, poor instruction book","review":"Although the rice cooker itself works great, the instruction book which comes with it is very poor. It doesn't even explain when to use which of the two slightly different sized cups the unit comes with. That said, it cooks white and brown rice beautifully and makes a terrific batch of steel cut oats oatmeal.One feature I wish it had was to give some indication of the approximate cooking time left to go. It only does so for the last few minutes of the process. Also, the built in clock doesn't seem to have a way to display North American convention 12 hour time and always displays in the 24 time format. The clock isn't important as we are surrounded by clocks on just about everything with a digital display these days, but it does show lack of attention to the local market. Then again, maybe there is a way to change the clock mode and I just can't find it in the manual!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Impressed","review":"We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker.

We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed.

I prefer brown rice so that's mainly why I fire up the cooker (though white rice is good as long as nothing is mixed in with it). The only bad thing about the cooker is that it's WAY too expensive to buy online. Try to look for one at your local department store. If they don't have one your best option would be to see if your local department store allows you to specially order a rice maker from them. Do NOT order one from somewhere online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"Very expensive. Have to read the manual every time for it to work. Got a mind of it own.

It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my \\"cheap\\" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money.

We've had this cooker for 5 months. The removable inner lid was recently dropped from a height of < 4feet. This short drop resulted in one of the tabs breaking off the inner lid. Since it was so new, I figured it would be under warranty, but Zojirushi said this wasn't covered and I had to pay for a new part ($15 with slow shipping, 10 days). I expected either better construction or better warranty coverage from a $155 rice cooker.

The song this plays when it starts and finishes is like something out of one's childhood, but it makes no difference. For people who want something done right, you already know Zojirushi is the way to go. I am glad I got the smaller model. This makes perfect servings for up to four - six persons.

It still looks and works like the day I bought it. It plays charming little songs to signal the start and end of the program and keeps the rice hot and moist for hours.

Outside all is white, but inside, her live begins to unfold before her in vivid color. Wishes can come true in the cabin - but will Vinny the cat's one special wish finally help the woman find her way to a true sense of peace? A very surreal book, sometimes confusing, but never dull. The two cats - clever, talkative Vinny, who claims to have had thousands of past lives; the innocent, quiet dancer Sophie - and a dull witted yet loyal polar bear named Simon provided the humor, and the woman was a powerful, inspiring character. Unusual, but worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once into it, a wonderful and uplifting read.","review":"Betsy Howie's Snow took me a few pages to get into -- she starts without providing the context upon which we readers tend to depend. I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as \\"reality.\\" I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too nervewracking to be enjoyable.","review":"I'm usually a good judge of which books I'll love, but not this time. My friend warned me that Snow quickly disolves into psychobabble, but was worth reading for the cat antics. Right she was! Perhaps I didn't feel well the day I began reading this annoying book, but within the first 20 pages, I hated it. It was hard to finish, but I was intrigued with the unusual talents the cats displayed, and I kept hoping the story would become less uncomfortable to read. It just had no flow. The subject matter did not bother me, but the way it was written did. I hardly ever read a book I don't want to finish, but this one was a struggle. To the author's credit, I found Vinny and Sophie the cats very charming. Perhaps Ms. Howie's next book will be easier on the nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera as described and works","review":"Thanks, camera as described. Works as expected or hoped.

I bought it to use as a desk chair and ordered the 75cm because I thought it would be more comfortable. Let me tell you, the ball is huge! I probably should have bought the 65cm, but this one fits my 6 foot 3 inch husband perfectly. We're very pleased with it. I feel safe bouncing on it and my kids love to play with it also. Oh, and I pumped the ball up by hand with assistance from my 5 year old using the included pump with no trouble at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Thick Stability Ball","review":"Nice high quality ball.

For some context, I'm 6'1\\", 200 lbs, and my desktop is at 30\\" with 25\\" clearance underneath. I inflated the ball to almost exactly 75 cm without any concerns. The included pump is adequate, but you'll pump for 15 minutes or so. The plastic plugs seal up the ball just fine, and come out easily enough with the help of a pointy object. I haven't had to do this but once initially to adjust the amount of air. It has held the pressure pretty much constant for 5 weeks now. The ball does not pick up lint and dust, so it stays looking clean. I like that it's rated for so much weight--it doesn't feel at all vulnerable to bursting, even when I bounce on it, which is a nearly automatic reaction to sitting on the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality fitness ball - great addition to my normal workout.","review":"I had previously owned a flimsy at-home non-professional fitness ball - I stopped using it because the quality was so poor. Workouts were a joke. I started looking for a replacement. After reading all of the reviews, I purchased thie GoFit 65cm Stability Ball. Its awesome - exactly what I was looking for. Loved the quality. Its a perfect addition to my normal ab workouts.I agree with other users that pumping up the ball with the supplied hand-held pump was a bit of a pain but after it was inflated, I haven't had to mess with it.Also, after reading reviews about the ball not inflating to the proper size, I decided on the 65cm ball even though I'm only 5' 5\\".

This ball seems no different than most others i've seen and used. I'm about 210lbs and when i use the ball for any exercise that involves sitting on it or laying on it the ball changes shape temporarily. When i get off of the ball it's not a ball so much as an orb. it returns to a round shape but for being as sturdy as Go-Fit seems to claim this thing seems to be crap. I'd recommend looking for something that is actually heavy duty if that's what you're needing.

The ball already has a similiar white plug in place. There are NO instructions on how to get the ball inflated. The pump does not fit into where I assume to pump air into it.

I use it for workouts, and also my chair for at the desk. I find this to be a very sturdy ball. Inflating it was not very hard.

I didn't watch the included DVD as I'm not using this ball for exercise so I can't say if the DVD content is any good or not.

An article at the N Y Times said that according to a 2008 study, performing clerical work at a desk while sitting on an exercise ball burns about four more calories an hour than the same activity in a chair, or roughly only 30 extra calories in a typical workday. And a Dutch study found that the disadvantages, including spinal shrinkage, may outweigh any advantages. All I know is that my back and hip joints hurt after I used this, and the ball didn't work out as an office chair. It might be fine if you want it for other exercise, but that wasn't what I purchased it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good quality","review":"I bought this ball because of the cheap price.

I have had friends and family using it and not being exactly gentle! It has held up well. I reccommend following the height guidelines when you purchase your ball.

My back used to ache after a long day at the office sitting in my traditional chair. But with this ball, I feel more energized and can lean back on the ball periodically for an invigorating back stretch. Plus, I can take 5 minutes here and there to get in my daily crunches, push-ups and other exercises.

Where's the music?Some songs start, seem to have potential to develop into something, and then don't. Now, having said all that, there are a few worthwhile cuts, a couple that are quite good. So ultimately, if you like to have more music than incoherent mixes of various sounds, then you have simply to decide whether or not you're willing to pay $3 or $4 a cut.I'll admit: maybe I just don't get it, but if you can find a place to sample everything on this album I think you'll find I'm vindicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"soundtrack when you're on a bad trip!","review":"this is one of the worse band and album ive ever heard in my life. this stupid ambitious but pretentious album shows no signs of songwriting. even the open-minded people will be forced to close their minds to keep this trash out.

In fact, I purchased a copy for my brother since he is in the ministry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for enriching ministry.","review":"I am using the book \\"Lectures to my Students\\" by C. H. Spurgeon in my Homelitics class. Spurgeon's insights have enlarged my horizions as to how I read and analyse The Holy Scriptures. The book has enhanced my teaching greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny Print","review":"Seller did a great job getting this to me in a timely fashion, no complaints there; however, the text within the book is terribly small, looks like someone zoomed out and then printed all the pages, they don't even fill the page normally (2 inch margins on the left and right and 3-5 inch margins on the top and bottom). Was excited to get the book, but not very excited about the print size"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful teaching aid","review":"This is one of the most helpful books for teaching that I have found. Spurgeon is known as \\"Prince of Preachers\\" and he really is a great teacher. I an certanly thankful He left some of his work for us to use. His ancedotes are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AN ABRIGED EDITION - PLUS IN VERY SMALL PRINT","review":"This is an abriged edition (although it says unabriged in the product description) and the print is VERY small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content...Poor format","review":"These are great lectures by Spurgeon, but the format of the book is very poor. It is a photo reproduction of one of the original editions and the type is VERY small and hard to read. There are other editions, Eerdmans for example, that are much better for a similar price."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It is well-written, clear, comprehensive, interesting, and very insightful. I learned more from this one book than from two months worth of newspapers, magazines and TV news programs. I give it my highest recommendation, and encourage every American to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how textbooks should be written!","review":"Of the 5 books I own that explain Seismic Refraction principles, Professor Burger is the only one who took the time to walk you thru step-by-step on interpreting a Seismogram. That is the sign of a true teacher and an Author who's not afraid of a little extra effort to help his students practically apply the knowlege. I only wish I lived closer to attend his classes!I do agree with the others in that an IBM PC version of the diskettes is long overdue, but this book still gets my 5 star rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"The copy of the poster was a little larger than expected but I was able to make it work with my Japanese inspired room decor.

A lot of blah blah about things I cared nothing about. A relative of mine was Norma Baden Wallace who was known as the Last Madam and Queen of the Underworld. She wasn't mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I came across this book while on vacation in New Orleans. The book is extremely well put together and the historical photos interesting. The testimonies by the women involved in the life make the book hard to put down and make for more factual and better reading than any scholarly reasearch book on the topic. This is a must have for anyone interested in the topic or as a coffee table book."},{"rating":"2","title":"why is this out of print???","review":"I recently bought this book for my wife and had a terrible time finding it (and it was very expensive). She has loved John Masefield for who knows how long (since she was a child) and has shared favorite poems with me from this book. I have also read some of them and they are wonderful poetry and imaginitive enough for all aged readers and some powerful and beautiful enough to bring tears to myself. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the sea. I was lucky enough to find a nice hardcover with paintings that capture some of the sensations of the sea. Poems like \\"Sea Fever\\" are classics that frequently printed elsewhere (and quoted in a Star Trek movie :)), and it should be reprinted and made available in the United States where publishers seem unable to identify what American readers are intelligent enough to comprehend. Get this from the library if you do not feel like the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Pixies Ripoff","review":"The first time I heard this song, I would easily have given it 4 stars. Great music, decent vocals...in fact, I enjoyed it a great deal. The second time I heard this song, I thought, \\"Hmm...this sounds awfully familiar for some reason, but I'm not sure why.\\" The third time I played this song, I played \\"Caribou\\" by the Pixies immediately afterward and figured out where I had heard it before.This song is basically a melange of Pixies songs, primarily \\"Caribou,\\" grafted together and repackaged under this band's name. That said, there is nothing remotely innovative or even creative to be found here. Yes, it's a nice song, but it's basically been done already, and it's been done infinitely better.Please, I beg of you: Direct your funds to their rightful recipient by purchasing either \\"Come on Pilgrim\\" or \\"Wave of Mutilation.\\" Don't waste your time on this inferior knock-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it lasted...","review":"The device worked wonderfully when it worked.

Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery died after 1 month on this replacment headset","review":"Nice and samll but battery died on this replacment headset after 1 month, the first one died after 3 months.

I mean, it's nsync, everyone can tell (right?). Well, about this CD, I wouldn't reccomend it. If you're an nsync fan you HAVE all these songs. Although it is only five bucks, so if you like these songs but don't have their album it's worth it. Hope it helps. Don't you think it's weird though, nu stylz, nsync... weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I wasn't too happy when I got this book in the mail. It simply does not have very much material, even for a baby. All my granddaughters teach their children simple signing starting at a few months and pre-verbal signing is great for eliminating much of the frustration of not being able to express themselves, but it seems to me that the pictures in this book would be difficult for them to catch on to. Obviously, the adult would need to teach the signs but I don't think they would be able to recognize them from the pictures after they learned them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book for you and your little one","review":"This is great little book.

Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. \\"Grillz\\" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot.

If nelly was a fat guy with a gheri curl he wouldn't sell any albums, since he's a fair-skinned, muscle bound tool, he sells.

But, somehow, \\"Suit\\" tended to sell more than what \\"Sweat\\" could afford. So, to make the wrongs right again, Nelly felt that it was possible to rerelease the album and just make \\"one\\" whole album. Well, it is a little too late for that. 14 songs made the cut from both albums, which include \\"Over and Over\\", \\"My Place\\", \\"Heart of a Champion\\", and \\"Na-na-na\\". Along with these songs, are three brand new songs, including the hit single \\"Grillz\\" with Paul Wall, Big Gipp & Ali of St. Lunatics. However, even with these songs, it does not help with what has been damage already. This seems more as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" between the two albums. So, if you are debating which two albums to buy, either \\"Sweat\\" or \\"Suit\\", just buy this cd.

When will the zombies and sheep get tired of hearing the same song over and over and over again? Avoid this rehash of Sweat and suit as if it is a newly found strand of AIDS.

So, I called them and of course, \\"we're experiencing high call volume\\" I left a message and they called back and said that they would ship the part. It has been 2 weeks now and the part hasn't arrive. I called back at a WAY different time and of course, got the same \\"we're experiencing high call volume\\" my guess is that they have one person answering all calls. Anyway, I've been on hold for over 16 minutes - and counting. So, I now have a bike rack that I haven't been able to use for about a month now and it will likely be at least another week."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"Carries bikes alright. Would expect some better quality for a trunk bike rack >$140. Screws to hold arms in place are cheap plastic and strip out very easliy. There's some other small problems with the carrier.

Save your money and get a $60 rack that will work just as good but not be as pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"After shopping around and looking at recommended \\"Thule\\" and \\"Yakima\\" bike racks, I\\"m very happy to have purchased this \\"Saris\\" Bones 3 bike rack for so much less.Traveled over 50 miles at highway speed with no problems. Amazon offered the best price...local retail stores wanted 60 bucks more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Purchased this bike rack after visiting the Saris website and searching for a bike rack that could be used with a VW Beetle and Toyota 4Runner. The rack arrived in a timely manner but.........instructions were vague and hard to follow. My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to install the rack & 2 bicycles onto the 4Runner. We could get the rack on - tight & secure - but the weight of the bicycles caused the upper legs to pull away from the rear window. We finally gave up and returned the rack to Amazon. In addition, no way could the rack be used on the VW - straps and metal clips would have to be attached to glass which the instructions clearly said should not happen. I consider my husband & I to be reasonably intelligent but possible that there was something we failed to do????????A positive....Amazon paid for return shipping and credited my credit card - no questions asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"only works with straight top tubes","review":"great looking rack. folds up small enough to keep in the trunk.HOWEVER, it only works well for straight top tubes and pretty much eliminates anything except road bikes. top tube adapters do not work well with this rack.Does not work well with over-sized tubed bikes. Large tubes simply do not fit into the slots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw; ties tear along the sharp cylinder edge","review":"This rack is sturdy as long as it worked. I bought this rack just about 4 months ago. I had it mounted on my car all this time. There is a thin hard plastic ring with a very thin lip that goes on the inside of the cylinder to protect the nylon ties from rubbing and tearing at the edge of the cylinder, which is very sharp. So today the plastic ring cracked (probably from temperature drop to 60s over the last few days from 90s the week before) and one of the two main nylon ties, which clips to the back of the trunk lid of the car, tore by cutting along the edge of the cylinder. So I think this is a design flaw - either the plastic ring could have been thicker or the edges of the ridged cylinder could be smoother and not so razor sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic good, metal bad","review":"I love everything about the Saris Bones--especially the bright red that matches my car!--except the metal clamps that clip onto the trunk at 6 points. There's bound to be a better way to keep them from scratching the paint than my solution of wrapping them in Saran Wrap. Otherwise, it's easy to mount, holds the bikes securely, and did i mention it matches my car perfectly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"I like using it.

It's very easy to mount and the bikes have not fallen off! LOL It seems to be well made but it is expensive.

This is an excellent product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for full suspension bikes.","review":"The reviews in Amazon made me decide to buy this bike rack but now that I have it, it is obviously an over-rated product.The extending arms that hold the bike are thick especially towards the end which make it hard to fit a bike properly.I have a full suspension bike and even though I bought the extra bar to go between the seat and the handlebars, it is not very easy to put on and definitely doesn't feel safe (the bike is hanging by the seat which is not a fixed part.)The seat post strap is a nice feature but is also cumbersome.As far as the plastic, it's good to have the material of the rack softer than the bike so that in case of a bang you don't damage the bike.After using it for a few weeks I found that it is easier to put the bike on in reverse with the seat post strap towards the lower bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sari Bones is Good but it Takes the Paint off your car","review":"If you own a car that you don't care about the paint, then this bike mount is perfect for you. However, if you have a car that you would like to preserve your paint job, then invest in a trailer hitch mount. I personally like my mount but I'm giving it a 1 because it is really tough on the car's paint job. Especially where the 6 rubber tipped connectors attach to different parts of the body of the car. There is a lot of strain on the paint due to the weight of the bikes. The rubber feet on the top and bottom of the center of the device is great but it too will eventually harm your paint. Giving it a 1 because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Computer...Nice Screen","review":"Bad Computer................BLUE SCREEN MANIA.\\"BREATHES HEAVY\\"...........OVERALL.BAD COMPUTER....DONT DO IT TO YOUR SELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Fell alot on Beginner Trails","review":"After watching this video, I fell on Beginners trails.

I ordered the DVD of the historic 1955 telecast. Of course, I knew it was B & W. What I didn't know was the sound wasn't clear and many of the lyrics indistinguishable. Sometimes the music was too loud. The limitations of the stage, after viewing so many natural settings on TV of the past 60+ made many things stilted.

Now don't get me wrong... I love this opera and grew up watching it on tv as did many reviewers.. But I'm not wasting my money on a black and white early tv video. What I am hoping for is a DVD of the wonderful video filmed on location in Israel with Theresa Stratas as the mother. I saw this the first time on PBS circa 1979, and was able to find a video tape produced by VAI. However it is time for a release of that performance on DVD.

The original (1951)had Chet Allen as Amahl. This version has Bill McIver. I watched the Hallmark Hall of Fame each year as they showed this wonderful performance. I have been looking for a release of this version for years. This is close enough to the \\"original\\" to be collected. The sound and video quality are very good, especially considering what the telecast was like. I have no complaints. The story should be well known from the summary, later versions and the reviews. 50 years have not diminished the greatness and enjoyment of this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music is great","review":"Not a weak note in Menotti's score.

What a great surprise! Don't let the cover fool you. It is a quiet anime but without making you want to go to sleep. It has a fantasy side to it but in a realistic way (if that makes any sense to you). It's very emotional..so prepare yourself for that. I recommend having some kleenex around while watching this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding series","review":"The Air TV series is one of the greatest drama's I have ever seen.To say the character design, art, and story are memorable is an extreme understatement.The inclusion of the OVA episodes makes this an incredible value.As with all things, I strongly recommend watching it in it's original language (Japanese in this case)with English subtitles so that you can experience it the way the director intended.Overall: I strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys dramas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is one of my Favorite Animes.

I did at that time, just as I do now. The show seems to show a great importance in some parts, if not all of it. I could feel great emotion towards the scenes at the end of the story. It was that engaging.The only thing that I do not get is the complaint of a missing episode. After having read about it, I searched for it on You Tube and all I can say is that it would have made me lower my rating to a 4 out of 5 stars. We already get one episode that is kind of like a recap. Why should the audience have to suffer through seeing another recap?Overall, it has a great story and nothing seems to ruin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time!","review":"Okay, so I read the bio on the series and thought I would like this anime.

I had heard about it from a friend and looked it up here on amazon, it had enough good reviews for me and I decided to get it. I was very disapointed, the story line was good and the characters could ahve been interesting and fun, but there is just something about this book that made it VERY dificult for me to get through and even harder to really like. I felt no connection to the characters, and the romance between Jessex and Kirith Kirin was just.... it didnt seem real to me. I truely don't know what to say about this book. It wasnt my favorite but I cant say it is the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for me","review":"I look at the ratings and see 4 and 5 stars so I read the book.In the beginning of the book Jessex was an interesting character. He learns magic, and discovers he is really talented but then he falls in love with Kirith Kirin and oh by the way who is a man!

And Oh, is he ever perfect. Jessex has none of the frailty or humanity we've come to expect from even the cheapest dime-store fantasy novels. As a result, the book is a near complete loss...

This movie is very enjoyable even as a musical! But there's one big problem - it's a moral one. Bing Crosby goes for a beautiful lady who is betrothed to someone else. Why couldn't this beautiful lady not be \\"taken\\" in the storyline? This movie reminds me of \\"Titanic\\" by James Cameron, where Kate Winslet is to marry someone else but goes for Leonardo DiCaprio without breaking off the other engagement first, which would have been the right thing to do.

I never realized how many different expressions of Cottage Style there is. It helped me to fine tune the specific cottage style that was right for me. I personally was turned off by anything cutesy but found that cottage style needn't be cutesy at all...if you don't like that look. Nor does it have to look old and antiquey.

While Hitchcock managed a few decent movies, I think he was LARGELY overrated.The story is thin, attempted humor is more annoying than funny (as is Peter Lorre), in general the writing is bad and the acting not so great. Our war spies end up getting credit for a job they couldn't/didn't even do - they were pathetic and so was the whole setup which makes the USA look foolish and incompetent.

John Gielgud, from the Shakespearean stage, makes a worthy effort as does Madelline Carrol, who was in The 39 Steps as well. Peter Lorre, while a tad over-the-top and at some times irritating, is a joy to watch. The main villain is very smooth and a treat to watch as well. Comedic elements thrown in with tension and suspense makes Secret Agent a worthwhile Hitchcock film. From The Man Who Knew Too Much to The Lady Vanishes, Hitchcock could do no wrong.

Yes, dimbulb college morons get killed off in this (like about five thousand other slasher flicks) and some can act and some are just eye candy like in Hell Night, Halloween, Friday the 13th and a Nightmare on Elm Street. This one leans more toward Prom Night (1980) or Deadly Lessons, though, with its level of gore and characterizations. It IS shot on video (a high def camera, I believe, if the crisp image is any indication) but as any horrorhound knows this isn't necessarily a bad thing (The Ripper from 1985 remains the low bar here).

A definite must-read for fans of historical fiction and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story full of suprises!","review":"I've read and re-read (multiple times) everything Tobias Wolff has written and I think this book is the best. It has the narrative pacing of a suspense novel, with strange, funny yet very human characterizations. The writing is pristine clear. The primary theme is the percieved benefits of conformity by the main character and his undercurrent of resistence to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Tobias Wolff!","review":"A very short read, but full of emotion and great story.

They know a lot about it because they were there for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good book to read","review":"The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"Being from Long Island, I understand the story behind the US Open. I was also able to go to the Open on the Saturday and get a feel for the event. As such I really appreciated this book because it is hard to build such an event in the public course like Bethpage. It is a testament to the USGA on how organized they are and all of the event preplanning they do. I thought it was a different and insightful look at the Open"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the Open","review":"Mr. Feinstein is a gifted writer and storyteller. This is the story of a golf course, the championship it hosted and the people that made it happen. Mr. Feinstein follows the story of the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black Public Golf Course from idea to fruitition. He takes us behind the scenes and inside the ropes. It is a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR ( PUN INTENDED) DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, \\" Inside the Ropes\\", as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much extra crap","review":"He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst book yet...","review":"I bought this book anticipating another great read like: A Good Walk Spoiled. What I got, however, was every tiny, irrelevant detail about every person even remotely involved with the US Open. For example, do we really care that the superintendant's son played junior golf at... Or do we need 10-15 pages on the Shinnecock Indians and the 1995 US Open at Shinnecock? Or that the workers at Bethpage enjoyed eating sandwiches at BK Sweeney's??? Or that the guy who caddied for Tiger in his practice round was frome Ireland and his family, blah, blah, blah... Come on. It was just too much clutter and noise.This from an avid, single-digit handicapper, from Long Island, who played Bethpage Black and went to the Open on Friday in teh pouring rain!I had every reason to love this book, but instead threw it away. Save your money. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite a Good Walk Spoiled","review":"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. \\"Open\\" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inside look at the U.S. Open","review":"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love golf or just a great story","review":"What a book!!!

This is the more traditional squarish design rather than the nice widescreen-sized puzzles, of which I am becoming quite fond. That is the only reason I made this a four-star review rather than a five-star. The pieces on this one, while nice with a superb amount of variety in them, are average in size, making this puzzle fragile like typical puzzles once put together.The many different blues in this puzzle are incredible and really make this a very beautiful item. There was just the right amount of difference in the shades that it was not too hard to put together. The mix of gold shades in the wisemen and the camels stand out just enough in contrast to the blues.Very good puzzle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ulu, Live at the Wetlands Preserve NYC.","review":"Great CD.

I am an avid fan of Jazz-Funk Jambands, but this album, no matter how many times I hear it, just isn't that good. Most of the songs drone on one groove, go into space and lack inspired playing. The one high point of the record is SMB, which is really cool, I'll admit.

All the major pedigree breeds are identified and described with a short history of the breed, to help the prospective owner to decide which variety to choose, as well as the most important points to look out for. The magnificent color photographs capture the full spectrum of the beauty of cats, from the cuteness of the playful kitten to the splendor of champion show winners. It is a delightful read and a valuable reference source to the different breeds of cats. Highly recommended to all people owned by cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not a good choice for future mathematicians","review":"There are a lot of good calculus textbooks out there, and many of them are better, I think, than this one. I don't know whether the authors are trying to make calculus easy & interesting. The result is that students learn more how to use the machines than the subject--mathematics itself. Students talk more math than do math!! The authors seem to thoroughly go against the classics that emphasizes the \\"symbolic\\" approach more than \\"numerical and graphical\\". Sometimes new approaches should be encouraged but I personally believe that all should do to help the students grasp the materials and enhance their mathematical thoughts. This is a book that teaches you how to learn and teach calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives me a headache","review":"I am now taking calculus with this book. I don't know how people survived calculus with this book. This book is for someone who really has a grasp on calculus, not for beginners. The examples don't match the problems, so you're thoroughly confused and have nothing to look at to help you when you're doing homework. You get a headache literally just from trying to understand it. Calculus is hard enough and the authors make it harder to learn than it needs to be. I've had other calculus books that explain much better and have very thorough examples that I could understand and keep up with. This book does a very poor job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"I had this book for three terms of calculus, and it was a headache. For every one person who liked the book, there were fifty who didn't. The authors, in trying to take a \\"leaner, more conceptual approach\\" to calculus, thoroughly confuse. The chapters on series and sequences are impossible to understand, and no practical problems are included in them. A good textbook supplements the material presented in lecture, and this one certainly did not. To summarize: this book presents calculus in a way that makes it seem far, far more complicated than it really is. And, to top it off, this is an *experimental* textbook that has been around for years. Time to conclude the experiment; it failed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"This is the third calculus book I've had, and the only one I haven't understood. In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions. I imagine if one had a good calculus teacher this would be less of a problem.Basically this book taught me nothing more than to hate calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, but horrible context","review":"I praise Ostebee and Zorn for making an attempt to make calculus easy and for everyone. But I just don't think that is true. Calculus is a sophisticated form of mathematics and sometimes it needs to be taught with vocabulary and methods within the mathematics community and outside of everyday life. When you combine this with the usual high number of mistakes present in a first-edition book, a great deal of the phrase \\"we'll discuss/define this soon\\", excessive use of the graphing calculator, and some pretty lame jokes, you get a product that's not really worthy of being used in a college-level course."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is decent. It was a little overpriced for the quality though.","review":"I bought the book for college and it has served it's purpose. It is a good book. There is quite a bit of writing in it and some of the pages are bent and wrinkly, but it was a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely revised my way of learning math from a book!","review":"Ostebee and Zorn presented Calculus in a mind stimulating and reform way. No more copying examples out of the book because every problem is the same. This book makes you discover the methods and understanding. The basic understandings are provided, but the rest is up to you! I have never understood Calculus so thoroughly! I do not rate the book five stars, because of the unreliable solutions manual. The book is geared toward user discovery, so the solutions in the manual need to be CORRECT in order for the user to benefit the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely wonderful!","review":"I loved this book as well as all of C.W.

However, what I found special about this one is that it is very realistic. The characters and the situations in the novel makes you feel this happened in real life. The book is about the summer romance between two teenagers: Brenda Patimkin (one rich girl) and Neil Klugman (a poor boy). Neil sees her for the first time swiming in a pool, and falls in love with her. After that, they begin to love each other romantically; but after awhile they start having problems with each other, which will make you wonder if they'll stay together as a couple (but that's for you to read.) I'd say it is an entertaining book; it has funny parts, sad parts, happy and romantic. I haven't read other Roth novels, but this one is very good written. If you enjoy realistic novels, then it's a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected.

Dinosaurs whose only behavior is maniacal attack, even in the case of some herbovores. Prehistoric men who operate pretty much on the same level - savages just gotta be savage, after all. A paleontologist who travels back to the time of the dinosaur and collects no data - mostly just shoots things. Only one female character, who is mostly only happy when she does something to please the male heros. People who make bizarre choices apparantly only because the plot needs them to. No character development, clumsy writing, sloppy editting.Actually, Lester Del Rey didn't even write this. Someone else wrote it to his outline.There was good science fiction written in 1966, but is probably a example of why science fiction used to have such a crummy reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love SB","review":"It's a fun movie that involves SpongeBob...kids LOVE.

But It is quite annoying. The show was fine. But a MOVIE?!? I would rather watch a 24/7 marathon of Telatubies! The only person in SpongeBob Squarepants that is even remotely funny is Patrick Star!And like every other movie based off of a show, when you return to the show, THEY ACT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED!

The big movie of the hilarious TV series, it's The Spongbob Squarepants Movie! Spongbob and Patrick are on a mission to save King Neptunne's crown, and they travel a long long way. Despite my two stars, the move has it's moments when you laugh and giggle. But the movie lost the essance of the series: It wasn't that funny.Spongebob was the icon of goody-goodness-fun. But then the movie is a huge letdown and there should be a sequel to imrpove the series.The funny moments are when Patrick falls in love with the mermaid, (I think her name was Cyndi?) and he's like 'Your Pretty!' Same old Patrick, the character that stays consistent.Movie is worth a rent.

Full Screen crops the theatrical picture to 4:3 ratio which is the shape of a standard (non-widescreen) TV screen. There is no letterboxing, but up to a third of the original picture is lost. WIDESCREEN preserves the original theatrical picture ratio of the film which will appear in \\"letterboxed\\" format on a normal TV screen.

I saw this movie when it came out in theatres with a fellow Spongebob freak. Gosh, we were like 15 and we did not even care.That being said, I did not care for this movie. The writers make great 12-minute episodes, but apparently nothing good comes from trying to make longer plots. It also has some disturbing parts for younger kids, so I don't even let my niece watch it when it comes on TV. She's a big fan of the episodes as well.All in all, stick with the original shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'D GIVE IT A MILLION STARS IF I COULD","review":"THIS MOVIE IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE SHOW BECAUSE IT'S LOTS LONGER THAN JUST 30 MINITES.

I also recommend this for anyone who loves Spongebob (and Patrick), who loves silly, but sometimes, twisted comedy, or someone who just wants to have a good time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rent before considering buying","review":"I am disappointed in the movie. My advice would rent first to see if you truly want this one in your collection or rapidly repeatly watched over by the little ones.The movie had a few funny parts but off beat to the clean crazy humor the show is so loved for by adults and children. Some how seeing Patrick in a pair of net stockings and high heels sort of ruins the image of cool to dearly sad way of getting a laugh, if someone finds that funny. I find the rest of the movie following suit to a lower level of humor where I think they either were trying to hard that they missed the boat or maybe not trying hard enough that the boat is a sinking ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorb the fun!","review":"This movie was so funny!

This was an enjoyable, but not exceptional DVD. Around here the measure of a DVD is the encore factor. If they don't play the hell of of it, it isn't all that. (Doesn't explain El Dorado, that gets played far more often than it deserves.) It hasn't been played a second time, even by my 7 year old who watches SB every day. I wouldn't waste the cash on this one, you'll get more enjoyment out of the endless re-runs they play on Nick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Preparation Material for the Money","review":"For those folks already familiar with SQL Server, this book will fill-in any obvious knowledge gaps when preparing for the exam. It's like the related MSCE Training Kits in that it covers all the required topics, but with less detailed discussions and lab practices. It also costs less and demands less study time to complete.If you don't know SQL Server and T-SQL quite well this book will not help you pass the 70-229 exam. For example, while the included practice test will get you in the right mind set it does not drill you nearly enough on how to write sound stored procedures, triggers, and cursors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for prep material!!","review":"Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229.

Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Accurate","review":"I had thought that this book and the sample Exam on the CD would be a realy close reflection of the exam content. But whan I took the exam, it didn't seem like that was the case. The book and sample exam seemed to focus on Admin. stuff while the exam seemed to emphasize SQL, TSQL and database design a lot more. I also don't think the book prepares you for security-related questions very well. But it might still be worthwhile for someone who feels ready to take the exam and just wants some practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, too little practical information","review":"This book has two main flaws that caused me to abandon it after the first few chapters.First, it spends an inordinate amount of time on theory, compared to giving practical examples.Second (and a truly fatal flaw) is that during the course of the book, the reader is directed to build a database that is essential to reading the following chapters. The reader is encouraged to think theoretically about the general structure of the database, but is given no specifics. Yet specifics are exactly what the later chapters require! If the reader follows the directions, it will become necessary to make numerous structure changes later.Worse yet, the \\"correct\\" database is not included on the CD, nor is it available online. That makes it impossible for the more advanced user to skip chapters that he doesn't need.This book has become one of my more expensive doorstops."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book is an incomplete mess.Throughout the book there are sample questions to \\"quiz\\" the reader on the material. BEWARE! many of the answers in the book are wrong.For the harder topics this isn't even a guide at all. Only a list of study points.The CD with practice questions repeats many of the questions in the book and had incorrect answers.A good replacement for this book is a brick wall. Stare at it and you will acheive the same results as reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 126 questions !!!","review":"There are 6 domains and 20 objective, in those 6 domains, of Exam, so count how many questions are per domain (6!!!). Some topics have only 3 questions, and on Exam you will get 3 or more questions from that objective.Before every domain there is list of articles (Training Kit + Books Online) to read for that domain, and every time they write how to start Books Online (klik Start menu, Programs, etc.) 3 - 4 line for somebody that goes on 70-229!!!.1/4 (to 1/3) of almost every page is unused (empty).If 2 or more answers are wrong for the same reason, they will repeat explanation, several lines, again and again.Some questions are for total begginers, and for some you need a lot of expirience.During my web exam expirience I noticed that questions are a little bit easier than the most on the Internet.So if you are total begginer and you have extra money, buy it, but for expirienced people I recomend something like www.certportal.com or other web sites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much help...","review":"Having passed the SQL Server 6.5 exam, I didn't even find this much help as a review or prep for SQL 2000...

After reading The Six Sigma Way, you'll probably be ready to jump out of your chair and immediately follow in these companies' footsteps by launching a Six Sigma initiative of your own. The authors, three consultants who teach firms to implement Six Sigma efforts, convincingly extol the money-saving and efficiency-enhancing virtues of the holistic approach. This book offers a lot of jargon and complex concepts, but the material is presented in easily understood charts and lists, and there are plenty of concrete examples. We [...] recommend The Six Sigma Way to managers who have heard wondrous tales of Six Sigma, but would like a more down-to-earth explanation of how it can be used and the benefits it offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive introduction to the subject","review":"For those who want a clear, concise (if not comprehensive) introduction to Six Sigma, this is the place to start. The authors offer an enticing glimpse into the real-world application of Six Sigma tools and techniques. While not to be considered the be-all, end-all (see authors like Breyfogle or Pyzdek for that), The Six Sigma Way is the book to read if you're contemplating a Six Sigma effort and need fundamental knowledge, a starting point for more thorough treatment of the subject (which can be daunting in its comprehensiveness). Highly recommended, especially with the companion guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"No Joke. A serious six-sigma book written in most elegant form. I like the part where the Authors provide insights into \\"Sir Pork\\" - a really good way to put serious stuffs into readable form. Ignore the stars.

In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Six Sigma Way","review":"The book was very easy to follow. I found it especially helpful that the Six Sigma Way gave tips as to which chapters should be read for each level of Six Sigma implementation. Since my company already had it implemented and I was only reading the book for an understanding of what my company was doing, I was able to skip the unneeded portions about implementation. This was a big time saver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time with this book!","review":"This book will tell you that six sigma is an excellent quality improvement program, (You probably heard this already) yet authors won't equip reader with the tools that six sigma offers. I read this book twice with a strong desire to understand the principles of the six sigma, but after reading it cover to cover twice I got nowhere.I like to read, and through the years I read a lot of books, but consider this to be the worst business book I read so far! Jack Welch, in his book Winning (which I strongly recommend) dedicates one short chapter to Six sigma, and it covers everything you will learn from this book. This book offers no substance what's so ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook is a waste of time","review":"Bought this audiobook to pass the time on a long car trip. I have never seen so-little useful information stretched to fill so much time. It is written in such boring language that I don't know how the reader stayed awake while recording it for audio. Maybe the paper book version has some diagrams or charts to give form and substance to the information, but the audiobook is like a poorly-done PowerPoint presentation without the slides. It's just a sad collection of redundant bullet-point generalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horridly boring.","review":"More power to you if you can get something worthwile from this book. I bought the book on CD, and it was easily the most forgettable experience I've had in a while. The information is presented from a 30,000 mile view. So \\"big picture\\" oriented that it's useless to try and consider the action behind the concepts presented.If you're looking for a way to appear to have read something complicated and high level about Six Sigma. you found your source. If you want real, usable information, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense branded and packaged as esoteric knowledge.","review":"I was amazed at how a book full of nothing new could be sold as if it contains some secret knowledge that only the initiated could comprehend (you know, like that Kung Fu martial arts stuff...take the pebble grasshopper).What it comes down to is an organized approach to identifying, measuring, and improving business processes. This is something I imagine has been going on long before anyone called it \\"Six Sigma\\".So, if you must have this book how about cutting the cost of acquisition to three bucks or so plus shipping and get a used copy to see if this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This book is a must have for anyone that uses Six Sigma, is learning Six Sigma, or wants to advance their Quality career.This book gives insight into the \\"why\\". Why Six Sigma is being implemented, Why it's so \\"hot\\", Why it can turn any company around, and Why it's better than TQM.While the book is mainly aimed at those in leadership positions, I believe that anyone that has a thirst for knowledge on Six Sigma should pick up this book. For those of you who need to implement Six Sigma buy it in conjunction with The Six Sigma Way Team Field Book. Everything you ever wanted to know about Six Sigma can be found in these two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the case","review":"I've had this case for a few months now and still love it. I used the bottom DVD slot for my DVD burner and used the top slot to wrap all the excess cables from the power supply. Keeps the inside of the case clean and simple with good air flow.

When the box arrived I was stunned at how big this box was, I guess in my mind I pictured it a bit smaller. It's about the size of a toaster oven. There is definitely a certain order in which the parts need to be assembled. I would suggest you pick up a modular power supply because cable management in this not so little guy is a royal pain.It keeps very cool inside thanks to a well done air flow design, but the stock fans are loud, very loud, and can be distracting, replace them for ones you can actually control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for Pet Lovers","review":"As a dog owner, I immensely enjoyed the stories Mr. Herriot shared.Along with his skill as a vet,he shows a great heart.Anyone so caring and tender with animals is truly a decent human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am an avid dog lover.

The authors heartfelt emotions can be felt on every page. He clearly adored the animals he cared for over the decades. He described the colorful European countryside, the diverse pets, and the people who owned them in fine detail. Each story is accompanied by an ink sketch that added some warm visuals. My favorite stories were of \\"Tricki Woo\\", \\"Judy The Nurse Dog\\", \\"Granville Bennett\\", and \\"Cigar.\\" What was nice is that since the stories were broken up, you could not lose your place when you took a break. Yet, I only took one because this was a fast page turner. I have had several dogs in my life and these are the most honest depictions of dog behavior I have read thus far. All animal lovers will enjoy this. Time to hug my dog and adopt another."},{"rating":"2","title":"short but delightful...","review":"James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories is a short but delightful book written by the world famous veterinarian. It is beautifully illustrated by Lesley Holmes.This book consists of ten stories from Herriot's previous books that feature dogs that he has treated over the years. It's difficult to pick a favorite as they all have amazing personalities. There is Brandy, who is such a scrounger that he gets his tongue stuck in tin cans that he digs out of the trash can. TrickiWoo, a Pekingese, picks winning horses at the races. And Gyp, an epileptic sheepdog, only barked once in his entire life. Although all the dogs have special characteristics, it is obvious that it would take a veterinarian with compassion and humor to see that these animals are more than just pets.I truly enjoyed Favorite Dogs Stories. However, if you've already read Herriot's other books (which I haven't), you will find that they're repeats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful and Warm","review":"This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while because I passed it over for other newer books...

I am basing this review on the quality of the piece.When shredding cabbage, one must realize that the cabbage will contain some moisture. There is no protective finish on this slicer to repel moisture or keep it in good order when cleaning with soap and water. Also, when I tried out the sliding box that holds the cabbage, there was an area that the box would not readily slide through. Upon further investigation I found the base of the slicer was warped, where two diagonally opposite sides were not on the same plane as the other two sides. In essence, it was a rocking horse.It seems to me that before this thing leaves the manufacturer, someone should be checking the product.Very poor workmanship and quality even though a close grained wood was used in its production.I am presently warping this thing in the opposite direction before I apply a clear epoxy paint finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharisee bashing","review":"Excellent book. Lawrence is the only writer I know of who was able to trace the priggish type of American back to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day. Well, Lawrence gives him a perfectly-placed kick: check it out.All of these essays are thoughtful, funny, and insightful. Lawrence has a unique way of grasping the undercurrents of works of fiction, and many of his most surprising assertions ring true upon reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always interesting but often wrong","review":"This passionate brief survey of American Literature contains much spontaneous flowing masterful and original writing. Lawrence famous 'Trust the teller not the tale' is the motto of the work. It argues that the true creative work takes on a life of its own that even its creator cannot completely define and control.Perhaps the most famous essay in this book is Lawrence's hatchet- job of Ben Franklin who he found to be a spiteful, penny- pinching, calculating dead soul. In fact old Ben could be in certain places as lively and probably more lively than Lawrence himself.What however is most important is that Lawrence in this work understands the great subterranean and mysterious genius of a kindred spirit for him, the literary creator of the Great White Whale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"The statue pictured is not what the recipient got!

I've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders, but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over, while still remaining snug against the skin.

Michael Jackson and Prince influenced by James Brown and Stevie Wonder, John Lennon by Chuck Berry and Elvis Costello, David Bowie by The Beatles, Madonna by Debbie Harry, it goes on and on... SO WHAT! That's why music evolves and progresses!And lets face it, its not as if the charts are cluttered with outstanding artists these days, therefore you can't be too critical when something as solid as this comes along, especially when the only alternatives are bland horrors like the hideous Coldplay or the frankly lousy 50cent.

Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh...the beginning to it all...","review":"\\"Definitely Maybe\\" is simply definitely (no maybe) a great album! The songs are good, and only the beginning to what will become the Oasis sound. Songs ranging from the loud and proud, \\"Supersonic\\" to the quaint ditty \\"Digsby's Dinner\\", to the infectious (and my personal favorite) \\"Columbia\\". This is really a very good album, not even considering the fact that it's a debut. It is not anything like the critics say : a carbon copy of pre-Brit rockers The Beatles, Rolling Stones, or David Bowie. Comparisons could be made that they're all British and play guitars... I mean really... it's not like they just rehash the same stuff! This album is well done musically and delivers the unmistakable vocals of that Brit Brat Liam Gallagher. Simply a great album to have if you want to hear some snappy music that isn't always about angst, but isn't candy either...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply, the best album they've ever released","review":"Possibly the best album to come out of Britain in the 1990s, and definitely Oasis' best work to date \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is admittedly brash and raw, but is as of yet the only album to even come near to showing Oasis' true potential.The high points are the thumping opener, \\"Rock 'n Roll Star\\", the tenderness of \\"Slide Away\\", and the majestic anthem that is \\"Live Forever\\", but the album is undeniably a classic in its entirety.If you like Oasis, buy it. (If you haven't already bought it.) If not, buy it anyway. It shows that there's more to Oasis than limpid \\"ballads\\" and sub-standard Beatles rip-offs.Make no mistake, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is the finest album Oasis have ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a Cd to own.","review":"From the first time I heard Liam belt out \\"Live Forever\\", I was hooked. This CD really ushered in britpop as we all know it, and defined the middle part of the last decade. Some five years on, it's a CD that is standing up beautifully. Definitely Maybe is full of raw energy and punk attitude all the way through. Classic tracks like Live Forever, Slide Away, and Supersonic, are instantly catchy and powerful. I also really love the gem, \\"Married With Children\\", (about the only soft song on the disc). Like them or not, the Oasis boys really made one hell of a rock record. The disc is full of past styles and refences, not just the Beatles, but a bit of the Stones, T-Rex, and The Sex Pistols for good measure. This cd is Definitely one of the decade's best. No if's, and's, or maybe's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendant","review":"Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll. This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe.

Must listen tracks on this album are \\"Live Forever\\" \\"Supersonic\\" and \\"Slide Away\\". What's pleasing about this record is that it is raw and captures a band in a live like sound.

Its the kind of album from top to bottom that puts a hop in your step and has you humming all day long. The most amazing thing about this band is that I have yet to hear a bad song. Noel has a gift and with Liam's vocals its a deadly combination. Live forever,Supersonic,Columbia,Up in the sky,Slide away, I mean the list goes on and on, brilliant is an understatment.

With all the junk bands around today like Third Eye Blind, NSync, and Metallica it's good to know that there is at least one band around that is truly dedicated to rock and roll. It's too bad that Oasis has had such mediocre success in the U.S. I just can't stand to listen to the radio anymore. I can't name even one good band in the U.S. It seems to me that all the best music is made in Europe. Great bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and now Oasis have all come out of Europe. Well enough with my ramblings. If you want a cd that will stick to your cd player indefinitely buy Definitely Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best from Oasis","review":"What else is there to say? Before all the commercial success, unnecessary hype and unhealthy agitation around the band, this little gem rocked my stereo. Much less Beatles-influenced than their second album this one is also much more electric, filled with Noel's pentatonic solos, repetitive but fun, and cool seventies-sounding riffs. Anyhow, in my opinion, Oasis hasn't been able to surpass this LP yet and probably won't ever be able to. Start your collection here."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time","review":"If you're gonna buy an Oasis record or any for that matter, this is a great one to get. Every song is catchy as hell. Just great pop rock songs. Noel Gallagher is one of the best songwriters ever. Liam's voice is awesome the whole way through, and you'll find you can't get the songs out of your head.

In 1994 (has it leen that long??) they loaded, locked and rocked all over the world on their debut.The album opens with \\"Rock N Roll Star,\\" a ballsy rocker that is all throttle, and it never lets up. \\"Live Forever\\" was the lead single from the album and it's easy to hear why. The vocal melody is sweeter than cotton candy, while the music is both soaring (in the chorus) and rocking (in the closing 1:30.) The sneering vocals on \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" are teriffic.\\"Digsy's Diner\\" swaggers with a fuzzed guitar and jazzy piano and the balladeering on \\"Slide Away\\" offers brief respite from the all-out rocking taking place around it.This album is available in used stores throughout the country, making sure that you have no excuse for not owning this CD. To paraphrase Nike, \\"Just Buy It.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album that Saved Rock","review":"Up until 2005- this album has stood as the quintessetial Oasis CD. The songs are solid throughout and delivered with a very real swagger. This CD announced that straight ahead rock was still a viable music form just when rap and grunge and rap/metal seemed poised to make \\"regular\\" rock n roll disappear forever. The Gallaghers are characters and their sniping at other bands through the years has been entertaining (and most times they are right). You gotta love the \\"who gives a @#$%!\\" attitude from these guys.This cd is loaded with great songs, live forever, supersonic, up in the sky being the highlights.

Yeah, and the Dave Clark 5 are better than the Beatles, Diabelli is better than Mozart, Cherubini is better than Beethoven, Def Leppard is better than the Rolling Stones, and Oasis is better than ANYONE that ever made a rock album. Give me a break. It is listenable. That is about all you can say positive about it. I could say a lot that is negative, but what's the point?

Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed.

In a world populated by \\"fluff\\" novels and mass-production sequels it's refreshing to see an author returning to the pure simplicity of short story. He has shown us that humor is truly the side-kick of love with his zest for character development and raw dialogue. Whether you are reading about his immortal samurai warrior, a lovestruck dog pining for a cat, or bittersweet realities of \\"laundry room romance\\" the author pulls you in with believable snippets of wit and charm.Truly, a voice of our time, owning \\"Love Hurts...\\" is an asset to any book collection.

There are some really good stories in it, some that really made me say, wow, who is this new guy. But then there are other stories where I wonder agin, who is this guy (but in a weirded out way). I really liked the comedy stories, The Art of Romance, and How To Make A Man Cuddle were pure genius, I literally laughed out loud. Some of the sad stories are a bit schmaltzy, but decent. The one I didn't really care for was Bunjiro. NOt that it was a bad story, I just think that he needed to make this its own seperate book.

I continue to get the impression that some people suffer from being overly enamoured with the author or the concept of T4A, and thus lose sight of the fact that this book is really a lot of fluffy stuff wrapped around four lines of text. Honestly, the Four Agreements are wonderful points to live by, and I do every day.

It is well built and has protected my TX from damage. The Palm fits snugly and the case closes securely. The memory card slots are a nice touch, and the openings allow for access to all ports without opening the case.I can't comment on the sturdiness of the belt clip. I took it off the first day, as I usually carry my Palm in my shirt pocket.Cons: The case is very slippery so I stuck on some 3M non-skid strips to keep it from slipping out of my hand.I also wish the front cover opened and folded over the back, rather than just over 180 degrees.You have to watch the hinge pin, as it has a tendency to work its way out.I consider these to be minor shortcomings and I would recommend this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN!!!, RUN FAR AWAY!!!!","review":"I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm TX Armor case is okay but...","review":"The case is attractive, built like a tank, and the Palm TX fits easily and snugly inside. Though reasonably slim, naturally it does take up more space in your pocket. Since it's hinged like a book, you end up holding it like one- on your lap or a table. You can't leave it in the case if you use an after market cradle to charge/synch your Palm TX. Though the original Palm TX cover is rather skimpy, think of it as a bikini i.e. comfortable & covers the basics. The Armor case might be better for travel and rough environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protective armor case, better than the original case.","review":"I think that it simply does what the manufacturer says it does, which is to protect the Palm, and in my case I've found that it is so. I use my Palm in my pants pockets, and I like the fact that it does not get scratches at all, like the Palm original aluminum case. It does not rattle the Palm because it fits snuggly, unlike the original case. It has a back opening for the tiny speaker, so I think you can hear alarms louder. I've used mine for a month and I haven't have any problem with the plastic hinges that others described. It is somewhat difficult to open, though, that's why I give it 4 stars. You can charge and synch the Palm without open this case, unlike the original one. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw","review":"Bought two of these and it always breaks in the same place after several months of use, if not sooner. Other reviewers have had the same experience. The problem lies with the plastic slide where you attach your Palm. It is flimsy and not detailed properly re. interface with the metal case itself. It invariably breaks after several openings/closings, if not before. I had a Rhino case before on another Palm and it looks as if I will have to try that or a leather one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case, has slots for media cards but...","review":"I've had this case for close to a year now and had no problems with it up until 2 months ago when I noticed one of the plastic hinges that attaches the Palm to the case snapped off, the remaining intact hinge has held up for about 2 months so far. The clasp has been fine and holds the case firmly shut, great access to all buttons and slots. I would have given it 5 stars but the hinge broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to open.","review":"Looks great and very sturdy, unfortunately is not very easy to pry open. If you need to open it constantly during the day, not a smooth process."},{"rating":"1","title":"case closed NOT!","review":"Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open.

It was easier to just carry the Palm TX without the cover. This was more of obstacle than protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend it","review":"I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the Palm TX","review":"I just got the newest version of the Palm TX--and I'm not sure if they've changed the dimensions or anything--but this case does not close when I put my Palm TX in it. That's right, it doesn't work with the new TX. There is a small piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the palm in the case, but this is preventing the case from closing because the palm is too large.FYI. I will probably keep the product and just break off the little piece of plastic. But just so you know, don't buy this hardcase if you're getting a NEW Palm TX (with wi-fi and such)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protection","review":"The case provides great protection for my Palm TX.

I'm pretty tough on things and this case is just the extra protection I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"lose the belt clip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip. It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat. This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well. It flops and swirls around. Otherwise, the case would be fine. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent case","review":"This is a very nice looking case. The PDA fits snugly and doesnt slide around. The latch on my case seems very secure and takes some effort to open. As far as the button style swivel belt clip, I have never seen one that works well and Ive had them on various phones and pda cases. I dont rely on them.The main thing I dislike about this case is that it opens to the left, not the right like other cases Im used to. A minor thing that I can get used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This case is not worth the money. The first problem was with the screw that hold the belt clip would not stay in the case. I glued that in place. Then the clip would not hold onto the case. Then the belt clip broke. The last thing was that slide that holds the Palm in the case broke. I would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. Look elsewhere!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit","review":"The case looks really nice and seems well made. But I never used it because the case seems backward for my TX. While the TX fits well into it, I can't access the stylus or the ports for synching and charging. If I put it in backwards the stylus and ports are accessible but I can't see the screen when I open it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying something new but really cool","review":"I thought their last effort was kinda soft and lacked enought thought to be a good CD. So I was hoping this one would do the trick. GREAT CD!! They sort of stray from the Heavy guitar sound that carried them in earlier efforts and go for a Dream Theatre keyboard/sound with heavy guitar. I personally think the keyboard addition gives the sound a little more melody and adds some spice. As for the previous reviewers comments on no melody within the choruses or songs, I didn't find it to be true. This is a solid CD with some minor changes that any power/melodic METAL fan will love!! I found it to be a back to the basics CD. everything is simple and to the point! Sometimes you just need a catchy riff some solid drums and a good tune. This CD delivers that.

I found his interpretations to be a bit far reaching, and at times absurd. Reed often goes on into his own \\"poetic\\" rantings and all too often describes what he see's to be comparisons between his own life and that of Rimbaud. I had to force myself to finish this book.

It's still worth a look if you're in a demonic possession mood but it's more Italian devil scandal than Exorcist.Maybe in the 70's it was a good Exorcist-copy film but not now, now it's just late '70's shoddy devil madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Piano Man's piano","review":"The song selection from these three cds is excellent.What a steal to get three of Billy's cds for less than four bucks!Yes, his Russia tour was precedent setting at the time.

But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England.

But Kit is completely unprepared for the ways of these people. Even so, she manages to grow in unimaginable ways as she connects with people with whom she would have never seen herself.And it's not a simple moralistic book. It's a book about a girl coming of age. Unlike other books of the Puritans, there are no villains, just those who are different and it's amazing to see Kit come to understand that.The characters are entrancing and dimensional, the setting is described in an honest prose that only shows Speare's love of New England.It deserves its Newberry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackbird Pond","review":"I read this great, great story as a kid, and I'm not sure I've ever learned more from one book.At that age, seeing the protagonist (a good girl!) consider marrying for social reasons, not romantic ones, was revolutionary for me. This portrait of the English colonies, the Puritans, the tropical plantations, the slavery, the daily life in 1600s New Hampshire were a very entertaining education.This book is a little girly.

It was even better because as an adult I can see some of the most important themes of the book that weren't evident to a child. Tolerance and acceptance are perhaps the biggest lessons of all to take away from it. Independence is another.

Kit fits fits perfectly into the time period without becoming one of those overly sugary \\"porceline dolls\\" which is what happens to many of the characters in all kinds of historical fiction because the author is not quite sure how the characters of the past should react. It's interesting to watch as Kit tries to fit into her surroundings, but then finds out she can't. She is who she is, and would be who she is. So soon she learns a way out of the suffering of being different but has another problem--her unique character and \\"evil\\" way of dressing lead the people of her town to believe she's a witch. Now she must rely one the people she trusts most to save her, and hope that some of the people she found hopelessly mistrustful of her would find a way to forgive for being different."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"Orphaned Kit Tyler feels trapped in the bleak shores of Connecticut Colony.

Soon she meets a Puritan woman named Hanna who is said to be the Witch of Blackbird Pond. But thier friendship is soon discoverd and Kit finds herself being acused of witch-craft.

The ending is good but I struggled to get through the middle"},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG and DULL","review":"witch of blackbird pond is a very well written book. it goes into much depth about certain things, however, i feel that is one of the reasons it is only a 2 star book. this book tells a story about a girl who moves into america before the revolutionary war. she has to saty with her only remaining relatives, who do not share the same points of veiw as she, kit tyler, does. kit is acused of being a witch but in the end can not be proven of her suspected withcraft. this book, yet well described, is streched out over to many pages. a lot of unesscesary things go on that one should not need to know. witch of blackbird pond has no real point to me and is a LONG and DULL book"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch that wasn't!","review":"I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book ever","review":"I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read.

She is disappointed by what she finds when she steps of the ship. From the very beginning the people of the village are suspicious of Kit because of her unconventional ways and style of dress. Kit would constantly walk alone in the woods, where she met Hannah, who is known in the village as the \\"witch of Blackbird Pond\\". Kit and Hannah become friends, which cause the villagers to believe that they are both practicing witchcraft. Then Kit begins to teach Prudence, a young girl from the village, to read. Soon Kit finds herself being put on trail. Throughout her ordeal kit comes to know and accept herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Novel","review":"In my opinion, the conflicts are well formed and the story line is basically flowing. However, there are too many political arguments that make the story boring. This book is also rather predictable, as the reader can guess what will happen next. I think that a strengthening of the plot in certain areas would make the book more enjoyable. While some parts are breathtaking, other parts are sappy and uninteresting. I'd reccomend this type of book to those who don't mind a political conflict now and then, who like romance and history, and who want to have a look back in time at what life was like back then. I sort of liked the novel, and then sort of didn't, for all of the reasons mentioned here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only a page turner but a lesson teacher too!","review":"I recommend this book to everyone:children, young adults and adults.

With Hannah Tupper, Kit can let go and speak her real feelings. She feels almost as happy as she did back in Barbados. And she cannot understand why everyone is so misunderstanding towards Hannah Tupper.So when Kit's new family warns her to stay away from Hannah Tupper, to avoid trouble from the rest of the town, Kit ignores them. Unfortunately, her friendship with the so-called witch is discovered. And Kit is also accused of witchcraft!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TWOBP is an excellent book","review":"TWOBP (The Witch of Blackbird Pond) is one of the most exciting and riveting books I have ever read, right up there with NUMBER THE STARS, A WRINKLE IN TIME, and my other favorites. This book is beautiful and touching. You can read the plot synopsis above, but I wanted to add my opinions. I've read about these \\"witch hunts\\". No wonder they suspected Hannah Tupper. No, not because she had a broomstick or cast spells on people, but because she was a Quaker, and she wasn't like the Puritans. And different scares people. The lonely old woman lives by the swamp because she loves the Meadows. She doesn't go to \\"Meeting\\", so they make her pay fines. And then, one chilly night...but you'll have to find that out yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story was a awsome story.","review":"I would stay up til 1:00 am on school nights reading this book! The charactors were intresting, and sounded like people I would love to meet! When Kit helped Hannah escape I was amazed that she did that! When Mathew stood up for Kit I could tell that he realy did love her even though he never realy showed it. The whole story was good! I liked the way Kit amazed the people on the boat when she jumped over board to get the little girl's doll. I think beginning, middle, and end were all well done. I would recomend this book to every one! I consider this one of the best books of the centry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!

I now teach Early American Literature, and I really appreciate these books that give my students a sense of place. We've been using Kathleen Kent's The Heretic's Daughter, but The Witch of Blackbird Pond tells just about the same story with more accessible content. It's certainly just as appropriate for adults as for young people.The story moves at a quick pace and gives a realistic sense of setting. It covers themes from the time period such as religious intolerance, hypocrisy, the slave debate, fear of outsiders.I highly recommend this reading for anyone interested in late 1600s Early America. Read it on your way to visit historic Salem, Mass."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic!","review":"I read this in high school and loved it.

The basic plot was fine, but the thing was like a soap opera, where everyone was with the wrong person, and of course, everyone was ever so happy at the end. I would have found this a more enjoyable book if the ending had been Kit marrying Willam, Judith becoming an old maid, and Nat marrying someone else. (Still John with Mercy though, because they deserve it.)The reason I gave this two stars is that readers 8-10 would probably enjoy this, but if you're a teenager or even an older preteen, I wouldn't recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one good book","review":"I've heard from alot of people how boring this book was. For me it was ok. I love the plot but the whole setting in the 1600s was what I didn't like, and one chapter was all dedicated to some political guy, I didn't like that either.

It is so boring! Basiclly, this girl is moving from some island to Conneticut in the 1600's, and the storyline basiclly follows all the random boring things she does day to day, even when there could be action, it is still boring. Only read this if you have trouble falling asleep. There is hardly any magic or anything like that at all, as said by the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond","review":"I am very disapointed that my teacher chose this book for my class to read. I feel it was very dull and boring, with nothing to keep the reader attentive. Throughout the entire book, there were no exciting scenes (there was one situation where the author could have made an exciting moment, but instead decided to turn it into a section of tasteless humor) and many of the chapters were about relationships between characters which were not explained enough to be interesting, or the various chores and jobs that the main character, Kit, did.I know there are many readers who enjoyed this book, but I personally do not like books who just tell the lives of someone unless there are some exciting events. Too many of the chapters of this book were wasted on petty happenings such as washing clothes or teaching someone to read. If you are looking for a book with excitement or adventure (which is what the title implies), I do not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"This book is boring, but there are some ok parts.

There is no action, no humor, no excitement whatsoever. There is a lot of detail, but that is only on one person. All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa. So bitter, bland and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY BORING!

The main character is Kit Tyler. The story is about a girl who came from England and went to the Caribbean and went to New England to live with her cousins. The town that she lived in was a town in Connecticut in 1687.The people accused Kit of being a witch. She could not do anything about it and she was put in a store room. The son of the captain saved her from being persecuted as a witch. She got away from the people that accused her. This book is a good way to understand the way the people who were different were treated in New England in the 1600s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiki's Total Review Page","review":"I enjoyed this book mainly because it is a Historical fiction novel. I think this book would be a good reading source for anyone between the ages of 11-13 because it has alot to teach about life in the 1800's while letting you read a facinating story about a girl and the troubles she goes through after she moves away from her home in Barbados to her uncles home in New England. I think the auther needs some more detail in her writting as to create a more vivid picture of the senery. I think that it would be wonderful if this story could have a sequel to it because like all books it cuts of into ablivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond","review":"First of all I did not like the book Witch of Blackbird Pond. It's not that the author didn't try, it's just that I hated the book. She may have won many awards for many books, but I don't thing this book desverd any recognition. The book may seem interesting to many others, but it seems like a reason to take a nap to me.It may be because I can't stand historical fiction, most of the time, or that I just didn't like the book.

I think the book should have a little more excitement before I give it any recogniton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Boring Book","review":"This book was very boring. The characters were not exiting and difinitly not interesting. The book was not badly writin just had a bad plot. The characters like kit had no adventures or exitment. If that is what you are looking for I recomend you get a differnt you get a book. I do not think the characters were very exiting and did not work to make the plot interesting or adventurues. That is why don't think the book is good. If this book was non-fiction I would have understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond","review":"This book was horrible.I had to read it but in my own opinion this book really had nothing to do with witches.They only mentioned a few things about withches.For example ,when the main character{Kit}jumped in the water to save the little girl's doll,they just mentioned she could get in trouble for swimming.Another example of this would be how Kit was put on trail.They just said she was but it would have made the story a lot more interesting by adding the twist that she was found guilty. The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brina's Review","review":"I read this book when I was in fifth or sixth grade.

All in all, I did not favor this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was slow and boring","review":"I think this book was too drawn out and boring. All of the chapters were the same thing. There was only one chapter that I actually didn't fall asleep on, and that was the climax. I also think the book could have been better if they didn't have the last few chapters. None of it was pertinent to the theme or plot. I think that it was extremly slow because they don't even get to the plot until the last few chapters. I would not recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was nice.","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George Speare, was filled with excitement.

Lastly, the holster flops out from my leg approximately one inch and there is no way to hold the holster tight against your thigh. All in all, a pooly made holster from a poor design.

Time and again, during recent years, we have seen purportedly \\"Catholic\\" authorities, speaking through the media, contradicting beliefs universally taught pre-Vatican II.Has the Church changed so radically? Is what was once wrong, wrong no longer? Does it matter if the formal liturgy of the Mass is changed by the Celebrant? Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as \\"reform,\\" currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book!

I have to adjust them every time I wash it (where they also become very twisted), every time I put it on or take it off. The straps slip throughout the day as I wear it... you get the idea.

It is truly worth seeing but I have had to explain the Edward James Olmos character to several people.

It caught my eye and I read the reviews on it and purchased it without even so much as hearing a track performed by Bonnie Prince Billy or any of his various other incarnations. Admittedly, the first song, \\"A Minor Place\\" is kind of a dud in my opinion. It generally annoys me but a few times as of late, it has seemed a better song. The rest of the album, however, is all beautiful, haunting tracks featuring Oldham's amazing song-writing and his simple voice that seems as old as time itself.Some of the particularly strong tracks on this album include Nomadic Revery, I See A Darkness, Today I Was An Evil One, and Black. And for the record, track 4 is called \\"Another Day Full of Dread\\", not Bread.Quite simply, this is an album with a beauty and haunting quality that cannot be described with words. It is also some of the best music to listen to while drinking with a close friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SPOOKY GEM","review":"Bonnie 'Prince' Billy (aka Will Oldham) creates the scariest take on country music imaginable. In fact, this could easily be labelled 'goth country'.His lyrics are intensley personal and his voice a deep and dark wonder. His songs are carefully crafted and arranged in an obscure warmth and frailty.On some occasions the songs creep along steadily, on others errupt into soaring climaxes of double tracked vocals on the brink of collapse. These climaxes don't play on the usual tricks of severe dynamic change or string sections, but rather involve escalations in emotive force that ripple through you.Will Oldham is a master songwriter, and an expert at creating sound collages and textures not usually associated with country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death to Everyone","review":"Sparse Instrumentation and hauntng melodies make up this release from Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy and they won't leave your head for days. From the Bass and piano opening of Minor Place to the end its simply put a brilliant record. Full of gorgeous melodies and simply beautiful string arrangments. The album does truly sound aged in a way that will let it always be a timeless record that will live on for years to come as an intelligent and inspiring piece of work. The tender intelligence that the lyrics portay is none the less amazing. I dont have to sit here and type why its good...just buy it and find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty of fragility","review":"Bonnie Prince Billy combines soft and fragile melodies with atonal voices. He shows the beauty of error (Note the background voices in \\"Just to see my Holly Home\\") and the crushing power of tenderness.Like almost everything that is \\"REALLY\\" good, you have to learn to appreciate this album.

On their first two albums, they got away with mere imitation just because they came up with some pretty infectious melodies. But on this album, the melodies aren't even there. They've fallen victim to their own hype and have created a monster. For God's sake, do not buy this album. \\"All Around the World\\" is the best song, although like the rest of the album, someone should have turned off the studio tape halfway through the band's performance. Way too long and tedious. And if Noel is one of the richest musicians in England, can't he afford some cleaner production?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD for those new to Oasis","review":"I feel that this, and Morning Glory (the CD that Oasis put out before this one) are the best CDs for those new to Oasis.Why? This is the last CD Oasis made with the core of the original band.Also, Noel is writing very long dreamy heavy rock songs and rock ballads that are well-crafted, yet that go nowhere and in circles but just enjoy doing that, cause that's what it's all about anyway, ehs? Noel's guitarwork is all over the sonic screen, and Liam sounds great, too.A great, long album not unlike all the double-LP rock albums of the Seventies that had vague concepts and heavy chording.Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"When Oasis is good, they have catchy lyrics and well thought out arrangements.But when they're bad,they sound annoyingly loud and rushed.This cd shares a bit of each.With good tracks like D'You Know What I Mean,All Around the World, and Don't Go Away, you wonder how they made the crappy My Big Mouth,I Hope I Think I Know,etc.If you liked Whats the Story (Morning Glory)chances are you will not like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favourite Oasis Album","review":"Although many people prefer Morning Glory, this is my favourite Oasis album. I love the heavy, and to me very interesting production. The layered guitars, sound effects, keyboards and percussion create a marvellously powerful 'wall of sound'. I like all the songs on this record but the highlights for me are Do You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Don't Go Away and the magestic All Around the World. The songs on this album may seem very long and can be quite boring at first. But this is an album that should be listened to. It's fantastic to hear it all and focus on all the parts. It's an album that should be got and should be really listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't anyone noticed yet?","review":"Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums.

Still, \\"Be Here Now\\" has its moments. The best song on here is obviously \\"All Around the World\\". It's long, pretentious, and has a stunning music video to go along with it; it's reminiscent of the Guns N' Roses' song \\"November Rain\\". The album also houses \\"The Girl in the Dirty Shirt,\\" which is the nasaliest of any song Liam's sung before or since. The rest of the album is mostly just OK, making this a major disappointment given the brilliance of their last album. Oasis completists will want this album; everybody else would be wise to just buy \\"All Around the World\\" as a single and leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underated masterpiece","review":"Personally i feel this album has not got its just deserves. I am a huge Oasis fan and although not quite as good as Whats the Story morning glory, it certianly comesa close. Nearly all the tracks are superb with stand by me, i hope i think i know, dont go away and all around the world taking the front line. This album is great to listen to and was unfailry snubbed by all those set-in-their-way alternative music fans who think its cool to hate Oasis. A legend of an album by a legend of a band. Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album, but songs don't stick like other albums.","review":"When I first listened to this album, I thought it was the best Oasis album there was, but as I kept listening, I figured out that this album was missing something. It didn't contain songs that stuck in my head that I wanted to keep listening to like (WTS)MG? and Definitely Maybe did have. It was dissapointing to see this album fade so quickly in the charts, but for their next album, hopefully their new producer will give them more of a new sound. All in all, it was a good album, but not great. Oasis could so much better, I think they got a little lazy and sloppy on this one. Hopefully, the new album will sound better and newer, and hopefully it will fare better in the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and nothing new to say","review":"Listening to What's the Story Morning Glory, you could still believe that, magically, Oasis had somehow channeled a bit of the Sixties soul. There was, somehow, a sense of mystery and fun in the production. But now they give us overlong B-sides without emotion, sense or creativity. Only \\"D'you know what I mean\\" and \\"Don't Go Away\\" have some quality. Everything else was a dissapointment. Right now, Oasis are just one step away from becoming some stupid band like Guns and Roses. So you better spend your money buying a real , perfectly produced, inventive and meaningful rock album and near-masterpiece like OK Computer. Also you can buy something really sincere, from a band that really speaks to you and cares for its fans: Adore (by Smashing Pumpkins)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental & Depressing","review":"Was having a tough day when ordering this.

In my opinion it is their best album, and tends to be the album in which I still listen to the most. It is probably Oasis's hardest most heavy album with songs like \\"My Big Mouth\\", \\"I hope, I think, I Know\\", \\"it's gettin better man\\", and \\"D'you Know what I mean\\". Th album has more of a rock feel than a pop feel than \\"What's the Story Mourning Glory\\". I feel that every song on this CD are great rock songs.

Be Here Now is a major disappointment from this sometimes brilliant band.Hype is what drove this band into the spotlight. When you have everbodys attention, you HAVE to perform well.What's The Story Morning Glory was released and it seemed anyone with a good trained ear for pure pop music was licking their chops.Then this yawn of an album was released and it seemed to take a lot of the air out of Oasis' balloon. Believe me, it's not a BAD album, it's just .....boring. Nothing jumps out at you making you want more. A lot of these songs sound like leftovers from other albums.I think that if this album actually kicked some butt, and had the catchy tunes like the ones on \\"Morning Glory\\" , Oasis would be #1.(not touring and sharing a bill with the Black Crows). I love you guys, you pump out some great tunes, but this is rubbish simply put."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great Stuff!","review":"Man I have to tell you people that you are way to harsh. This album is almost the best Oasis ever. If it wasn't for My Big Mouth and maybey I Hope I Think I Know. Other than that it is great. The song Magic Pie has to be my favorite Oasis song it is mesmorizing. The line, \\"those who don't say what they mean live and die by there own sword\\" is a great lyric.

But PLEASE! This was so mind-numbingly awful that by the time I got to the eighth track I wanted to (JOKING!!!!) get that guitar and WRAP IT ROUND HIS NECK! It was that bad. Even the stand-out tracks Stand By Me and Be Here Now are pitiful copies of their earlier songs like Married With Children and Shakermaker. The rest - well.....do you really fancy hearing \\"Wonderwall\\" twelve times every time you put the album on?If there had been a category lower than one star it would have more accurately described my reaction to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fade the songs!","review":"This album could have been a 5 stars album if only they had finished every song after 5 minutes of playing. Good songs, but nothing that justifies playing them for 7 or 8 minutes. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3 is because Stand by me is one of the greatest songs by Oasis, a classic. I like the big guitar sound all over the place, with every channel full of guitars. But all around the world playing for 9 mintes and then a reprise for another 2 minutes can only be explained because these guys were hooked on drugs at the time.

Oasis' lyrics have always been pretty throwaway but here they are banally Hallmark. \\"All around the world/ tell 'em what ya heard\\" is as deep as they get here.

But we forgive Be Here Now of it's weaker points because of its strong ones. These strong points include D'You Know What I Mean?, My Big Mouth, and the (underrated) future classic, It's gettin' better (man!!). Maybe its me, or maybe oasis should forget about ballads and soft songs and stick to Rock 'n' roll of which they are the undisputed champions. It might be lack of inspiration or (more likely) lack of effort which contributes greatly to the more laboured efforts mentioned earlier, but overall, Oasis deserve a pat on the back for giving us some more of that unmistakibly \\"Oasis\\" tunes that are entirely worthy of your dosh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one word can describe it...Unbelievable!","review":"This, Oasis' third album, will forever raise the bar to which records are judged. \\"Be Here Now\\" exhibits a new found maturity that was lacking in the past two albums. Every track is massive. From the heart pounding \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\", through the psychedelic \\"All Around The World\\", and culminating in the feel-good \\"It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)\\", \\"Be Here Now\\" will twist your mind in knots trying to remember every moment of every song. \\"Be Here Know\\" is only paralleled by the likes of Oasis' other two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound","review":"If you want the best Oasis for the Oasis sound, purchase \\"Definately Maybe\\" or \\"The Masterplan.\\" If you want a great album of a different sound, buy \\"Be Here Now.\\" The band was on its best behavior and performance, taking the time to make 12 quality tracks.Some of the top tracks, \\"D'You Know What I Mean,\\" \\"Fade In/Out\\" \\"Magic Pie\\" and \\"All Around the World.\\" I hope that on their next album, Noel takes the time to sing lead on a few more songs. I have yet to hear a bad Oasis song with him singing lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd ever made","review":"Be Here now is the best cd ever made. This cd exploits Oasis's musical talent to the fullest with tracks like \\" D' You Know What I Mean \\" and \\"All Around The World\\". Every song on this cd could be in the #1 spot on Billboard. Noel Gallagher's musical mastery is shown in the combination of orchestra and rock in \\"All Around The World\\" and \\"All Around The World(Reprise)\\". This cd is a must for all oasis and Beatles fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old-fashioned rock and roll...","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's. Noel Gallagher knows how to write a song, and Liam's sexy voice brings them to life. Tracks 1-6, and 8 are the only tunes I listen to, however. Be Here Now is not one of those rare CD's you can listen to without skipping around. But, the songs I like don't get tired. If you want a hard-rocking version of The Beetles, buy this CD. If you want sensless lyrics with synthisized beats, check out The Backstreet Boys like everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few excellent songs shine through the retreads","review":"This album should have been great. It should have been the best album of the 1990s. However, the band doesn't seem nearly as motivated and hungry as before. Some songs are just too long, too familiar and too boring. But, songs like \\"D'You Know what I mean\\" and \\"Fade In/Out\\" among others are well done songs that feature Oasis trying to alter their musical style (albeit not by too much). Bottom line: It's great rock n' roll music. However the energy is more intense on their previous albums. It's still better than most rock music out today. Look for their next album in 2000, chances are their hunger will return and it will be one of the best albums in the last 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away, dog","review":"The book \\"Go away, Dog\\" by author Joan L. Nodset and pictures by Paul Meisel is teaching children to mean to dogs. For example, page 5 yells at the dog saying \\"Go away, you bad old dog.

My child, 2 at the time, giggle and laughed, especially when the dog licks the boy's hand. We had to buy our own copy. I later used this book with a neighbor boy who was terrified of dogs. It showed him that the little boy in the book gave the dog a chance and so should he. It helped a bit. The writing in the book is easy to follow, on a child's level and the pictures are darling. Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah ....","review":"If you have access to templates, or internet @ home etc. this book is not useful.

Forget about the classical stuff and go back to what made him what he became - one of the best songwriters to come out of the 70's. And to not let the forgettable River Of Dreams album be his last say on the pop/rock world. But after hearing this rubbish, I hope Billy stays building motorcycles, and cruising around in his boats. This single may just be the most boring bland thing he has ever done, and after the mixed bag of his last three studio albums (Bridge, Storm Front, ROD) that's saying something.When dealing with Joel your best bet will always be his classic period 1976 (Turnstiles) to 1982( The Nylon Curtain) everything else is very hit and miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what we waited fourteen years for?","review":"Billy Joel, the greatest songwriter of his generation, really fell on his nose with this one. The lyrics, which consist of one trite phrase after another, are set to a rather pedestrian melody that doesn't take the listener anywhere. The only thing that makes this song even marginally listenable is the orchestral arrangement. A BIG disappoinment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh maybe zero stars","review":"What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected?

Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy has turned into Rod Stewart...","review":"Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville! This should be a demo for another singer to record.It's just too schmaltzy for me. I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too. Billy is a much better singer than this.After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match. I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Friend in the Book Case","review":"Good programming books are not rampant. Manning tends to be a great source, however. They've done it again with this book. And, this time, they have the added attraction of a great, adult sense of humour with Shawn Bayern. If you cannot use JSTL with ease after reading this book, then you will be in the minority. I don't know if Bayern makes the hard easy or the easy easy, but it definitely is made easy. I sailed through this book wondering how 400 plus pages could seem like 90 pages. The best thing is that there is a forest for the trees to live in throughout this book. Bayern is a great teacher. I'm going to look at his other book now. Maybe it is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful and understandable","review":"While the technical specification of JSTL is readable like most hi-tech documents are \\"readable\\" (i.e. it left me sometimes a bit puzzled), this book is both deep and full of very useful examples. Sometimes, in my opinion it goes too far (programming a message board with JSTL), but this only goes to show how powerful JSTL really is.Overall, I really enjoyed reading it: It made a lot of things clearer and there were a couple of times where I thought: \\"Oh, I didn't know that JSTL could do that!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource all things considered","review":"This is a good book to learn about how to use JSTL. It has an excellent reference section, and the body of the book explains how to use the JSTL tags with many good example. On the whole, a very useful, readable book. One negative: The author has a sense of humor which some might find odd, and he interjects it throughout the book; at times it's distracting. But if you can get past that, you'll find this to be a good resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining, fun adventure all the way","review":"I don't generally read science fiction, in fact, I never do. But with all the hype - or lack thereof - surrounding the bombed Disney movie, I decided to read the book before the movie comes out on DVD. Yeah, it's a little silly, but it's still a fun ride all the way. I enjoyed the nonstop action, John Carter's superhuman strength, his gentlemanliness (is that a word?) and his ability to bridge culture gaps and help the locals overcome traditions of hatred and prejudice. He is a southern gentleman to the core. It shows in everything he does, particularly in his absence of lust for the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris though she is buck naked and gorgeous. He adores her totally and completely and treats her like the royal lady she is the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"ERB Finally Makes LIBRARY OF AMERICA w/A Princess of Mars!","review":"This Library of American edition of A Princess of Mars is a beautiful book! It's about time Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of the USA's bestselling authors for about 20-25 years starting in 1914, had one of his books published by the Library of America. LOA has also published Tarzan of the Apes.I have the 1st edition of A Princess of Mars, by McClurg, and this Library of America edition is close (but not quite) a fascsimile 1st edition. All five of the original illustrations are present, but they are not on \\"coated\\" paper like they are in the original 1st edition. The dust jacket is beautiful.I short, if you're looking for a very nice edition of this book, buy this one!Before closing, note that I also give the story itself 5 Stars!

It is an escapist guilty pleasure to revisit them in my 50's. Campy, but classic. I'd highly recommend for anyone who enjoys sci-fi/adventure tails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic look at the Literature that Was","review":"John Carter of Mars was one of my favorite all time heroes, ranking right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, and of course Tarzan. I read it as a teenager, and recently read it again, and was again amazed by the story. Of course Burroughs didn't believe in that Mars anymore than anyone else. It was nonetheless great Romantic Science Fantasy. Red Martians,Green Martians, four armed carnivorous apes and of course Thoats, flying battleships, rifle that kill at a hundred miles, and of course sword fights. Complete nonsense if looked at rationally, but still a great story. Burroughs was criticized for too many outrageous coincidences in his stories, but that is the stuff of exciting literature. Recommend that this book be on everyone's reading list before seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci Fi Fun","review":"Somehow John Carter manages to go to Mars, and when he gets there, he finds out that he is physically stronger than the warlike martians that happen to dwarf him in size. He uses that strength, and the convenient fact that the also telepathic martians can't read his mind, to dominate a clan of green martians and win a beautiful, conveniently human, princess. Then he saves the world a couple times just for kicks, all while running around naked, because no one on Mars wears clothes.The cover says it all. It was an easy read, adventurous, fun, and all the blatant inconsistencies and false information can be happily ignored because it was written in 1912 by the author of Tarzan, so keep it in perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, fast-paced read","review":"My first time reading Burroughs. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, even with the occasional and distracting techno/biological inconsistencies...an excusable byproduct of the times.

Fun, quick-paced reading that will hold your interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recently reunited with a long lost friend","review":"30 years ago, when I was 14, I read this book from cover to cover in a day. Action of this sort was new to me & I was hooked on it. I could not get enough of John Carter & his adventures and read all the books in the series. John Carter was a real hero and what boy becoming a man didn't want to be just like Carter? While browsing the local library shelves last week I found an old edition of A Princess of Mars.It was like rounding a corner and walking into your best friend you've not seen in forever.I read this book again as if it was the first time ...it was more glorious this time than 30 years ago.This book is filled with adventure,courage, action,devotion,insight & is extremely well written. A Princess of Mars is a must read..as great as Tolkien's Rings & Howard's Conan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame on the publishers","review":"The Martian Tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs get the highest marks, best reviews, they are labelled as the treshold of present day science fiction and science fantasy. Presently nobody seems to be interested in printing these fabulous stories. I wonder why ? Maybe it's because nobody has ever written stories that can be re-read over and over again, making these stories uneconomical in our present day society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been wonderful BUT...","review":"I was SO looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with the old-timey but not campy hero John Carter of Mars... only I sure won't be doing it via this Kindle book!

The story is still fresh, and Burroughs captured the ideas of inventing alien or fantasy cultures. Some authors have taken the concept further (e.g. Flash Gordon, Star Wars) and others have made a mockery of the model (e.g. Chronicles of Gor). The sensuousness and adventure of this book cannot be denied. It is one of those stories that must be read, as no motion picture or other medium could quite do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fantastic Sci-Fi","review":"I know the book/series is dated, but it's still a terrific read.

I was amused at first by the writing (written almost exactly 100 years ago now), not so much for the phrases and words (though they are amusing at times) but the style and the way the characters are portrayed. This is truly a peek at the sensibilities of an older age.However, once you get over (or used to) the over romanticized hero, to whom no danger raises so much as an eyebrow, you will live (or re-live) a classic tale that is nicely told. It is fun as a middle aged adult to again read these stories, suspend all disbelief and scientific knowledge, and just enjoy them for what they are!

The only thing is that it has been ripped off by so many other franchises.The only problem with the book is Burroughs insistence on creating as many alien races as he can. The amount often becomes bewildering, and this is a problem that a lot of his other work had.

Arriving alone, naked and friendless, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie for sure.","review":"If you saw the movie, you may really like the book. Beware. A book is never the same as a movie.... They are better, more detailed, more thought and less hollywood crap ideas of what the public is supposed to want.It was also written by a man from the distant past. So don't beat up the author, that doesn't have our knowledge. GREAT BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Early 20th Century Science Fiction","review":"Once you accept the mumbo-jumbo elements of how Civil War veteran John Carter is transported to Mars, you can settle back and appreciate the remarkable fantasy world that Edgar Rice Burroughs describes. In a driving narrative that never lags, Burroughs succeeds in creating a multi-layered society rife with racial animosity and social unrest. Carter becomes the igniting spark, the focal point for societal change at all levels. This book is actually the first of a trilogy. Books two and three are \\"The Gods of Mars\\" and \\"Warlord of Mars\\" respectively. They are all excellent - so good you'll have trouble believing that they were written nearly a hundred years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic adventure novel","review":"The few Victorian references only add to the charm of these books. They are very well written adventures, from an imaginative author, writing when automobiles had just come out. I won't repeat what the other reviewers say, except that you can go back and enjoy these every few years. The recent movie seemed to mix several of the books together, and didn't do this set justice. I think the series is actually better than the Tarzan series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction, but watching others is most beneficial","review":"This is truly a very wonderful, helpful DVD. I bought it several months ago when it was still too cold to hoop outside. You do need quite a bit of space - probably a good 10x10 area would be enough. I went to a music festival with my hoop after practicing once a week or so for a couple months, and people were amazed that I had just begun hooping! Huge compliment, and a huge endorsement for this DVD.While this is an EXCELLENT way to begin hooping, I highly recommend going to a festival or a class where others are hooping - you will learn the most from watching others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introdution","review":"One thing that I found frustrating is that the second DVD in the series was more of a workout dvd, while this was more breaking down the moves.While I do go to a hooping class, I also want to speed up my learning curve with the hoops and I found this dvd to be a great help. Everything is broken down and explained in a clear and concise manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to hooping","review":"I enjoyed this DVD since I am totally hooked on hula hoops right now. Its fun yet basic. Just teaches the basic moves and how to start out. I haven't yet mastered the corkscrews and I do wish the corkscrew lesson was more detailed, but this video has a good flow and I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get started in hooping","review":"Living where I do, taking an in-person hooping class just isn't an option, so this was the next best thing. I picked this DVD over the 'HoopGirl' DVD because I'd read elsewhere that there are 'troubleshooting' sections on this DVD that cover what you're probably doing wrong (and how to fix it) if you just aren't getting the move(s).The DVD is well-edited, I can understand the instructor easily (even if my body is sometimes slow to catch on), and the troubleshooting sections are a definite help. My one minor quibble is that the menu could use a little more breaking down (it would be nice if I could choose which section of hip hooping that I wanted to go back to, for example), but I am still giving this DVD 5 stars because of the way the information is presented. I hope to be giving the Level 2 DVD a try in the near future. Can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Instructional DVD!","review":"This is a great beginner DVD for hoopdancing. Even though I already knew hooping basics I still found this dvd helpful. Floating is one of the moves taught on this DVD and is a move I had never saw explained elsewhere. The moves are broken down into small steps that are easy to understand and you are told to expect that some of the more complex moves take time to learn, which is helpful because you don't want to get frustrated and feel discouraged. The troubleshooting section is very helpful too. I have this video and the next, Beginner Level 2, and highly recommend both of them! Happy Hooping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Instructional DVD","review":"I have been learning hoopdancing little by little and this DVD has really helped me. It is meant to be watched first and then practiced on your own, which is important to know so you won't expect a follow-along DVD. (I find it best to practice hoopdancing free form with some music anyways.) The troubleshooting sections are GREAT. They help me every time I encounter a problem. It is slow going, but once I have mastered the techniques in this DVD, I fully intend to get the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"what i thought...a kid'z view","review":"The \\"Gadget\\" by Paul Zindell is the story about a boy named Stephen.

Although I read the whole book it was very dull there is no paspizazz, action , the details where not realistic. At the begining when steven's cousin was killed the book became opaque. Because the book started right after the boy was killed. Steven got sent to a military acedamy and was sent to live with his father. Know lets skip to the middle of the book he saw the adam bomb go off. he was in the fire of the bomb why didn't he die. Next the child went to see his friend Alexie who he fins out that he is an undercover spies for the war.

The studio album concentrates on the songs, whereas \\"Live at the Stone Coast Brewery\\" is all about the jam and great improvisation. Each song packs a punch. There is great guitar and organ work throughout the album, backed by a grooving and very solid rhythm section. Highlights include a great extended vocal jam, too. Overall, this album is a must have for lovers of jam-rock, improvisation, or just all around fun music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"iWhat's the big idea!","review":"I've heard all the albums, seen them live, and all I can say is \\"Phish-Lite\\".

It sort of compromises the reason you have a PDA to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN!!!! RUN FAR AWAY!!!","review":"This product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but could be so much better","review":"I've had mine for a couple months now.It's very solid and looks great.I've only dropped my Palm once but its slipped off of things twice. The case cushioned my Palm TX just fine.What could be better is:1. If the outside finish were slightly rubberized. As is this puppy is very slick. In your hand or just about any surface you place it on. To slick.2. It were hinged on the top instead of the side. I have large hands and holding this case open in my hand during use is straight up a pain in the hand. And don't forget the part above about this case being slick which makes it an even bigger pain to juggle. It would be much easier to use if it were hinged on the top. Placing the hinge on top would also work to ensure that the memory card doesn't accidently pop out.I love this case but the two flaws have me looking for another case and recommending that you keep looking for another, more functional case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A biography of Lincoln for young children.","review":"This is a children's book about the life of Abraham Lincoln. First written and illustrated in 1939, it was expanded in 1957. Most of the book focuses on Lincoln's early life. The illustrations resulted in the book being awarded the 1940 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a children's book. It is a book that helps children learn more about U.S. history and a great president. It is also a book that should be on the shelf of any serious student of children literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great frothing pitcher","review":"This is a great pitcher.

The recap of the events that transpired in Halo was wonderful too. Then the kicker; in the 3rd book there's a few Spartans left? What a way to lead up to Halo 2.

However, he came to offer her a job to go undercover with him, and she agreed. Soon, the inevitable happened and they were running from danger and submitting to their passions. This is a sweet romance, and you really do like both characters. It doesn't have the snazziest of writing, and sometimes seems rather simple and slow, but the romance was a very effecting one. The danger and intrigue was not bad as a backdrop and kept as a continual focus where some other romance novels may leave it as a weak side story that's often forgotten when the passion runs high. I recommend this book if you want a simple sweet romance and two likeable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color photos! a new \\"Stacked Hair Wing\\" and PJ wrote it!","review":"Mr. Jorgensen has updated his classic work.

The new one will replace the original.Simple, clear and easy to understand (insofar as Atlantic Salmon Flies can ever be \\"easy\\") in technique and illustration.This updated copy includes color photos (the old one apparently did not have the budget to print the photos in color) and addresses many issues that a starting Salmon Fly tier needs to know to start the steep learning curve for those patterns that are more art than function.This isn't a book devoted to \\"Art Salmon Flies\\", but if you want to go in that direction this is as fine an introduction as there is.This book addresses all aspects of tying these interesting and effective flies. You can easily tie a Jock Scott in hair wing or married wing with only a fair amount of time devoted to learning the new skills - if you are a decent intermediate Trout Fly tier.A wonderful book by a living master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"A remake of the original with up to date techniques. A must for a begginer in the art of Classic Salmon Flies and to have for your library. It used to be the only one you could get on this subject for quiet awhile. Nice to see it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"look cheaper than i thought","review":"it is a good product, but it looks like very cheap transparent plastic, i just got one to try them befor getting the whole set of sizes, but kept only the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Africa","review":"Having travelled to Africa many times, I found this novel truly evocative of the tropical center of the continent--its people and their lives, its complexity, its mystery. THe tensions between the Americans and their new African neighbors make clear that we cannot just drop ourselves into a new culture without serious ramifications. The main characters are beautifully drawn, and the plot is intricate, interesting and believable. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters","review":"I could not finish this book. Unlike the other reviewers, I was not the least bit impressed by the quality of the writing. The dialogue was stilted and the characters were one-dimensional. Save your money. Read Mike Tidwell's Ponds of Kalambayi if you're interested in a Peace Corps novel set in Africa. Tidwell's book is everything that The Road Builder is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off - No Video","review":"There is NO VIDEO in this thing, just music. If there is a video on the disc, there are NO INSTRUCTIONS what so ever on how to play it. The only print on this are a bunch of stupid rants about piracy is good. But there is NO VIDEO here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I was really disappointed with this book, especially since it was so highly recommended by friends and in general. I guess perhaps when it was written the ideas Fromm expressed were new, or at least the way he expressed them were new, but I can't believe that any minimally self-aware person hasn't thought about at least 80 to 90 percent of these ideas themselves. Fromm seems to be the typical over-educated, intellectual psychologist/philosopher, who takes a simple idea (if you don't know and love and understand yourself and the world around you, you can't love another person) and over-analyzes it, giving historical and biblical examples. Just another 90-odd pages of psychobabble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffly vaugeries about nothing.","review":"Here is a book that talks about thoery, dinsintergration, and practice of love, but really says nothing. He uses vauge phrases like \\"the union of conformity...is insufficient to pacify the anxiety of seperateness\\" Does't help a person have a better relationship. Only creates mythical boxes for love such as \\"God Love, Brotherly Love, Self Love, and Motherly Love\\" which he describes in equally abstract language. Would recommend this book only for college students who need to write a report on love, but not for anyone with an interest in enriching their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninstructive book not based on concepts, and even off-topic","review":"I am not able to say that Erich Fromm's book The Art of Loving really is about the art of loving. The only important message I was able to digest is that loving is something you do, not something which happens to you. I do not follow how this book could be labeled as practical when it does not really contain any program at all, rather, it contains a lot of unwarranted criticism of modern society.The book contains many easy to disprove statements. Also, Fromm does not bother to explain how he came to his conclusions - it's like a mathematical textbook that contains theorems and claims without any proofs or defitions. In other words, there are not many lines of reasoning to be found. All in all, I am disappointed with the quality of Fromm's thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"dated but quite worthwhile","review":"This book is a product of the 1950s and does contain some outdated attitudes about gender roles and sexual orientation. That being said, it is a remarkably thoughtful and penetrating examination of the theory and practice of loving. Many of Fromm's observations are astute, and his concerns re narcissism and consumerism in the search for a mate are even more cogent today (witness reality TV's \\"Who wants to marry a millionaire\\" and \\"the bachelor\\", e.g.). Most people I know could learn something from this book. Be forwarned, though...it is not a quick or easy \\"self-help\\" read, and Fromm's advice, which is to behave altruistically, is not easy to follow, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful non-poetic description of love.","review":"The most beautiful non-poetic description of love. Love, according to Fromm, is the conscious act of connecting with others in kind and compassionate fashion. In doing so, we overcome the primary fear we feel as humans, which is to feel alone. If more people understood that trule love is not about being loved, but about loving, this world would be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true eye-opener","review":"This is truly one of the most influential books in my life. If you want to live in a happy and lasting relationship this boook is a must. Fromm has such a way of making profound matters easy to understand. Read this book and become and expert in the art of loving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not in love with it","review":"I bought this book for a psych class, my teacher mandated the purchase of this specific book, and at the end of the class I ended up asking my teacher to consider another book to talk about loving. Fromm's book starts off with good insights into certain relationships (which is the only reason it got two stars instead of one) but by chapter three those insights are long since forgotten and replaced with hot air. Fromm tends to take a chapter to say what only needed to be a page or two. He talks in circles after a while and that makes the book unbearable to finish. I would recommend borrowing this book from the library not wasting your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice thought","review":"this book explores love and what it means. Love is not defined here, and it is merely described. That's nice, but is narrowly defined as loving everyone and as part of a \\"loving personality.\\" For some reason, it's not okay to love say, your girlfriend or your child or your mother more than anyone else... according to him, we must love everyone. Love is not a personality type just as much as excitement is not a personality type. Love is sometimes exclusive... isn't that why there is jealousy? It is a good read and a good text, and offers insight into human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"I've just received it as a persent for my birthday amongst another 8 or 10 CDs. At first it caught my eye better than any of the rest, but I feel very dissapointed because of the (almost all) live recordings, which I don't expect in a collection named \\"Greatest Hits\\".

He does a great job in carefully deciphering the power of prayer in their times and showing its unchanging nature with the ability to manifest even today. He writes of the importance of emotion and feeling the prayer; bringing it from the head into a matter of the heart. He talks of the possibility of living life in a prayer, which in fact is living a life in the space of continuous intentionality and co-creation with God. I found it to be an amazing book bringing home to me the importance of mindful living, of being present, aware. Of living in faith. I believe if one has truly embraced, incorporated - taken out of the intellectual mind - and encodified, better said, embodied its teachings, then one is living a transformed, powerful, God present life. I loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gregg Braden brings us a valuable book","review":"This book by Gregg Braden is fantastic in the best possible way. It is packed with answers that make sense. I had originally borrowed the book from my spiritual teacher, and I had to remove many sticky notes that I had used to mark important information when I returned it, months late. I had no choice but to get my own copy. I will re-read this a number of times, and I have returned to select passages many times already. Thank you Gregg, for sending this information out into this world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Isaiah Effect","review":"An eye-opener.

The effect of his passion for answers, moments of puzzlement, and intense desire to help create an everlasting peace, illuminates pathways that can lift people from lives of confusion to lives of direction. Many of the concepts noted had before been free-standing models that Braden draws into a much bigger, stronger picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading","review":"This book is about 2012 end-time predictions rather than actually \\"decoding the lost science of prayer and prophecy\\". Just a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Please don't waste your money or time on this book. Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same. If you just have to spend your money on something, choose a good charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"Great information, great author.

Braden's baloney name-drops quantum physics, a subject matter that, clearly, he does not begin to understand but does know how to exploit for his mush-minded readers. What Braden also understands is the mindset of so many irrational readers who are positively triggered by words such as \\"Decoding,\\" \\"lost,\\" \\"science,\\" \\"prayer,\\" and \\"prophecy.\\" Combining all of these trigger words into one book title evidences Braden's marketing savvy, attracting the ignorant and the neurotic into a mire of mystery and mishmash. Even the brilliant writings of Carl Sagan do little to educate people away from irrational and pseudoscientific gobbledygook such as is displayed in this silly, silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR $","review":"This book promised to be rich in the recently discovered secrets of the prophet Isaiah, a scientific explanation of prayer, and \\"A Groundbreaking Interpretation of Prayer, Quantum Science, and Prophecy.\\" Not!If you break ground with this book do your self a favor - throw it in the hole and cover it up it's not worth the read.If you want to read about someone else's personal adventures and their preceived importance then this book is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The tragic waste of a tree.","review":"I was expecting a more scholarly work based solely on the jacket design.

It is well written and reads easily, aided by personal anecdotes. It is also well referenced and gives us practical direction based on truths that have been known since ancient times. The prophesies seem to say we are heading for destruction, and we may be....but we have the collective ability to choose that path or not. But we must choose, and Gregg shows us how...how to choose our collective future and our personal one.

Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, \\"I will not give out the names of my suppliers\\". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm?

Sometimes (in some places) it does take a while to get a signal from Colorado but for the most part it's never been an issue. The screen has stayed bright on mine, only dims a little when the battery is about to die. I've only had to replace the batteries once. Nice snooze and travels well too.One hint - if you need to replace the AA batteries, the easiest way I could get off the cover (brute force didn't work) was to put a piece of tape on the back cover and pull sideways.

Turns out, I already practice \\"chi-running.\\" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form.

Well written, not much to argue with, I just was hoping for a bit more unique factor from the author which I did not find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Information","review":"Chi Running: An execellent book on running with useful information for readers who have been running for a long period of time and are being to suffer thorugh repeated injuries and starting to feel that \\"burn out feeling\\" comming on.This book will put you back on tract and become more focused about your training while improving your overall health.Hihly recommened for runners regardless of distances or training level, there are helpful principles to be learned from Dreyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, information. Easy to read and understand.","review":"Sometimes it is hard to read about something, rather than just doing it. But in this case, it is so well written, and walks you through some prep exercises, and that it makes it very easy to read and digest.The other feature about this book is that CHI RUNNING is communicated in a very logical manner, which one might not expect from something with \\"CHI\\" in the title.As an avid yogini, this ties in well with the concept of developing the core and allowing the muscles to relax (which sounds contrary) while running. It makes sense!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more knee trouble","review":"I am missing the ACL on the left side and never expected to be able to run again. After using this method with 5 months of training, I was able to complete a marathon. It is easy to read and quite clear, although I recommend getting the video too.B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to learn injury free proper running training","review":"This is a great book that may change your running for ever for the better. Very well written and easy to understand. If you read about POSE running which has more scientific explanation about the correct form of running, essentially says the same as this book does. Forget about heel strike and lift off with your toes. Learn how to run with mid-foot strike under your body (not in front) and lean forward (which will work as your gas pedal as you are taking advantage of the gravity) without bending at your waist. It is like controlled fall. You will find you are spending less energy and your risk of injury is less as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mixed results","review":"I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"it is a good book for running. it helped me prevent shin splints and i now run with much less effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my running and my life!","review":"I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"helped me get a little further","review":"I have a few races under my belt but am not exactly a seasoned runner, I found this book to be very helpful in improving my form. It won't help you immediately get faster, or add miles, and you must train to get the benefits from it. However, I don't thinkI would have made the improvements that I did without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concepts","review":"I am 65 years old and have been running for about 40 years. When I was younger I never had to worry about injuries. With age they became more frequent, which led to my interest in this book. While it is too early to tell whether applying the concepts will totally eliminate injuries, I can say that the concepts are sound. I can also say that now when I finish a run my legs feel fresh; while in the past they felt strained. With each day that I learn to more fully incorporate the principles of Chi running into my form I feel better and better both during and after the run.I nice ripple effect is that one can apply the principles of Chi running into other aspects of one's life: for example, the posture which the book describes should be practiced at all times: not just when running.This book is a must for anyone who likes to run or even walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"The book is very informational.

The book is highly repetitive (the same amount of material might easily have been covered in 40 pages), it lacks organization, the author invents words which have no meaning (\\"instate\\" as a verb, anyone?), and the typeset is HORRIBLE.The author has some good ideas. Let's hear them.....coherently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a revolutionary idea","review":"\\"ChiRunning\\" is not a new idea.

Having hip problems and subsequent difficulty running I was about to give it up when I learned new running techniques from Danny Dreyer's new book, and DVD.

I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble. Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.What are the publishers thinking? Does their greed know no bounds? They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost.

What a joke! It is only a bit over 3 hours of audio on 3 cd's. It appears the author talks about Chi Running rather than reading from the book.If you have the ability to read and are interested in the book, buy the book instead.Listening to this is like listening the the author give a speech about chi running or an informative podcast about Chi Running. It's interesting and informative, but it isn't listening to the book as written. In fact, I can't believe this counts as an audio \\"book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upside Down Some Habits","review":"First and foremost: do not have it as e-book. This is probably true for most of manual-alike books (I had similar experience with a swimming manual), but with ChiRunning you are going to miss the at-a-glance capability only the paper can give you.Anyway, this is indipendent from the book, that is a GREAT book on running.I have read a great number of books on sport, several manuals and guides: this is something \\"different\\". The approach is different: here Danny, the author, start from Tai Chi to get to a new running concept.Well done, interesting even for a convinced Cartesian as myself, always critical towards Oriental disciplines (notwithstanding my long residential experience in Far East).Other than paper edition, I would suggest DVD: ChiRunning videos you can recover from the network are not exaustive (not at all).Probably a stage with a Certified ChiRunning Instructor would be the best completion, but unfortunately courses seem to be available in US only."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Ideas","review":"I wanted to know how I could become a faster runner. This book gave me some new insights on running that I had never had, nor known. I was well satisfied with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant...and redundant","review":"Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour. He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end. Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase \\"Chi running\\" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas with some entertaining philosophy","review":"I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Find","review":"Many young pianists have the manual skills and dexterity to master these pieces but . . . the feeling and interpretation that Ms Bardin brings to us here in nothing less than marvelous.

The romantic side of this story gets a little sappy as part of the overall pulling of all of the story lines together. Part of the entwined past coming together ending was foreshadowed in S2 Pt1 with Odin, the First Fist. While it does pull together, it's rather simplistic, predictable and generally unlikely (but that's a writer's stock in trade I guess). Still it does close out the first story arc (assuming they are planning a second). They have left it wide open for another season (or two). All this aside, while not my favorite of the three it is still a good watch and I'd say it was worth the price and time. As a whole the series was good with most areas being above average. May be suitable for teens or even children, but watch it first. We all have different opinions on what's okay for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"real good","review":"Had never heard of the guy - got it at a bookstore because it had 1200 pages (I needed a lot to read) and because it was written by an old guy (well, he's old now, at least - well- wrinkled but kind looking). So far I'm about a third of the way through it, but like everyone else has said, this book is great. Some writers get lazy and write the same story over and over. Not this guy - every character, every situation is unique. For people who like movies, read the one about Istafan and compare it to \\"Lost in Translation\\". The story about the swingers party is indescribably great also, just in the way he describes a man kissing a woman's hair or them barely dancing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NY MEM.","review":"I THINK THAT THIS WAS THE WRONG TYPE OF MUSIC FOR RIEU.

The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends.

Memories of the early Ramones, when Dee Dee wrote his best songs. Hop Around is much better that his last album, with several excellent songs, many good ones, and only a couple of throw-aways. Dee Dee borrows many of his own riffs and song titles, but I guess it's OK to steal from yourself. \\"I Don't Wanna Die in The Basement,\\" \\"Now I Wanna Be Sedated,\\" and \\"38th & 8th\\" may not be the most original songs, but they are great nonetheless. Also, the production is very good. Any Ramones fan should definitely buy this album. Others are advised to buy it and see how the \\"old school\\" rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's pass this one over in silence","review":"This is an utterly poor effort by an aging hero. Dee Dee is obviously a very sloppy guitar player, he sings bad (not to speak of his wife Barbara's \\"vocals\\") and the songs.. well, they sully the memory of the Ramones' work on classical albums like \\"Ramones\\", \\"Leave Home\\" and \\"Rocket To Russia\\".

Only DVD pictures look better. It has a very precise flying erase head that allows excellent editing for clear transitional cuts. If you prefer 8mm recording I recommend you get one of these units before they are all gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST VCR SONY ever made","review":"This 8mm Video Recorder has one of the best pictures I have ever seen.

When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music, and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever, i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short, maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision. The songs in general are caught up trying to be punk when they sound more like un inpsired emo tunes.......i guess maybe they are trying to hard to please......have you seen the videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooofffaaah...","review":"Saw them live with Dredg and they stunk up the joint...badly.Don't compare them to TMV...no comparsion in any manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"better luck next time","review":"if sparta actually makes a good album i'll give all my mars volta material away. they lack any kind of creative thinking or flow in there music. they continue to try and re-hash the spirit of atdi.......zzzzzzzzzzz. not gonna happen.listen we all know mars isn't for everyone, but collectivly they are changing music,taking risks and devolping a new style of fusion... writing and putting together such timeless concept albums takes skill... also to have complete control over there music??? how many artists can say that? sparta take notice... try something new.. weak songwriting and catchy pop hooks will only take that atdi recognition so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 full-on hits","review":"There are 5 totally rocking tracks on this disk (the last 9 are kinda generic).The good tracks are simply as good as indie rock gets: extremely catchy, stick in your brain hard rock.

Based on how good these good tracks are, I'll give it my favorite album of the year award.Like most bands, buy all their albums and make your own compilation disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Music","review":"Before I bought this album I only knew two Sparta songs. When I heard they were going to play again after 4 years of not doing so this past November 17, 2011, I bought this album. It is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I keep listening to it from beginning to end and they are even more amazing live! I have not heard their other two albums but after listening to this one I can tell you I'll be doing so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent album, poor follow up.","review":"I really enjoy this album, though I am disappointed that it was delivered by Sparta. The band which had a very unique release with Wiretap Scars seems to have gotten sucked into the mainstream formula of making music. No bad, but I find the sound of this album to be far more generic than their previous effort. Porcelain is still fun to listen to though, regardless. Catchy, energetic, and somewhat moody... despite the lyrics being rather shallow. The instrumental and drum solo are nice touches. My recommendations to check out would include 'While Oceana Sleeps', 'End Moraine', and 'Tensioning.'If you didn't like Wiretap Scars because of its raw sound, give Sparta another shot and try this one out - it is much more polished and may hold new appeal. For those like me who loved Wiretap for its intensity and style, you'll probably miss the classic Sparta intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid follow-up to Wiretap Scars","review":"I think Sparta have finally carved their niche with this album and proved that they can do amazing things post At The Drive-In. Amazing songs pretty much throughout, especially with \\"While Oceana Sleeps\\", Breaking The Broken\\", \\"Travel By Bloodline\\". The closer to the album \\"Splinters\\" is absolutely amazing. All in all I think a very strong follow-up album to Wiretap Scars. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because I think the production and mixing is a little below what Jerry Finn can do. But again this is simply my opinion and I do realize that they were probably going for a \\"rawer\\" sound that the last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your $","review":"I was hesitant to buy this one, as I thought their first album was just OK, but since I knew they were talented, I rolled the dice. Once it entered my car player, it stayed there for over a week straight.

I dig this album, hope you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"this cd is awesome. tho i wont say its an improvement from wiretap, they do experiment a little. tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, and 14 are all good tracks IMO. but the stand outs are tensioning and while oceana sleeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could learn from Mars Volta","review":"Okay....with the break up of ATDI, It is pretty obvious that all the talent went to The Mars Volta. These guys don't suck. They are just boring. They sound like every other band I have heard before that is out there making music with no uniqueness really. People think just because they can play an instrument that they can get a deal and start a band. This is what Sparta did just like all the other 500 bands in the industry who all sound exactly alike. The MArs Volta has tried new things and these new things have separated them from the 500 other bands. Like Tool, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, And Queen...Mars Volta tried something different, which has gained them a great amount of respect. Sparta? I can name a million other bands similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dregs of ATDI finally crash and burn.","review":"Of the two bands that ATDI splintered into, it should be obvious at this point which one is actually worth listening to. The Mars Volta makes intelligent, frenetic, insane polyrythmic guitar-prog music, while Sparta have found their niche in the world of tepid, whiney radio rock.There's nothing interesting about this album. There are songs that are slightly catchy, but nothing well written or particularly original. Even the cover looks stupid.

In the U.S. they both could have been Van Damm's comeback films. Derailed- stinks. If your a film junkie, do not buy this triple feature. All 3 films are full screen. You really only need Wake Of Death and In Hell. I purchased both from Amazon marketplace sellers and got them cheaper than the cost of this set. In fact Wake Of Death was the best $3.00 movie I ever purchased. (.01 cent plus 2.99 for shipping) Whats funny, I am not a fan of JCVD, I just kept reading great reviews on both films and the fact that Ringo Lam and Simon Yam where involved (One of my favorite HK directors and I am a fan of Simon Yam)in the making of each film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this Van Damme Double pack!","review":"Derailed-No stars! Everything in this movie really is horrible! Fights, story, music, editing, effects, etc. Do not watch this one!Wake of death-3 1/2 stars! Now this is more like it! The story telling can be a little sloppy at times but for a low budget movie this one caught me off guard. Decent Action, great acting by Van Damme! He is so much more interesting as a dark or broken character. And 100 times better than Derailed! LOLIn Hell-3 1/2 stars! Another good straight to video film for Damme! Decent fights and good performance by Damme! I thoughtit was interesting that Damme was not a fighter but a regular guy turned into an animal. Alot better than the cheesy Death Warrant film!So in my opinion these are two of his best straight to video films, buy if your a fan and stay away from Derailed!

This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except \\"turn off the television\\" and \\"read to your children\\". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is advocating an elitist and pointless view of education. Bennett, has missed the core issues of what it means to be an educated person, especially in our every widening (global) society. Bennett advocates a people who are full of facts and \\"trivia\\" knowledge rather than pushing students to be critical thinkers who can solve problems, read with intelligence, and interact with the world from a stance of tolerance and intelligence. There is no \\"yard stick\\" that can measure intelligence. What rubbish. This book is designed to shame parents rather then educate anyone. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for all Parents of Children K-8","review":"If you are assuming that your child's school is doing a fine job of educating your child or that your child's education is similar to the one you received, you must read Bennett's book.

He does all the things farm kids did in those days. He fakes sickness so he can be home when the new tractor drives in the lane, rides the cows, makes pets of everything, falls in the creek. His dad farms on the contour and the neighbors think he is crazy.

With an extensive index and related subject references at the end of each chapter, navigating the book is easy. It's size is enough to make most readers weak in the knees, but if it's treated more as a reference book to be used as the situation arises, you'll soon reserve a place of honor on the desk for easy reach. Most of the instructions are easy to understand, even for beginners like myself. There are some areas I've avoided for when I feel more comfortable, but that is a very small portion of the book. I do sometimes wish the examples were a little less basic to help take the reader beyond the very simplest concepts of database management. But, then again that's what really makes this book so helpful in the first place.

Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong. The screen quality is just plain awful. If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all.

For example, \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\" almost got me in an accident when I was driving it was so hilaripoignant. There is a song about a mule skinner on one of the CDs I never heard before.

MacIntyre provides a new introduction that critically reviews what he sees as the strength and weaknesses of the book. The book itself, however, is unchanged from the 1964 text.Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through. MacIntyre presumes the reader has a basic understanding of the ideas and philosophers he discusses.But for those with adequate background this is a wonderful book, full of many insights. Be warned, though, this book is not a neutral review of the subject matter. In this book MacIntyre lays the groundwork for his own particular version of ethics (developed most fully in After Virtue).Much of the book is dense and part of it is, arguably, poorly written. But it is worth the work needed to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot to recommend.","review":"This series is my first experience reading Moorcock.

It combines musical film with 1950's mystery. It's a fresh take on an old plot. It was also cool to see so many great French actresses in the same movie. Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, and Fanny Ardant steal the show, but all eight actresses turned in a nearly flawless performance. There are a lot of family secrets revealed along the way and the intricacies of the characters are played well. The ending is typically European but not an unfamiliar device to American theatre patrons."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's...Bizarre","review":"This has got to be one of the loopiest films I've ever seen. Does it work? Not really. Is it fun to watch? With these women, how could it not be? But don't expect logic in any way, shape or form. (Keeping track of who is or isn't a lesbian alone could make your head spin.) Unfortunately, don't expect good songs, either. Why make a musical with such paltry material? I guess the director's answer would be \\"why not\\" -- which is pretty much the feel (and philosophy) for this entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"hello kitty is better","review":"Oh dear. If 7 brides for 7 brothers is one of your favorite movies then by all means buy 8 women which is equally silly. Life is Weird and so is this film directed by Francois Ozon who should have been kicked out of the academy for this one. Arnaud De Moleron, the set director, should never be employed again. The set is so ugly is steals attention away from the silly action and songs in film. Fanny Ardant is beginning to look quite piggy in the face although her figure is still fine. If the intention was to make a movie in the vein of 1950s Hollywood drama/musical this film fails on all accounts. Unless you are a die hard fan of someone in the film don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!

Isabelle Huppert gives a scene-stealing performance, and there is nothing bad to say about this film. See it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainly for movie addicts","review":"On first sight this is just a whodunnit: during a roaring snow storm the man in the house is murdered and the 8 women who are left behind all have had a reason to murder him. The cast is impressive (where else do you find 8 superstars together in one movie?), but the story line is rather thin.This is because the story is not the major feature of the movie, but the references to other movies and genres are. Unfortunately, when you are not a movie addict (I admit I am not), most of the references will go unrecognized and what remains is a lot of over the top acting and childish, and often not very well sung,songs. A movie which will be certainly enjoyed by people who have a good knowledge of movie history, but it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The French don't get it","review":"This movie was made just after the first resurgence of movie musicals, the first round being Moulin Rouge, Knight's Tale, and Chicago. So the French decided to get in on the trend and do a musical as well, but apparently this is much too happy a concept for the French personality, and they butchered the job. The movie is filmed like a British stage mystery; 8 women snowed into a house with a dead man, murdered by one of them, telephone cut, who's next to be killed? On this level alone, the movie is trite, unimaginative, and poorly done. Then to make it worse, at some point each one of the 8 woman will have a singing/dancing number, unbelievably bad choreography coupled with a song of no musical value, some of which are actually painful to endure.The only way to get anything out of this movie is to turn off the sound and just watch Catherine Deneuve act and move (except for her badly done dance number)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"If you have no taste....no morals......and are tone deaf and have time to waste then this movie is for you.

A french Version of CLUE","review":"I don't know how to review this honestly as I am split down the middle. In all honesty it reminds me of the American film \\"Clue\\". Everyone is stranded in a big house, one person gets murdered, and everyone has a motive. I didn't like the musical numbers and really the film didn't hold my interest very well. I did get a kick though when the mistress arrives, sees her dead lovers body, screams, then runs to the firplace and starts singing and stripping off her clothes while singing lines such as \\"When the bill comes, you have to pay\\".Watch \\"Clue\\" instead, it is much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE 8 1/2 WOMEN INSTEAD","review":"Imagine getting snowbound in a cabin with 8 WOMEN (Universal) and a dead body and then have to witness each woman sing and dance (badly) as they tell their story.

It was a desperate-to-be-different movie with corny dialogue and even cornier subplots. The characters are two dimensional and are all arrogant in one way or another(other than the maid). You just can't have a \\"wacky\\" and risque movie; the mediums simply don't mix as is proof in this film. I am a fan of our ArtHouse movie theater, and attend regularly, but this movie was one of the worst I've seen there. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no - I had to end it!","review":"I agree with the others that gave it one star. I was expecting a much different movie. It was trying to be different, quirky, and funny and it was none of these things. I did not care about the characters because there was nothing of substance to care about. I realize it was a comedy that was supposed to be light and funny, but it did not make me laugh, in fact I was cringing at the performances especially the established older actresses. The songs were awful or maybe it was the bad singing and choreography. I am no movie critic and so if you want to risk the money be my guest.

For a charming musical, for example, see Sous les toits de Paris directed by Rene Clair in the early 1930\`s. The forgettable songs in 8 Femmes are stiffly rendered by actresses who can\`t sing and can\`t dance. The drama of the murder plot is oddly juxtaposed against giddy females singing about, well, who knows what? The songs are not organic to the movie, just added on at odd intervals so each of the eight ladies gets a chance to demonstrate her non-talent. Where is Ginger Rogers when you need her? And you need a score card to keep track of all the ladies who are in reality lesbians. The scene with Fanny Ardant on top of Catherine Deneuve was, well, beyond words. Kindly run, do not walk, to the nearest exit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the Musical Out","review":"I found it to be a good movie to watch as the women of the mansion try and solve the \\"murder\\" of the patriarch.

The movie itself was good but it could do much better without the musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy fun","review":"Well, no one said it was supposed to be serious, and it's not. It's just a silly, riotous evening of laughter, some of it so 'out there' that you can't believe you're actually watching it. Cast is loaded with French 'name' actresses, all 8 of them. Full of sidelong glances, over the top cliches, French stereotypes, nut-ball songs and dances - and a murder. Dum-de-dum-dum. With skits and schticks that'll keep you up giggling as you remember them later in bed when you're trying to sleep, and with a setting (remote snowbound country home) that is sure to remind you of some of Agatha Christie's classics, this one is a winner, all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dark farce","review":"that can't decide whether it's a murder mystery or a parody of one. Each character has a < gasp! > song, each worst than the last. Its message is the women in any man's life will drive him crazy. Sure, the eight women here are the best that French cinema has to offer, though Catherine Deneuve is a bit of a dumpling despite being typecast as a closet \\"Sapphist.\\" But the movie's unit setting is more typical of stage than cinema. And it drags, horribly. You might find its compendium of French insults interesting. But if you don't, it's just a director stringing cliches together to abuse both art & audience. Probably not worth your time, and certainly not worth your trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 Women","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie.

I did not think the structure and writing to be very good either.However, looking at some of the reviews, many higher ratings went coincided with admiration of a zest for life, unbound enthusiasm, empathy for indulgence in food, music and sex, and a readiness to forgive blatant sexism, quasi-philosophy, and Taliban-style clan justice. Lower ratings were not as easy to connect, but many less positive reviewers had a more jaded look on life, did not suffer fools gladly, and would not spend a lot of time with either Zorba, the narrator, or the murderers of a suspect widow.In the interest of disclosure, I am a 62 year old hetero European male, and I would find spending time with the narrator cruel and unusual punishment, but I could possibly get to like Zorba, on condition he'd shut up, and play the santuri."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a classic?","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it.

The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset","review":"Love the performance. Love the support. The only problem I have is with the durability. I've owned two.

I got this set as a gift and used it occassionally for travel. I found the headphones too bulky to take with me most of the time. Still, I found the noise cancelling to be great and enjoyed the sound quality. Unfortunately, the headphones began making loud vibrating noises after about a year (and 15 total hours) of use. Bose will fix them for $100 or offer me a credit toward a trade in on the Series 2 of $112 (I would pay $188 + tax vs $300). I am not impressed enough to pay this for a new pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable support policies","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with T. Gardner. I loved my QC1 headphones, which I bought for use in an office with noise problems, until they started making a noise that I liken to the noise of a nearby helicopter. The noise is not always there, and I can usually make it stop by fiddling with the positioning of the earpieces. Bose support has offered me two options: repair them for $100 or replace them with QC2s for $188. I consider neither reasonable and unless I can get them repaired for a nominal charge, I will never buy another Bose product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but flimsy construction","review":"In my opinion, the sound quality is quite good.

There is a design flaw in the headband whereby the plastic covering on the sides will crack after 2+ years of use. Turns out, after contacting bose, the headphones are neither factory nor user serviceable. You can exchange them in for a new pair at $100 cost. That's right, if anything breaks whatsoever, you are expected to buy a whole new pair. So instead of just stocking spare plastic headband parts for $2, bose wants you to pay $100 for another pair once these fall apart.

The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack (right at the L/R labels). They eventually crumbled and fractured, causing the cups to fall off.

My complaint is for $300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I bought these, they work wonderful for sound reduction if you only use them once in a while.

It took me a while to figure out where the black specks on my shirt were coming from. They continue to flake even though I tried to remove as much of the loose material as possible. I emailed Bose about this and their response was that I could bey a new set of pads for $35. So basically I'm going to be out $35 every 2 years or so to keep these in usable condition. Sounds like a maintenance plan to me, I'm very disappointed with the responses from Bose on this issue and based on this and on reading other reviews of this product, have decided that Bose is not a quality product.

The first time they broke I paid $100 for a replacement pair, and the replacement then started to crack in the same place as my first pair! So I quickly pulled out the black electrical tape and effected a repair before they completely broke again. My self-back-patting was shortlived however when they broke completely at the swivel joint, while I was wearing them. I treated these headphones with the utmost care and they still broke. I fly a lot and the noise cancelling really helps reduce the fatigue from the engine roar so I will try another manufacturer, probably Sennheiser. I always found the sound quality to fine, not great but when you're on an aircraft you don't expect much. But I do expect something that costs $300 to be able to stand up to the rigours of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's much better out there, people!","review":"Tried one of these in a Bose store, oh my God it was a joke. Drums sounded muddy and boomy at the same time, highs were shrill and unnatural, and voices sounded completely hollow.The Sennheiser PXC-300, at 2/3rds of this Bose's price, blows it out of the water in all departments: noise cancellation, physical comfort, and most of all, SOUND QUALITY.Me, I'm no hoity-toity \\"audiophile\\"---but I do have friends who are audiophiles, and they do plenty of headphone listening, contrary to the previous reviewer. In fact, many audiophiles will tell you that a two hundred dollar pair of quality headphones can easily surpass the sound quality of a two thousand dollar pair of speakers!To be fair these Bose headphones sound slightly better than the under-100 dollar competition by Sony and Phillips.

From the White Room with black curtains to the ever popular and often covered Sunshine Of Your Love, the band had some of those air guitars players playing until they couldn't play no mo'. Although the music varied a lot(anyone for tenis) the album is great! Even if the harder stuff is wanted for your collection from the earlier days, you can not count your collection complete without the first four/five songs from this great compilation.

Also \\"The Very Best of Cream\\", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album.

The first thing i thought was Beastie Boys. The second thing i thought was mixed with \\"Rage against the Machine\\". yes, that's right, this band sounds nothing like Limp Bizkit, it's painfully obvious to me that they sound like Rage and Beasties. With that, this band f---ing rocks. I swore to god that if i heard another rap-rock song i was going to riot. the thing abotu this band is they're not a nu-metal band. most of the rock-rap bands are nu-metal, which means they're depressing, dull, and boring. this band is anything but that. they've got the melodic/funk side of the beastie boys, and the hard rock side of rancid and rage. i'm not saying this is anything too original, cuz it's not, but this band can really pull off a Beastie Boys version 2.0 extremely well.

I thought \\"Wow, maybe there is hope for rap-metal.\\" So I went out and bought the CD expecting great things. First off, like every other reviewer mentions, these guys want to be the Beastie Boys so bad, but believe me friends, these guys can't even hold a candle to the Beastie Boys. This whole CD is dreadfully boring, and now \\"Stick Em Up\\" is starting to sound just a little to manufactured. Nothing caught my ear on this CD, I was just so bored.

I do not recommend this CD at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 thing even slightly remarkable","review":"Okay, I knew going into this CD that it'd be heavily rap influenced after hearing Stick Em Up. I was extremely disappointed. It's basically all rap. They just get some people who are not even listed as part of the band to play an occasional riff on the guitar or provide background bass. The only thing that made this CD worth it was \\"tarfur.\\" it's supposedly the first rap song written entirely in Icelandic. However, Quarashi makes Limp Bizkit sound like Metallica, Quarashi is so heavily rap. I wouldn't recommend it, cuz they're not even very good MCs.

I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock.

A brick through Lora's window and the destruction of a piece of heavy equipment at the construction site deepen the community's concern. Soon there are two dead bodies and an attempted poisoning. Faith, as always, feels that her investigative powers are superior to the police, so she sets up a trap for the person she suspects is the murderer.

It's overpriced by $7 compared with the Spartan Sports Talking Pedometer (almost the same product except different colors for plastic). The stride mechanism also sticks occasionally and I have to shake the device to get it to work.I agree with previous comments - there are some problems. It's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns on the very annoying music, and it's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns the alarm on, and it's too easy to accidentally press the big button on the front that will speak the number of steps and distance you've walked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artbymarilyn.net","review":"I bought this item because mine were old and broke.

The first 50 pages were okay, because period pieces are not always my favorite. I hung in there since C.S. Lewis is my favorite author. I'm so glad I did because I got hooked. By page 50 I was so engrossed I couldn't put it down. By the last 50 pages I finally understood what the book was REALLY about and finished the book sobbing at 4 in the morning. It's been over ten years since I first read it and I think of it often. It makes you think about your own life and if you are having an impact on those around you for good. Why are we here and what are we doing about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greek myth for todays reader?","review":"I struggled with this book from the very beginning. I look at all the 5 star reviews and wonder what is wrong with me but the book was boring and never went anywhere. I found myself wading through a lot of unnecessary verbiage that only made it all go that much slower. And the story itself didn't grab me as being worth the read. Maybe I'm too impatient and want the writer to get to the point and have a little excitement, but I didn't find it as one of Lewis' better books even though it is touted as that. I'm not a great fan of Greek mythology and often struggle with Lewis' writing so the combination of these two did me in from the beginning. His writing didn't help me \\"see\\" what was happening, nor why. I guess I don't appreciate what the world calls \\"great\\" writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewis' Masterpeice","review":"'Till We Have Faces' is not the retelling of Cupid and Psyche, it is the story of the troubled sister watching from a distance. Reading this story was like looking from the outside in; the view of a non-Christian of the beautiful, but mysterious joy of the Christian. It is a breathtaking story told in a style completely unlike Lewis, bringing together the light and dark of a legend of ancient Greece, with a deeper understanding of human nature.\\"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\\" ~1 Corinthians 13:12"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"This story is beautiful and haunting. It is so very human and so much more adult than the Narnia series, yet still has something childlike in its portrayal of love, family, and heartbreak.The myth of Cupid and Psyche is somewhat well known. C.S. Lewis mixes classical Greek elements drawn directly from the myth with an almost tribal sense of spirituality and a fairy-tale setting to tell a wonderfully unique and thought-provoking story from the point of view of Psyche's sister.We feel firsthand the heartbreak and intensity of first love, family love, betrayal, and loneliness. This story draws fewer allegories than Lewis' other fiction (Narnia, Out of Silent Planet trilogy, Screwtape) and instead is a powerful story from a wonderful storyteller which is much more subtle in its morals and questions of life. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the usual CS Lewis","review":"Having heard much about this book from a Wheaton professor, I finally read it with an expectation of receiving great insight. For that, I will have to re-read, I think. There are hints of truths, some of which I know I missed, since I am accustomed to didactic presentations. Didn't quite realize until the end that it is indeed a retelling of an old myth. At any rate, it is an interesting read, even if taken only superficially."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One I missed","review":"I thought I had read everything by C.S.Lewis, and was pleasantly surprised when a friend recommended Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. I downloaded it to my Kindle while experiencing a rainy autumn week-end in Northern Michigan. Within this excellent read the sun came out, even though the rain was still giving me a great reason to curl up in a chair and enjoy the genius of Mr. Lewis. Needless to say, I spent a very enjoyable week-end because of this wonderful novel. I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"I had a friend of a friend hand this book to me, obviously excited about it. I thought this was odd at the time, until I read it. This book falls into the rare category of books that I will definitely re-read. And I'm not a fan of Chronicles of Narnia, or Lewis' other writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating, up-all-night enchantment of a novel","review":"Quite possibly one of the best books ever written. The first time I read this book I was incredibly sick and promised myself (at about 7 pm) that I would read just 1 or 2 chapters and get to bed. At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept. This book is surreal, empowering and cathartic all at the same time. It brings mythical characters who often feel cold and drab in mere textbook descriptions to life as utterly human, modern characters with a depth of feeling and thought beyond the scope of that captured in most novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myth as a light on human nature","review":"A Lewisian telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's sisters, drawn as a very sympathetic character. As always, Lewis writes well, with insight into the depths and heights of human psychology, and with subtle allegory and a taste for grand and weighty endings. It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth the time.Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian. It hasn't happened yet, though! Perhaps, having been brought up on the Narnia books, I've developed some immunity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Lovely","review":"The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, \\"I could not put it down.\\" This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply A Masterpiece","review":"There are few books in the world that make you pause, which leave you breathless and strangely still. This retelling of the famous Greek myth explores the deeper layers beneath our daily masks to the darker underbellies of ourselves that we dare not share even with ourselves. I have read hundreds of books over my lifetime and this book by far is the greatest book I have ever read not only for its simple eloquence and poetic prose but also the quiet journey of the human soul it gently leads the reader on."},{"rating":"2","title":"CS Lewis at his best","review":"I'm a real fan of Lewis for his style and character development. In this book you come to really care about and understand the protagonist. The twist at the end is amazing. I've read that Lewis named this as his favorite of his own works. Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are angry at God read this book","review":"I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. The protagonist is angry at the gods for the problems in her life. She questions their existence and condemns them for their arbitrary nature due to the difficulties that she faces.As I read this work I could see many of less desirable traits I possess in the protagonist. I, like many people I suppose have bemoaned \\"why me\\" and \\"when oh Lord is it my turn\\". Reading this book provides a mirror of such emotions.I highly recommend this work for anyone but especially for someone who might wish to indict the Gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Till We Have Faces Review","review":"This is an excellent, exciting book. It is an interesting story with a much bigger underlying message waiting for you at the end. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, allegorical tale!","review":"Lewis explores the human psyche in this literary masterpiece. You will go away with insights that you might not have considered before after reading this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I love this book even though the ending confused the heck out of me. C.s. Lewis did a great job of retelling this myth i had not heard of this myth befor until i got to the end of the book where the author tells you about the real tale and how he changed it he did a great deal the tale and he changed it for the good wich made the whole character change and gave her a different out look throughout the whole story in the real myth the main feelings of the character was jealousy twards her sister psyche and in the myth retold the feelings of jealousy arent twards her sister Psyche she feels anger twards her sister at times and she feels that her sister does not lover her anymore because she wont come home to her. This tale has many twists turns ups and downs like a roller coaster and if you miss something you might not get certain parts of the book. I still think I need to read it again. I hope this might of helped and I hope that you enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This myth needs to be retold again","review":"This book is extremely hard/boring to read. If it weren't for the fact my book club decided on this book for December, I would have given up a long time ago on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"C.S. Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and thought provoking","review":"A neat twist looking at it from the older sister's point of view. She truly believes she loves her sister. Her love like many of our loves is conditional and fear based. It isn't until she is compelled to write her story that the process of self-awareness takes hold and she goes through the myth herself. As she does this her true love for Psyche and all the others including herself grow as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is greater than justice","review":"Without one mention of Christ in this book, C. S. Lewis was able to open my eyes to Christianity. In the way that Orual bears Psyche's pain because she loves her and by then equating Orual with Ungit, I was able to realize that one of the major points in Christianity is that love is greater than justice. And furthermore, as Orual bore Psyche's pain, Christ suffered to bear our pain. This book's message is an analogy for Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complement to Life.","review":"I have never read a book with such power to haunt, to inspire. Till We Have Faces held me spellbound the first time I read it, and it's power has done nothing but increase with each re-reading. There are thoughts expressed here, thoughts that perhaps each of us have known on the flickering edge of our consciousness, but have never known to put into words. This book is incredible in the way that it matches gritty realism with a soaring myth, and make the myth so much more powerful because it becomes real. Reading this powerful book will change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Journeys","review":"Amazing story that touches on the raw experience of love, how it can go wrong, perception, the pain of recognition and forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incisive and clever","review":"I've just finished reading this and must say I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect the story to be such a clear picture of a woman's psychological maturation. The story's protagonist moves from self-pity through a life of concealed pain, and ends with her final triumph. It holds up a mirror to the way we live our lives, firmly stuck in ourselves - and when all of those prejudices and ego-tricks fall away, we get to see reality from a wider perspective. We are changed forever.The book is classic Lewis - moving, funny and entirely compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable literature","review":"I purchased this book reluctantly. It started out methodically(as THAT HIDIOUS STRENGTH) but had an ending that literally knocks your socks off. I expect a Christian theme with Lewis, but this story delved into more morphous questions of diety and love. Definitely one of Lewis's top five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late arrival","review":"I received this book in late December, months after I ordered it and long after I needed it. I contacted the seller and received no reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I mention tedious...?","review":"Boring, snoring, not in the least alluring...obvious, sophomoric and terribly uninteresting...Oh yes, and did I mention tedious ? I'm sorry, but this book was torture from beginning to end (in my humble opinion). With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards. Perserverance is not always a good or noble thing I suppose, as the time spent reading this book could have been better used in more enlightening pursuits.Similar sentiments have been expressed to much greater effect (for me)in a number ofplaces...from the Bible to the classics to poetry, music, opera etc. *JTQ"},{"rating":"1","title":"A REVIEW OF TILL WE HAVE FACES A MYTH RETOLD","review":"Sadly , and with great disapointment. If i am honest i will have to say that this is the most boring and awful book i have ever read. Like the last commenter i had to put it down well before the end. the title should read \\"a truely boring book\\"i am an avid reader. I love the classics. but this has nothing in common with the real myth and the book is distressing. i found myself wanting to slash my wrists because it was such an awful and boring hysterical book that never takes off. I kept reading because of the comments of other readers. However i could not carry on and had to put this book down. I dont think i have ever read such a boring and moronic text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible book. Kindle edition has LOTS of typos","review":"I have read many of Lewis' books and this one outdoes the power of Perelandra. other reviews will give you some of that flavor. The content is five stars; the Kindle edition is so sloppily done that it goes past a mere annoyance to sometimes interfering with what CSL was communicating. Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book unlike any other","review":"This book captured my attention quite unlike anything else that I have read. The building up of each character was a work of art, the story fantastically woven between the threads of an ancient tale of tragedy and love. everything about this book made me reconsider what I truly believed to be true literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Classic","review":"There's no doubt that \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is Lewis' most profound book. Its prose is masterful: spare, stark, the best writing Lewis ever did. He creates memorable, fully human characters, especially in Orual, daughter of Trom King of Glome. She is ugly, brutalized by her father, friendless until love enters her life through two characters: her Greek slave tutor and her youngest sister, Psyche. The novel becomes an examination of loves true and false, of manipulation of love, and of the power of grace to redeem and love the unloved and unlovely. I've read this novel at least a dozen times; it never grows stale. You needn't know the original myth to enjoy the book. I only wish more readers knew about this book--even many Lewis fans are unaware of this one. It will move your heart and make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"First-time disappointment","review":"Up until now, I have never been disappointed in a book by C.S. Lewis: fiction, fantasy, non-fiction-all top-notch, gripping and beautifully told. I found the first person narrative of \\"Till We Have Faces\\" to be thoroughly unconvincing-it never rang true to me as a story told by a female protagonist. The language seemed unnecessarily stiff, even allowing for the style being imitative of epic prose. I would discourage anyone from reading this book as a first contact with C.S. Lewis (it's probably interesting as an anomaly for readers who are well-acquainted with his work.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before I expected!","review":"The book arrived before I expected and it made me happy because I would have more time to read it, before my book club meeting.I am half way thru the book but so far I enjoyed the book very much because being a C.S. Lewis book I thought it will be hard reading. Surprise! It Is Very Easy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"From begining to end a perfect example of the art and skill of Mr. Lewis. Unlike any other of his books. Yet just as wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reworking of a classic myth","review":"This book was a fast read, and coupled with the fact that I really couldn't put it down, it was a really fast read.CS Lewis is one of my favorite authors, I have many of his books, and currently have a few more on my \\"to be read\\" shelf. I love the way that he can be a cogent and articulate theologian in such works as Mere Christianity, but then he can switch hats and write wonderful works of fantasy, which have strong undertones of Christianity such as the Chronicles of Narnia (I really need to go back to those, because the more I read snippets of them, the more I realize just how Christian they are), or the Space Trilogy, or this book.What CS Lewis has done here is to take the classical Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, and rework it. Now one might say, well that myth is a classic, why mess with a classic? Well, read the book and find out. In a way he reworked it, but in another way he wrote an entirely new story unto its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm, I don't know if this was a good book....","review":"NOT!!! I'm 14 years old and I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is so creative and it has a lot of dialog- which means it never got boring- and it was so interesting! I loved it and rate it 5 stars!!*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Find in it what you like...","review":"I had not been familiar with the myth of Psyche nor with the writing of C.S. Lewis prior to picking this book up, so I walked into this story with no preconceived notions at all. I really enjoyed the plot and characters, especially for the first half or so. Then, the book became quite bizarre and abstract, and I personally became less engaged. It wasn't until the last 20 pages or so that I once again was pulled back in. Lewis helps the reader gain perspective and insight into what we have read, and this is what helped make the story worthwhile. I am not sure I would read other Lewis novels -- not being a fan of fantasy or a particularly religious person -- but I am glad that I read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the skinny on this release","review":"Four stars for the creative band, KISS, and for these strong, early records. This box is new from Universal and includes the first three CDs, \\"Kiss,\\" \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" and \\"Dressed To Kill.\\" The actual discs are dated \\"1997,\\" so they are probably the original remasters, and not new remasters, I am guessing. The box includes the three CD covers of the orignal three CDs, but no additional artwork or liner notes.

Además nos cuenta hechos conocidos como el rescate en Entebbe, el robo del MIG iraní y el asesinato de Gerald Bull.En general, es un libro ameno de leer y haber un alinea especulativa, que de cualquier modo es imposible de comprobar pues ningun gobierno confirmaría lo dicho aquí, asi que no es posible saber hasta que punto es cierto lo aqui dicho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading and buy it.

You can make labels for your needs and wants like creating and designing your own address labels for shipping packages, to setting up ordinary setups for when you need to send out traditional letters. But, my favorite featureon this software is that you can actually design create C.D. labels for jewel cases, for when you design your own music albums.

The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off","review":"I order alot of merchandise from Amazon.

This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson). Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.Strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others. A fabulous storyline that is much, much more than cheesy one-liners and ridiculous comic book style visuals and effects. And some great action sequences that will even make you say \\"WOW\\" in this era of super-sized special effects.A review can't do it justice...SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great","review":"I bought this DVD to get ready for The Dark Knight.

Don't forget it. But the 2nd disc, packaged only with the \\"Deluxe Edition,\\" is one of the most underwhelming \\"bonus\\" discs ever sold. Yes, Christian Bale's transformation into Batman is amazing, but he merely talks about it--we don't see much of his grueling eating and workout habits. There's some insight into the director and screenwriter's collaboration, but to get there you'll need to page through a maddening \\"comic book\\" interface. By the time I finished making it through the \\"interactive\\" DVD, I felt like Bruce Wayne after his parents were murdered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only","review":"This is the best batman movie ever. I did like batman and batman returns, but the last two sucked. It looked like it will be a long time before we got to see another batman film.

Come on this beats spiderman 2 and fantastic 4.This goes into more detail of how bruce wayne became batman.

Batman Begins has the action, and more importantly the plot development that movies lack nowadays. Unlike the Spiderman movie's happy happy joy joy feel with unrealistic happy outcomes to every event, Batman Begins has plot twists, deception, and is a more realistic movie in general. I'd have to say that the movie started out pretty quickly and for a second I thought they made Bruce Wayne an Asian man. This movie is probably for teens and adults versus younger kids, just because their is some \\"intense and scary\\" parts. I'd have to say this is perhaps one of the best \\"hero movies\\" and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Perfection","review":"It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days. Disappointing acting, unoriginal stories, and recycled plots create a crapfest of bad movies. However, The Dark Knight shows us we don't need to be this way. Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors. The story line, while obviously somewhat recycled (forgivably so), is as original as its going to get, and the whole movie is carried off without much in the way of flaw. Granted, you can pick things out that are \\"wrong\\" but all within the realm of suspension of disbelief.In any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Begins","review":"1st.

The acting is wonderfully perfect. The special effects are seamless. The scipt is pretty darn good. Even better than the originals, BATMAN BEGINS revives the story of our beloved caped (or winged) crusader from the very beginning, when his parents are killed. It goes from there to a wonderful semi cliff-hanger that leaves you eaglerly awaiting a sequel (due out in theaters July 18, 2008).Great acting and script. Seeing the marvelous Bale in the Batman suit is truly a thrill. On a Batman scale alone, this would've been a 5. But, to be honest, though it's great, it's not as good as Spider-man or Iron Man.

Just this one. This was the only flaw of the movie. If the next Batman movie is about drugs in 2008 then I am going to be so mad. Christopher Nolan needs to come up with something other than drugs. And then the train fight. This is pretty much a copy from Spider-Man 2. Correction there are two flaws.

It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes.

It takes forever to get going. I know it has to setup a backstory but its still really boring. Doesnt even feel like a batman movie.It barely shows the villians. Way to much dialogue and not much action. Even the batmobile scene through the city isnt exciting. It goes like 25 mph. The blu-ray pic quality is not top of the line stuff compared to the best. I looks kinda like a upconverted dvd. Watch the preview of the dark knight on the disc and you will instantly see the difference. Also the \\"League of Shadows\\" storyline is laughable. Haveing just seen The Dark Knight a few days ago, i can say that it easily a 5 star movie.

The movie was great the acting was good the directing was good almost everything about this movie was good. There are some problems witht he movie I did not like Katie Holmes acting lots, I like to see more of the villians they could of done more with the scarcrow and finaly the movie was way to long almost 2 and half hours they could of cut some things out.

As if Tim Burton invented Batman and his version is the one to respect.The Burton film was rife with inconsistencies in relation to the true origin of Batman. The Joker did not kill Bruce Wayne's parents. Commissioner Gordon did play a crucial role in Batman's development.Batman Begins is the truest version of the Batman legend and is not meant to be considered as a part of the previous films canon. It is the beginning of a whole new telling of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great edition!","review":"The original release of Batman Begins had absolutely no special features, but this Special Edition has a ton of interesting and entertaining documentaries.

Great actors, great props, great music, great special effects.4 The plot line is scary though, espeacially Dr. Crane's mask.5. A few suprises in this one: Wayne Manor burning down and Bruce's suppossed \\"mentor\\" turning out to be a bad guy.6.

I can only imagine where all these 5-star reviews are coming from: the 15 - 23 age group.It was not a great movie. The evil bad guy was obvious since they wouldn't knock out a big star from the plot like that so early. Katie Holmes was so boring and lackluster as the girlfriend, truly whiny and dull.

Christian Bale gives a moving performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the best I've seen on the big screen anyway.My only compliant was the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Why not get someone with a little more depth. Maybe it's because I can only think if her as Joey on Dawson's Creek. I kept expecting her to say something like,\\"Wait!

After the horrible Batman & Robin, this movie I entered with curiosity and skepticism. Would I be disappointed again by my favorite hero? A resounding 'NO!'. When I saw this movie, I saw Batman like I never saw him before in live-action. The moment he lifted up the corrupt Flass and told him 'Swear to me!', Batman was back and bigger & badder than ever. Nolan became my hero ever since. He is truly a master at his craft. Batman Begins single-handedly resurrected my favorite hero and I couldn't be happier. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of the Bat","review":"Initiation:This is a movie with some seriously gritty action. It begins with Bruce Wayne as a child and his first up close encounter with bats. A fear for this creature then grips him.

This link is located in Asia where he is mentored by Ninja Cult leader Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). He develops his fighting skills, however, he fails to fully develop the ability to kill.Launching the Batman:Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) finds that upon his return to Gotham City, that it has been overrun by criminals.

Nice movie, worth regular price and buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"I have just recently seen Batman Begins, I would not watch it for as long as i could remember although when The Dark Night released my wife insisted on seeing it because of it being one of Mr. Ledgers (rest in peace) last films I must say he did do quite an excellent portrayal of the Joker not Jack Nicholson but for the context of the movie he was perfect I dont think anyone could have done better although my main reason for writing this review is because Batman Begins is not rated R as it is posted for the listing of this movie here on Amazon im really not sure as to who should be addressed on this but they should correct this information because it is clearly a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you had to own ONE HD-DVD...this is it","review":"This was the film that originally made me go with HD-DVD. Batman Begins is truly not just a super hero film, but a wonderful work by Chris Nolan. Excellent sound, dialogue, picture quality is excellent. This will become a classic masterpiece like vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Batman of the three with Christian Bale","review":"This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises. Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding. It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable. The next two were more corny and seemed to focus more on the effects and not the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Begins","review":"Love the story, love the choice of casts. Would definitely watch this movie multiple times. I did not think of wanting to collect the Batman series but after watching the whole 3 movies, I would like to have them as our family's private movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"The superhero movie that wasn't afraid to be different. Instead of creating a world that was fantastical and \\"comic booky\\", Christopher Nolan decided to take the franchise in another direction and introduce a Batman that existed in the real world. Christian Bale is great as the caped crusader, and it has everything you would expect from a Nolan film; a smart script, terrific editing, and incredible action sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Movie - But Big Waste of Time !!","review":"This is a rewrite of my 'Batman Begins' review, which i just wanted to make shorter and more to the point-****Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).but i would skip this one.peace out & cheers!-CrowTurtle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy!","review":"Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set) [Blu-ray]I was all ready to watch this Blu-ray movie on the night before Dark Knight opened. When I put it my Sony Blu-ray player it would not play. I later read on the box that some Blu-ray planers need to be upgraded to play the movie. Amazon should have told me about this before I bought this item. Blu-ray players are still very costly, so I am very upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked go see War of the Worlds instead.","review":"A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm astounded","review":"at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bore","review":"I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"what!","review":"It thought this movie was going to be cool,but the beggining was so boring i fell assleep! But the end was cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Why this was so critically accliamed is beyond me. It was all...bleh. The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh. Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all. The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie. I just saw it as another silly superhero fare. I guess I just don't like superheroes. If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series. Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope this is also the end","review":"This movie reminded me of a very long music video without the music (other than the bombastic soundtrack). The plot is very thin and rife with cliches, and the characters are very poorly developed. Christian Bale conveys anger well, but his character makes no other demands upon his acting ability. Katie Holmes is almost forgettable; what separates her from a thousand other 20-something starlets is not evident in this film. Finally, I understand that Gotham is a dark place; but this film is so visually dark that it is often difficult to discern the action. Only Michael Caine is palatable, although even his character is one-dimensional.I expected much more from Christopher Nolan, whose Memento and Insomia were remarkable for their complex yet coherent plots. Like John Dahl, Bryan Singer and Curtis Hanson before him, Nolan appears to be another young director with great potential who has decided to cash in on his reputation while he still has one."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL","review":"God sitting through this was pure un-adultrated HELL. The acting couldnt have been worse if it was rehearsed and scripted. Aside from the movie sucking beyond my imagination and the villian being the most retarted thing I honestly think I Have EVER SEEN. I had humpty dumpty sitting in front of me laughing at every boring scene in this snooze fest. So needless to say humpty dumpty cut into my fallin asleep so much i wanted to just kick the fat f*** in the back of the head.Anyway...long story short dont waste your time, money, gas, or sanity on this retarted snooze fest....if you do bring something to slit your wrists with. GOD I WISH I DID"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Book Movies Suck Especially This One","review":"Batman is nothing but Hollywood garbage from a director who has created much better films such as Following and Memento. The plot is preposterous even though the creators claim they were trying to make Batman more realistic. The train action sequence at the end, pardon the pun, completely derails the movie from any realism they attempted to create in the first half. Morgan Freeman pretty much recycles the same role he's played a million times. I have no earthly idea why Nolan wanted to make a superhero film. Your money is better spent elsewhere such as the new Skinny Puppy DVD The Greater Wrong of the Right. Don't waste your money on another superhero film. Give a message to Hollywood that you want something original and creative instead of the same old Hollywood schlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta own","review":"If you are a fan of any of the batman movies, shows or comics, it is a must own. I am a huge fan of the original (Keaton) batman movies and these new ones really give the original a run for its money. Great acting too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy to be put in your DVD collection.","review":"I liked this. It was well written and the special affects were high-quality. I also enjoyed the acting and the fact that it wasn't extra corny like any of the prior Batman films. I think Bale did a excellent job as Batman along with the supporting cast. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't too thrilled with the fact that they took an awfully long time building up Bruce Wayne's character. We only get to see him in action as Batman for the last 30 minutes of the film. Another thing that I was puzzled about was the decision to cast Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love interest. It didn't seem like there was too much chemisrty between the two, to me. I think her role was absolutely pointless and it added nothing to the film. Other than those two things I think its a decent film to rent or possibly buy to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great origin story, in classic Nolan fashion","review":"The movie is great, but the service (and prices) amazon provides for this film is great. I'm very happy to have bought the rights to this digital product rather than buying a dvd from some brick and mortar retailer! Great movie, great convenience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"This movie is great. Better than that, watching it on Amazon saved us from having to find copy somewhere.

I highly recommend anyone to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"All right, I do admit a like for the first four, but this one knocks them all out of the running. This is how Batman was meant to be seen. It is the closest thing to the dark cartoon series, and the comics, I have seen. The size is giagantic, and makes you feel surrounded as you watch. Christian Bale is perfect for this role, he has an underlying tension, that makes all of his characters verge on psychotic, and a few actually were, but for Batman, it was perfect. The ability to get so many well known names to come across as these characters believably is wonderful, and makes you care about all aspects of Gotham City. As long as Chris (Nolan) stays on this same wave length with the rest, Batman will never die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Batman has obtained cult status with all ages. And of course I am a fan of the big black bat and own all the other movies.Actionwise this movie is fantastic. The special effects in the battles are very good. I have seldomly seen better. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that there are some changes in the storyline which have already been explained in the earlier episodes. I think that takes a lot of the realism away. For instance some parts of the beginning of batman have been changed, where little bruce see's his parents die, which was a main part of the movie with the Joker. But I don't want to kill the suspense.I really think this movie is worth watching and I am glad that I got it. I definetly recommend it for any Batman fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME High Definition PICTURE AND SOUND!!!!","review":"Listen up!!!!Get yourself a HD-DVD player and be ready to be blown away with this movie...

INCREDIBLE!!!This film is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This is a different Batman alright, it's definatly darker. Christian Bale makes a good Batman as well. Not enough Scarecrow though. From the trailers I thought this would be Batman vs. Scarecrow, it's not theres about three vilians in the movie. Scarecrow is cool vilian I like the gas as a weapon and how the screen got all distorted when he used it and how is voice sounded when he put on the mask. His first appearence on screen kind of creeped me out. All in all this look like the begining of a good new franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best batman movie hands down, Anxiously await release of the DVD and the Sequel","review":"Batman Begins a new generation of Batman movies and if this movie is anything to go on the movies to come will be worth watching and buying. In this movie the as the title states shows the beginning of Batman from where Bruce Wayne was before to how he decided to use the bat and because \\"Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread\\" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman. I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled. But I eagerly await the release of the sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BATMAN EVER","review":"This movie IS Batman. Everyone (except young children) will love this movie. Period.

This is how Batman is supose to be done!This is a film well done and needed so badly to keep the Batman alive. It developes Bruce Wayne from a small boy to his training to become a crime fighter and finally to becomming fear itself in the hearts of of those cool bad guys in Gotham.We finally learn where Batman gets \\"All those wonderful toys\\".A great flick for comic fans and anyone who likes action and a great story.

I would add 'Addictive and Philosophical'. This film is ultimately about struggle between means to fight injustice, and their own philosophies, which, I think, is portrayed handsomely, but little artificially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman begins to be better than ever","review":"Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll try to keep it short","review":"Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman.

Christian Bale, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and the greatest living actor today... Gary Oldman. What more could you ask for?This movie introduces the beginning of Batman, as well as introduce two new villains from the Batman live-action franchise - Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and action, as well as a very nice ending. Gotham never looked as beautifully depicted as Nolan has done.

This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time.Christian Bale has taken Batman and made it his own. I didn't think anyone could top Michael Keaton's performance as the dark knight, but I was wrong. The entire film in itself is truly unbelievable. I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie.Let's not forget the locations that we see in this movie. All truly breath taking. Batman fans rejoice! This is a movie that is not something you should miss. Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie.

Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there. Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching. Is he in Tibet? Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up. Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was. The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion). Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this. But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars.

The plot and character development of this film are sorely lacking even for a comic based character- as it relies entirely on non- stop action. I enjoyed action films when Arnold was the big star of the time, but Batman Begins lacks any real excitement and is incredibly over-serious and lacking in humour.Christian Bale lacks any personality as Batman. Michael Keaton was infinitely superior.

The acting was wonderful....every one really put everything they had into their given role. I loved the fact that we got to watch Jim Gordon as he rose through the ranks over the course of the movie. Micheal Cain had some funny lines and all the flashbacks with young Bruce and his father really tugs hard on your heart strings!

There is really not a lot of depth, but these type of movies don't need a lot of depth. Here's why it's a 5 stay film:1) The overall story is interesting and flows very well.2) A number of top notch actors give good performances.3) The movie stays on track in doesn't get side tracked by focusing too much on a particular villian, as some of the previous Batman movies did.4) Christian Bale is one of the best Batmans we've seen. He comes across as a legitimate Bruce Wayne, someone who is a little secretive but who we can still get to know. I always felt that Val Kilmer was too aloof and Michael Keaton doesn't seem tough enough.5) The special effects are very good.All in all, there's a lot to like about this film. I's one of the most fun movies to watch of this year. Just be prepared for fun and action, because you're not going to get a real deep drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie more true to the comics","review":"finally, a batman movie true to the comics.i didn't like the 4 previous batman movies but i loved this movie!! i'm picky when it comes to batman but this one remains true to the character. i have the deluxe edition dvd and its great.highly recommended for \\"real\\" batman fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Batman Film","review":"This is the best version of Batman to ever hit the screen. It beat Tim Burton's 1989 version all to pieces and back again. It is dark, stylish, and true enough to the comics to make die hards happy without alienating moviegoers who are not up to speed on the comics. Think of it as a wink wink, nudge nudge by use of character names only comic readerswould know.The cast is absolutely superb. Christian Bale brings just the right amount of tormented soul to Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and Katie Holmes is as pretty as always. Add in the usual fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Liam Neesom, and you have the best comic book based film ever.Please suppot this film so we can get bigger and better movies featuring comic book characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"I love all of the batman movies. I didn't want to watch this one at first because it didn't seem to fit with the batman stories, but I finally broke down and watched it. Twice. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was great but Amazon's streaming on my ROKU was so poor it was hard to watch","review":"The streaming was so poor I eventually gave up and searched for the movie on my Verizon FIOS where I watched the last 30 minutes on TNT (with commercials) where it was also playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"just wow","review":"This movie was good, and the second one was even better. The third one was a piece of poop though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up to bat!","review":"\\"'Batman Begins' at last penetrates to the dark and troubled depths of the Batman legend.\\" - Roger Ebert, douching himself once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick, slow DVD start","review":"The BD version takes the SD version to a whole new level! The colors are brighter, the clarity even better and the audio is fantastic - just as you would expect with a great movie in a full HD format. The only flaw is that this disk starts up rrrreeeeaaallllyyyy slow - so slow that I was all ready to send it back to Amazon for a replacement when I tossed it into our player (Samsung BD-P1400, firmware dated 09/08) one last time and then got distracted by a phone call; when I returned, the movie was up and running like normal. Our family estimates that it takes about 3 minutes to bring up the main menu... Outside of this flaw, everything else is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY...WB HAS GOT IT RIGHT!","review":"This is undoutably the best Batman movie to date...and yes, i also mean better that Burtons!This is the Batman from the comics, the way Bob Kane intended him to be. The cast is spectacular. The tone of the movie is spot on and realistically based in the modern day world. Not only is Batman Begins a 'great comic book movie'...it's a 'great movie'-period! I foresee oscar paying this picture a couple of nods come academy award time next year...Yes... it's just that good! Let's hope the sequel keeps the bar raised just as high or higher than director Chris Nolan has pushed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !!!!","review":"Probably the best of the five modern movies made about batman, this one is the most true to the comics and the most realistic. It may be long, but most will enjoy every minute. If another film is made in the series, I hope they use some of batman's best villians in this style instead of that lame Joel Schumacher style from \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\".Again, incredible movie, outstanding story if I could give it more stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD ever","review":"The movie is amazing and worth the price. This is one of the best movies of 2005. Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer. Disc 2 is the Worst DVD I have ever seen in my life. The menu system is a series of comic panels that has only one feature per screen and you can't tell what you are looking at with out actually starting the feature, most of the time anyway. I can't watch the Disc, its garbage and torture trying to deal with. Don't (DO NOT) even think about getting this version. I am going to return my copy to get the Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition). I never get the one disc version but I will have that one now. Save your money (even if it's only $5 [if it was a fifty cents I would still tell you to say your money] it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bat Has Lost It","review":"In This Batman Was Not Very Good Maybe it was because the villian was an idiot with a moth mask on and gased everyone to see ilussions hopefully the next batman with the joker as the villian will be better i heard it comes out june 2007 with spiderman 3 and superman"},{"rating":"1","title":"BATMAN BEGINS (2-Disc Deluxe Edition)","review":"I was suprise to recieve both dvds being DISC 1 - Feature Film & no Special Features.Your FEEDBACK features did not have any column with product defect !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman begins bites","review":"Once again, way way way overhyped! I really expected this to be the best Batman movie yet. OMG was I wrong! I had to fight to stay awake through the first hour, it was so boring. I think Christian Bale sucked as Batman. It's hard to even express how stupid the Batmobile looked! And what was with Batman talking like dirty Harry? The best parts of this movie, were shown on the commercials. If Christian Bale plays Batman in the sequel, at least I'll know not to waste any money seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont play on my \\"samsung bd-p1400","review":"I was really looking forward to this title on blu ray, I already own the dvd, But it wont play on my player which is less that a year old. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality streaming video!!","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The movie quality is very fuzzy, that is, when it does play because it buffers and stops constantly. I have a cable modem and do not have this problem with YouTube or Netflix. I reported this problem to Amazon and they gave me a $5.00 credit, but that was over a year ago and the problem is still there. I'm going out to get the DVD of this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"It kind of sucked!","review":"Sorry Batman fans but I didn't like the movie much because it didn't show Batman till the last hour. I wanted to like it I really did but how can you people sit through and watch the first hour without Batman? The last hour was great but the first hour to me was kind of slow. I was about to get up and go home because the first hour was really boring and no Batman because it only showed Bruce Wayne being trained to be Batman. Christian Bale made an excellent Bruce Wayne and his voice fit the part as Batman but the beginning was too long and I really wanted to see Batman to show up but he didn't till the last hour. I liked the original Batman movies better but Batman Begins sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MOVIE!!!!","review":"I saw this movie 3 times. It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get. The acting and directing is top notch. Also the story is great. Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"good not great batman","review":"this movie is good not great because it follow the comics but not batman personalty micheal keaton got it right as far batman make up don,t get me wrong bale did a good actor but he got batman wrong i read the comics the batman keaton got right blade was better than this movie because wesley carries the darkness of blade bale don,t carry that well two because bale did he better val and geoge than two his verison it,s just as good as the frist batman movie not better than keaton this is better than superman returns for one the joker didn,t kill his pranets mr,s fox is in it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Begins","review":"Batman Begins is a really good movie. I enjoyed it because it wasn't like the comic book depictions I have seen in the past. It was more for an adult audience and showed how he got to be Batman and why. It didn't have all the silly, stupid things that the old movies had. It was more like a drama and my whole family really enjoyed it. Christian Bale was excellent as Batman and everyone in the movie did a terrific job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not that great...","review":"Batman begins is a great movie, there is no doubt about that as I'm sure you all know. That's just it though.. its the only thing great about this set. The postcard picture's are nice but whatever you know? And the comic is alright but it doesn't really have any of the character's you wanna see, it's just the bank job from The Dark Knight so it's no big deal. In the end I can only recommend this movie the the truly HARD CORE hard core fans of the new batman movie's. For me (a fan of batman but not a hard core fanatic) just the blu-ray it's self would have been a better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"As the title says it is the begining of Batman, you have to see this oneto the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best \\"Batman\\" Movie","review":"Excellent movie depicting how batman became batman. Excellent storyline, you're always thinking what's going to happen next. Great acting. This movie should definitely accelerate Christain Bales career. Good action sequences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serious Batman","review":"Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes. This movie departs from the somewhat whimsical, goofyfied villans of the last few installments and returns to a more serious feel. It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.His mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale. This is a really cool movie. I am an amature film maker so the \\"making of\\" features on the dvd are a real education. My only critique is that some of the fight scenes are shot so in tight that you don't get a good look at the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the basics","review":"Dark, hard-hitting - the Batman I have grown to love in the comic book. Still an interpretation of the Batman myth, but a believable and engrossing interpretation. The supporting cast are phenomenal, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Begins well!!!","review":"It's no Dark Knight, but then again, what is...anyway, still better than all the \\"original\\" Batman movies. At least the quality of the video is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman is back and this time he is buying Hotels and changing the rules on Swimming","review":"Good movie .. and best actor for this character to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"This one's much more entertaining than the other Batman movies. It's a good story based on Bruce Wayne's sincere desire to see justice done and his willingness to lose all to accomplish it. There wasn't too much sensuality although Katie Holmes wore some tight shirts and it must have been chilly on the set."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-9828455b"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/5.md","filePath":"drive/5.md"}'),R={name:"drive/5.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
