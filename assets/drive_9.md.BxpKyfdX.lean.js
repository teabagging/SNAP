Mel Gibson, as much as I looked forward to seeing him in the movie, was uncomfortably \\"gay-like\\" - and by all means I have nothing against gay people but he wasn't trying to act like one in this movie, he was trying to be a hot shot women's man. He just couldn't act it. Somehow Mel is not good acting funny in that way. Storyline was so-so.

The rolling credit was a great relief. What a ripoff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What WERE they thinking?","review":"Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are both fine actors, and no doubt have their choice of dozens of great roles anytime they want them. So how did they wind up in this stilted, overproduced piece of jetsam? I should know by now that any film written or directed by Nancy Meyers is going to stink, but somehow I watched this one anyhow. Big mistake! Every scene feels contrived; you can just see the writers going \\"now comes the scene where.... \\"If the same premise had been developed by the \\"Seinfeld\\" team, it could have been hilarious. As-is, it's heavy-handed and moralizing through and through. And Gibson gives his hammiest performance since ... well, ever. Ugh!

As other reviews state, it is a fun watch. Fun that is, until my wife asked me what I thought the message was going to be. When the end came, the message was clear: Women cannot do wrong. Just look at what they think (all thinking pretty much the exact same). Men (shown with Gibson's character) cannot do right. This movie was a fun movie, but much too 1-dimensional to need such a strong, Hollywood cliche message (those are for the 2-dimensional movies).

The original idea was very interesting and could have made an excellent comedy about women and emotions. MISTAKE! this is one of the worst film i ever seen in my whole life and without a doubt the most predictable and boring piece of garbage. The acting is terrible: Mel Gibson is Over-The-Top and horrendous.You can't believe him one second. I was ashamed for him. Then, we got Helen Hunt (the worst actress in history): To say that this girl can't act is an understatement. She made me sick. One-dimensional and absolutly horrible performance. The only good points are the solid performance from Marisa Tomei and the enjoyable Bette midler guest appearence but they just can't save the film. Avoid this movie at all cost: It's just too BAD. A waste of time, efforts and movie reels. 2 hours of my life i'll never get back.

That's pretty much it.So, Mel can read women's minds. So cue LOTS of scenes of women checking him out, forming clear, straight sentences in their minds (does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie? If anyone could read anyone's mind, wouldn't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish, half sentences, words, songs and ideas?)But I digress. I can buy any premise if it's well thought out and, for a comedy - funny. And this isn't any of those things. Instead we get to see Mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel, Psycho II style. \\"Are you sure you won't have any tea, Mel?

What type of script is this? Who's supposed to believe this tripe? Helen Hunt looks like an overgrown owl and any man in Mel Gibson's place would use his powers for the good of sex instead of throwing it all away. Also, when he says he's gay, I truly believed him because JUST LOOK AT HIM!!!! This was obviously a chick flick and every man's nightmare and I'd watch out because I know who the writers are. BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson-Wild on the Set","review":"The original concept was interesting. (By a freak of blow-dryers and bath-bubbles, a male chauvinist brat [normal guy] gains the ability to hear all women's thoughts.) Add Mel Gibson to the film; and you've electrified an instant classic.Almost every other line is a laugh your heart out joke; and every character in the film is acted to the hilt. It's enough to make you swear Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, and probably the entire cast and crew of this film ought to be a awarded a perscription for Riddlin.In short: if this film can't make you smile and laugh, You're Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Have You Dancing","review":"I loved this movie, not just because I'm a Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson fan, but because it just thrilled me! The great band music, Frank and Dean and Sammy Davis - the sound track is just great. On top of that the dialogue is witty and smart. The love story evolves at the right pace, with the proper hurdles along the way. The first time I watched it I wasn't sure how the main characters nearly came crashing down, but that just inspired me to watch it again! and again! and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson at his best!","review":"The subject matter of this film will generally be hated by men and loved by women. (Just read the reviews if you don't believe me) Subject matter aside, the acting was superb! I imagine Mel Gibson had a great time doing this film. He expressed just about every imaginable emotion all in two hours. It takes a great actor to combine comedy and seriousness successfully, which I believe he did. This movie may not be a \\"classic\\", but if you just want a few laughs, I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The word is: C H A R M","review":"\\"What Women Want\\" is a movie that aspires to nothing more than to charm the pants off both men and women. And both Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt succeed admirably by way of their explosive on-screen attraction. Some screen pairings don't always click but this one does in the old tradition of screen lovers like Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn (\\"Bringing Up Baby\\") or Myrna Loy and William Powell(\\"The Thin Man\\"). The story is a trifle, the production values are first rate, the music is seductive (check out the soundtrack)and the fact that you really do fall in love with both Mel and Helen is strange but true. This is the nature and result of an extraordinary love story. Isn't this all we could hope for when we go to the movies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Love This Movie!!!!!","review":"It was great watching Mel Gibson waxing and wear pantyhose...This is a great movie...He really knows how to play whatever part he is challenge with...Watch this movie with your other half and after they will know WHAT WOMEN WANT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TIRED, FORMULAIC DRIVEL","review":"I am not a fan of Mel Gibson, nor am I a fan of Helen Hunt. Their pairing here is not endearing. The jokes are tired. The story stale. The idea of a chauvinistic, womanising man getting electrocuted and then magically living through the ordeal only to be able to read the minds of all women he encounters... in his dreams. A man this callous and shallow would not use this power to become a gentler, more sensitive man. He would use it to get exactly what he wanted. Sure, his character does exploit his new gift to an extent, but of course, the end is just picture-perfect because he has become so sensitive and soft-hearted that he can practically read the mind of leading lady Helen Hunt even without his improbable skill. I am not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair stereotypes of men","review":"This movie was absolutely horrendous! All the men were...manipulative and dominating evil doers while all the women were either small, petite, no self-esteem mice or strong, commanding, feminist CEO's. I was just appauled at the awful stereotypes that were being given to men! Sure, some, if not most, guys are actually...manipulative and dominating evil-doers but if I didn't know any better, this movie was just some radical feminazi propraganda designed to make men look like the bad guys. But Mel Gibson was great, though I don't know what possessed him to take up this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't put this film on us guys!","review":"I am a woman and this movie is not what women want. This movie was terrible. The guy was a jerk and he stayed a jerk and if he came to me and told me he stole my job, I would have punched him. He would have annoyed me anyway saying every little thing I said after I thought it. Mel is old; the movie may be great for some porky housewives drooling over Mel. And the movie is filled with stereotypes--the typical skirt chasing men in the office for example. It just plain stunk and I wasted a Sunday afternoon on it when I could have been twiddling my thumbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slight twist on a cliched genre","review":"\\"What Women Want\\" is merely a slight twist on the cliched genre of romance-comedy, adding in the unique aspect of Mel's ability to hear women's thoughts. This idea had enormous potential, and potential to be funny. But this was not the case.A few cute jokes, a strange scene of Mel dancing in the bathroom in pantyhouse and lipstick, and the obligatory cheesy make up with his daughter at the end of the movie after a rocky relationship. We all saw it coming.It's a good date movie, but little else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie -- don't waste your money","review":"I'm not even going to spend much time writing this review because this movie is not worth my time. But anyway, the movie had a few cute moments, but other than that, neither my fiance or I enjoyed watching it. We didn't even finish it before deciding to sell it off. Definately not recommended. If you really feel the urge to watch it, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total flop","review":"I'm sorry but I think Mel Gibson is much too old for the character of this role. I thought the story line relied too much on crude humour, obviously Hollywood doesn't think that people can enjoy a movie without a little naughty stuff in their movies.Well their wrong, I didn't enjoy this movie because of the objectionable and disgusting crude humour,etc.. I thought that it was silly, and shallow, and definately this is not Mel Gibson's best. He's much too old for this part.I don't know what Hollywood wants women to think they want, but I know that I was sorry to have wasted my time watching it. His character is manipulative, and disgusting. I don't understand how the director, could glamourize this. It has too many offensive things for me to like it.I think that the romance storyline was ridiculous and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do women want?","review":"My guess, is that women want a stronger movie than this. It's an interesting premise. But what we have is a strictly average movie. The movie is formulaic. The movie is beneath Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, and I'm surprised that either of them took the parts. In the end he turns around to be the better man, she gets her job, love wins out, a neat, pat ending, blah, blah, blah. We've seen this movie many times before. This one just runs a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a must-rent (hint: don't bother buying)","review":"I'm neutral to Mel Gibson. He's getting old. The movie wasn't acted all that great, but it did have some humor. It's almost a must-rent, but not quite. I wish I'd rented something else, but at least now I can say I've seen the movie, and that I'm truly traumatized by seeing Mel Gibson dressed up like a woman. *shudder*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was boring after about twenty minutes. After the boredom came self-reproach, for having thought that this idea could be properly exploited by fairly talentless writers like these.It's about the level of an average \\"Friends\\" episode, which I'll admit would make it funny enough for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent if you're bored and have seen everything else","review":"The premise of this movie is very good - Mel Gibson, after a freak accident, can \\"hear\\" what women are thinking. However, the director should have given a little thought to what men want.Mel can read the thoughts of all women and the woman he choses is....HELEN HUNT? Not to bash Helen Hunt too much, but she is neither a particularly good actress nor particularly attractive. Her popularity in Hollywood can only be explained by one thing - she seems to be the only actress who can play a neurotic woman. And that wasn't called for in this flick.Let's see: the characters in the movie have no depth, the ending is quite frankly pathetic; the movie is entirely too long and unfortunately feels predictable. If you buy this movie before seeing it first, you are a fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Inept","review":"In Mel Gibson's latest vehicle--and I use the term in all seriousness; his films are like beautiful, empty cars that he somehow manages to power with his charisma--he plays a womanizing cad with a lot of charm and no manners. He's involved in a highly implausible freak accident involving a lightning bolt and a hair dryer which allows him to hear what women are thinking. He learns to be more accepting and eventually develops something akin to human empathy. And, heaven help us, there is even a cameo by Bette Midler. It's a great date movie; it's light and fluffy, like popcorn or cotton, and there's some funny business with Mel as he does funny woman things, like waxing his legs and trying on pantyhose. The soundtrack is so uninspired that, frankly, it finds itself right at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Women HATE!!!","review":"This movie was poorly designed and not a great movie at all. I rented this movie on DVD and it's a good thing I didn't buy it before I rented it. Mel Gibson is a great actor but it's movies like this that make him look bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"This movie was an insult to my intellegence. Helen Hunt must have needed work bad to portray such a dim-wit. Everything funny in the movie had been shown in the trailers. Mel Gibson as a non macho man would have been worthwhile, had he pulled it off. His attempts at being sincere reminded me of Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day before he got it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel's hot","review":"This movie rocked so much. Mel is such a hottie, even though he's old. I really did love it. Now, I couldn't get it a big fiver because it wasn't absolutely perfect. There were places where the pace kinda slowed down and times when side characters were given too much attention. The story was at its best when it focused on the love affair between Helen and Mel and on Mel's comic prowess. His advertising gig was great, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!!","review":"It's a comedy, but you won't laugh. I was very depressed when I watched this movie, the idea was wonderful but the story [was bad], the performance also is so stupid, if you watch Helen Hunt you will be confused weather you are watching Mad About You, As Good as it Gets or even Twister!!In briefe, if you are getting this movie, don't expect much!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel does it again","review":"Mel Gibson demonstrates his range of skills and versatility through this movie. His traditional characters in Mad Max, Braveheart, We Were Soldiers and other action films gives way to a funny and creative role. Fun movie, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Gibson","review":"Funny movie. Mel Gibson at his best. It's about a man trying to understand women so he starts doing some of the things women do (shaving his legs, wearing pantyhose, etc.). Bought it this time as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duck and Cover","review":"Duck and Cover, Take the Money and Run, etc are some of the phrases that come to mind when I think of how I would describe this movie. No, more correctly these are phrases that would describe why Mel Gibson would ever make a movie like this. They had to drag me to the theatre in the first place to see this film. Luckily I needed no such assistance when the film ended. Seriously, this is a very forced comedy and not a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"It's a stupid movie if you ask me and a waste of time - fast forwarded through half of it after giving it a chance. Don't like M. Gibson any more after his drunk rantings that showed his psychological state - superficial and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"I thought this movie would be soo funny, but its not.

The same cheesy love sick movie that we see all the time, only this one has a horrible story plot to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintelligent, trying waste of time.","review":"Not enjoyable. Made it through the first hour with rarely a laugh, and then gave up. Zero enjoyment. Terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Women Don't Want!","review":"What Women Want was a smash hit when it was released but this romantic comedy is unfunny and way too long. Mel Gibson gives another solid performance but I just couldn't relate to this film and I am a woman! Helen Hunt was so over-rated when this film was making millions of dollars at the box office but jeez you never hear anything about her anymore, her ship has sailed. This is a movie you rent or borrow from a friend, not worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the end does not justify the means","review":"I found that most of the good parts of the movie to be in the trailer, but isn't that the way of movies today? In all honesty, the movie was okay. It had it's cute moments but when the entire package doesn't deliver and I go away unsatisfied I can't in good conscious recommend a movie. For me the end negated anything that was good about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Guy, clever business man","review":"Gibson is a smart guy. AS one of the people who rules Hollywood, he alters the kind of movies. After the cheesy and full of cliches \\"PATRIOT\\", he changes to comedy. But along his side in Helen Hunt. The chemistry between Gibson and Hunt was just perfect. The plot has a good premise. SOmetimes it gets a little bit silly, but the general effect is an enjoyable film to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"An 18 Year Old Viewer...","review":"Ugh, this movie is shocking. It was good concept to start with, but as we journeyed deeper into the film it began to become too cliche. Most of the actors were so busy passing horrible lines at each other and being played as typical romantic comedy stereotypes, I was only entertained by Marissa Tomei's open and funny preformance. In the end the movie is nothing special, so if you want to see a good recent Gibson movie watch Ransom, and if you want to see a good recent Helen Hunt movie... Uh... watch Project X!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, bad movie","review":"What a great premise. Mel Gibson, a male chauvanist of the worst order, can hear what women think. The previews looked like the movie was going to be a great comedy. If you're looking for comedy, though, just watch the previews. All of the funny parts are in the previews, and the movie turns into a romantic drama about Mel Gibson's character reforming and seeking better relationships with his daughter and boss. This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy. Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme. Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms. By the time he's turned things around, it's too late to turn this movie around. Definately one that I would skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Enjoyable but rent it first or buy on sale or second. It is fun but not sure if it is worth full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Women Want . . .","review":"Is to stop being insulted by Hollywood. I find it difficult to believe that this movie was written and produced by women. All the female characters are 1 dimensional, and weak I might add. Even Darcy, who is supposedly a fire cracker at her profession. In the end, she can't even stand up for herself when she realizes she has been taken advantage of by someone she trusts. It's high time Hollywood and society realize that what women want is more than love from a man. They want to be healthy and have good careers and have fun hobbies. They do want to be loved, but love comes from friends and family, not just men. This movie had a lot of potential, but it didn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats the Mel I like!","review":"This movie is incredibly funny. Mel Gibson went from a macho pig to a metrosexual in all of 30 minutes ;)Aside from the great music and wonderful cast, this movie is pretty family friendly and great for all those guys who want to know what women really want. Heres a hint guys...They want you to listen to them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did watch it with my wife... she hated it!","review":"A wretched romantic comedy in which Mel Gibson can suddenly hear women's thoughts, and changes from a big sexist jerk into a cuddly, sensitive sweetie-pie. It's not so much the premise that [stinks], but rather the script and its muddled, uninspired execution. It's actually kind of surprising that a female-led film production could have taken such a simplistic, one-dimensional view of the subject. But, gosh, isn't Mel adorable with those cute baby blues?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Movie","review":"I Have looked at the movie reveiws some people have made about this movie. I thought this movie was a solid movie. The movie gave men hope of what women really want, but by no means the answers. I think this movie tought me to listen a little more to women. I think one of the best parts is when Mel is going to try and save the day. Thisgs blow up and his face, and HH is the one that saves him. I think it makes women realize that men like to be saved as well. I think it's a good learning film for both men and women. I though Mel did an excellent job. Go and buy this movie, because I am going to."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for any Paul Gilbert fan","review":"I'm a huge fan of Paul Gilbert. I don't know why I waited so long to get this CD.

Also, some of these songs like \\"Rollin' & Scratchin'\\" and \\"Robot Rock\\" are SO repetitive (I know that's the point), they get old by the three minute mark. Yet, other tracks like \\"Around The World\\" and \\"One More Time\\" are perfection, hence the classics they are. One other disappointment....where the hell is \\"Digital Love\\"? That song should be here before many of these. Still, these are all good at the least, and it's a good sampling of their three albums.

Worth the buy for the unique videos, especially Around The World.I do have to point out that the quality of the video could have been better, as I have seen Daft Punk music videos on DVD (like the collection of video from Micheal Gondry) that were higher quality, so I know it isnt the video itself, but none the less its only something a videophile would really notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racer And Tugboat","review":"I goy this boat a couple pf months ago and it has never had a problem I take it to the lake almost every weekend and the boat is great i actually saved 3 boats so the boat is really powerful it goes about 4 mph but you can pull many things on it.It is a great boat I reccomend this boat to evryone who likes boats but the people that only like fast boats dont buy it.The boat is also durable because it can get run over and still be afloat.And the people who don\`t like to buy alot of batteries get this boat because I used my boat for 3 or 4 hours strait and it\`s battery was still as good as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great toy","review":"We own two of these (different frequencies so we can race them) and have given them as gifts.

I hate toy boats/cars/planes that run on rechargable batteries - where you have to constantly charge them for hours at a time only to find that they run out of juice fast (15 minutes of use time) and suddenly (usually when boat is in middle of lake). No such problem with these boats. Overall, these boat were great. I would hightly recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing Stink","review":"TO START OFF, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT ZERO STARS FOR ALL OF THEM, BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET ME!!!!!

The love and respect of his music by so many fellow artists, along with his fans, and family, is truly wonderful, truly moving, and absolutely life-affirming.

Two words for Brian - LOVE YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"Tour\\" in this Brian Wilson DVD.","review":"This DVD takes what was really a wonderful tour and hatchets it up into so many pieces the viewer is never allowed to sit back and enjoy a concert. Every song is followed with 3-5 minutes of hijinx, fawning celebrity interviews, or spaced out ramblings from Brian himself. To make matters worse, the song selection features just about every number Brian covered that was originally sung by Mike Love, ignoring many of the gems Brian performed that he actually originated as lead vocalist. If you saw this tour, this mess of a DVD is a real disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Rated R for profanity - not for kiddies","review":"I was greatly disappointed to find that I can't share this video with all company to my house, especially the kiddies, due to the occasional profanity. Brian Wilson uses the F word once as does Ronnie Spector, and Brian uses \\"Go##ammit\\" once. I think Brian uses bad judgement to include the profanity on this DVD, as I really doubt if the use of profanity is going to add to anyone's impression of him or his DVD, but the profanity and R rating will exclude it from being marketed in the WalMart stores, so he loses a potentially big market there.But the performances and sound are awesome. Brian adds more vocal harmonies and really takes his songs to another level, its just mind blowing. I wish I could get just the songs on CD for when I'm driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but diagrams useless","review":"The book is very well written but, if you need to see what the moves look like, you'll need to get a video or another book.

Instead, what I received was a poorly veiled advertisement for the author's 4 DVD set of instructional videos.While the book does contain certain valuable facts about Tai Chi (history, etc), this is not something that you can pick up and begin doing Tai Chi exercises within an hour. The DVD on the other hand is almost completely useless and while advertising the full length 4 DVD set - looks as if it were filmed in the author's living room with long curtains hiding his sofa.I would not recommend this product.

After about the 10th time it becomes over kill. I haven't finished the book as I'm turned off by the lack of information that is true information on how to practice Tai Chi, look for a teacher, etc. As I have now found a true Tai Chi teacher, I realize how poor this book really is.

Service and delivery was prompt."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excersise in being wrong","review":"Wow, this book makes you realise how unbelievably wrong a single author can be, and pass it off as fact. She presents the argument that heavy metal and roleplaying games will cause teenagers to kill themselves, kill others, and worship the devil.It's sad that a person can believe this, and devote so much time to this. I'm sure when Gary Gygax sat down in 1970 to write Dungeons and Dragons he said 'right, my ultimate goal here is to make teenagers worship satan Hahahahaha (maniacle laughter no doubt followed). Or Judas Priest said 'yes, if we make our fans kill themselves then we'll have none left! ha! Brilliant!'An interesting book, but only when viewed from afar, as a study in how deluded some people can really be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll out the Graphite Statistics.","review":"I possess graduate degrees in Psychology and Teaching and I can attest that this books only value is as an example of incompetent statistics and poor logic. Sure, everybody can have an opinion, but Pat Pulling was a bold-faced liar. When she couldn't get evidence to support her hypothesis, she simply generated it. It is almost humerous if it wasn't such a good example of a person on a Quixotic crusade to explain a tragic incident in their own life and getting nowhere. The really sad part is that if somebody was intelligent and wanted to generate a case for what she argues, it could be done, even if it was as erroneous as her book. She doesn't even tell a convincing lie. It was sad that she never received the correct grief counseling by competent individuals before she passed on a few years ago. I hope her tortured psyche can rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can only agree with the previous reviewer.","review":"As a person who has played roleplaying games for several years, I can assure everyone that there is nobody less suicidal than me. Pat Pulling, though understandably grief-ridden at the suicide of her son, has taken her grief to far, and is using D&D as a scapegoat. If her son had played tennis before he killed himself she may well have ended up making some daft theory about tennis. Sadly, since D&D is something of a fringe hobby (although the roleplaying hobby is growing all the time) many people were fooled by her and her Fundamentalist cohorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars because I did enjoy reading it even though...","review":"... I was really expecting a lot more from this book. I purchased it for the story \\"Don't Look Now\\", which is often said is a mere shadow of what I think is a great film(even though the book came first). I felt that all of the stories pulled you in to begin with, but the endings were just flat? \\"Not after Midnight\\" was pretty good but again the ending did no justice. \\"The Way of the Cross\\" was also interesting, great character development from the little boy \\"Robin\\" way too wise for his age and \\"Rev. Babcock\\" talk about conflicted! But again the ending just left you empty? Not that I wanted blood and ghastliness, but just a bit more force or painful irony,à la \\"The Twilight Zone\\"This is a good book to read to and from work (if you take the train or bus of course!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbit is Great!","review":"Let's get the negative out of the way first. The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time. Also, turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit, which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other. The pearls are also pretty loud.Now, for the positive. The rabbit is awesome! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction. The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration, which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I've had previously, which is a definate plus. I am well pleased with the product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bent shaft, no returns","review":"This product may work well, but I'll never know. Ours arrived with a bent shaft.

Yet here, as in fragments of poetry that she translates, they shine through in eloquence.Grim subjects also appear. Especially the sourge of AIDS, which ravages southern Africa. An irony is that traditional folk healers' influences are sometimes reinforced by AIDS.

It has just enough detail to give you a sense of what it would be like there, but not so much that it bores you. It goes through all the stages and emtions of human life and puts the important things of life into perspective. Many classics tend to be a little boring and hard to follow and understand, but Dumas puts excitement and life into his book which makes it easier to follow. The Count of Monte Cristo is not a book that is easily forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Long Book(that's a plus)","review":"Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight.

Contriving to escape, he recovers the treasure and sets himself up with a new identity as a wealthy nobleman. While many people would have enjoyed their wealth, Edmund is obsessed with revenge against the people responsible for sending him to prison. He is willing to destroy not only those people, but also their families. Money can buy a lot, and he expends large amounts of his new found wealth on elaborate schemes to ruin the people. Down deep, he is actually not a nice person, and you do not want to get on his wrong side. He holds grudges and pays people back in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Simply put, I love this book. What a great book to introduce to students interested in historical adventures, and this one is spot on. It's one of the great adventure novels, with lots of action, well-written characters, important issues, and can be read quickly because of its compelling storyline. Also, there is the deception factor,which makes for great storytelling, but in this case the deception is of good in the eternal struggle that is good versus evil. Scott A.

If you are unfamiliar with the REAL version of Monte Cristo and didn't know that the actual novel is 1300+ pages, don't bother with this version unless it is required for a class.

After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, \\"the Conspiracy\\" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice edition. Wonderful story.","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stands alone as Dumas' best work. His character development and innovative storyline should be used as a model for fiction writing.

The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a \\"must-have\\" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period.

If you are looking for an abridged version of this classic tale, look no further. The storyline is well captured and with many delightful descriptions still kept in. Often, however, the story seems to move quite fast and it makes you wonder what details are being left out. The level of English is about equal to the High School senior or early college level. A number of French word's are left untranslated which help add to the flavor of this classic French tale. The price is very low and its a great deal.I would definitely recommend this novel to students studying the French Revolution and Romanticism. There is a lot of historical and stylistic content that make this novel a gem for scholastic study. Also, if you would like a portrait of the comings and goings of aristocratic Europe around 1835, this novel depicts a lot from those societies.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"One of the best books I've ever read, highly recommended.

I was actually forced to read this for school once, and was expecting some boring crap-story from some french guy I'd never heard of. I was pleasantly surprised.From the beginning, the story is set up so the main character is at the point in life when things have gotten about the best than can get. Then everything goes to heck. Dumas reallly did an excellent job creating a twisting plot and real sympathy for the very much wronged main character.

But he beat prison, he beat death, he beat all his misfurtunes, he became bigger-that-life, the Count of Monte-Cristo, just to get his revenge to all those who broke his life.This is a novel about a man whose only goal became revenge but was it the right thing to do?

I think he would have made a fortune by himself and be happy at the same time, maybe less educated and brilliant but definitely happy. I couldn't help love and admire him and was sorry to let him go at the last page of the book.Dumas' writing is brilliant and breathtaking.

It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much, if anything, missing from this version.If this is your first time reading this story, don't be put off by other reviewers who claim that it is too wordy or easy to get lost. It really isn't. And if you've only seen the movie (unless it was the Richard Chamberlain version, which in my opinion is the only good adaptation)be prepared for the ending to be different.Overall a really great, must-read book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Dantes!","review":"From the moment I picked up this book it has not left my eyes.

As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion! You're better off just buying the book instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation","review":"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Mount Everest\\" type read","review":"This is a classic for a reason.

He also said to make sure you get the unabridged version. (It is over 1400 pages long, but after the first 300-400 pages you will be glad it is so long.) Not only does this book have incredible insight into the human condition, it is also a very exciting tale of escape and revenge as well as a great \\"trip\\" to Europe.

I have read the original: it consists of two volumes each one of which is twice as thick as this book! Because chunks are take out, a lot of times you can't quite catch the story and figure out why things went the way they went. The story of Cadrousse and Andrea is missing completely, the reason why Villefort had a change of heart is not clear, the story of Danglars being kidnapped by the Roman bandits, Danglars' daughter running away from home, the results of Monte Cristo's visit to the telegraph... and that's not all!

During his betrothal feast for his wedding, Dantes is arrested because he is thought to have been a follower of Napoloen. When Dantes think he is going to get put off the hook, he is sent to the Chateau d'If where he spends over a decade of his life in prison. When he meets Abbe Faria at the prison, his life is changed.

Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic novel!","review":"As human beings, we, for the most part believe in justice. When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"You see all these reviews on this site of highschool kids says 'SOO BOORING' but these are obviously immature lazy students, who cant appreciate a great book.

I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful \\"their\\" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas.

They would say that Crime and Punishment or even such Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet would allow further insight into the main character's soul. But these books only showed the torture, and are not complete. The Count is shown to have a very brooding conscience, and though it is tainted by revenge, the involuntary hurt he gives to the innocent brings out both his tortured soul and his contemplative soul, taking each problem as it comes instead of all at once. This is how most people's trains of thought work, for as bad as a problem may become, we are always working around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mauvais livre","review":"This a really crummy translation.

When he escapes, he seeks revenge, one of the best revenge stories ever written.I do have one complaint; I read this after seeing and loving the movie (2002, Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce). The movie didn't quite follow the book. I hate to say this, because it does not happen often, I liked the movie better than the book. But definitely a must read.

But, it's a very, very long read. Not that the twisted (often convoluted) story isn't intriguing. Most of us are probably aware of the story and most of us have probably seen one (or two) of the hollywood versions of the book. Just like most movie-adaptation/written-word works, the book far exceeds the film(s). Differences are as small as location details and as large as, \\"That's how it ended?!\\"One of the things a book can do that a movie can't is give you a depth to its characters. And character development is what really lets us know (and love/hate) the heroes/heroines and villains in a story.

I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages. Now I know why...there are several chapters intentionally omitted in this version, making it impossible to make sense of the text.

My two year-old recognizes it as \\"papi's book\\" because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte.... Every character has an incredible story and every story will take you deap into the time and place and the feeling of it all....This book cannot be described. It must be read.

I can't say enough about this book that already hasn't been said. I only regret that I haven't read the unabridged edition yet.My only complaint would have to be the numerous spelling mistakes. Examples would be, misspelling a character's name in the character list in the beginning of the book... and throughout the book simple words such as was or house are typos.

Very long, and very worth every minute spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the actualy story","review":"In the \\"actual Count of Monte Cristo\\" Dumas perfectly explains all of Dante's dilemmas and how he fixes them. In this book they just pick some chapters and piece them together. So what you get is bits and pieces of chapters (and you miss a bunch of veeeeeery important chapters. Read the actual story not this thrift store jigsaw puzzle abridged version. In this book they leave out important characters like Jacapo who helped dantes find the treasure (which isn't even mentioned in this version), Danglars just magically disappears towards the end of this book but in the real one he still is quite critical to the end. I never have liked abridged classics because you never get the whole story and this is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself dont read this book! watch the movie instead","review":"THIS BOOK IS BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I watched the movie, and loved it, but was completely and totally bored by the book. on the other hand the movie was wonderful. lots of action and drama. it is about a young man who is framed and taken to the prison island of monte christo. he escapes and finds treasure in a hidden cove.

I'm an avid reader (I teach high school literature) and made it to my late 20's without ever reading this unabridged version. Man am I glad I decided to pick it up and read it. Don't be scared by the number of pages (1245). I absolutely promise you will finish it in no time. I mentioned to the person who suggested I read this version this comment, \\"there is no soul on this earth who would not like this book\\".

I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers.

I am so glad I did! My husband and I both read and loved this book. It's a great translation and I would definitely recommend the unabridged version. It was interesting in my bookclub to hear all of the different plot lines left out of the various abridged versions. Some of them were pretty pivotal! I'd stick with this great version."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved \\"Les Miserables\\" you'll love this too","review":"This book was a gift to me from my sister, and I must say it was one of the best gifts I could have received. Having recently read 'Les Miserables' (the book is so much better than a movie or play) I was primed for The Count. The stories are so similar; two men who escape prison and begin a journey towards enlightenment and salvation. The only difference being that Jean Valjean was a true criminal who redeems himself through selfless philanthropy while Edmund Dante (the Count) is a wrongly convicted man who uses his wealth for revenge. Yet both of these stories ultimately have identical moral themes.Classics such as these transcend time, and for good reason. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it; it will give you a profound sense of humanity when you put it down, and will keep you thinking well after you have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful, this one's ABRIDGED!","review":"This isn't a review so much as a warning; I never read the book once I found out that it is an abridged edition. It says so across the back of the book, but there's nothing about it on Amazon's page. I sent the book back and received a refund. If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABRIDGED!!","review":"Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted.

This is a major undertaking...","review":"I happened into a foreign film of theCount of Monte Cristo, and was charmed by it. So I checked Amazon for a written copy. Heavens, it's a 'classic'!It was originally written in French a couple hundred years ago, so you have to depend on a good translation.You may also want to concider an abridged version if lots of details and many words annoy you.It takes place as Napoleon is in and out of power, and the politicos are jumping back and forth with theiralligence. And there is misplaced love, castles, dungeons,luck, no luck etc....and I'm not very far yet! But it does make me want to read on.

Dumas kept dragging in so many characters, it was hard to keep them all straight.Part of the problem was that, if I read wiki correctly, it was originally written as a serial - you know, like soap operas that never have a conclusion. There really wasn't a conclusion, in my mind, to this book.Bought free from Amazon and downloaded to my BlackBerry and read a chapter a day for 3 months. Since I always have my phone with me, could read it while waiting for a plane or on a plane at home and abroad or in a line etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Although the story is well known to me, the editing of this audio book was so confusing.

This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best book of all!","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is truly the best book I have ever read. The book is about a young salior named Edmond Dantes who is framed for a terrible crime by ones whom he named friends. In prison he plans revenge.

I have a 3-way splitter sending the signal to the TVs in the house. My house is ~30 miles from the antennas on South Mountain with clear line of sight. Things were fine before June 2009, but since the digital changeover a few of the Phoenix channels (12, 15, 45, 51, 61) have become weak and sporadic (available one day, not the next). One of my TVs has a signal meter. It read \\"75\\" before I installed the booster, and \\"67\\" was the best I could get after I put it inline between the antenna and the 3-way splitter. Since installing the booster I no longer get 12.1 (or subchannels) on one TV, and cannot get 15.1 (or subchannels) on the others. On all TVs channel 45.1 and it's subchannels stutter as if half of the digital bits are coming through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap but does the job","review":"Worked well for splitting cable tv, but remember you must use a bidirectional splitter at least 2GZ. Do not use an inexpensive splitter; otherwise you will not get results. Cheap splitters leak signals that interfere with others. As far as antennas are concerned, you can only amplyfy what you receive clearly. If the signal is not clear, this will not make the signal cleaner. All you will do is amplify a bad static signal. This product works well with faint clear signals. However, the only way you can sometimes tell if the faint signal is clear is by trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cheap \\"2-way\\" amp","review":"I got mine at the local hardware store. It was marked \\"Two-Way\\" and 50-900Mhz and a manufacture date in 2009. Which I hoped means suitable for a modern cable system with \\"return data\\" for doing \\"On Demand\\" services. I could not find any further specifications such as \\"bi-directional with return path\\" so I wasn't going to be too surprised if it killed the return path....Pleasantly surprized it works! Signal meter on settop box (secret diagnostics screen on Cisco RNG-150) went from -12dB to -1dB, and \\"on demand\\" still works so amp seems to be doing its job - long run with a couple of splitters - now I can split the signal again without losing channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement on signal, actually lost a couple channels altogether","review":"This RCA 10 dB amp did not work for me. I had it hooked up straight from an indoor antenna to a converter box. No long cable runs or signal splitter. With such a straightforward rig thought for sure I would see a signal boost. However, I ended up losing a couple channels like ABC and FOX. I also did not notice any signal improvement on channels that I did get. Bottom line, signal worked better without this amp in the circuit. It's a mystery to me why it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing different -- Money down the drain","review":"Bought two of these based on reviews, which I now see was an inappropriate measure as the units are useless. Picked up nothing different-new than before, with the only difference being that I lost five of the twenty-four stations I was picking up from my outdoor antenna before installation.Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Things Worse","review":"When I received my order, it was obvious that it was repackaged (a previous return). That was my first hint. At the very least I was hoping for some marginal improvement on a couple of channels.

This definitely isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well for DTV signals","review":"Wanted to split my DTV Antenna signal to go to another DTV in the house.

This book proved to be the ideal choice. Each subject was introduced in a simple and intuitively appealing manner, leading logically on from one to the next. It is a real pleasure to read, for layman and technically-minded statistics-novice alike.Despite its age, its examples remain forever pertinent (after all, a standard error on the standard deviation of a sample of measurements on boys' heights, weights and examination marks remains the same in the 1990s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Treasure","review":"This book presents the clearest teachings on ststistics, and how they can illumunate the truth for any any lover of technology who may not be a math genius.

He plays with it everyday and makes up all kinds of scenarios. It is a large helicopter that seats one Rescue Hero. It has a retractable cord that has a hook on the end that the heroes hand can attach to. It also has two buttons on the back. One controls the blades spinning action, and the other pops out two compartments that hold 'water cannons' that can be fired at the push of a button as well. My son puts out fires all over the house flying it from room to room. I also love that it doesn't need batteries.

It was not only a disappointment, but also a waste of my time. I could not believe the drivel it contained. The writing is so poor that the text is actually difficult to follow, and, to top it all off, the concepts are so trite, hackneyed and saccharine that following the text yields nothing. No insight, no information, no enhanced awareness. Nothing. I am at a loss to explain the good word of mouth this paperback has received except to suggest that perhaps the people who order it for prisoners don't actually read it before ordering. It's a waste of paper, newsprint and glue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide for Ending the Cycle of Hurt","review":"This frank and loving guidebook provides a rare ray of hope to people who might otherwise remain stuck in a pattern of self-defeating behaviors. I have personally observed the changes in prisoners who have used this book with the corresponding workbook as a guide for personal growth groups. The results are nothing short of miraculous. The book is clearly written and easy to follow, making it accessible for people with all levels of education. The case examples that Ms. Casarjian uses to illustrate her points are at once deeply personal and universal. I recommend this book to anyone who is in prison or working with those who are in prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Birthday gift for my little Granddaughter","review":"I bought this 'baby' for my little Granddaughter because she has such an interest in 'babies' and she loves it.

She enjoys watching Calin's eyes open and close; nite-nite. Most of the time she 'loves' the baby then throws it on the floor! but then, she's only 1 year. We're trying to teach her to lay Calin down and not throw her!! Overall, I think it's well worth the price and I'm hoping it will be one of her favorites - maybe even a keepsake!

This book is part of his trilogy over the parables and as such one expects to find many of the same ideas articulated in this book that are in the other two. This expectation is fulfilled and amplified in this work. In reading the other two books, I remember thinking to myself, \\"Well, you have a point, but what about the parable about so and so?\\" In this work, those so and so parables that were my wall of defense to Capon's arguments became transformed into his coup de grace. This work is not one to be read -- it is to be ingested and thoughtfully considered. One cannot assume that reading a work like this leaves one unchanged. I can honestly say that Capon's work with the parables of judgment has helped me see that there is not a Marcionic dichotomy between YHWH and the Abba of Christ Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"the classic dance movie","review":"full of songs that we all heard of. 2 disk set special features some of them are commentary and alternate scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hearted 80s coming-of-age mini-classic","review":"Sweet, unabashedly sentimental coming of age tale, set in a resort the Catskills mountains- an area that was once the summer get away for upper-middle class Jewish families fromall over the New York area.The dancing is hot, the acting is a mix (Grey and Orbach are very good, Swayze tries hard,looks great, but is a better dancer than actor ).The ending feels very Hollywood, which is too bad, because the film seemed to promisemore complexity in its gently satirical look at early 60s America in the first half.Plus some very creaky, cliche sub-plots start to invade the film as well.Yet the story is told with an honest and good heart, and there's a reason it's becomea mini-classic. Do I think it's a great movie? No. But can I understand why ageneration that grew up with it cherish it as a wonderful coming of age fantasy?Absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!!","review":"I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and it is a great addition to any home library. (That's my criteria - no point in buying a movie if seeing it once is enough<G>)The love story is genuine, the music is great, and the dancing is out of this world!Also captures the times of the 'Borscht Circuit' hotels in the Catskills much as 'Marjorie Morningstar' did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"I've seen this movie many times and could watch it many times again.

Yeah, the story is lame, that acting barely O.K., but who cares? Nothing makes us feel better than that last dance. The rest of the music is top notch and fun and the dancing fantastic. No one, but no one, would be caught dead dancing like that these days tho'or so it would seem. But again, who cares? It's also kind of fun watching the other dancers. Take a close look and watch them ham it up. It's hilarious. Also, having watched it several (who knows how many?) times, I finally noticed a young girl and boy who seemed to be showing up also in several key scenes. The producer's kids maybe? Bottom line, it was Swayze at his absolute best, gorgeous, hunky, sweet, perfect hair, beautiful shy smile.

The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect. Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry.

It is a forbidden love story with a lot of dancing and is a movie I never get tired of. It is about this family taht goes to stay in a hotel where the staff are not treated so well. Baby (Jennifer Grey) helps one of the staff pay for a doctor but she and Jhonny (Patrick Swayzee) have to do the dance and so he teaches it to her and they fall for each other.

Yes there is some immature dialogue here and there and all turns out right in the end for the characters played by Swayze and Grey. However, it shows how love and affection can conquer all angles. It also shows the strengths and weakensses in both Swayze and Grey and Jerry Orbach for that matter. The Dance scenes are pretty captivating for the particular genre. Maybe not the most well developed story in the world but for a night when something relatively light will do, this flick will certainly fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hits of the 80\\"s","review":"I grew up with this movie it was one of the first and one of the best movies that Patrick Swayze has ever done.

Full marks to the director and choreographer in an absolute master-piece - Emile Ardolino and Kenny Ortega. Great movie. Only one observation though. While the movie is recorded 5.1 surround which allows you enjoy it to the core, the addtional features, which are truly collector's worth, have been recorded in Prologic mode, with the result you are forced to listen to the songs in the main film so that you get the theatrical feeling. In any case, since they are a bonus to the collector, I guess one can't get too wishful. The DVD is an absolute must buy for all music and dance lovers......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great glimpse of the now played-out \\"Titanic\\" Syndrome","review":"I loved this movie. I saw this not too long ago. I had seen the movoie Titanic and thought \\"poor boy meets rich girl, how cozy.\\" But now I see where the inspiration was!

Great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"looking back at my highschool years","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was in highschool, and being amazed by the striking characters, dancing scenes and great music. ...It may sound like a boring melodrama with rich girl poor boy from wrong side plot, but pas du tout. Patrick Swayze is sexier than he has ever been and will be, Jennifer Grey is wonderfully casted for the warm, strong willed, charming but not a classical beauty Baby. The leading woman character Baby (real name Frances) is so admirable-she is optimistic, confident, helpful, intellectuel and is not afraid to go for what she wants without being egoistic. I have to admit that I took her as a role model at that time. Today watching it again when I am 30, I still think that I can adopt some characteristics of her-at least believe that I can change stgs if not the whole world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant DVD package to match the movie","review":"Finally, an 80's movie DVD with more than just a film trailor. This one disc is jam packed with lots of goodies to watch as well as an excellent movie. Also it has a booklet.The movie is romantic and well crafted. You can see how much blood and sweat went in to the two main parts of Jennifer's and Patrick's parts. They really played the best possible and it shows throughout the movie.The entire cast infact have invested so much energy that the movie glows, unlike so many other films where no one's heart was really in the production.The soundtrack is excellent; mixing vintage 50's/60's music with modern 80's songs - which really works.In total the movie, DVD features and even the box add up to a superbly made package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love it!","review":"I remember trying to catch the movie on TV, but I always miss part of the movie. So I looked for it at Amazon so I could get it on DVD. It was on a discount. I finally got to watch the whole movie and loved it. How could you not like Patrick Swayze. I wanted this one because of the extra material that you get with it. I checked out the second disc and one of the things that they did was they got photos and videos from Dirty Dancing fans all over the country, to show how big a fan they are. It was really neat. I would recomend this to anyone who loves Patrick or a good romance movie. Nobody puts Baby in a corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Dirty Dancing DVD","review":"This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iconic","review":"When it was released in 1987, Dirty Dancing was a cultural phenomenon, and it hasn't faded in spite of the fact that it's dated and that the dancing, never really, really dirty, doesn't seem dirty at all, by today's standards.Patrick Swayze plays a dance instructor pretty-boy at the Catskills resort where Jennifer Grey is vacationing, as she's done every year, with her traditional family. They fall in love (or at least in lust), of course, and of course her father doesn't approve and sees to it that the guy is fired in order to denigrate him in the eyes of everyone and separate him from Grey.All this is predictable enough, but Grey and Swayze have chemistry, and boy, do they put on some sexy moves with their dancing. If you've never seen it, you're in for a treat. Just put your cynicism and modern worldliness on hold and let yourself be sucked into the spirit of the film. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie but the Special DVD features aren't that special","review":"This is an awesome movie, but I held out buying the original DVD until they came out with a Collector's Edition DVD with special features.As it turns out, I was somewhat disappointed by the special features. The commentary was good, but the featurette was only about 7 minutes long. Also, the 3 music videos were pretty bad quality (I am sure they were transferred off of tape that was about 15 years old). Also, the musical didn't really hold my interest. However, this DVD has so many extra features that if you only like half of them, that is still quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hoping for a little more","review":"While I can't claim to have seen this movie more than a couple of times, I did look forward to all the extra features of this dvd. I was a little disappointed in the outtakes and deleted scenes, etc, in that they were quite brief given the enormous amount of material that must have been filmed and not used. I do highly recommend the real dirty dancing scene with \\"Johhny and Baby\\"-its the most erotic thing I have ever seen in clothes. I did enjoy the commentary and trivia as well. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie I forgot was out there","review":"This movie has always been one of my favorites.

It's great to see \\"Lenny\\" (Jerry Orbach) from Law & Order in the role of Jennifer Grey's dad. Patrick Swayze is a great dancer and the music from the movie is tremendous.

Then she like trys to be cool by danceing in a dark coner by herself. Then Patrick kidnaps here and leaves here in a forest in the rain. GOOD JOB PAT. With her out of the way he's the star.

I used to dance all throughout my childhood (tap, ballet, jazz, etc), but as soon as I saw this movie when I was 15, I switched to Latin-American dancing and it's been my profession ever since.The music and the love displayed in this movie really makes you want to get up and express yourself through dance. Patrick Swayze is a joy to watch. Throughout my entire career I have never seen a man dance as well as him. Any woman or girl who hasn't seen this movie will fall in love with it instantly, but I also believe it is good for men to see this movie to get a taste of what women really want -not just a hunky guy, but a man who can show his true feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this video, wonderful music, dancing and love-story!","review":"I thought that this was a treat, it had classic boy and girl plot, wonderful dancing, and the music was fantastic!

On my 46-inch high definition TV with my Toshiba 1080p HD DVD--the picture and sound are stunning! The picture is crystal clear and sharp and the colors are rich and vibrant. This movie did not look this good in theaters in 1987, when it was first released. The picture has been enhanced for large, wide screen TVs--so there are no annoying black zones (bars) on the top or the sides of the screen. It fills the whole screen. I still cannot believe that this is a regular DVD, not a high definition edition.

However, I have a nice, large flat screen TV (like most of the USA) and when I played this DVD I was surprised and delighted. It was enchanting. The nostalgia was like visiting your past without the angst and acne. It felt good. I like a movie that makes me feel good. This is one of those films.

Not a great film but a very good one - still. I had not seen \\"Dirty Dancing\\" in several years, but my wife had to have this comprehensive addition. It turns out to be fun to watch. Not just the film, but all the extras as well. It is also sad to think that at least five of the talented people who worked on the film are no longer with us - from director, Amele Ardolino to the incomparable Jerry Orbach. And then there is Patrick Swazee. I never truly appreciated him, but have developed a respect for his talents, both as an actor and as a dancer. \\"Dirty Dancing\\" is a rollicking, coming of age film, in which Jennifer Gray is perfectly cast as \\"Baby.\\" We see the arc of her character, first as the tentative \\"daddy's girl,\\" and finally as the free-thinking woman she has become. And all with her original nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Ultimate fan!!! But where's Patrick Swayze???","review":"This is a great edition of the classic Dirty Dancing. It has a TON of special features including music videos of the 3 most popular songs and a full length Dirty Dancing concert. And of course the regular interviews and retrospectives. I am a little disapointed however. Patrick Swayze is not interviewed AT ALL and the only actor they talk to is Jennifer Grey. I would have liked to see interview with other characters and the writer talk more about how she wrote the movie. The other disk is of course the great movie! No complaints about that.

Sure its set in the early 60's - then tell me why the hell are they dancing to 80's songs? I almost shelved Patrick Swayze after this one but he was redeemed by Roadhouse. This movie could only be enjoyed by a pack of prepublescent girls at a slumber party who are wondering what its like to lose their virginity.

U remind me had sort of a moderate pace with great lyrics and a great tune! U got it bad was very slow, and had a sort of eerie yet sad tune, which made it sound like it was really coming from Usher's heart. The electric guitar solo made it even better, to liven up the mood a bit. This was better than Confessions, My Way, and Usher's first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"late and later, no show","review":"I ordered this cd Dec 8th 2009 and have not recieved this at all, the seller is at fault and I'll never buy from them again!!!!

Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"8701 Rocks!","review":"Hey guys! Everyone has gotta buy Usher's new cd 8701! It rocks the house! It is the best cd and does not suffer from the sophmore cd flop that most artists deal with. You'll love Pop Ya Collar with its edgy hard core vibes and you also get your share of ballads with songs like U Remind Me. I promise you even if u are not an Usher fan before this you will either become an Usher fan because of this cd or at the very least will be happy you bought this cd. It is so amazing!!! Usher is definetly number 1!!! There is no one else out there like him. He leaves all the other r&b crooners in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Ain't Goin nowere","review":"UsherThe hardest thing to do in entertainment is to go from a teen prodigy to an adult star. At the crossroads of his career, Usher succeeds were artist like Al B. Sure and Tevin Campbell failed. With a team of all-star writers, Usher delivers his music with and impassioned voice, and shows the true talent he is. Although some of the dance numbers are not as good as on My Way, mid-tempo groves like U Remind Me, Hottest Thing and Twork It Out are excellent and memorable. Usher never oversings, except on U Got It Bad, but all is forgiven because this is also a good song. This may be only standard issue R&B, but it's delivered exceptionally by a true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like it","review":"this has to be my favorite usher album next to confessions. the lyrics, beats and flow all work for me. he's very talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher is Back (with some experimentation)","review":"This CD takes a little getting used to. The single \\"U Remind Me\\" and the fast tracks \\"If I want To\\", \\"I Can't Let U Go\\" and \\"Good Ol' Ghetto\\" are really tight - they grab you on the first listen because they are so catchy and unique. However, there were some songs I was not too impressed with on my first listen, but with time they grew on me, such as \\"U R The One.\\" I don't really like \\"U Got It Bad\\" or \\"You Don't Have to Call\\" - I find them too slow. There is a good mix of slow songs and fast ones - personally I prefer the fast ones. Give this CD a chance - it's worth the money. The slow jam \\"Can you Help Me\\" is really sweet. By the way, Usher has also grown vocally - he sounds more soulful. And you probably don't care, but I also recommend Craig David's Born to Do It and (unrelated) the Backstreet Boys'Millenium and Black and Blue as albums that you can listen to from start to finish like Usher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher improves every time, especially on this album","review":"The album 8701 is very good. I especially like \\"U Don't Have to Call.\\" The track is very catchy and upbeat. It would be a perfect dance track for the club. I also like \\"I Don't Know\\" featuring Puff Daddy. The track is also catchy in nature and also has an upbeat tone. He balances the upbeat tracks with the slower, much more sensual tracks for the ladies. I wish he could have used \\"Pop Ya Collar.\\" That would have made it off the hook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Usher Back In The Game","review":"With his last effort placed on hold, listening to this album you can only say \\"Well worth the wait.\\" Usher modified his style with the aid of super-producers Jimmy Jam and The Neptunes, and secured his own individual style instead of bringing on mixed artists on every track like some do these days. This album flows from the beginning to end. For the upbeat tracks, you can't miss with \\"If I Want Too\\" talking about stealings girls, \\"I Don't Know\\" with P. Diddy, and the smash hit, \\"U Remind Me.\\" For the softer side, he displays lyrical range on \\"Can U Help Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\". With no weakest link in this latest effort, Usher provides his audience with one of the best R&B albums of the summer, and probably his best to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy sony dualdiscs!!!!!","review":"this dualdisc contains NO ENHANCED AUDIO, the dvd and cd layers are the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"you got it bad","review":"I THINK THIS CD IS THE BEST YET..

I listened to the 30 second sound clips and thought 'Hey, what a great album' but when I went to Wal-Mart, got it, and then listened to it, I thought 'blah'. Usher sounds like Eminem! (Not a compliment by the way) His music is just...blah.

It was sometimes unclear what was happening and how everything worked. The drawback to such a finely detailed world is that it's difficult for the author to introduce all the content we need to know in an interesting way. I found the characters actions somewhat unrealistic, perhaps because I didn't know enough about the class and race dynamics involved. The author is a perfectly competent writer, but I just didn't like her style. I'd recommend reading excerpts before buying to see if you have the same reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I'm with the other reviewers. Confusing, needing to reread pages because of the choppy writing and the heroine is not very likeable. Keeping the reader in the dark about what's going on made it hard to read, I almost gave up on it. I certainly didnt hurry to finish the book. At least I got more done around the house because it wasn't hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even after finishing the book, I still wasn't quite sure what it was about","review":"Once an impoverished and homeless orphan, Kaylin has worked toward becoming a Hawk, the equivalent of a police force in this fantasy world. The recent deaths of local children hit entirely too close to home as she becomes involved with trying to discover who/what is causing them. Although I haven't exactly come to expect greatness from Luna books, this was disappointing. I spent most of the book confused -- not only about the immediate goings-on, but also about the entire plot in general. I didn't feel I had enough information or understanding about the world the protagonist lives in or even about Kaylin herself for the story to come together and make sense. Fans of other books published under Harlequin's Luna imprint will be disappointed in the absence of any romantic element to the book whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book...","review":"I honestly don't know how this book earned so many 4-5 star reviews. When I bought it I actually hoped for a \\"Linda K Hamilton-esque\\" type of book - I mean sort of a junk food for the brain type of fantasy...But I can't even finish this book. I confess I am on page 113 and I can go no further.I just wonder - who edits this krap and decides to print it? Just awful.For those of you (like I was) wondering if you'd like to buy it - I reccomend checking it out from the library before you even waste 7.99 on it.To describe - it's like if you mixed a bad Sci-Fi channel movie with a bad Lifetime channel movie and then fill with charecters from your junior high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, overly long fantasy. Nothing urban about it","review":"The cover and description on the back of this book made me think thiswas an urban fantasy. It's not. There is nothing urban about it.That's not to say it's a bad book, it's not, but it is straight upfantasy.The author tried very hard to create her own unique fantasy world fullof magic and otherworldly creatures, but the result is a bitconfusing. Even after finishing the book I'm still a little confused.This book is also way too long for the story. It could have been halfas long and had a much better pace. I found myself getting frustratedas Kaylin was called before her superior's for the twelfth time andyelled at, threatened, and given no explanation for her repeatedquestions. It felt very, very, redundant.Also, this is nothing romantic in this book. Nothing at all. Iprefer some romantic elements in these kind of books I felt it'sabsence here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hard to follow but I like it!","review":"I had to read this 2 times to catch on to what was going on (I don't think I was paying enough attention).

If I had a dollar for every time the word \\"Hawk\\" was used, I'd be able to pay off my new car! Geez, I understand the character was a member of the Hawks, I don't need to read \\"I'm a Hawk\\" on every other page! Whomever edited this book should be fired. This reads like a first draft dictated to a typing program. It's really sad because the story idea is very good, but its buried under so much unnecessary stuff. Save your money and treat yourself to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many incomplete sentences can you fit on one page?","review":"I really wanted to like this, but it's one of the worst-written fantasies I've ever read. Apparently little money is expended on editing at Luna Books. The writing is so awkward, repetitive and dull that much of it simply wastes space and insults the reader's intelligence. It's about what I'd expect a talented eighth-grader to write. There are multiple incomplete sentences on every page, the descriptions are lackluster and cliched and the dialogue is dull and staccato.It's so disappointing that this book wasn't edited adequately. If the author had been challenged to tighten the writing, it could have been turned into something readable, if not actually good. I'm astonished at the positive promotional comments on the jacket and wonder if the reviewers actually read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cast In Shadow","review":"The book was enjoyable enought to read once, but not enough to re-read when the next book comes out in the series. When I became intrested in this series 6 books were out. I read all six. If I buy it I read it. I'm 90% sure I won't buy number 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I bought this book a while back but just now got around to reading it. I'm a fan of luna but I wonder what they thought when they were reading this. Its really confusing in the beginning throwing characters in there that dont have much of an explaination since they aren't human. It would have been better for me if there were more details about their society since its other worldly like, to be honest I dont feel anything towards the characters. If one of them died, I'd be like oh well I guess. The main character is double sided, like she wants to still be friends with Severn, yet killing him at the same time?? Its mainly lacking alot of explaination. But I will trudge on and finish it and probably read the others since I already bought them, which I know regret. I had high hopes from the 5 star rating i saw. Just proves to show I need to read the first one before purchasing the books that follow after. Hope this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book to this series!","review":"I bought this book and once it arrived it sat on my shelf for several months. I couldn't get beyond the cover, which didn't give me a lot of confidence in the book.However, when I finally pulled it off the shelf and started reading, I was sucked right in to the story.Loved the characters, the variety of them, the depth, and their struggle with light and dark within themselves and each other.Thought the relationship (if you can call it that) that Kaylin has with Lord Nightshade was awesome..the hint of sensuality..Very impressed with the depth of the story and the journey it takes you on...never quite knowing what's around the corner (or who).Left me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning","review":"One advantage to finding out about books years after they've been published is that you can catch up right away without having to wait for the next one to be published.

I love the Carry On series. They are not the funniest films ever made, but they are consistenly funny, and after a while, you know what to expect from each scene. The cast members are very good, and it's like watching a TV series because you feel as if you know these people. I have recently started to accumulate as many as I can through Amazon.One thing I like about them, especially the early ones, is their \\"old English\\" quality. You see England, cars, fashions, etc., as they were forty years ago.Overall, these films are just fun, nothing to be taken seriously or analyzed to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highjinks that Never Grow Old","review":"I first saw this 20 years ago on an independent TV station and loved it. It is too bad that they do not include this installment with the other \\"Carry On\\" movies in the fine collection that they put out a few years agoThe Carry On Collection. Frankie Howerd, Jim Dale, and Kenneth Williams are exceptionally funny. I loved Jim Dale as Dr. Killmore wooing a medical school skeleton in his office."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this pan!","review":"I am very clear about my criteria for cookware. Pans must feel substantial without being too heavy, must heat evenly, must be easy to clean, must be adaptable to a variety of uses, and finally, must look good hanging in my kitchen. This pan easily meets all these criteria! Since I received it (excellently packaged, as fine cookware should be), I find I use it often, always with excellent results. And I love pairing it with the CIA steamer insert. Now that I am retired and have more time to enjoy cooking, I have begun treating myself to cookware I can truly be excited about.

I found this to be far more creepy than romantic. It's interesting that this title was determined worthy of reprint at this time.

When she finds out about Trav's lies, she then turns into giantic, rightous bitch.This book would've been half way decent if the heroine could've been more lovable or more reasonable.. her love for her dead hubby came across as unbeliveable.. if she did love him al ALL at any point in her life.Get ready to spend your afternoon annoyed to all hell, if you do decide to try this book.

It was basically pornographic in some parts. And the whining by Kayla. It went on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Love Story?","review":"Don't be fooled by the inscription on the cover. This book is classic only in the Harlequin Romance sense. The premise could have been interesting if the story itself wasn't so annoying. The main characters are a man driven by an obsession and a compulsively grieving widow. I felt like handing out referrals to a good psychologist. The language is stilted and slightly off-putting. There are a few moments in the book which could be touching, but were handled ineptly by the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it, but -","review":"I enjoyed the novel, but Kyla's behavior became very frustrating after a while. Her undying love for her 1st husband was beautiful, but even after poor Trevor managed to marry her, it was about a month before she'd get close to him. And after he slavishly did all she could dream of, she still said some really wretched, ugly things to him when she found out the truth (which of course she does). Personally, I'm dying to find out what happens to Babs. Is there any hope Sandra Brown will write a story about Babs, a woman who is not strictly chaste like all of Brown's heroines, but still has a wonderfyul heart?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you see it, just throw it straight into the trash","review":"I picked this book up at the airport to kill time. The book was so bad that I threw it in the trashcan to make sure no one else had a chance to waste their time. Kyla's irrational attachment to her dead husband was increadibly annoying. She needed counseling and it doesn't look like she had any. Someone else mentioned to skip this book and go to another. I will read another Sandra Brown book, but if the next one is as silly as this one, then I'll be through with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully romantic!!","review":"I loved this book.

It looks like a made for TV movie that was probably shown on the SCIFI channel. It has a heavy mix of CGI and live shots, most likely to keep costs down.But, the bottom line for me is that it's simply not interesting. It's a low budget film with flat uninteresting characters that relies heavily on cheap CGI to establish set placement. The funny thing is that if I saw this playing on TV I would change the channel because of the low budget production. So, why in the world would I want it in my DVD collection...This is a perfect example of a low budget movie that is bad, and don't get me wrong, I like low budget films. Low budget independant films give filmmakers chances to really explore their creativity.

I've heard about the famous car chase scene for years and until now finally seeing it i must say it is quite overrated. BUT it must of been spectacular back then. Gene Hackman does some excellent acting, of course, which is about the best thing about this movie, just him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Snapshot","review":"This 1971 movie shows the powerful Gene Hackman as the narcotics cop Popeye Doyle. Although he is a central character, I would be hard pressed to say the movie was about him. Instead, the movie covers a particular drug deal that Doyle and his partner come across. You see a seasoned policeman following his hunches and a terrific chase scene.The best part of the movie is that nothing is over-explained. If you are used to having the movie go into detail to show you why a character is angry about life, then you will probably not follow this movie. The script keeps to the snapshot of Doyle's life, but particular scenes will tell you volumes about Popeye Doyle. The writer did not think it was necessary to spend long segments on the background. This is a more intelligent film.I would recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"below expectations!","review":"I was disappointed with this film, having heard all the good reviews. The chase scene really isn't that spectacular. I could not believe it when I saw this garbage beat out A Clockwork Orange for best picture! For a better action flick, check out Dirty Harry; It has a much better chase scene which involves Clint Eastwood riding on the roof of a school bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.","review":"C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no (...) reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally over rated!","review":"Why did it win 5 oscars? With a main character that never stops to think about anyone else. A soundtrack so intense it hurts you ears. Half the dialogue is shouting or arguing!Half the film seems to be set either in their car following somebody, or them walking about - still following somebody.

It ended in America with the Frenchman returning home. The movie was much longer with Popeye Doyle going to to Paris to follow up on the case. The most exciting and important conclusion of the film was deleted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This had to be the most boring cop movie I've ever seen. Not only was it boring, but I found myself hoping the bad guys got away. The movie was basically about a racist, sadistic cop who spent the whole movie either beating innocent African Americans or chasing a drug dealing ring. No intersting dialogue at all. The only halfway good part was the car chase scene, but when Doyle almost hit a woman crossing the street, I lost interest in the dynamics because it was so thoughtless. Then, if you weren't sleep by then, you get to watch the police tear up a drug dealer's car for probably 15 minutes. What was really stupid was that they completely ripped the car up, upholstery and all; however, when the owner picked the car up, it was in tip-top shape. I don't know what other movies this one was up against for the Acadamey Awards, but surely one of them was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Suitable for Blu-ray","review":"The color scheme that was used for this Blu-ray product looks unnatural and is not true to the original film.

That just happens to be an interest of mine .The director goes on about camera technique in rather an egocentric manner in the commentary and in the documentaries , which apart from that aspect , are very interesting in themselves .Luckily , the whole 2 disc package is extremely good value .Anything with Gene Hackman is worth seeing just for him , I find .Try this package , as well you will gain an appreciation of not just the film , but also the thought that went into it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL CLASSIC","review":"I SAW \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\" WHEN I COULD HEAR.

The criminal (Fernando Rey) is cooler than either of the cops, there is the obligatory stomach-churning chase sequence, everything feels slightly early-70's not-quite-glues-together and out of focus, the main character is a brown 1970 Lincoln Continental Mark 3 and you have the most overbearing, maniacal, evil-hearted director of the last 50 years (Freikin) presiding over the whole thing. A supremely satisfying movie experience from any angle your heart desires.There are several other films that surpass French Connection in one way or another, but this film is truly one of the greats. In my opinion there are only a select few movies (Kane, Godfather I, Nashville, Raging Bull, perhaps a few others) that do better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD of a great film","review":"No need to say much about this film, it is a classic with superb performances and an excellent script. The cast are all spot-on, with Gene Hackman (one of my favourite actors) fully deserving his Best Actor Oscar.The 2 DVD set includes 2 documentaries, one 'The Poughkeepsie Shuffle' made by the BBC, and the other I think specially for the DVD release. Both occasionally overlap in content of course, but are definitely worth watching. They include interviews with Hackman , Roy Scheider and William Friedkin, and with the two NYPD cops on whose exploits the film is based.The DVD transfer is very fine for a 30 year old film. Don't worry about the atrocious grain (which almost amounts to pixellation) in the opening shot of Marseille's skyline. The rest of the film enjoys an excellent anamorphic transfer, with only slight grain visible in a few night scenes. This transfer is well up to the standard of the best DVDs of similar period films. The soundtrack is also excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Buyer","review":"The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received.

I have watched it numerous times and it is a masterpeice of filmmaking, acting and storytelling - what a performance by Hackman ... and Roy Scheider as well. Of course, it's also the first blow of William Friedkin's incredible early 70's one-two punch (\\"The French Connection\\" and then \\"The Exorcist\\").

I mean, cmon, the whole premise is around $500,000 worth of heroin. Please. Even in today's dollars, that's a joke. The movie spends 10 minutes watching the cops rip the car apart trying to find where the drugs are stashed. Today, drug traffickers rent 26 foot Ryder trucks to move the stuff around.

Also you said that these traits helped him in his chase against the criminals. But didn't you see the ending? Doyle never catches the ringleader of the drug traffic.

The music was great and imaginative. The stake out scenes were too long.There was probably 30 minutes during stake outs that had maybe 4-5 pages of dialoge. Anyway the ending was typical of the time like \\"Billy Jack\\" or Easy Rider\\". Show the cops in a bad light and let the rotten drug dealer get away. I'm sure it appealed to teenagers back then, but not today where we have 30+ years of hindsight on the drug scene. The mark of a great film is how soon would like to see it again.

I have to ask one question to Morris: Why did you do this movie? Are you that desperate for money? Are time really that bad? It started off really bad, but got interesting towards the middle, then it ended predictably. Hands down one of the worst of the new \\"blackploitative\\" films of our era.

Specifically, she explained very well the times of the prophets and possible relationships to one another. Mrs. Mears is clearly a dispensationalist regarding eschatology (study of the end times). Meaning, she believes that prophecy is interpreted in a specific way with which I disagree.

Her sister's life of serial monogamy's most recent break up has left Miranda with many regrets, and what if's.

Meryl Streep plays the psychriatrist, I like Meryl but I did not care for her in this particular role (see Kramer vs. Kramer and Bridges of Madison County instead), she is not at her best in comedy, she is brilliant in dramas, that's what makes her special and unique.

What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that \\"separation of powers\\" did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy reading for any student of political philosophy, but ultimately dangerous to our republic.","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist.

I find the music sparse and minimal yet I want more. There are no big surprises or monster hooks just subtle nuances of sound and voice.

The higher the stakes, the more unpalatable the pale charicture reveals itself to be. This album is far from Damon & Naomi's earlier incandescent incarnation as \\"Pierre Etoile\\" and the results are disappointing. It's a rather cloying and saccharine set of takes on the \\"sweet tune\\" with old-school instrumentation that seeks to contrive wholesomeness but ultimately basks in naivité. There are slightly more engrossing tracks towards the end, but listening to Big Star's original version of \\"Blue Moon\\" on the heels of Damon & Naomi's neutered cover will highlight just how lacking this whole project is."},{"rating":"1","title":"in a galaxie far far away (from good art)","review":"comes these bozos (just look at the picture of Damon--he IS bozo!)--boy this band is terrible. very bad Renaissance music vibe. stupid lyrics. no real melodies. avoid avoid avoid--danger, Will Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"death in the afternoon","review":"I enjoyed the first part of the book all about the ceremony, drama & skill of the fights. It was my lesson & instruction, history before I attended a bull fight in Spain. The second part of the book got bogged down in too many names of famous bull fighters & was not interesting, I appreciated the bull fight so much more with a little background. Wish I could have been there during Hemmingway's time"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent piece of bullfighting literature","review":"I found this book fascinating. I am not a big Hemingway fan, but I am a fan of bullfighting, and it was great to read of the Spanish history of the sport. The only complaint I have is that at times he tends to ramble...however, this book is a superb starting point for any who are intersted in bullfighting...and it has great photos too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"It was hard to believe I was reading Hemingway - but then again, not really. His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better, since this was Hemingway. Instead, it kept getting worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel","review":"I read this book for the literary circle at my high school, and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure, so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure, the author strays off the \\"topic\\" (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about \\"venereal diseases\\", which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting, or possibly Ernest Hemmingway, it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books, including \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", are definitely worth the read. Just because you liked other books by the same author, please do not assume you will like this one. I LOVED \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", but I couldn't stand this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer. Horrific, outdated material.","review":"Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just bullfighting","review":"Death in the Afternoon marks Hemingway's first major experiment in style and genre. While it is about bullfighting, and a marvelous one at that, this book is equally (and perhaps more importantly) about the art of writing as well as the writer himself, or more specifically Hemingway. When viewed in this context Death in the Afternoon reaches a much more complex structure and one demanding closer attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender Story","review":"Ms. Hailstock has done it again.

Tremors 2 is a surprise as well. We are minus Kevin Bacon this time but despite an almost carbon copy story line there are a few twists and some Humour from Fred Ward (Remo Unarmed And Dangerous) which will have you falling of your seat.

Not only is Kevin Bacon missing, the laughs and fast paced entertainment are missing in the sequel. Instead, we have a film that fails miserably as a sci-fi horror film and even more as a comedy. It's not as campy as Tremors and doesn't have the suspense, either. Stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"As entertaining as the first","review":"Okay, so it doesn't have Kevin Bacon or the rest of the known cast that's from the first Tremors. Fortunately Fred Ward and Michael Gross return, and the adventures continues with shocks and laughs.

I purchased the DVD for Tremors II to upgrade from the VCR tape that I had watched numerous times. This is probably the best of the sequels to the original movie. Fred Ward does an excellent job recreating his character, but the actor in the role of the sidekick is a little lame (the only real downside to the entire movie). Of course, it would be hard to top Kevin Bacon who starred with Fred Ward in the first movie. If you like Tremors I, then this should be your next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Worm Monsters, Little Monsters","review":"My reviewer's group and I enjoyed this one more than the first \\"Tremors\\" (although it rated four stars with us).

If you've only seen it, and not the original, it's okay. But to point everyone in the correct direction...buy the original. It's so great and funny. It should have been titled \\"Val and Earl\\" (The two main characters) rather than \\"Tremors.\\" The character interaction is what made that movie. This film doesn't have, or master, nearly any of those qualities. The original is a barrel of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"In denial that there is this/any sequel to Tremors.","review":"This was oneof the lamest sequels to any given movie. First off, you could tell they wrote around availability. Examples, primary ones. Weren't able to bring back Kevin Bacon but, keep Fred Ward in it, even though the bubby thing between the two was seamless in Tremors. Can't bring Reba back in, well, let's say they were divorsed. Please, that notion is an easy out to admit she wasn't coming back to it.The newer evovled \\"tremors\\" was a stupid idea. Tremors was called Tremors for a reason, the monsters shook the ground, that registered on the richter scale. These stupid chicken designed ones in 2 takes away fro mthe whole point and the name. Now if it had evolved and was huge, Godzilla size, then it could still be called Tremors, and add to it.My love for the first movie can't be ruined but, 2 doesn't even exist as far as I'm conscerned, it wasn't Tremors and 2 never needed to be made.Honestly, if I could select 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"best sequel ever","review":"This is the best sequel ever made. In the beginning, it explains where everyone went and is constantly referring back to the original Tremors. Unlike most sequels, the characters don't just 'drop' inexplicably out of the film. Michael Gross gives an especially great performance, and its hilarious how he blames his marraige problems on the fall of the soviet union. This is a truly worthy sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn worms, never cut you any slack!","review":"I can still remember the day I first disovered there was such a thing as \\"Tremors 2\\".

It preserves the wonderfull humor and suspense that the first one did have. I just recently discovered that the two Tremors movies were out on DVD, and I bought the both of them at once.

After suffering through the entire length of this \\"film\\", I can sum my feelings in only two words-- Stuu! Pid! As far I can gather, here is the plot to Tremors II. Take five out of work, has-been actors, that will do almost any movie for a paycheck, give them an innane script about some giant baby worms (with feet?) who try to nurse their way through a town full of hicks. The End. This flick was so bad and such a waste of time that I don't even want to waste another second on this review. My advice? Go out and rent TREMORS. Sit back and enjoy and try and forget TREMORS II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tremors Movie Ever.","review":"Lets see, where to begin on this disasterpiece? For one thing, the acting on this film is pretty bad and seems to reek of B-Movieness. Actually, now that I think of it, everything in this movie is pretty average, except there is one thing in this movie that is extremely stupid/annoying: The way the tremors look, act, and move.In case any of you that are reading this haven't seen the movie, I will now describe what the tremors look like. They are short, stupid-looking creatures that looked like they couldn't hurt anyone, let alone kill them. This movie was completely unrealistic and I just couldn't see why anyone would be afraid of those things. It's the film-makers job to make the creatures look scary, but they've obviously failed in that aspect. I know this really doesn't sound like very big of a deal, but the whole movie was just ruined for me because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stuart Hemingway Livelihood","review":"The music on this CD is an eloquently beautiful masterpiece of tunes. Stuart Hemingway and his band portray these great figures of music in a way that diminishes the cruelty and unfairness of life; it elevates the soul and the appreciation for the wonderful world that is Jazz. If you do not buy this CD for its excellent music, you should buy it to support Stuart. For those of you who don't know, Mr. Hemingway is blind. Even with this obstacle, he achieves a supreme quality of composing and performance. I personally know Stuart Hemingway and am one of his students.

I must say that it could have been worse (like in the case of The Neverending Story III, as compared to the original,) but it's still pretty darn bad! I read most of the other comments before deciding to write my own, and one thing I noticed that had yet to be mentioned was the script quality. I'm no great writer, but I can recognize bad writing! OK, so this movie was more geared towards kids, but Disney movies have better scripts than this! The lines that came out of Drake's mouth made me shudder... no dragon as majestic as Draco would have even considered uttering such dribble! Honestly, Drake talks (and at times even acts) like a second-grader... its such a disgrace.

There has to be some sad or not so good parts in a book scattered throughout, but what I found in this book is that there is a depressing feeling that permeates from start to finish.

We are meant to see the Fremen as Arabs, the Harkonnen as the \\"evil Jews\\" (they came to take the land of the Fremen away from them; they only care about profit; Baron Harkonnen drinks blood; etc.), the spice is very obviously oil, the Emperor is the USA.

You people are stark raving mad.","review":"Look, I love Herbert, and I love Dune, and I just got a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I would get at least the first three books, but, guys? You might want to take a look at your pricing, there. I am NOT going to pay MORE for the Kindle edition than for the paperback. Particularly not for a book I already own, just for the convenience of reading it Kindle-ized. I hope that is some kind of silly, easily fixed error. Oh, and guys? Also not paying more than four bucks for an e-version a book as short as Dune Messiah. If the publishers are making you do this, feel free to forward this review to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, outrageous kindle price. Shame on Penguin","review":"\\"Dune\\" is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and loved Herbert's talent for world-building. \\"Fear is the mindkiller...\\" is a mantra that I've used over and over.So why am I giving it a 1 star rating? Like other Kindle readers, I'm appalled at the price, which is actually higher than the price for the hardback. As other reviewers have pointed out, the Kindle edition is also highly flawed--formatting and spelling errors abound. Is it so much to ask the publisher to get it right? Also, this is a 40 year old book. Penguin has no business charging this much for a non-print edition of a book that is readily available in multiple editions used and is ten bucks new in paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This translation is embarrassing.

There is a lot to slog through and this book is slow reading. I did have to put it down after ^150 pages because after a while, I just wasn't interested. Who are these Dune cultists? Living in a big city, I can't say I've met one."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but...","review":"I must admit I heard a lot about the book prior to reading it: 1. One of the top ten 2. Question antisemitism 3. A little boring at times. Honestly, I can only agree to 1 and 3. I don't think it is in the class of the Lord of the Rings, but it is certainly noteworthy science fiction if you can slog through some of the more longwinded passages. Herbert's GRAMMAR skills are in question at certain points. Finally, except for it's small cult fan base, no one talks about this book....at all. No one buys Dune calendars, plays Dune games, etc. Thus, the emotional bond that Tolkien established in the Lord of the Rings is obviously absent here. Tolkien influenced generations with his story, and clearly Herbert has not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Disappointing","review":"A famous quote in the book is, \\"Fear is the mind-killer\\". I agree if you fear reading boring books as alternative to treating insominia.There were some good parts of the book that sparked interest, but they were few and far in between.I read the marketing ploys trying to convince the LOR fans that Dune was their science fiction savior. It's pure nonsense.What I can't understand is how overrated this book was. Even English majors I know gave me positive accounts of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go ahead, click \\"not helpful...\\"","review":"...but I honestly don't see what's so great about this book. Daniel Keyes' \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" and Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" are both better science fiction stories than Dune. They make powerful, emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes. If you want epic literature, read Lord ot the Rings. That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth. Everything is predictable about the plot, not to mention the fact that Paul is next to impossible to relate to.On the other hand, Frank Herbert DID exert a lot of artistic effort into this, which is to be commeneded. Perhaps he should have exerted this effort into a better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably boring and tedious description without end","review":"A friend told me that DUNE was different from the run of the mill sci-fi endless spillage of adverbs and adjectives. After three chapters of the most tedious and unnecessary descriptions of the tiniest details I decided he didn't know what he was talking about. Boring junk with a capital J!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the book, \\"Dune the Audio Colletion\\" big disappointmen","review":"I loved the book Dune, but the \\"Dune Audio Collection\\" was a big disappointment. It included some selections from the book and jumped around. Scene one: Paul is fighting his instructor. Then quick jump to scene two: him and his mother running away and survivoring the sandworms of Dune. They let you know between the two selections: \\"Oh by the way Paul's dad just died.\\" Very jumpy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fun Read","review":"You have to give Frank Herbert credit for having a great imagination and stamina. That's about all you have to give him credit for.The plot is cumbersome. The characters have no charisma. The whole idea of this high culture developing on this barren rock seems pretty far-fetched. Herbert's invented ceremonies and cultural mores are wonderful, but they can't support the bloated story and anemic characters. Masochism not being my strong suit, I gave up on this one after about a hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"way over rated","review":"It really puzzles me how this book could have so many five stars. How a slow book like this could achieve a rating close to Ender's Game is indeed quite incomprehensible. Are there many fans from the 1960s editions rating it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzz","review":"How can anyone find Dune to be entertaining. Frank Herbert rambles on incessantly about politics, religion, and society. There is little action and Herbert never goes into detail about the technologies of his universe. However, he never seems to shut up about his philosophy either. This is a VERY tedious book. The concept is quite fascinating, but the book itself lacks the entertainment factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-go at this station.","review":"I can't help but feel the need to write a less-than-memorable review on these books of Frank Herbert. I'm on the verge of giving it away, but if you read them, over %90 of them are people sitting on rock ledges or balconies thinking of plans and plans and plans. The action scenes seemed to be written as if they were afterthoughts, almost a \\"by the way\\" feeling. The characters were elaborate, but making them ACT was impossible, and that's why I gave the whole Dune series 2-stars instead of one. If you're thinking about reading them, ask someone who has already read them and then get a summary; it'll be quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices out there","review":"Having been recommended by friends as a must read in the sci-fi genre, I finished reading the original Dune trilogy, expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, I found myself disappointed and want my time back :).Herbert has created a colorful and exotic world. The writing is very detailed. However, I found the series to have too much pretentious babble with little real substance behind it. The first book, Dune, is the best book of series. The second is barely readable. The third one bored me to tears at times. For a classic sci-fi series with real plot twisters (or \\"a feint within a feint within a feint\\" in Herbert's words) and intelligent discussions, read Isaac Asimov's Robot series and Foundation series. For a fantasy series with enticing plots and moving character, read Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really the best","review":"I read the many superlative reviews of this book and purchased it last month. I thought the people who wrote in that they couldn't finish the book were just being obnoxious. To my dismay, I would have to agree with them. Yes, the plot is fine, and the book is imaginative. The rival families/spice/Gesserit are somewhat interesting. But I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through. It's just so boring, and convoluted, I couldn't take it. I found no pleasure in having to work through it. Anti-semitic? I doubt it. Bad grammar in spots? Yeah sure, but not a big deal.In short, a good book, but clearly not in the same league as J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"P.S. No one talks about this book...at all. Just wait until Tolkien's movies come out. See the difference for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with Dune","review":"Like many others, I picked up DUNE based on its broadly accepted status as a SF classic. I don't read much SF, so I try to get to the Big Books (War of the Worlds, Ender's Game, Fahrenheit 451, \\"The Year's Best\\" anthologies, etc). This was not a good book. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, and everyone's always \\"hissing\\", \\"glaring\\", or \\"swallowing with a dry throat\\". The plot is interesting enough, but not nearly as complex or Byzantine as I had expected: warring factions, religious fervor, double-crossing, nefarious rulers, ulterior motives - standard stuff, really. If anything, the plot seems complicated because we're told so little about what the Guild, the Great Houses, and CHOAM really are. Anyway, as a non-SF connoisseur I realize that I don't get to vote on which books are the classics. But from where I stand, DUNE is a poorly-written, lackluster, repetitive tale. It's not the best SF I've ever read; it's not even the best book I've read this month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Sequel","review":"I think the most recent reveiws of Dune Messiah miss the point by calling it a sequel. The trilogy should be taken as a whole. Dune Messiah sets up the action that will climax in the third book. Read the trilogy as a whole, have some patience. The Dune trilogy is still one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written. P.S. - Skip the movie (the 80s one that is; the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series is very good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"My dad gave me a copy of the first paperback edition of this book for my 13th birthday back in 1965. I just want to say now - thanks Dad. From the very first I could not put it down. Since that first reading I have read the book at least a dozen times or more, and even read it aloud to my son when he was about 10 years old (as a teenager he went on to re-read it on his own).This book is a classic, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes SF, or just like a darn good read in general. Interestingly enough I never cared for anything else Frank Herbert wrote - but this one just blew me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done","review":"I enjoyed this book to be sure, and although it was quite lengthy, I found myself unable to part with it easily. I finished it within a week simply because the story was so gripping. I'm not sure how Herbert manages it, but it seems that he can endlessly descibe something yet never bore someone. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth ten times its weight of water!","review":"Without a doubt Dune is one of the strongest sci-fi books I have ever read. Infact, I should have read it sooner. The book was written way before I was born but it is only when someone presented it to me as a gift that I decided to read it. I believed that after seeing the movie adaptation by David Lynch the book will not be as interesting. I was wrong.In addition, I have played every computer game in the Dune series. After reading the book I have noticed some subtle roots of computer game story and design I have not noticed before.Without contemplating any longer, I went out and bought the two sequels. I can't wait to finish them. There is something amazing about Frank Herbert's writing. It is so rich, so deep, so dense with thought that I find it to be a jewel among thoughtless sci-fi of today. Dune was written in sixties but it still blows away the sci-fi world of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to be forever changed?","review":"That is how good this book is. I will forever remember it. As previous reviewers said, music that I was listening to at the time and things like that, when I hear it again will bring my mind straight back to DUNE. Dune blends plot, character development, tradegy, and triumph perfectly. I know no other book(s) that can compare to Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read, along with Dune, in light of current events","review":"I first read the Dune series in the late 80's after the first movie came out. I have just begun re-reading them after 9/11. I particulary find the manipulation of politics and religion by first the Bene Gesserits and then by Paul to be quite interesting in light of the current events. For those who have only seen the movie, Paul may seem to be a romantic hero. However in a 1980 interview Frank Herbert compared Paul Atreides to Hitler, and warned of the dangers of a charismatic leader gaining influence on a population. I reccomend that people read Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. You may see some comparisons to our current \\"war\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SF BOOK OF ALL TIME!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"There isn't much to be said that hasn't been said already, but suffice it to say that Dune is the most original, well-crafted, well-told, brilliant, and all around best sci-fi book EVER written. I know plenty of people who've read it and hated it, and I used to be one of them. Anyone who refuses to wait until they're a matured adult and read it again is in a literary vacuum. Both myself and my best friend benefitted from rereading it, while another friend of mine has only read it once, and \\"suffered through it\\". To those who think Dune is clichéd, all I can say is, learn to read. You have no idea how much it will benefit your lives. Dune is the most detailed, original, meticulouly thought out, colorful, and exciting sci-fi universe ever to be contained in one volume, and that's putting story, characters, and writing style aside. No science fiction library is complete without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune is the best sci-fi ever!","review":"Dune by Frank Herbert is a wonderful book. From the water rich oceans of Caladan to the soaks and sinkwells of Dune (Arrakis), Dune is the best sci-fi ever. It's sister books, the rest of he series, end the story of the Atredies, but Dune can be read ovver and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"like ocean","review":"The story is talking about desert and dune, but the book is actually like ocean, with not only bellowing plot surface, but also unfathomable thought-provoking depth.Actually I read three sf books in a row in two months: Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card, Blood Music by Greg Bear, and this Dune by Frank Herbert. The first one was disappointing, and the second one was just so-so, compared to the third one, the real masterpiece in sci-fi world.The highest score is 10? I'd rather give it a 12. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is easily the most hardcore sci-fi book I have ever read. I don't know what Herbert was smoking, but I wish I had some. I feel sorry for all the people who saw the movie and figured the book was that bad. Their loss. The complexity and imaginative power that this book reveals is truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!The God of good books!!!","review":"GREAT BOOK. Love the way Herbert has made up a \\"new\\" religion, based on Islam and Christianety...It gives the reader a perfect picture into a futur, where humans relly more on other people, then robots. Also the part about \\"making a perfect humaniod\\" is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff.","review":"They did a great job with this audiobook. Dune Messiah is my favorite of the Dune Books. I found myself getting all choked up at the end, even though i knew what was going to happen. That tells you a lot. I hope Children of Dune is not too far off in the future. They really do need to get all of the original Frank Herbert material on cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down.","review":"An introduction by the author in my edition indicates his goals: to explore the messiah myth, to examine the relationship between politics and economics, to explore the consequence of the control of a limited resource, i.e., water as an analog of oil. The novel does this so admirably and a great deal more. Overlayed are a gripping story and some really big issues: loyalty vs. betrayal, love vs. obligation, nature vs. nurture. Strikingly, these inevitable conflicts are subjected to tension and resolution. Sure, this is space opera at its best, but it is a wonderfully written novel that can stand on its own beside traditional literature. Don't let the detractors keep you from this; they simply don't get the point. It is a big, well written book that will enrich you whether or not you proceed on to the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch out for the sandpeople","review":"this is the best work in the dune series. I love rereading this book, i loved the dune movie (yes the david lynch one!) and miniseries. This is a great book if you are looking for a long scifi series"},{"rating":"2","title":"He who controls the Spice...","review":"For anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi, they should pick up this book. But it is not for people who think sci-fi should be \\"all action, all dialogue, non-stop.\\" Because Dune is a far cry from action. It has it's moments of intense action at times, but for the most of it, it delves into the inner-workings of baronies and empires, the thoughts of young dukes and old planetoligists, and the struggle against tyranny. There are characters you will hate, characters you can do nothing but love, and some characters will seem so unimportant you forget them, only to have them come back at the end.All in all, I reccomend this book so highly, I think 5 stars is a rude understatement. I believe this to be the best book ever written (that I've read.) Buying this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far this one of the best science fiction novels","review":"BY far Dune is one of the best science fiction novels ever written. This book gave me a stronger view, and a better perception on understanding science fiction. Many story lines that run at the same time through out the story really keep you into the book, but many readers can get lost through out the book in between story lines. Overall I give dune a five star reading! Dune is the best science fiction novel I have ever read and I definatedly recommened this book for anyone who likes to read. It is spectacular.Dune is based in a galaxy far away much like most science fiction novels of it's time. A boy named paul has caught word that he may be the Kwisatz haderach. He has to travel through out the planet Arakis and train his followers to defeat the emporer and the Harkoneons, the defeaters of his father. I will not reveal the end of the story so I don't spoil the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for fans of the DUNE series","review":"The 2nd book in the Dune cronicles, Dune Messiah changes the tone of the series. One of the most dissapointing things about this book is how Paul Maud'Dib is shown. He is not the hero of the first book, but an actual human that has (many) flaws. 3rd favorite of the 4 I have read so far. Best in this series: Dune Second: Children of Dune"},{"rating":"2","title":"To enter the new millenium in peace, understand Dune.","review":"Dune, written in the year I was born, holds the singular distinction of being the novel that introduced me to the literary world of science fiction.For it's time, the concepts brought forward by Herbert were astonishing in perception and grand in execution. I was mesmerized, totally.It has been 20 years now since I first read Dune, and I've fully re-read it 6 or 7 times in that span.Brilliant sums it all up.Postscript:The film totally f***ed the original vision, and it ruined the mental pictures formed by Herbert's elegant descriptions. Yes, I read the novel before watching the film.DON'T WATCH THE FILM !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Is this book great, or what? But seriously, it is a rare insight into the bitter rewards of power, along with all the other levels this book has to offer. Religeon; how much of this is created, & how much is self-creating. Economics; Muad'Dib - the supreme energy eater. Politics: Bene Tlalaxu, Bene Gesserit, House Atredies, The House of Ix, The Fremen, The Guild, oh yeah. Finally, this concludes the story of Paul Atredies (The Preacher is another story...) who sought to make his future, only to find his future made him."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie was better","review":"If you have never read this book, here it is...Dune... Arabs in space, some of whom are on drugs.Humanity devolves back into tribalism/feudalism, with attendant problems of religion and war. Dark, cult-ish, historical hodgepodge, all in sci-fi drag.Sorry, but throwing in some spaceships and anti-grav gadgets doesn't qualify Dune as a science fiction story. This story is simply a relic of the hippie-dippy culture... toss out rationality and other elements of modern civilization, and substitute supposed mind-expanding drugs, Eastern mysticism, and revolution.If that sounds like something you would enjoy (perhaps if you're an old hippie, or a \\"turn on, drop out\\" type) go for it.The movie was beautifully done, however. Even Frank liked it. Only problem with it was the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORRRRRING","review":"this book bored me to death. it was hard to follow with way too much description. scenes that should have been exciting took up five more pages then they should have, and quite frankly could have been made more exciting by a first grader.

Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Dune was one of the most intreving books (excuse my spelling) I have ever read. Its sort of Machavillian in a sense with spies, assassins, and so fourth. It has very rich layered plots that take alot of understanding to really get the FULL meaning of the book, and lots of new words you need to know (The Imperial Dictonary in the front helps ALOT) I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading how politics, mystisysm, and religion all play a single role in the Epic adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why God created books.","review":"Dune is a complex world.

You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the Greatest Science Fiction Novel Ever!","review":"Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune,' ranks among the great works of fiction and is perhaps the greatest of it's genre. The novel is a subtle but effective weaving together of political intrigue, heart-racing action, intense story, and incredably well-drawn characters. Paul Atredies, the young son of the Duke Leto, and his family are removed from their home world of Calidan to oversee operations on the desert world of Arrakis, or as it is better known, Dune. The story that follows sees Paul grow not only into a man, but into a super-human being capable of destroying the hated enemies of the Atredies, the evil Harkonnen. Herbert's understanding of human nature serves him well in this novel and his concerns about our own ecology are apparent. Like Asimov's 'Foundation,' series and the 'Childe Cycle' of Gorden R. Dickson, Herbert's 'Dune' is a classic of Science Fiction that will ignite any reader's imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first book","review":"Dune Messiah was a bit of a boring and wordy book. It mostly has to do with the rule of Paul Mau'dib and his reign as Emperor over Dune and the universe. Plots to remove him from his position as a godhead are formulated and carried out by people all around. Basically, it was a good story, but dry and boring in comparison to Dune. Read the book if you plan to continue with the Dune Chronicles like I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I liked Dune and so far I'm liking Children of Dune better then Dune Messiah, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. It was a great book that bridges the stories in Dune and Children of Dune well. You have to read this book if you want to be well read in the classics of Science Fiction. Frank Herbert is an awesome writer and this was a very enjoyable tale. Its made more enjoyable by the fact that it is the prerequisite to reading Children of Dune, which is GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here and read the whole series","review":"The Dune series truly is a wonderful collection of sci-fi books. The vividness and completeness of the 'alternate reality' being portayed is staggering.

If you want a break from everyday reality, dive into these books and don't surface until you need food, sleep, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing experience","review":"The Dune Chronicles are the most richly imagined, fleshed out books in history. Never before has an alien landscape come alive like Dune has. There is not one facet of life Frank Herbert does not touch on. This book makes one long for the future.

Dune I gave five stars, however, this book does not go in depth about anything. It merely skimms the top of everything and doesn't explain or explore as well as it could have, and should have.Dune Messiah attempts to build on Dune, the ultimate in sci-fi, and fails miserably. Instead of bettering the Dune story, it weakens it with bad plot twists that are nothing like that of Dune.I had trouble reading the end of this book because it starts out slow, and doesn't improve. It laggs through the whole story whereas Dune the origional glued you to the book.Finally, Messiah mocks the origional Dune by weakenning the structure with which Dune was created and the glory was origionally born.So if you're looking to find the magic that Dune brought, don't read Massiha, it just doesn't live up to the name Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book: worst narrator!","review":"This is indeed one of the best science fiction works produced however I must give it a miserable review on account of the almost criminal selection of narrators!

This book is nothing like the original. It's dissapointing b/c I think the author didn't have all these sequals in mind when he wrote dune. He came up with an amazing world, and a great story. Then, after he made a lot of money, decided to come up with some other books trying to get that magic the first book held. Well, it doesn't have that magic, and really I don't think I will ever read a sequal to a book ever again.

I first read the entire series in about a week, taking short breaks for food and sleep, scribbling furiously in my \\"famous quotes\\" notebook. Since then I re-read it in three languages, saw the movie 5 times, and turned a lot of the poetic teachings of Dune into living principles.

The concepts and ideas in this novel are extremely intelligent but a slight bit tedious and complex.

The audiobook, however, is extremely disappointing--at least relative to expectations. It is not an abridged version of Dune. It is a set of selected readings: it only contains four random selections for a total of 3.5 hours, drawn from across the entire original trilogy. My understanding of abridged is that a twelve hour or so book is reduced to eight or nine hours--usually done with audio books to make the story flow better to a listening audience. While it is very interesting to hear Frank Herbert read selected passages, this tape will not give you Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Science Fiction Classic","review":"Frank Herbert's masterfully crafted book, Dune, is one of the best books I have ever read. Set on a wonderfully unique world Arakis, AKA Dune, this book follows the life of Paul Muad'Dib. I do not want to give away any more plot points than that. However, if you are a science fiction fan, you will love this book. The story, characters, technology, and world are all wonderfully crafted. The writing style is wonderful as well. It does not explain everything for you, but it withholds just enough information to make you think. With a unique and wonderful storyline, and excellent writing style, you can not go wrong when you decide to read Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I had great expectations when I picked this book up from the store last month. This book is okay, but certainly not \\"the best\\" as many claim. My suspicion is that people on this review site tend to be a small but determined bunch of supporters. The biggest flaw is that the book is boring. It truly is difficult to keep turning the page. After being 1/2-way through, I just had to toss the book out. If you scroll through the \\"real\\" reviews, you will find this is a common lament. Also, it doesn't have the same emotional life as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and does not draw one in. Dune is certainly not in the same league as Tolkien's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but bad book...","review":"I know this is considered a classic and one of the supreme Sci-Fi novels of all time and that's why I was excited to read it. However, I found it boring and disjointed. Some of the characters are interesting and the story has it's moments but it's not worth the time it takes to read it. The story spends too much time building up to events which are either unsatisfying or over the top. The main character was extremely shallow and what personality he did have was still obscure. I didn't care for him at all. He seemed to be as bored as I was with the things going on around him. The book had good concepts but they were never really put to good use. I really wanted this book to be good. I was on it's side to begin with, but now I can see why Herbert had such a hard time finding someone to publish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Clearly, you have to be a fan of the robot genre to remotely even come close to liking this book. The first chapter gets off to a very slow start, the storyline becomes boring rapidly, and after a while, the book is unreadable. I would imagine that those disappointed with this highly overrated book would turn to other science fiction. Lord of the Rings puts this book to shame. J.R.R. Tolkien makes this author look unimaginative to say the least. If you want real science fiction, start with The Hobbit and go onto the LORD OF THE RINGS. Put this book where it belongs: in the GARBAGE bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"A hatful of people with unreadable alien names, and a central character called Paul.

If you've loved Dune, you'll probably hate the sequal so don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It helps to be able to write","review":"Herbert is one of those people who have a great imagination, with beuatiful skills of creativity. These people can create amazing worlds in their head, with politics, culture, and a unique language. The only problem is, he can't write. I am an avid reader, and recently decided to pick up this renowned novel. I was sorely dissappointed. With such poor development( I do not mean an introduction-I hate introductions. I mean actual coherency), I could barely bring myself to finish this book. Don't waste your time. This so-called \\"Brilliant\\" sci-fi novel is nothing more that a pieced-together third-rate material. (By the way- anyone who wants to tell me that writing isn't as easy as it looks- I am a writer, and would be glad to email some of my stuff to anyone who contacts me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Like many other of the reviewers listed here, I decided to read this book based on the positive feedback I've received from friends and the many glowing reviews at Amazon.I managed to read about 100 pages before I realised that this book was boring and going nowhere very fast. Maybe I've been spoiled by author's such as George Martin & Dan Simmons who write truly captivating prose.Dune is one of those books that I may get back to one day (with emphasis on the \\"may\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeehhh.....skip this one","review":"I basically found Dune to be an airball in comparison to the reviews some people gave me. The plot was too intricate, the book was too long, and for God's sake it is a pain to have to flip back to the glossary every page or so. I actually began to uderstand the book at page 425 when the Baron is discussing his plans with Thufir Hawat...but I shouldn't have to read that much for it to get interesting. And I hate to get all of you SF freaks angry...but Frank Herbert was a BAD WRITER. Some of the things he describes are very clunkily worded, sentences either too brief or two wordy. Plus he never used the word \\"and\\" in the entire book. An example would be a sentence like \\"He walked over to the case, opened it.\\" It just got annoying after awhile. It is a long dull story told with modest talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"$15.99!","review":"Wow, the Kindle version is selling for $15.99 but the used paperback is selling for like $3.25, the new paperback for $9.99. It's also free at your local library. The publisher sets the price. I like this book, but for $15.99 it gets 1 star after adjusting for the value proposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"have never been able to get into it","review":"Dune is supposed to be one of the best SF novels of all time. I like SF, so I should read Dune. In fact, I have started to read it at least half a dozen times, but I have never managed to get beyond the first few dozen pages. It just doesn't appeal. There may be some brilliant ideas in there but the writing is so ponderous, it kills any desire to read further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune by Frank Herbert","review":"The Atreides family is assigned to Arrakis, where they exploit melange; a special spice needed specifically for interstellar travel. Meanwhile, Paul, a member of the family is studying the ancient arts of the Benne Gesserit. Prophecies call him the Kwizatch Haderach; the only male Benne Gesserit, who will free the people of Arrakis and bring to blossom to humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. Overall, I think the magnificent book Dune, stands among the major literature achievements ever to have been written. The only thing comparable is Tolkien's work. However, I reccomend the book only to readers with patience and a love for science-fiction and fantasy. The book is very misleading to read and contains constant flashbacks, historical notes, and is very difficult to read comprehensively. Good luck to all who read this book. It is truly a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Herbert puts a whole world into one book. Every time I read this book I catch something new. The wonderful part is that you can read it very superficially or VERY deeply and enjoy the book every time. Paul Muad'dib is such a fantastic character who is not just a man in himself, but a figure bred out of millennia of selection for salvation of the entire human race or the tool of a select group of religious fanatics. Herbert cunningly leaves this dichotomy for his readers' judgement. The introduction of the Orange Catholic Bible and the Butlerian Jihad allows the book to move away from the static placement in time that troubles many other great novels of this century. Our only loss in this series is the untimely death of the beloved author before its completion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune","review":"When you read something this good all you need to say is \\"It's a great book,\\" that's all. This is one of those books that you wish it would never end, but unfortunately it does, but then you get to read the sequels. This is Frank Herbert's masterpiece that started a saga and turned into several movies.The story is about young Paul Atreides (son of Duke Leto Ateides) and his family who are moving to take control of the planet Arrakis also known as Dune. Dune, however, is not a normal planet, it is all desert and is the only source of \\"spice,\\" the life blood of the human race. While on Dune they must overcome the Harkoneans, a noble house that will do anything to gain power.Over all this is one of the best books I've ever read and definitely the best sci-fi I've ever read. This is truly a master piece more than worthy of Frank Herbert's name. From the amazing story and great detail and description this is an astoundingly interesting book one you should read even if you don't like sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Novel Of 20th Century?","review":"Is there any doubt that Dune deserves a shot at the title of \\"Best Novel of the 20th Century\\"? The book transcends the S-F genre... it is the finest book of our times. I have faith that it will survive the filter of time and its zealots will sustain it forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Towering Epic on the potential of Mankind","review":"Not a small task to attempt, the reading of this tale is a must for everyone. The depth of detail makes the impossible seem actual - have you ever considered how the ecosystem of a waterless world works? The characters are bold sketches of heroic ideals as in the great works of the ancient Greek tragedians, but with the insecurities of 20th century life as we all know it. It is the tremendous and complete effort that Herbert put into the creation of an entire society of the future that ultimately gives this book its value and appeal - from religion to recreation, we are taken on a fascinating journey into an fantastical yet paradoxically realistic future. Not one for you 'blaster and quick thrills' fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does't live up to the original DUNE--but how many works do?","review":"Dune Messiah is an engrossing tale, returning to the world of Dune, Paul, Duncan Idaho, and Stilgar. Where the original DUNE was an epic, DUNE MESSIAH takes the story further. Although it does not compare to the excellence of the original, it is still a very interesting and exciting story of intrigue, mystery, and suspense. Frank Herbert has the ability to immerse the reader in his tale, having them constantly wanting to read more and more. The term \\"page turner\\" comes to mind. It was almost two years between the time I read DUNE to the time I read DUNE MESSIAH. I can say that I eagerly await reading the next chapter of the series, CHILDREN OF DUNE, which I hope to begin this week."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite","review":"Im only 16 but I've read many books and the only one that I could even compare to Dune would have to be The Lord of Rings. I just recently completed the entire Dune series and It was the best written most indepth writing I have ever come across. Frank Herbert creates an entire universe here; an economic structure, a political structure, an entire enviornment so completely different from our own. This is a definate must for readers of any taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci fi book i ever read....that's no lie.","review":"I have read Dune fifty times and i still could read it another 50 times. This novel can be read by people who don't even like science fiction at all. Hubert's fantastic vision of mans far future is so real and profound that it could actually happen. The Characters are just superb and so real you could touch them. The Movie by lynch based on the novel is nothing like the book, but i've seen that movie a 100 times because i really love the Dune novel series. This novel is about Man's ultimate destiny in the cosmos in relation to the many archtypes of humanities various beliefs and the apothosis of those beliefs, which is the perpetual survival of the human species. This is a novel to be read and cherished as a true monument to human creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have always wanted this book on audio","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it.

The plot centers around a conspiracy to usurp thepower of Muad'dib (though there are side plots galore).

Unfortuanly, some of thesequels were pretty disappointing. The second and thirdbooks, \\"Dune Messiah\\" and \\"Children Of Dune\\" are defintelythe worst, and \\"God Emperor of Dune\\" isn't much better(although it does have its good moments), but \\"Heretics ofDune\\" and \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\" are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune: Ignore that it is sci-fi and take its message to heart","review":"I will say this as concise as I can: Dune is a great novel. Sci-fi adventure is there, but if you dig deeper, you may be suprised to find an excellent cross-section of religion, ecology, politics, and business. There are many themes that you can follow throughout the book, or you can just read it superficially and be overwhelmed by the tide of complexity.I read it for my first time this month, I am 24. I wish I had read it sooner. I reccomend this book to the young Sci-Fi reader (there are battles and giant worms and space craft), to the young adult (learn a little about how fuedal politics work as well as conservation), and the adult alike (apply water discipline to your business and see how it changes).A book that transcends the author and format itself, a true marvel of writing. No wonder it has a cult following, which I now belong to.

Frank Herbert created a world, a government, religion, language, and a three hundred year history. The part that makes this book so great is that it takes problems and situations from our lifetime and puts them in their uncut form in another world.

This fate being the jihad to be carried out by his followers. I just don't buy it. Why can't he stop it? I think that Frank Herbert wants us to be so impressed with the over-complex under-explained dialogue that we feel like we are too small to have a valid opinion. The protagonist is just so inhumanly smart, so vastly more intelligent than us, we cannot possibly know of his problems. But then Paul Atreides doesn't exist, there is only Frank Herbert, and he is only human. To me it just smells of BS.The first book (Dune) was good. But like the Earth's Children series, I think it ends there. If you read Dune and want another Frank Herbert, I recommend picking up \\"The White Plague\\". Not the best book, not even top ten but intriguing and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Any SciFi Fan","review":"Dune is an epic and seminal work of science fiction.

The depth of the world, the plots within plots, creative characters and systems, etc. The story of Paul Atreides is well-chronicled so I won't go over the plot, but if you have never read this amazing book I encourage you to do so. This, along with Lord of the Rings and Stranger in a Stranger Land are among my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic masterpiece","review":"This was one of the books I've been meaning to read for a long time, and when I finally began reading it, I was utterly engrossed in the story. With the movie and the TV miniseries both available, it's superfluous to state the plot, so. And the story of a young boy becoming a hero isn't new, but the vivid geographies of Dune and the subtle complexities of life on Dune and in the Imperium are fascinating, and all make this a science fiction masterwork. It's got something for everyone: political intrigue, warfare, romance, evil vs good, spirituality. But it's definitely the Fremen and the planet Arrakis (Dune) that cativate me. I'm certainly going to read the rest of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This has got to be one of the best books ever. There is such creativity in this book that while I was reading it I kept asking myself how can a single mind accomplish such a thing. Everyone has to read this book, not only science fiction fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate, complex, flowing, exciting . . .","review":"The environmental pictures painted are peerless. The characterizations are excellent. The religious intrigue, while not mystical or deep, is nonetheless captivating (especially if you're a fan of messianic, \\"Chosen One\\" tales). And the story is wonderful! If you like fantasy, sf, or great novels in general, check it out. (But be sure to get this new Ace edition; it certainly can't have _more_ typos than the Putnam hardcover.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick but worth it.","review":"Dune is a very difficult book to read and one must have the ability to understand big words and a good memory.

Huge mistake. The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read. One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page. It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly. Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE HATE HATE","review":"One of the worste books of all time, I feel.Actually...

It didn't take me long: '...he was bom on Caladan...\\" in the 5th sentence of Book One! Come on Penguin (and Amazon), either significantly reduce the price or get it right (and do the 40th Anniversary proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo $1 credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Dune saga (this time on the Kindle 3 when it becomes available). Now I think I'll just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is Rife with Format Errors!","review":"Okay, it's hard to give this wonderful novel a bad rating, but the Kindle edition is so bugged, it makes me wonder if any human ever proofreads these new-fangled E-books.During almost every instance of italicized passages, there are numerous missing spaces between words.

The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars. The only reason I'm only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors. I can't believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer. I can't imagine that this version was even proofread. It's distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful. DO NOT buy the Kindle version. Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible printing job","review":"Excellent book, however the printing company has done a horrible job. They have not left enough space between the binding line and the words and one needs to struggle with every page to be able to read the book. Such a disrespect to this masterpiece and the author.

Shame on ACE printing company for doing such a lousy job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is a great book, and I watched the movies several times.I read the series in a short time, and I had some really cool dreams. Wish I could remember all of them, but they were motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitive work of science fiction","review":"this is not your typical science fiction. Dune is an introduction to a different, strange universe. Frank herbert did a masterful job of setting up this place- it is unique in a way that no other science fiction can replicate. Herbert's best creation is the world of Dune itself, and its mystical connections with the worms. But perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the book is the way in which its written. Nothing is spoonfed to the reader. You have to work to understand what he is trying to say- and its not easy for the casual reader. Dune is actually the most readable of the books in the series. From this one on, the series becomes more and mroe complex- until it became unreadable in my opinion, with Book5. But even lovers of traditional science fiction will find much to like here. A whole lot of suspense, intrigue and machinations form the first half of the book, with a unique setting and environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparison of original Dune with 25th Anniversary Edition","review":"After reading both versions, one has to wonder why the 25th Anniversary rewrite was performed? Was it to produce more sales? Quite possibly. The 25th Ann edition looses significant character development and intensity from the original.If it is the only version that can be found, by all means read it. I would though suggest that one look for Herbert's original version of Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was sure that it would win the Hugo and Nebula Awards","review":"There ain't much to say about this book else then: SUPERB! It really takes hold of it, makes you read it and then desire for the sequel-book \\"Dune Messiah\\". A rich family, currently ruling the Planet Calladan, is sent by the Emperor to take control of the Desert Planet Arrakis. The only known place were the \\"Spice\\" is found. The Spice became an important resource, because it sharpens the mind of the consumer and in some rare occasions can make people look into the future. Who rules the Spice, rules the Universe.

Save \\"The Lord of The Rings\\". The book was not an overnight job. It had Tons of info to back up every event in the book. It is a whole world with a long history and a reason for every event. It shows what good and bad things can come from ultimate power. The Long animosity between House Aterdies and House Harkonnen came to a climax in the Harkonnen attack on the Atredies. Paul survives by falling in league with the fremen and comes back to defeat the Harkonnens and the Padish Emperor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Science Fiction ever written","review":"I have read the 6 books by Frank herbert and I have seen the vision that he was trying to create in the wording of the books. Those who read the books shouldn't just read them, but they should invision what Mr. Herbert was trying to say and creat in you mind. I would suggest that you underline those parts that you find most interesting and and learn what he was trying to say at the point in the book.

You are bombarded with so many weird names of things that it's easy to get overloaded, and put it down. But this time, I decided to power through that first chapter, and shortly thereafter I was hooked. I've never read such a good blend of story, science, and philosophy. With characters so layered, and plots so intertwined, it was seriously one of the best books I've ever read. But it didn't live up to itself. It felt like the author spent decades composing the first half of the book, making it perfect, and then rushed the last half to meet a deadline in a few months. I may not read it cover to cover again, but I will probably read the first part many times, and be quoting passages from it like sacred text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for an e-book","review":"I have read this book many times.

I could not have been more wrong about how this book would be. For me to call something epic, it must truly be epic. Frank Herbert created an amazing and deep world in this book with immensely life like characters. The depth he went into describing the technology and daily lives of the Freman was astounding.

One might call it a classic of the genere. It has been reprinted many many times and one can find it used for minimal cost and most libraries have copies as well.Penguin publishing was previously one of my favorite publishers but now they are failing to adapt to the market conditions and alienating their customer base. While I don't say I'll never buy anything published by them again I do closely scrutinize and have to be moved from an initial not buying position. All publishers are really going to need to become lean product development houses that do not attempt to lock author's works or customers dollars in. Doing the opposite will cause authors to go around publishing houses all together and customers will just acquire the product in other ways.The price of this kindle product is rediculous and it is penguin's fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Is this book boring or what? I got through the first 100 pages with great difficulty (it was hard to keep from falling asleep) but it didn't get any better. So, I bagged it. I have no idea what the hype was about.

As a Sci-fi fanatic, I was disappointed in this book for a few reasons, the biggest being the boredom aspect. On page 229, I had to put the book down because I had no real desire to read on. The other bothersome aspect is that this book does not take you in on the same emotional level as a \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" You really pull for Tolkien's characters, whereas Dune folk felt like automatons going through another Matrix-lite plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"twaddle-dee-twaddle-dum","review":"Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"...sorry...","review":"After reading Ender's Game...well, to put it lightly, lets just say I got cabin fever.I admit--I have NOT finished the book yet (a side effect of cabin fever), and I WAS intrigued at first. 200 pages in...and nothing remotely exciting was happening. I argue with myself, wondering if I should finish it or not. Will something utterly fascinating grab my attention just 20 pages on?

It consistently tops the charts when readers are asked for the best SF novels. Being a SF reader myself it was almost heretic not to have read it before, so after more than 30 years I decided to give it a try. Awfull, is the word that best describes my experience. I couldn't find any sense of wonder or anything else for that matter that justified such high praises. To compare it to The Lord of the Rings is to commit a crime. This novel is a fraud, a naked king pretending to be wearing the finest clothes. Forget the hype, this is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a relaxing bedtime read.","review":"This is a chore.

I got to almost half-way, but I had lost interest way before then."},{"rating":"1","title":"An E-Book RIP-OFF","review":"There is nothing whatsoever to justify the high price. It is a book with no extras, unless you count the excessive errors. It has the feel of something which was scanned by an eighth grader with a short attention span.

Well, I do a little. There is printing cost. That is not my problem with this book. It's the typos. Amazon needs to start hiring their own proofreaders or refusing to publish books with such a shoddy translation. I'm only about a quarter of the way through the book and I have seen lots of typos.

I don't understand how the same man could have written both books. Dune has strong characterization and a strong plot; Dune Messiah has neither. Dune Messiah substitutes characterization with psycho-babble. Half the dialogue in this book doesn't make any sense and doesn't further the plot. The ending is strong, but it doesn't make up for all the nonsense that Herbert subjected me to. (Don't let anyone try to tell you that this book is \\"deeper\\" than Dune because of all the confusing things the characters say. \\"Deep\\" only equals \\"confusing\\" for people who can't read.) All that said, Dune Messiah made me feel like I was reading Fanfic.

I will leave it to the reader to enjoy the litany that includes the famous phrase, \\"Fear is the Mind Killer.\\"Herbert successfully weaves an epic tale of rebellion and religion. It is the tale of a man who becomes a messiah, and discovers many things about himself, the Empire he lives in, and the world of Dune.Herbert paints a world in which man can travel between stars, yet no longer uses computers; a place where fencing skills are often more useful than energy weapons; a land of soldiers, assassins, prophets, mystics, nobles, monsters. It is about love, passion, resistance--and the effect that the appearance of a messiah has on a culture.Sadly, much of Herbert's sequels don't live up to this first book. However, it is an entirely satisfying epic in its own right--if you never read the other books, this one will still live on in your memory forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book of Future describing the REALITY","review":"When I first read DUNE in Russian I thought it was a very unusual book. But when I managed to get it in English it was absolutely new.

Happily, their were five ratings of a 9 and nothing else but 10's. I am satisfied that the world is not as bad of as I might have thought now, now that I see that there are none so misled as to give possibly the greatest novel ever written a low rating. I urge those 9's to re-review and put the 10's where they belong. Nothing has ever come close to Dune, except Tolkien, and that was to different to be compared.

The most interesting twist is how Leiber moved away from science explaining the supernatural to science using the supernatural to maintain control on an ignorant society of peasents.

I was really looking forward to this movie, but when I was finished watching, I felt incredibly disappointed. Tom Lefroy was portrayed as a jerk, who seemed to have no real appreciation of Jane as a person, but just saw her as a woman to conquer. Jane was an idiot and I never could figure out what she was supposed to see in the guy. The sexual innuendos were thoroughly 2007, and stuck out like a sore thumb.

I didn't see how Jane would even have fallen for Tom Lefroy in the first place. He seemed a complete jerk. I could go on and on, but I won't bore you.I want those 120 minutes of my life back!If you want to see a good film based on Austen's life, watch Miss Austen Regrets (included in the new 2008 \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" by the BBC.)\\"Regrets\\" has great acting, humor, sexual tension, beautiful music and scenery.Watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pass the tissue","review":"Becoming Jane is a must see for those who havent seen it.

There are so many more talented English actresses who would have been better. It was like seeing all of the Anne Hathaway-isms rolled into this movie. I didn't buy her has beloved Jane, no spark.

The kissing, the loving looks, and secret hand-holding all help to make this a beautiful, predictable love story. But I warn you, if you've seen Pride and Prejudice 2005 (with Knightley and McFaden), then you are basically seeing the same story over again here.First, let me clarify that this IS NOT the true story of Jane Austen. I believe that many people have that misconseption. This is a Hollywood film with Anne Hathaway, so how could it be real? Want to know more about Jane? Read about her life in books and on the web. But don't watch this and believe it is true.There are a few objectionable scenes (rearside nudity, a married couple fondling each other in bed, etc.), and I believe that this film almost earned a PG-13 rating. But in the end, I say PG is fine, and it turned out to be a nice love story. I wouldn't watch it again soon, though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I'm a true Jane Austen fan....have read every book many times over and watched every BBC production.

Everything else was lackluster.Why was Anne Hathaway cast as Jane Austen? She can't even get the English accent correct! Even I can do a better one than she! She also is the most unconvincing actress available. Her portrayal of Austen is weak and forced. Too bad Keira Knightley couldn't have been cast as Jane, except she already did a brilliant job as Lizzy Bennett.I really have nothing else positive to say about this film. I even have to say that the DVD is of poor quality: hold it up to a light and put your hand in front of it. You can see your hand through the DVD, meaning that it is cheap. My DVD player had trouble reading it.Luckily I didn't buy this, but borrowed it from a friend.

It was an enjoyable two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Jane?","review":"I think not. Jane Austin was a brilliant woman that saw though cheap tricks and shallow men, just read her book. She watched the games and thought very little of the people who played them. This movie portrayed her as a silly young woman that was wooed by a man of little character and was a TOTAL GAMER. Mr. Wickham was nothing compared to this young man. Granted history tells of a boyish love and a girlish romance, but the way both characters are portrayed in this film you would think that there was only one thing on Mr Lefroy's mind and that Jane was a complete idiot when it came to men. (Which as I said before is highly unlikely with several brothers and a keen eye for falseness in others.) It was more about how young lovers now behave. I didn't enjoy it. We have enough of that kind of romance. I love Jane's books because they move past silliness and towards mutual respect and affection and then love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Jane...","review":"Absolutely love this movie... Very, very well done -- the acting by all characters is superb throughout... Also very true to the period... Yes, Miss Austin's choices were sad to a point, but she stayed true to herself and, I believe, these same choices contributed most heavily in creating Jane to be the Jane who has so blessed literature forevermore... Again, great movie and beautifully done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This, Might Want to Have a Tissue Handy","review":"I hadn't read any of Jane Austen's novels at the time I saw this film. so this was my introduction to Austen.My husband and I tried to see it when it was at the theatre but the local cinema had the wrong time listed on their web-site so we ended up waiting for it to come out on video. And boy am I glad we didn't see it at the theatre. This movie reduced me to a blubbering fool! And I much prefer to blubber in the privacy of my own home.I loved the period details, the clothes, the dances, the social interactions and the relationship between Jane and Tom.The beginning was a little bit on the slow side, my husband fell asleep, but I didn't mind.I loved this movie, I thought it was wonderful, the acting was wonderful, the story was moving, the costumes were beautiful.

The performance level is good, not great, but it is fun and very entertaining for Jane Austin fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Jane Austen","review":"Nicely done movie and well acted as well! \\"Becoming Jane\\" shows us a young Jane Austen already dabbling in writing, but hasn't as yet grown into the writer we know her as today. This movie is really about Jane finding out who she really is and wants from life.In \\"Becoming Jane\\", we learn of Jane's family life and about the social circumstances surrounding life and etiquette during the era in which she grows up. Life is really confining for women back then. It seems that a woman is pushed into marrying a wealthy man regardless if her has feelings of love for him or not.... And being a spinster is definitely frowned upon altogether, let along deciding to create a career for yourself as a writer.We see a side of Jane Austen's personality we may never know about from reading her novels and about the love she gave up for the sake of foraging ahead to become one of the world's greatest women writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Jane","review":"Beautiful performances by a highly talented cast. Anne Hathaway renders a loving, intelligent and vibrant portrayal of Jane Austen as a young woman. The story invokes scenes from Austen's novels but avoids the trap of drawing the whole story from them. Jane's parents and sister Cassandra are admirably drawn characters, as is her somber suitor, Mr. Wisley (sp?), who appreciates Jane's true worth and settles for her friendship when he can not gain her heart and hand. Tom LeFroy is not an appealing enough character as written to account for Jane's infatuation - but such is often the case in real life, and James McAvoy gets the most out of the part.The pacing seems a bit off at times, and some of the characterizations are a bit flat, but overall, it is well worth adding to any collection of Jane Austen novels and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and funny","review":"This movie was exactly what you'd expect: sweet, funny, and heartbreaking all at once. Anne Hathaway fully embodies the sassy and intelligent Jane Austen. Her saucy banter with co-star James McAvoy recalls the bitting humor present in Austen's novels. The supporting cast does not fail to impress, with Julie Walters and Maggie Smith brilliantly portraying Jane's social-conscious mother and a wealthy neighbor who's nephew seeks to secure Jane's hand in marriage. This movie has all the wit you'd expect from an Austen tribute and the right amount of romance to flutter the hearts of the most avid Austen fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly done!","review":"The end of the story between Jane Austen & her \\"beau\\" made me teary eyed, but after that, the blatant sexuality in the movie kind of ruined it for me. The movie took away from the wit, subtlety & the sensuality that Jane Austen had, I'm sure, to this Hollywood-ized version of it. Almost as if in order to keep us entertained, they had to include the nudity & violence. Others may have a differing opinion, but to me it wasn't what I expected & it honestly just didn't fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Fluff - Not for Anglophiles.","review":"While it wouldn't be fair to compare this to the A&E Pride and Prejudice, or the BBC's Persuasion, or even Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility as those were stories actually created by Jane Austen whereas this is merely a biography of Jane Austen, perhaps it would then be fair to compare it to Shakespeare in Love, then? In any case, this film fails badly in comparison to any of those. Becoming Jane is painful to observe in many places, especially where they strove, ridiculously, to fit famous phrases from Austen's work into places in the story. This was a thematic idea in the film which I found unendurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh - I hated this movie.","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is totally boring.

The main problem is that it presents the love story as if it were true, and there's no real confirmation that such was the case. All the research I did after watching the movie (trying to see whether it was based on a real story) shows that the \\"relationship\\" might have simply been a little flirtation, and not, as it is presented here, true love.

Not mentioning Harrison (or bad rapping him) is ironic since the book cover emphaiszes, in large print, the words THE DEAD, which is, not coincidentaly, the title of Harrison's trilogy, Trager can hardly be thought of as a literary artist.

The \\"story\\" ends abruptly with no resolution, presumably to make one sure to tune in to get one, which makes me feel cheap and used. I'd probably be more disgruntled but I didn't actually purchase the book.Other than that, it's not an abysmally bad story, but it's not great or ground-breaking either. The plotline seemed a little too generic for King, which makes more sense now that I have read that it's a re-interpretation of a work by Von Trier.I think some of King's work is really excellent, but I would rank this towards the bottom of his writings. That said, being ranked low for King is better than some author's best, especially in the \\"horror\\" genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is King Druse?","review":"I have been reading this book and am annoyed that I can put it down and, when I pick it up again, cannot begin to tell whether I've already read the section I begin reading. It is flat, with no real suspense, unless you count the question, \\"Was this really written by Stephen King?\\" as part of the book. It is pretty far off in its depiction of the paranormal, beginning with the ants. If this is King's work, he has succeeded at seeming to be a complete amateur. If it is Druse's, why is it a work of fiction? Sorry, this book makes me \\"harrumph.\\" I wish I'd bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Stephen King?","review":"Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie.

After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one, I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have, in the past, always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head.

One could not even classify this as a mystery or suspense. It is really utter nonsense. It is insulting for the author to claim that he is a trained investigator in any sense. Yet he willingly without any investigation gets involved in blood rituals and seances. Any expert in the occult has a healthy respect for the preternatural. Nany Drew would have done a better job on any one of the highly suspicious and improbable cases. This book should be geared for the 6 to 9 year old age group and unless they are camping alone in a cemetary at midnight on a full moon they would not belive or be scard.

Our heroins get punched, knocked to the ground, and kicked repeatedly (usually in the head) then get up and run away. I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.This movie has no nudity, sexuality, or real plot.

It recognized the disks, but would not play them. Amazon graciously agreed to send me another unit second day, and paid for the the original's return.

Why? Well, my main beef with it is that if you play a cd, there is a slight pause between tracks. Many cds have songs which flow from one track into the next track, and in fact, most of my cds are like that, being a fan of dance music (and a DJ). But that doesn't happen with this cd player, as you get a half-second pause between tracks.If you're listening to a mix cd, this is quite jarring. As all my cds (just about) are either mix cds, or stuff like Pink Floyd or the Moody Blues (which have tracks together), this player is completely worthless.It also doesn't let you fast forward or back, because again, it plays track by track, not the whole disc.It's also pretty loud when it changes discs, which is generally not a good sign of a long life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book covers very little on AutoCad 2002","review":"I'm a newbie to Autocad.

John Kerry's extraordinary devotion to public service can be explained by reading of his experiences, as detailed by Douglas Brinkley.

This is a detailed description of John Kerry's service to the country, both during and after the Vietnam War. Anyone who doubts Kerry's courage and tenacity will be disabused of those doubts upon reading this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gutless Wonder","review":"If you read this book, you will believe that John Kerry was some sort of hero. The truth of the matter is that John Kerry never wanted to go in the service. He applied for a deferrment which was denied. Then and only then did he enlist in the Navy. He served only three months on his \\"Tour Of Duty\\" while the normal Tour of Duty is 12 months.Kerry then recieved three Purple Hearts which no commander ever approved. Kerry filled out the applications himself. Like baseball, three strikes and your out. After his three fake Purple Hearts, Kerry was sent home and started his anti war nonsense.In an exhibition, Kerry was shown throwing away medals and claimed he threw away his medals because he opposed the war.

Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service.

Doesn't do enough in covering John Kerry's radical extremism in slandering US GI's in Vietnam as war criminals and the bad guys. Kerry served a total of 4 months and this book makes it out like he is a regular Audie Murphy, do all for your brothers in arms. Kerry sought to get out after getting a third Purple Heart(due to very minor 'injuries') and got out after those 4 months, leaving those 'brothers in arms' to come back and join the pro-Hanoi, Fonda sponsored Vietnam Veterans against the War, a very radical, communist loving group that slandered the US and our troops still over there(The North Vietnamese used Kerry's supportive rhetoric as propaganda with our POWs) as the one committing the wrongs and this book attempts to sugar coat it.

Kerry strikes the reader throughout the book to continue to be a condescending bag of hot air aimed at ruining this country via his hypocracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book'c content not supported by Kerry's military records","review":"This book is more a work of fiction than reality. As a historian Brinkley's book contributes nothing to the history of Vietnam and it is inaccurate in it's portrayal of Kerry's exploits. It relies too much on Kerry's diary and not enough on the recollections of the 200 plus men who served with Kerry. As a retired naval officer and a collector of navy medals for over 40 years, I found major holes in Kerry's records indicating conflict between the book and reality. Regretfully, Kerry has not released numerous pages of his record thus the truth of the matter will not be resolved. One would expect that if the records indeed supported Kerry, that he would have proudly shown them to the world. In the end, Brinkley's scholarship is lacking through a failure to pursue readily available sources. The result is an unbalanced view of Kerry and his service in the Navy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is bull!","review":"I never got past the chapters of Kerry's experiences on the USS GRIDLEY. Since I served with him the entire year, I can assure readers that it is filled with exaggeration and fantasy. Kerry makes himself out to be Master and Commander when he was just a goofy boot Ensign. There are a number of things that are just plain not true and lots of exaggeration. It is not a serious work but clearly a piece of campaign fluff.Don't waste your money unless you are Democratic to the core and need some fluff to get you excited!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Work on a Fine Leader","review":"Anyone curious as to how John Kerry surged to the front of the Democratic presidential race need only read this tremendously well-written and -researched account of his gallant tours of duty in Vietnam and beyond. Historian Douglas Brinkley does a terrific job of telling Kerry's heroic story, along the way tracing the compelling path of a thoughtful and highly principled politician. It hardly seems a coincidence that this book came out right before Kerry's leap to the top of the Democratic pack--anyone who reads it will see just how much this brave onetime Navy lieutenant could bring to the presidency. And whether one agrees with Kerry's politics or not, Brinkley's book not only offers a fascinating assessment of a crucial era in recent American history but is also just a darn good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Tour of Duty","review":"I find it absoultely incredible that someone believes everything that is shoved down their throats. Just because some historian says that he is a hero does not mean that he is. I tried to read this book, but couldn't finish, it was that bad. Kerry's \\"purple hearts\\" shouldn't even count. I mean, look at the guy. He has NO visible injuries and he got out of vietnam with Purple Hearts???All three purple hearts were signed on the SAME DAY.

Any questions you have about Kerry's character or his military service - especially those invented by political opponents who instead backed a corrupt coward named W - you'll find the answers right here.If you value truth over hype and courage over self-serving cronyism, you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research and gross exaggerations.","review":"I can hardly believe that this book is being distributed as factual and historical. A respected author has written a political essay of propaganda. The mighty \\"hero\\" John Kerry is nothing but a liar and someone who has attempted to shame and hurt the image of a generation of brave American's who did what their country asked of them. His flagrant charges which are totally false were nothing but an attack on our country. How anyone could believe he is a hero is so mistakenly foolish to believe this nonsense. Do your own research. The truth isn't found in the pages of this trash. There were NONE of the atrocities written in the book. Where did Douglas Brinkley get his information? The truth is there are many respected Naval officers who were there as well as enlisted men who served WITH John F. Kerry LT (jg) USN who vouch for none of his charges. God help our great country if Senator Kerry becomes our Commander-in-Chief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge the Man; Judge the Book","review":"This book was well-written and well-researched, regardless of how I may feel about Kerry's political stance. My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam. My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate. For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years. My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there. That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, \\"this one is accurate.\\" Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro into Kerry's life and character","review":"I enjoyed this book. John Kerry seems to get more interesting the more you look into him. The portrait given is a moralist, a thinker, who struggled with the great questions of his age.

Brinkley does a good job of humanizing the man behind the political persona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the rewrites.","review":"After I bought this book and started reading it, I discovered that the author, Douglas Brinkley is doing a rewrite because some of the information provided by Senator Kerry has turned out to be false and misleading. And as I understand it, the changes are still coming. Perhaps Mr. Brinkley should have done himself a favor, and written this book in pencil. It's a lot easier to clean up the errors that way. Are they going to issue free addendums of the new rewrites, or am I going to have to buy a whole new book to get the newest version of Kerry's story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tour of Duty","review":"This book is nothing but lies and propaganda.

As a Vietnam Vet, I can tell you that atrocities were few and far between. Brinkley ignored most of the Swift Boat charges against Kerry. He presented most of the Winter Soldier \\"Investigation\\" as fact when much of it has been discredited.It is interesting to read this book in conjunction with Unfit for Command. You get a totally different interpretation of what went on. And it appears to me the numerous officers who contributed to Unfit for Command have it right.One of the interesting things is that Brinkley never even bothered to delve into Kerry's admission on the Cavette and Russert shows that he committed war crimes, including the burning of civilian homes. Hard to believe he did not ask that question. A glaring ommission."},{"rating":"1","title":"you ain't the only vet out there John","review":"If John Kerry believes he is qualified to be President of the United States simply because he is war a veteran....5 million other veterans of this nation should be on the ballot as well.

I'm sure Kerry stayed up late every night and dreamed up what would sound good for a person with political aspirations before he wrote up the days 'After Action Reports'. I just wonder why the author didn't talk about Kerry's three deferments he applied for and received. When he applied for his fourth to study in France he was turned down so he rushed down to join the Navy where he thought he would be far from action. What a shock it must've been when after a few months he was assigned to somewhere where there was real danger. This is probably when he dreamed up his plan to get three purple hearts so he could leave after only four months. How can he talk about his 'Tour of Duty' when he was only there for four months?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Nothing but a whitewash of Kerry's military \\"career\\" intended as propaganda for support of Kerry's political ambitions.John Kerry's entire life is a lie.

Kerry & Fonda's efforts encouraged the North Vietnamese to fight on. The NV leadership said they were ready to go for a conditional surrender after 1969 but decided to fight on thanks to the efforts of Kerry, Fonda and Ramsey Clark.Kerry is a hero in JFK's Vietnam War but a hero for North Vietnam. In 1975, the North Vietnamese rewarded Kerry with a sweetheart real esatet deal for Kerry's cousin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tour of Duty, offensive and Insensitive","review":"As a Viet Nam war veteran, I am completely offended by Tour of Duty, which is nothing more than an attempt to exploit a bloody conflict (in which over 35,000 Americans died) to promote the Kerry candidacy for the presidency. This is not only inappropriate but is egregiously insensitve to both the survivors of that war and the families of its victims! It is exactly the kind of opportunism one has come to associate with that portion of the political spectrum. John Kerry should apologize and immediately arrange for the removal of Tour of Duty from the shelves!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the Story","review":"I'm afraid that Dr. Brinkley missed the boat on this one. By ignoring the Swift Boat Vets, he lost any claim to having written an honest biography of Kerry's war months. Kerry's unwillingness to release his military file would have signaled to any true biographer that there is more to this story than just Kerry's diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kerry Was Still Getting A Navy Paycheck As He Slandered GI's","review":"Kerry was still on the U.S. Navy's payroll as he travelled the NE & MidAtlantic for Jane's Fonda's antiwar rallys. Kerry was an organizer in the group. Pretty sad how he was cashing U.S. Navy paychecks as he was smearing American GI's by calling them \\"babykillers.\\" I guess there were no wealthy widows around so he need the paycheck.Kerry is no hero. He is an opportunistic back stabber. His cousin Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.This is after Senator Kerry sold out American POWs & MIAs while \\"normalizing\\" relations with the new Vietnam."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Manufactured, Not Earned, Record","review":"John Kerry gamed the awards and decs system--I saw it happen during my 12-month (not 4-month) tour of duty in Viet Nam.

NOW, if you are interested in the REAL human perspective on the men who served in Vietnam, then Naked In Da Nang is the book you need to read. I have heard the authors speak and I have read the book -- twice. It is very simple in its presentation -- and very complex in all the images and emotions it stirs (especially for veterans.) You can read it and decide if it represents John Kerry's Vietnam or you can read Tour of Duty and contrast it with \\"Naked.\\" Between these two men, I'd rather see Mike Jackson running for President -- but methinks he's a tad too smart for that!

Kerry himself admits now that he wasn't in Cambodia that Christmas,1968. I really have a problem with many things that John Kerry did ,especially after coming home from Viet Nam. Of all the Marines and soldiers that I personally knew who went to Viet Nam,some to die, I don't recall anyone coming home so fast as John Kerry. Doesn't Mr. Brinkley have a problem with the anti-military stance that Kerry took at the Congressional hearing? Kerry was not just anti-war,that is forgivable, but anti-military is another story. Mr. Brinkley should have covered more of Kerry's inconsistencies. That would have made a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE story of a REAL hero","review":"If you want to read a true and fascinating story of a real hero--both during and after the War--this book is for you. If you want to rant mindlessly against Kerry, like a lot of wackos who reviewed this book have done here, then skip it. Perhaps they'd prefer to be led by an overprivileged bozo who slid into the Champagne Corps of the National Guard--the unit where all the rich boys hid out--and then went AWOL even from that, to work on a pro-war Senate candidate's campaign.As for me, I'll stick with the real heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of liberal saboteurs","review":"In his review of this book (below), hanuan67 from Seattle has obviously not read 'Right From The Heart' by Phil Valentine.

And it isn't \\"conservative\\" but reactionary statist.Why is it that, while the \\"right\\" seems to be powerful now, I see their days as numbered?

Characterizing Clinton as weak on the military or liberalism is one good example. The simple fact is that the US brushed away Iraq with a military force that had been trained and armed by the Clinton administration; yet Clinton was characterized as weak and anti-military. The Bush administration's failure to follow up on warnings issued by the Clinton administration about Al Qaeda and its plans to use aircraft in terrorist acts against the US are ignored. And so on. We could all benefit from a considered debate on this issues with the basic assumption that we are all in this together. Unfortunately this book is not a contributer to that cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much perfect.","review":"Well at least these guys went out on top. This is one of their most consistent and rewarding albums and they never really had any mediocre ones.

The music is pretty simple in its entirety but it's all about texture and mood and these guys were some of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, pulsing eloquence...","review":"This is the most subdued of Morphine's works. Sandman is after new moods, quieter moods. Bass is prominent on this album, as if Sandman has been listening to Massive Attack or something. The sax is oftentimes more background atmosphere and color, with less emphasis on lead riffing or rocking out. It is truly a shame that this will be the swan song, now that Sandman has passed on. The soft desperation that this CD evokes is truly haunting given the context, though, in principle not unlike Joy Division's *Closer* (but not in sound) in adding that special resonance. A stellar final effort from one of the best and most original bands of the 90s. If you don't have Cure for Pain yet, here is your chance to rectify that mistake, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climb the rope on fire","review":"The passing of Mr. Sandman is made even more sad by the fact that their studio swansong, while it may be the band's most subltle and lowkey album overall, shows no decline in creativity, musicianship or songwriting (the title track, for example, is perhaps the loveliest in the band's entire songbook)...In light of Sandman's untimely death, the element of melancholia which has been an ingredient on all Morphine albums is thrown into sharper relief here. Relatively humorous and /or uptempo numbers like \\"A Good Woman Is Hard to Find\\" & \\"Top Floor, Bottom Buzzer\\" provide enough levity to keep the album balanced, but few will mistake this for a party album.I don't know (or want to know) if Sandman had intended to close the album with a song titled \\"Take Me With You When You Go,\\" but it will likely leave many fans with a lump in the throat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low rock at its best","review":"This album is my favorite album by morphine. The band mixed it up on this record. Not all the songs sound the same. There is more variety and the band seems to showcase their musicianship well.

The characters are intriguing and sympathetic. The novel deals beautifully with man's inability to live without holding something sacred, and its tragic \\"hero\\" goes to the grave realizing that he has been trying to fill that void with \\"straw\\" instead of something more meaningful--like faith, or family, or true love.Some critics have said that Turgenev supported the \\"nihilists,\\" the young men who scoffed at all things sacred. They say Bazarov is the hero of the novel, intended to be idolized. But I consider it impossible to read \\"Fathers and Sons\\" and not be moved by a deep need to hold something--anything--sacred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great political treatise, lousy literature","review":"Bless him for keeping this one short, unlike his contemporaries in Russian literature. Unfortunately, the fact that this book is 200 pages is the best thing I can say about it. This is so clearly the case of an author who had a political statement to make and decided, unwisely, to couch it in a fictional as opposed to non-fictional format. This would have made for a great political or sociological treatise, but it is not good literature. The characters and plot are so obviously secondary to the message. The characters are one-dimensional, predictable, and transparent. The plot is forgettable and really almost seems to have been an afterthought. The only real merit of this book is that it captures the birth of an important social and political movement, at a very pivotal time in Russian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanism for the Faithful","review":"This sympathetic portrayal of aristocrats, peasants, conservatives, progressives, radicals, nationalists, internationalists, romantics, and even nihilists is ultimately a work of great humanism in its best (and really its only) sense of men made in the image of God. Turgenev captures the vanity of youth, but considerately and without spite. It's an excellent book heartily recommended, even though he goes a little too easy on the progressives, radicals, internationalists and nihilists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"A classic piece of literature is defined by its ability to transcend time. _Fathers and Sons_ is one such book. It is the story of a son, returning from college with a fellow student, and his father. It is also about the generation gap that exists within the family, the dynacmic of college friends, the marvelous magic of youth, and the strength of familial ties.I first read this in college, but, like good wine, the story has imporved with age. As I have gained experience and wisdom with years, so has my appreciation of the brilliance and wisdom of Turgenev's observations. All too often we think of ourselves as the first to see or experience things - from love, to ideas, to the exuberance and idealism that being young is all about. Turgenev shows us the folly in that line of thinking. And in so doing, gives us a glimpse of the universality of what it is to be human. _Fathers and Sons_ ranks as one of my favorite books for this reason. After a reading, I am sure you will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookware deliveres as promised","review":"Sturdy, enameled finish.

On reading the second chapter descriptions of \\"secret societies\\" a person who knows Egyptian history and religion cannot help but feel a twinge of pain at the outright falsity of almost everything he writes there. The same goes for the brief blurb on Gnosticism as well as most of the rest of it. Find a book that has a more balanced view of history and religious ideas and skip this one. If you consider your time of any value at all then reading this book definitely wastes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy lunacy at its worst","review":"Still's book reads like a litany of modern urban legends. The Illuminai, Atlantis, even pre-Columbian Native American Freemasons! If you want to read something worthwhile on prophecy and conspiracy, look at Gregory Camp's \\"Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-times Paranoia\\", or Richard Abanes' End-Time Visions. William Still shows a chilling willingness to us facist sources to \\"prove\\" his conspiracy theories. Authors like Nesta Webster (British facist in the 1920's), Abbe Barrel, and John Robison are used as credible sources. Truly scary right-wing ideology, just this side of Tim McVeigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you handle the truth?","review":"Still's book, \\"New World Order : The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies\\" is a GREAT history book for high school students. Advanced home school courses ought to be based on it. I'd suggest it for each advanced private and home-school senior.Excellent research, writing and organization. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to the subject","review":"Well written and an easy read. A good introduction to some historical concepts that have been ignored by the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Another reviewer described Truman Capote's acting as unimpressive - decidedly a gross understatement. However, the main weakness of the film is the cornball cheap humor and lack of wit. The great cast is wasted throughout. It's worse than Mel Brooks \\"History of the World\\". Also, there are many convoluted attempts at twists and turns, but the results offer few surprises. In the end, it's more of a high-school script than a movie.The DVD extras are minimal and mostly unenlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real crime...","review":"...is the script. I am amazed at the rave reviews below. I envy their ability to laugh at jokes that wouldn't pass muster at Mad Magazine. The direction, by a theater director who seems to understand nothing about film, is flat and awkward. It's as if everyone, including the wonderful (and wasted) cast, conspired to snuff what little comedic potential there may have been in the script. As a supposed satire of mystery novels, the film is obliged to be more clever than the average novel it parodies, yet there is nothing remotely clever about the plot (if it can be said to have a plot), and makes no sense whatsoever, on any level. It was painful enough to sit through a cable channel broadcast. It seems a crime to ask anyone to actually pay for the ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This is pretty awful. The jokes are all pretty stale and predictable - a regurgitation of some notion of what humor is supposed to be - not the real thing. What's even worse is that it's an all-star cast, so with expectations so high, it has a long way to fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny bones..........","review":"If you have a sense of humor, you can't go wrong here.

Filled with slapstick, double entendre, dry witticisms, and sight gags, this movie has something for everyone, especially those who can appreciate all of the above. It features an all-star cast, including Peter Sellers (The Pink Panther), Maggie Smith (Harry Potter), and a hilarious Peter Falk (Columbo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Simon's best work","review":"Actually saw this in the theater when it was originally released.

Major disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Ever","review":"I just loved this film the first time I saw it. The oneliners are priceless.

The dialogue is pure Neil Simon, quick and clever. A blind butler excellenty played by Sir Alec Guiness adds to the hilarity. Buy this film and you will not be sorry..."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I first saw it in the theatre, I went right back!","review":"I can't say I have ever laughed at anything so hard since. Neil Simon's parody of the 1930's and 1940's detective stories is superbly cast: Peter Falk plays Sam Spade, James Coco is Hercule Poirot, Peter Sellers is Charlie Chan, David Niven and Maggie Smith are reflections of Nick and Nora Charles. They're all summoned to Truman Capote's home to try and find out who is trying to kill them all. It's Simon intermixed with Clue and neither suffers for the blending. ENDORE!

It's just boring, there's no good story, no good acting, nothing worth seeing in my opinion. It's really silly and unbelieavable but not even a fun watch. I would not reccomend spending any money on this movie, and if you get it as a gift, return it and watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watched this movie to see Vin","review":"Okay, this movie is really not very good. I don't like James Bond type of movies. They are always unbelievable and full of outrageous stunts which annoy me. Well this is XXX. Vin Diesel, who plays Xander Cage, is a daredevil criminal of sorts who is recruited by the government to be a secret agent. There is really no other plot. It is goofy and full of one-liners that are lame. Samuel L. Jackson is disappointing, at best. Asia Argento isn't a horrible actress. Vin Diesel, what can I say? I bought this extremely disappointing DVD simply because Vin is the star. Vin is hot. I would watch anything, even this movie, to see Vin Diesel. He is amazing. There should be a Vin Diesel channel where it is only Vin 24x7. That is a perfect world. Perfect..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have anticipated watching this movie for a very long time. I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater and was very excited when it came out on DVD.What I didn't like about the movie were the costumes. Vin Diesel's coat was hideous and the outfits on the females were repulsive.I'll admit that the only reason I wanted to see the movie was because it stars Vin Diesel.The story line is very cliche. It seemed like a James Bond movie. There is a hero who has to save the world from a super evil villain and sleeps with a few women along the way.The stunts in this movie are worth the price alone. My favorite one was when 'X' steals the senator's Corvette and makes a tape of the high speed chase and telling Senator Richard Whatever-His-Last-Name-Was not to be a dick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great!","review":"The previews made me want to get out and watch the movie. To my surprise, this movie [was unacceptable]. I did everthing I could to stay awake. The story was not interesting. The acting was bad. Vin Diesel may be a popular actor, but his popularity wasn't enough to make this a good movie. It just wasn't interesting. Don't be hyped by this movie, it's not all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Def, What?","review":"Purchased this,wasted money. If your gonna release high def movies(sony),shouldn't they be high def? There is way too much grain on this disc and when there isn't the picture is 'soft'. When I say soft I mean not much details, especially in 'face' shots(don't get me wrong there are some bright spots on the disc). Love the high def format alot but studios need to make sure we are getting just that on every release and not rush these things to market just to make a quick profit(the format is about the 'DETAILS'). If you do it right the 1st time you'll find us coming back for more without hestitation, without having to go to sights like highdefdigest reading reviews to make sure the video quality is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"XXX","review":"The problem with this tepid movie is Rob Cohen (the skateboardingfourteen year old teenager's favourite)he makes action films for for skipnot fans who don't shave and live in suburbia! If this movie was made for a more adult audience, it could have been good. As for Vin Disel, he is capable of much much more. Apart from Pitch Black and ElDiablo ( before it was turned into A Man Apart)he comes off as a member of The ATeam! The baddies are sterotyped euro trash with greasy hair in toe. In future Mr Disel should make R rated movies, period. 007 don't worry, don't worry at all, you are the best secret agent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not even Rammstein could save this movie","review":"The first 3 minutes is all that you need to see. It shows a spy being chased into a Rammstein concert where it shows them playing the song Feur Frei! After that the movie just sucks, it has a bad plot and bad acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright the first time...","review":"The second time sucked though. The movie has action for the first few parts, but then it slows to a crawl. The first 20 minutes or so of the movie are really boring. As soon as we learn about Anarchy 99, the movie slows down. Seriously, when the movie isn't in an action scene it is crap. I would write more, but I don't want to waste my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the stunts steal the show!!!","review":"I rmemeber first seeing vin diesel in pitch black a few years ago and i enojoyed it as well as fast & the furious and when i found out he was doing this movie i was really excited. THe movie starts off with xander cage(vin diesel) stealing a corvette and doing this crazy stunt off a bridge amd then gets a job working for the NSA by one of the operatives(samaul L jackson)and then it takes off from there, the movie is full of breathteaking stunts,as most of extreme sports feature breataking stunts and put them in an action movie and it really blows you away with a rush!. I think vin diesel is a great actor, he can act even though in this movie the actions spoke louder than words maybe simular to jean-claude van-damme or jet-li movie where you see not much acting but you have all these fancy martial arts and kicks and in this movie you see fancy stunts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick","review":"I enjoyed this dvd movie more than when I saw it in the movie theater. VIn Diesel's portrayal of Xander Cage, the anti-hero who saves the world, is effective. Lot's of X-treme action and adventure involved. If you like James Bond movies, you'll like this one (even if the tuxedo wearing spy image was killed early in the movie).I enjoyed the director's comments. I came to realize that there are many things that go into producing and directing in order to create movie magic. Creating these type movies involves dangerous work. His comments added depth and a better understanding of the characters. I appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidiest agent movie ever made","review":"This movie is literally a copy of James Bond movie.The only diffirence is the agent who tries to be a \\"cool\\"(skater,action renegade,trash talking,...) agent in the name of being the \\"new age agent\\".Vin Diesel totally ... .The movie is tried to be an original one by having a close-to-teenage guy,who is totally stupid.The story is probably one of the most senseless ones in the movie world.Who would like the destroy all the governments so everyone could be free,by poisioning the world?For the ones still interested in this movie and want to know about this movie:a movie that lacks everything to be a good agent classic.I think Vin Diesel and this movie's makers should watch more James Bond before they shoot the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"XxX is domino action pack !!!!!!","review":"This movie is for the action junkie in all of us and it's loaded and done right. Asia is a delight to watch anytime. Those who call this a dumb movie obvious do not enjoy action and would rate all actions movies the same.

Enjoy that good win over evil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Stop Pure Entertainment!","review":"xXx is no doubt the most action-packed this summer. Extreme sports come into play as Vin Diesel (xXx), a sports icon, becomes a spy, who uses his sporty stuff for an awesome adventure with breathtaking visuals, lots of laughs, and decent acting.

The theatre was filled with young kids (10 to 17). This new \\"hero\\" is not worth two cents. He can't act and all he knows is violence and we wonder why animals eat their young. This movie serves NO purpose except to promote hate and violence and give our screwed-up youth more sick ideas. I really believe that this new Hollywood is filled with hate and is sending a really bad message to our future leaders of our country. There are plenty of stories that movies can be made about, but this one is pure trash. Bad acting, bad music score (if you can call it a music score) bad directing and the list goes on.

To compare it with even the lesser Bond films is not possible. While the Bond films certainly played with reality, this film demands a complete suspension of belief.

Here is a bit of typical dialogue: (Vin Diesel to fellow agents)\\"You guys are thinking Swat Team! Start thinking Playstation and just blow stuff up!\\" It was somethng close to that, anyway.

This attempt tries to capitalize on pop culture in every way.

I mean, if the poison has to mix first, just tell em it's been launched and blow the thing out of the water before it's mixed. Crimony didn't they just SAY that it became harmless? It's just stupid.

The movie is shorter than you might expect it to be and very much like a James Bond Movie but for the new MTV generation. I do have to say some of the stunts are a bit over the top even for this kind of a movie, but if you enjoy hot chicks and buff guys and some great action you will enjoy this movie. The motorcycle scene and the avalanche scene will take your breath away but make you laugh at the same time and say yea right, but either way it is just fun entertainment.

In between, you're stuck with plot and dialog that came as the prize in Crackerjacks.There was one person in the theatre hooting and hollering everytime Vin Diesel did anything. Everyone else was busy snickering at the inanity of it all. In the restroom after the show, people were actually bonding over the discussion of 'what the heck were they thinking'. This is an example of what happens when there is no one around to say 'no, you cannot spend $20M of daddy's money making a movie'.Samuel L.

You could of put Fast and the Furious 2 in front of this picture and it would of been about the same. Vin Diesel needs to select his roles wisely or he may end up being the next Jean Claude Van Damme."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a good movie","review":"XXX starts off with an exciting, total action-packed blast of a beginning, slowly begins to sag, gets awsome again for about 9 minutes, then sags and never manages to become the least bit interesting or exciting again. I also didn't like the fact that it became WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much like James Bond films and it does not live up to any of the hype it got. It fails on most levels, and succeeds on only a few, if that. Rent it, but don't expect too much. Vin does pretty good, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets Face it","review":"Let's face it people, this movie is just another \\"Bond\\" film. Almost pointless action, thin plot, and REALLY HOT actors. \\\\This movie isn't for people looking for some deep plot, with lots of drama (Beautiful Mind). If you like the James Bond films, theres a good chance you'll end up loving this one! Vin Diesel plays this role perfectly, (like we had any doubt!) and the character's rebel style make this a great popcorn flick!The movie starts out like any action movie, the CIA needs to stop the enemy from taking over the world, they look for a hero. That's were the plot takes on a life all it's own. Xander Cage(Vin Diesel), known as Triple X, is a rebel and thrives on high action stunts. So the CIA pick him up and send him off to stop the badguys and save the world, xXx style.A great film with great action sceens, nothing deep but the guys will love the action and chicks, and the woman will love a shirtless Vin Diesel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triple Cheese","review":"This is possibly the worst movie of the year. Let's just forget for a moment the outlandish stunts that are for the most part, absolutely impossible and not even close to believable. Let's focus on the writing. This is just a poorly written movie. It's cheesy and disgustingly predictable. It's a great movie for people who don't like movies with content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this is one wack movie","review":"Don't watch this...vin Diesel is a really bad actor ... and how come Sam Jackson signed up for this movie ...I can't explain how bad it is, It's not even funny bad it's just a head ache"},{"rating":"1","title":"XXX","review":"This movie is just like a James Bond wannabee, the cars the gadgets , are all copied from some James Bond movies. I am an avid fan of James Bond movies and I am not saying that I being a James Bond fan is bias in commenting this movie, but this movie and all its cast & characters still cannot hold a candle to all the James bond movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"XXX it's not a porn","review":"pretty good movie , don't listen to all the people that bad mouth this movie.

Plus, it helps that Vin Diesel is in it, since he is soooo HOT!! But even if he wasn't in it, it would be an extremely good movie! I love all of the action scenes and the characters! Also, all of the high tech gadgets that are in the movie help out too!This DVD has an awesome special feature for the new 2004 GTO coming out this Winter. I love this car and the car that is in this movie helps with the adrenaline rush too!I also love the choice of music!!Good buy for anyone!***Check it out!!***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vin Reigns","review":"This is a great movie for those who love high-tech action and oodles of stunts.

The action doesn't let up, there is great stunt work, awesome scenes, and cool spy toys. The only small thing that could have been a tad better is the kissing scene. Go see this movie and then buy it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Action Actor (Or is he) is in Town!!1","review":"Sounds and appears to be very evident Mr. Diesel is going to be the choice of Actors in American (Arnold/Sly-Type)action films. I know some people in the \\"Biker World\\" who highly agree. This actor has a strong American charcator and no accent to confuse what is being heard on screen. Powerful vocal ability helps. Strong stature, appearance, etc. Convincing strength, and physical abilities. The type of person that would put fear in a big bouncer about to ask him to leave a bar.I predict a very long and successful future for Vin!!!Raelynn........"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is a four star movie","review":"No plot, full of cheesy lines you could recite before the characters did. The action didn't thrill me, the script didn't hold my attention. It even helped me like Vin Diesel a little less. I understand why it's popular with the younger people - it would appear it was designed just for them. But defninitely - seeing a four star rating on this one has convinced me to NEVER trust a rating system EVER again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen! Awful acting! Vin Diesel made guys like Arnold Swartzenagger look like Oscar material. Samual L Jackson was awful in this movie too, and he's usually a great actor. The one liners that were supposed to be funny weren't, the action scences made you laugh. Like the part where he jump over the house on a motorbike and is able to shoot some guy in mid-air. I would give this 0 starts if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this crap","review":"If you want a real spy thriller movie go see \\"Die Another Day\\" and watch it on DVD. I saw this when it came out to the theatres and trust me it's a big ripoff. Everything in it is Diesel's 007 impersonation. He's jealous for one thing: he's not Bond, James Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"xXxtremely Awful","review":"This could have been a Patrick Swayzee flick made for the USA Network. Vin Diesel does what he can with what little he's got to work with here, but he's a star who deserves a much better vehicle than this. Cheesey as can be, bad, no, HORRIBLE acting and worst of all... very mean spirited. At one point, the villans turn on a group of scientists who've made a toxic nerve gas for them and from behind the safety of a thick, glass wall, use that weapon to kill the scientists and mock their deaths, pretending to choke and gag and plead for help while laughing at the dying victims. It's unbelievably sadistic and violent for a PG-13 movie.....On a positive note though, the soundtrack is awesome. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST movies ever made","review":"Bad acting, unbelivable action shots, terrible dialogue, no plot, what more can I say than xxx is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cliche (2.5 Stars)","review":"[I was very torn between giving this movie 2 or 3 stars, so I decided on a 2.5 rating] This movie isn't as great as it was hyped up to be. Right after seeing it, I thought it was really good! But then once all the excitement died down, I realized that this movie pretty much stunk. It was very predictable. I mean, you know that Vin Diesel's character is going to save the world, and that he's going to get the girl. James Bond has nothing to worry about, since any of the Bond movies are better than this flick. It's worth a peak, but it's not a movie I would go out and buy. Sure it has a lot of action, but just action doesn't make a movie. The plot is unoriginal and not that exciting. I think I kind of forced myself to like this because the kids I saw it with thought it was \\"so tight\\" but actually it's not. So, if you're looking for a cheesy action movie, you've found it here! Not that highly recommended. ... Enjoy... well, maybe not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggg!","review":"My wife said it best \\"this movie is for teen age boys\\". Sure there's lots of action and stuff blowing up all over the place. Some great effects, although a bit far fetched in the reality department. But the acting... yikes. Diesel takes the 'wood' grammy away from Keanu. They should have given him a role like AAAH-NOLD in Terminator... very few lines. And the female lead...I guess shes good if you're into \\"heroin\\" chic.Puullllease! I guess some people liked it though...possibly the same people who think pro wrestling is a sport!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Action over Dialogue Anyone?","review":"Okay, for some, this will be a great movie. I remember, as a teen, watching Stallone and enjoying many a movie where it was all about action and not about plot, character or acting. For the next generation, here is Vin Diesel. He is not James Bond, but maybe James Bond's younger, American second cousin. Sure, he used some spy stuff, but for the most part, XXX uses ESPN Extreme Sports moves to make his plans work out okay.For the rest of us, this movie is not a good option. It actually got a little boring watching scene after scene staged just to show off another \\"stunt.\\" Perhaps if the pyrotechnics budget had been diminished just a tad and reinvested in a decent screenwriter and acting coach, this could have been a boxoffice blockbusting series in the making. Unfortunately, it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vin Diesel...","review":"Am I the only person who is not taking crazy pills? Vin Diesel is a freaking dork. He is the worst actor in the world. He speaks in one tone of voice, and he reminds me of a steriod-freaked John Madden. He is NOT the next great action star. He sucks. He hasn't made one good movie, and everyone's riding his nuts, just because he's got muscles. Get off his nut sack people, and realize he needs to stay in the gym, and away from acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage.","review":"The only reason I saw this movie was because of all the hype,(although my expectations weren't high to begin with) and I wish I hadn't completly wasted 2 hours of my time. XXX was the stupidest movie I've seen in a long time, the stunts are completly unbelievable, the acting is sub-par and the story is something that a 5-year old could understand easily, not to mention its about as stupid of a story as I've ever heard. This movie is 100% sensless, thoughtless action with no backbone.(The one redeeming quality it has is Sam Jackson as an actor but thats not enough to save it at all.)

Even the effects were also bad.The only good thing about this was the fact that I didn't go and see this movie is the theater to wast my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get any worse","review":"What can you say about a movie with a story that's even worse than Vin Diesel who wants to make us believe he can actually act. \\"NO BRAIN, NO PAIN\\".

In certain parts of this film it tends to become slow and boring, and the action sequences are nothing spectacular.If you plan on seeing this film for the first time, go ahead and rent it before you purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"::::shakes head:::::","review":"First of all, I know Vin Diesel can act, I've seen him do so in other movies. I just don't know why he can't act in this one . . . I blame it on poor directing. If he's going to be this bad in the rest of his movies, he should pull a Fast and the Furious and keep the lines to a bare minimum of monosyllables such as \\"yes\\" and \\"no,\\" \\"sure\\" ect, ect. The only reason I would buy this movie is because he takes his shirt off, and he is HOTTT! Although the shirtless scene only lasted all of ten seconds, it was well worth waiting and hour into movie to see it. Now, if he had just kept his shirt off for the whole movie, or at least pranced around in one of his \\"Pitch Black\\" black tank tops, the whole thing would have been more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Vin Diesel was awful in this movie. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. the fast and furious was over the top and entertaining. Diesel was good in that flick.

Its VIN DIESEL for goodness sakes! This film promises explosions, hoochies, Vin D. wisecracks and a little plot. That is exactly what you get. Anybody see the latest Bond film?

I had a good time watching this film, isn't that the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"This is an empty movie. Diesel can't act and doesn't try. Where's the action? Where? There are humorous moments but try an enjoy those on the third viewing. The most pain inflicted in this movie was certainly on the audience. From head bangin' music to bad acting by the star - this movie will leave you feeling empty. You won't remember it in a week. Skip it and move on to something with some meat to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad....very bad","review":"This movie is not worth renting, let alone buying. I returned it to the video store right away because I would rather get charged for a late return on adult movies than this one. It would have been much better if it were shorter and could have benefited from some editing. It would also help if there was at least some realism within the action scenes. I mean motorcycles just don't jump 20 feet off the ground without a ramp or something. Do not get me wrong I love action films but this one just crossed the line one too many times. The action was just not believable, but if you like that then who knows maybe you will like this one. I am not putting my name on this review for fear of people knowing I even rented this. Beware...consider this a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad and the Brainless","review":"Loved Vin in Pitch Black, he was pretty good in Fast and Furious too ... but this movie?Ths acting is flat, the stunts make no sense (jumping a motorcylcle over a 20 foot fence with no ramp? I guess I missed the part where he put ET on his handlebars) and there is not much of a story to speak of ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to the bandwagon,","review":"I find this movie rather good. I mean, of course its no Bond, it was never meant to be. I dont even think they were making it to be a parody of Bond. Forgive me for saying so, but most spy plots are recycled, editted, and squirted back out on the market for our eyes. As an 18 year old kid, I can never grasp what was so allluring about Bond, but I could grasp xXx. I mean, its not a movie for die hard Bond fanatics. Its more for kids who just want an action flick. Thats all it really is.I'm not saying the acting was superb, cause it wasnt awe-inspiring. I'm not saying the script was flawless, cause it was full of cliches. I'm just saying that if you go in to this movie with the intent of comparing it to the time-proven Bond flicks, you're going to hate it. But if you watch it with an open mind to take it for what it really is, I'll guarentee it grows on you.Besides, whats not to love about a bald, bulked up, hot muscleman with an attitude?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a comedy?","review":"Wow, this movie sucks really bad. I don't get the whole extreme sports thing? Is that cool to do an ollie with a motorcycle while shooting gaurds? Is it even possible? Vin Diesel sucks (literally). He just doesn't seem right doing half of the flips I see him doing. And, he looks like a bad transvestite when wearing a fur. The only good thing about this movie was Eve. Her ten minutes of fame. And, come to think of it, Eve looks like a bulldog. So, I guess there really is no plus to this movie. We need to send this movie to where Eve needs to go, back to the dog pound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond as Sluggo!","review":"Okay, they blow stuff up real good in this one. So I'll give it 2 stars for stunts and pyrotechnics. And it gets itself over with quickly enough and doesn't waste too much of your time, so another 1/2 star. And if you're of a certain age, this tatoopiercedmuscledtuffguy might appeal as he swaggers about doing nastyforeignhipbadguys and foxybabesluthos. That it adopts the dopey James Bond quips and archaic attitude to women is just part of the genre I guess. Anyway, mindless noisy fun, forgotten the minute it's over. Diesel's act could fade fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I'd love it...I thought wrong.","review":"Boy was I disapointed. This film had no character developement, no real \\"set up\\", and the stunts were ridiculous. This seemed more of a 007 \\"wanna be\\", and 007 Vin Diesel is not.

I would rent this before buying it, if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low jack James Bond","review":"Be warned, this is not in the same class as any of the James Bond series of films. Initially advertised as a new age, or hipper James Bond film, this one does not deliver. This was like K-mart James Bond with horrible dialogue, flat acting, and unbelievably bad stunt work. There wasn't a single stunt in this movie that impressed me, I was left thinking oh wow, I can't believe there was that many explosions and it still stunk. Even the gadgets were goofy and unbelievable. You know its bad when the gadget guy manages to outfit an old GTO with a warehouse full of gadgets in an afternoon and provide a thick hand drawn instuction guide with it! A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I will make it short, about half way through the movie I turned it off.

To summarise: Worst storyline of any action film ever, some of the worst acting i have ever seen,Vin diesel is awful as an an action hero and it is shot very badly as well making it look [bad]. Stay away form this [movie] unless you are an american, as apparently they like this sort of [thing]."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneXXXcusable","review":"Vin Diesel is a great actor, as is shown in this movie (though some of his aesthetics were a bit overdone). The action scenes were entertaining. But that's about it. First off, the first 30 minutes were supposed to set up the story, but the plot was hard to follow. So that left me to guess what would happen in the rest of the movie, and that's where it got terribly predictable: guy meets tough girl, they fall in love, guy finds out she's \\"one of them\\" (the villians), girl says she really isn't, guy and girl get the villians and save the day.

Persuaded by the US government to participate in a top secret underground mission in exchange for his freedom, Xander is off to Prague to try and foil an attempt by a rogue Russian terrorist to save the world. Sounds simple...it is! Sounds like its been done a hundred times before...it has!But all the entertainment is in the action and stunts. While they are all unbelievable, Rob Cohen directs a highly addictive action movie that leaves everything else for dead. While Vin Diesel may not light up the screen (females will tend to disagree), most of his scenes are done by a stunt double, his performance as Xander does enough to warm the audience to him. Martin Szorkas plays a very good 'bad guy'. The ending was a bit of an anti-climax but still satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated XXX-Not Suitable For Anyone!","review":"With last year's 'Fast and The Furious' and now 'XXX' Director Rob Cohen and his team have come up with a new kind of movie franchise; take some bad acting, sophmoric dialouge, surround them with a heavy metal soundtrack, a lot of special effects and tired stunts and hope for the best.....Vin Diesel was fine in supporting roles in \\"Boiler Room\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" but he ain't no James Bond, and as an action superstar in \\"XXX\\" he displays as much charisma as yesterday's bed of lettuce.Even the great Samuel J. Jackson is crippled by the deadly screenplay..you can almost hear him saying to himself \\"let me get my check and get the hell out of here\\"...The DVD is loaded with special features, but when a movie is this bad, it's kind of like puttting a Lexus hood ornament on a Dodge Dart."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie EVER","review":"this movie was so amazingly bad, i valued my time back more than the money i spent to see it.

Stupid: trying to be big, bad and rebellious and only looking like a lot of bad influence on youngsters. The ending was the real fallout. It just kept going on and on.

This one did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cheesiest movie of 2002","review":"XXX was horrible! I didn't expect TOO much from Vin Diesel in the first place, but he was even WORSE than I had expected. This movie had a pathetic plot, stupid dialogue, and the most far-out fake action sequences I've seen in years. I do not understand what the hype is about XXX. The main reason why I kept watching was to see more of Samuel L. Jackson, but even his role wasn't worth my time, and I LOVE Samuel L. Jackson. If you just have to see it because of him, let me give you a word of advice: Fastforward to the Jackson scenes. I was blown away at the stupidity of this movie. I can't believe I sat through it. Poor acting, poor directing, and poor dialogue left me so glad to see credits! This probably isn't a movie for young kids anyway. It's PG-13 rating reflects violence, language, and a scene with sexual dancing. Don't see XXX. It's a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"kicked butt","review":"i heard this was to surpass james bond. I think not. The actions scenes were decent, but the story [wasn't].

So I never bothered to see it. As I had nothing to do the other day, I just decided to borrow it from a friend. And I have to say, it's not very often that I expect nothing of a film and get a lot less than I expected. Vin Diesel is laughable in his role as a super-hero agent, the script is weak, uninteresting and non-believable. The action sequences are also non-believable and mediocre at best and not as \\"mind-blowing\\", as the trailer would lead you to believe. The only reason I can think of for the making of this movie is to satisfy bored teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"XXX a must have for any action fan!","review":"Remember how you felt when you walked out of the Movie Theatre after watching the first Die Hard? Maybe you forgot however when you see XXX you will never forget the adrenaline rush that comes with it! Vin Diesel was awesome in this movie! It's Jam Packed with some of the best action scenes coexsisting with awesome special effects. XXX is a must have for any Action Movie Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION PORNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie will keep you glued to the screen for hours of mind numbing action sequences. It is essentially a james Bond movie with WAY more action and a tattoo'd bad boy as the main character(Vin Diesel).Even though it was directed by Rob Cohen(FAST AND THE FURIOUS)It has very little in common with F&F; except Vin diesel.casting is great story is well..... ok action is like no other movie out there,and the acting is pretty decent.Definitely worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best actor!","review":"Vim Diesel is even a worse actor than Richard Gere!

Rent it - Don't buy it.","review":"I would rate this movie as just \\"Interesting\\". The acting is terrible and I started to get tired of all the one liners. Vin Diesel did an ok job for a B-Actor, but the supporting actors acting was laughable. It reminded me of the cheesy robo-cop movies. I found the action on par and pretty good. Better than high profile movies such as Mission Impossible 2 (Although, the motorcycle stunts are quite far fetched.) This movie was interesting to watch, but just that. It was ok to watch once, but I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And XXX marks the spot","review":"I took a chance with XXX expecting it to be just an average run of the mill movie but this film turned out to be much better than I thought. It may not be the best action movie in the world but just for my two cents it's a very good movie.Vin Diesel stars as the lawless stuntsman Xander XXX Cage who is recruited by secret agenst to thwart the mad schemes of a Czech madman who uses a deadly agent called Silent Night because the deadly chemical is neutralized and rendered harmless by water and water vapor leaving behind no evidence of the incident. The madman plans to depopulate Prague by means of this chemical and it's up to Xander Cage aka XXX to stop the madman.Rob Cohen who directed last years awesome Fast & The Furious directs this movie so those who liked the former I think will enjoy this one too.I hope I didn't give too much away."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond with muscles","review":"It is like watching James Bond with muscles. Vin Diesel takes on the role of Xander Cage and it's like Xander could be a younger version of James Bond, maybe even his child born to one of the many women James Bond has romanced over the years.The stunts are amazing and keep your eyes on the screen waiting to see what comes next. It has action mixed with comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this film for what it was: a fast-paced action flick with a respectable effort from the whole cast and a lot of fantastic action scenes.

As received the pad surface was a bit marred though not in a way that impairs its use. The pad surface is soft and it appears that it will be rather easily damaged. The Wenzel charcoal grey mat appears to be essentially the same product at a similar price (sometimes lower). The grey pad seems less likely to show the cosmetic marring if that is a concern to you. Just buy whichever color is lower priced at the moment unless you prefer the bright blue.These mats are a good value at a price in the range of $8 to $10. Curiously the Amazon prices have fluctuated and gradually increased from $7 to about $20.Wenzel Closed Cell Camp Pad (Charcoal Grey)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bulky","review":"For what it is, hit sleeping pad is ridiculously bulky.For car camping, I think this product is decent, though if I have the option of car camping, I think a portable cot + heat reflector (e.g. mylar blanket) is better for comfort and warmth. For backpacking, it's just way too cumbersome. I may decide to cut it as the biggest pains in sleeping in a tent is uneven ground or roots/rocks the jut up around my back and butt. My head will have the pack as a pillow and my legs aren't as easily affected, so maybe a shortened pad is all I need. But as is, this pad is not gonna cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The authors lost an unique opportunity","review":"The importance of the subject can't be overstated. The authors, however, are more interested in selling advice, keeping unrealistic cases without a full solution, using phrases like \\"We used a simple binomial model to get illustrative results\\". What results? Incomplete answers, however, are nothing compared to basic conceptual mistakes.

Just read the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"A very disappointing read. Although this book will explain the power of real options I feel it does a very poor job of explaining how to evaluate them. Additionally the book has errors in some of its examples and in more than one place is incorrect. (ie spread option analysis) In several places it gives some theoretical values with no explanation as to how they were reached. I would only recommend you read the 1st Chapter in each section, as subsequent chapters just repeat the material but with a different concept. Definitely not for the person looking for a book with some meat on it. (Incidently several of the 'real options' they identify in the book or completely outdated. ie The afore mentioned spread option. People haven't used the method they suggest for many years as its mathematically incorrect.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"If you are interested in learning about how to conduct option analysis, this is not the book for you. The book never provides you with the details on how to conduct the valuations described in the examples. Instead, they use over 100 pages to reiterate the same points they describe in the first 5. Furthermore, there are plenty of mistakes in the text to add to your confusion.In short, this book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a marketing gag","review":"The authors praise the real options approach as t h e new and effective method to decide on uncertain investments. When it comes to elaborate on methods and techniques, however, they fall short of explanations and try to get away just with a presentation of final results. It seems to be no more than a marketing gag.

Not inspiring and not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for those interested in real-option theory/practice","review":"This is a solid book that provides background as well as insight into how to use and finanically benefit from applying a real-options approach. The authors have done a nice job in furthering real-option research in blending the academic with the practicality of implementation.An unexpected benefit of the book was discovering that Professor Kulatilaka has also established a useful website, appropriately titled real-options.com. In addition to the book, todate, this is the most comprehensive website on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best user friendly treaty on Real Options.","review":"This is an excellent book on the subject. It is the most readable and user friendly book on the market on Real Options. You don't need to understand Greek to tackle this book unlike the other ones. The author clearly explains the Black Scholes option model, the foundation of option valuation. They then illustrate how this model can be applied to non option business investment opportunities. The authors establish a real option framework to handle your business decision. It explores many practical cases in detail, so you get a good feeling for this approach. The authors also flesh out when it is better to use Black Scholes vs. Monte Carlo simulation in order to make a business decision."},{"rating":"2","title":": )","review":"I purchased two of these sleeping bags for Bonnaroo Music Festival 2007 and they worked out great - probably most suitable for cold weather, which the festival was not.

It truly is an enlightening book. The writing in it is also truly magnificent. I oftentimes found myself reading the same passage over and over again, rolling the words around in my mouth like a delicous food. This epic novel also has many themes that one can put into use in one's own life. Some of the many important themes? Power, responsibility, and the meaning of life.

ATKM might teach you how to. Second, if you read past the first few chapters, the action speeds up. Like any good book, the author needs to set up the action. Why'd you fool even bother reading the Cliff notes, which are written in boring scholarly tones? Warren was a true poet, and each and every word of this book was carefully selected to convey Penn's message of corruption and fate. By taking the reader through a story through the eyes of Jack Burden, Penn documents the changes of Jack's philosophy of events. An extremely rich book, gripping, and for you ignorant girls, the plot resembles TV soaps that you're probably spending too much time watching. If you want soap-opera twists, ATKM has them also.

No higher praise can I offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but finishes strong","review":"I must admit that part of my interest in this book is provincial, as I spent part of my growing years in Louisiana, where the name of Huey P. Long is still familiar. Robert Penn Warren's novel starts off a little slowly, but the action picks up, and Willie Stark is a finely drawn character whose resemblance to the real life Long will not be overlooked by those familiar with Louisiana's political history in this century. Warren captures the FLAVOR of Huey Long's political milieau with his portrait of Willie Stark.

The trip from one end to the other is one of the most riveting, enthralling, and emotional in my experience.It is less of a political novel than philisophical treatise. But inside our journey through mankind is the powerful engine of human enotion and All the King's Men runs the gamut.Warren had great facility with the language, in line with Twain and Faulkner, utilizing an extensive vocabulary that does not cloud or interfere with story or plot.Get the idea of a man who \\"debauched massively\\" from an automobile seat, and you see what I mean. Warren creates images that guide the viewer into the mind of the storyteller, yet exceed any one man's grasp. We enter the mind of God, and He has quite a story to tell.I cannot recommend All the King's Men more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWER..LOUISIANA STYLE","review":"This book though written long ago, really transends time.

Well, I began reading again, from the beginning, and the most insane thing happened - I began loving the book. And not just that, I read for hours on end, finishing at least a quarter of the book before my first break.

The novel gives us a glimpse into the underhanded, controlling, backstab-your-own-kin tactics of politicians and their cronies, and that is always enjoyable. Sometimes the book becomes a bit long and plodding, but other times it is a pageturner.

If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published.

First of all, the narrator's voice is so gravelly and unappealing that it was a low-level version of torture to listen to.

With standouts by Patrick Stewart as a bitchy cutting designing older queen and Brian Batt (Mad Men's resident closeted gay) as his \\"Cats\\" loving lover. There are wonderful cameos by Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy, Olympia Dukakis, Victor Garber, Camryn Manheim, just to name a few.The real heart of the story is where to look for the finest performances. Steven Weber as Jeffery and Michael T. Weis as Steve the man who challenges Jeffery's decision on how to get by in without love are so fresh and believable. They are a joy to watch and lovely to look at as well.\\"Jeffery\\" delivers plenty of laughs and some tears along the way. A wonderful play that translates well to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Cute","review":"I saw this movie a little after it was released in the theatres back in 1995. It's about a gay man that is trying to come to terms with the changing sexual landscape of the '90s. Back in '95, this movie was really funny with a serious overtone to it. Watching it again, it still remains funny but seems really dated in it's attitude towards HIV & AIDS. Even though it seems dated, this doesn't take away from the charm of this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes \\"arthouse movies\\" or gay themed movie fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed so hard my stomach ached!","review":"I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters back in 1995, and I simply loved it. Steven Weber plays Jeffrey very believably, considering Mr. Weber is in fact straight. Patrick Stewart also plays his character very well; it's a very unexpected role for him to play, and I like it when actors and actresses play against what audiences expect of them. While the plot is actually pretty predictable, the sheer humor makes that ok. I totally recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Gay Movies Ever Made","review":"I cannot believe that so many people actually liked this movie. I have seen over 60 gay and lesbian movies and this is by far the worst one that I have ever had the misfortune to watch-with \\"Chuck and Buck\\" running a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeffrey","review":"Okay,so it's not rocket science. This is a fun, funny movie about a gay man coming to terms with living his life and enjoying it as opposed to running away in fear. Great script, so very touching and very funny scenes. The cast is amazing. Patrick Stewart steals every scene he's in. Really good movie adaptation of the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"gr8 movie","review":"Jeffrey is funny man who just scared and took everything to another level at least until another guy came his way to explain that it aint bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"comedy about Aids with a message","review":"Jeffrey decides he doesn't want to have sex because it has become so difficult to enjoy it with all the dangers of Aids. Of course, his attitude is impossible to maintain when he meets Steve, a gorgeous - and HIV-poisitive- guy. The film shows Jeffrey's struggle to come to terms with his fears, and to not let them stand in the way of a relationship with a man he loves. Friends and family play an important role in helping Jeffrey. Maybe this sounds dull, but it's actually very funny; especially the scene where he calls his parent is hilarious (I won't spoil the fun by telling what he discusses with them). With the current increase in HIV infections, this is again a very topical film that you must see. It shows we have to enjoy life to the full, without losing a sense of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great shoe. I normally dont order shoes on line because of the fear of them not fitting right, but these shoes fit like a glove and I could have worn them all night. The delivery was fast, I had them the very next day. I would surly order shoes from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe- lots of compliments","review":"These shoes are my favorite in my closet right now. I have them in chocolate. They are so pretty and look great on- I have big feet (size 10) and they make them look much smaller than usual. The one minus is that they are a bit weird to walk in. I just don't feel completely steady in them b/c they have a different and heavy wooden heel, but it just takes some getting used to. I'd highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Mac!","review":"I ordered this beanie as a gift. I was so happy not only to find Mac at Amazon, but the price was excellent! I received my order quickly, and Mac appeared to have never been touched or taken out of the plastic bag he was originally wrapped in. My friend, who is 9 years old and a huge St. Louis Cardinals fan, was ecstatic to have Mac. This was also a life lesson for us as he prayed that it might be \\"the plan\\" for him to have Mac while understanding the possible risk when we place an order with a complete stranger. Imagine how his heart soared when I handed him this precious toy which represents one of his heroes. Some might say, \\"It's a silly toy!\\" but this seller boosted a little boy's spirits in more ways than imagined. Thank you - thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This movie was not what I expected. I was looking for nostalgia, instead I got different scenes from bugs bunny shows, all of which had nothing to with Easter. Save your money and do a search on youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Obvious Decline....","review":"I love keith Richards but it's clear he ran out of new and/or clever, innovative ideas quite some time ago. Mick, too. This album has little edge, skill, or ambition to it. Even Mick's lyrics are lacking. It may have been great to have Mick Taylor come back and try to re-ignite the old, old flame of decades ago. I was afraid this was going to happen with this album...and it did. Another album similar to \\"Stripped\\" might be good (w/ classic non-Stones cover tunes). Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to SpookyChick","review":"I have been a Stones fan since my dad turned me on to them in the mid 70's. The first album of theirs that I bought with my own money was Some Girls, and I played it till it was all scratched up. And except for Tattoo You, the past 20 or so years have been spotty at best. Well, I'm happy to report that this is their strongest album since T.Y., and rightfully belongs next to their best sixties and seventies albums. I won't bore you with the song details. Just read the reviews here and take it from me, you won't be disappointed.And if you check out SpookyChick's other \\"reviews\\", you can see that she is very biased to liberal media, and most of her reviews are negative. Just ignore her and she'll go away. Unlike the Stones, who will be remembered long after Mr. Bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy Brings Out Their Best","review":"Two potential catastrophes in the band this summer -Charlie Watts' brush with Throat Cancer, Ron Wood's brief descent into Crack over his ex-wife's suicide-formed the catalyst for Mick and Keith to stop chasing fads and deliver this, their most potent set since 'Tattoo You.' Enthralling, stripped-down melodies abound throughout the album, but I'd list my favorites as 'Back Of My Hand,' with Mick playing remarkable bottleneck slide (it's true!) and drawling with 'Sticky Fingers'-like majesty, and Keith's \\"Infamy,\\" with a rising chord progression which sounds cribbed from their great '70s Paris bootleg, \\"I Need You.\\" It's seems, at last, that they've figured out they only have to draw from themselves to find the old magic. Welcome back, boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mick-heavy, great Stones album","review":"This is almost a Mick Jagger album grafted into a Stones album, bringing out the best in the former and plenty of solid work from the latter. Jagger not only co-writes the songs and sings, as usual, but also plays guitars (including slide), bass, harmonica, keyboards, percussion, sometimes all on one track. I haven't seen this much one-man work performed so beautifully on a pop album since Prince was at his peak. On the other hand, Stones fans may miss hearing more from Ron Wood and Daryl Jones, especially after the awesome work they did on the last tour and live album. As accomplished as Mick is in their roles on several tracks, you can feel the difference.The lyrics are awesome, with \\"Sweet Neo Con\\" socking it to the right; \\"She Saw Me Coming\\" giving us a classic Stones double entendre and a femmes fatale; \\"Rain Fall Down\\" waiting out a storm with a lover while an eerie, funky phone rings and rings. Mick seems supercharged."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one doing it better...","review":"at their age, And that is what this is all about.At 60-breaking new ground about the definition of who can rockand at what age. Damn good record.Hell, with 16 tracks-how many clunkers? 1-2..maybe?Who else could make that claim today? remarkable......your welcome"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stones are Back","review":"This is a return to the great layback production of Voodoo Lounge after the experimental production of Bridges to Babylon. The Stones are great as always. The team of Jagger and Richards bring some of the best written songs in awhile. Even for a bunch of old men they still could rock and this album proves it. Some of the bluesier songs remind me of those on Exile on Main Street. Though some songs are poppy, this is still a very good put together album. Favorites include Rough Justice, Let Me Down Slow, Rain Fall Down, Streets Of Love, Back Of My Hand, This Place Is Empty, Dangerous Beauty, Laugh, I Nearly Died, and Look What The Cat Dragged In. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look What The Cat Dragged In","review":"With sixteen songs, the first impression is that there's got to be a lot of filler here. The good news is there's nothing but perfect Rolling Stones songs - one after another. The Stones jump around from the pondering bluesy, \\"Laugh, I Nearly Died\\" to the hard paced, \\"Driving Too fast\\" and \\"Rain Fall Down\\". Some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political, \\"Sweet Neo Con\\" and the scathing, \\"Look What The Cat Dragged In\\". It's all new, fresh and lively as hell. Producer Don Was does a fantastic job getting the Stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades. Rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true bang","review":"I bought this album yesterday but I was familiar with the most of the songs.So I can review it.First of all don't believe the guys that give 1 star etc.They should not taken seriously.Now for the album.It's sure better than Voodoo Lounge,than B2B etc.I will place it in the best 10 albums they have ever made or at their 12.A nice addition for the long time fans and a good way for teenagers to start be interested in the best band ever.I give this album 5 beacuse I can't stand the guy that gave it 1.Basicaly it worths 4 stars to 4 and half.Somewhere between"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to form","review":"\\"A Bigger Bang\\" is the Stones album I've been hoping for since 1983's \\"Undercover.\\" This album contains only the core band with a minimal amount of outside musicians, unlike the extravaganzas on prior ones. It's great to hear the four Stones, plus a bassist and maybe a piano player, cranking out rock-n-roll just like the old days. This basic rawness is sadly missing on every album since \\"Undercover\\".\\"Bang\\" shows that the Stones still have it, and that they can give any modern act a run for their money. I hope the Stones know what works and make their future albums along this vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"good effort","review":"I was curious to see what this bunch of 60+ guys are still capable of, and I knew it was generally considered a good effort, so I bought this the other day.Simple, kick-arse R'n'R is what I love; I also enjoy anyone sticking it to the Idiot in Chief - which is why I like Rough Justice and Sweet Neocon the most.Rough Justice is just great R'n'R.Many seem to have critiqued Sweet Neocon on two levels: as just a political message, and as a song.For me, I don't think you can separate the two. I see part of R'n'R as always being about rebellion, so the fact that the sound is rebellious just adds bite to the sarcasm of the lyricsas for the rest, none of it really grabs me that much, personally. Particularly the bluesy numbers, as my taste is R'n'R.I rate it 4 stars, because I think it's a good effort, just most of it doesn't appeal hugely to my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Bloody Wasn't","review":"Go buy \\" Bridges \\", \\" Steel Wheels \\" and avoid the God Awful \\" Voodoo Lounge \\" and don't waste your time with this rehash of \\" Bridges \\" \\" Steel Wheels \\" and the God Awful \\" Voodoo Lounge \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN A NIRVANA CD IS A BILLION TIMES BETTER.","review":"GOD DAMN, THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER CREATED EVER!!!

The Rolling Stones aren't getting older; they are getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Stones CD","review":"Most of the reviews capture the essence of this new CD, so there is little more to say. To me, though, a couple of items stand out: Jagger's voice is brillant; Keith turns in at least one catchy tune; the guitar work is OK (could have used more of the famous weaving of the 70's work); and the writing is fair. The problem is that these guys have so much more in them that its a shame that they don't exploit it. Listen to Keith's guitar and voicing on Hubert Sumlin's latest work, or for the West African rhythms at the end of Laugh, I Almost Cried. I think you may get what I mean. Hopefully, they will finish this all off one day with a CD that will have each one of them lay down 2-3 tracks of their best. This would be an appropriate end to one fantastic band."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bang\\" is a blast","review":"Not trying to force anything revolutionary or chart-busting, the Stones wind up hosting an intimate little party of an album. All the friends you've come to know and love are here -- the ballsy rockers, the funk work-outs, the blues blasts, the swaying ballads. And the Stones treat all of them to playing that's pretty much unparalleled at this point. This is a band that actually sounds like a band -- the instruments talk to each other, the songs tilt and swerve, the energy is authentic. \\"Bang\\" isn't the orgy that was \\"Exile\\" or \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or \\"Some Girls.\\" But it is a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the Rolling Stones had died in a plane crash","review":"If the Rolling Stones had died in about 1979 or 1980, they would be remembered today as the most excellent band of all time (even better than the Beatles and Led Zeppelin), and everyone would've been dying to know what they would've done if only their lives hadn't been cut tragically short. Maybe the musical landscape of the 1980s and 1990s wouldn't have been so barren without them . . . Hmmmm. That of course didn't happen, and I love the Rolling Stones, but part of me agrees with BALD, the \\"classic rock\\" novel about the importance of hair by Russell David Harper. It's fun to wonder about these things, but the album's pretty good actually.

The band SOUNDS great, I don't have any problem with the MUSIC here, BUT the songs almost to a one suffer from an acute case of Jaggeritis, an affliction dating back to Dirty Work where the Mick opts to go on for paragraphs when a few well-chosen words would do the trick. Dangerous Beauty isn't bad, great playing, but who is going to remember any of this in a few months? When even the Keith songs don't cut it, what hope is there left? This feels like a half-finished album, a great band playing hot but with too many wordy whiny Mick solo-album reject lyrics to make it worthwhile. This isn't the comeback album or tour of the year. That honor goes to Garbage, playing their hearts out live and with a solid album to boot. What a depressing disc this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This time they mean it","review":"It's a wonderful surprise when your expectations are bettered by a band. After \\"Bridges to Babylon\\" I wasn't expecting much, but this album is the Stones playing with passion, conviction and an energy that a band one third of their age would envy.As always Charlie Watts is awe inspiring, Keith Richards and Ron Wood play with ferocity but its Jagger that really impresses this time. He is singing with none of the awful affectation of the later day Stones and is speaking from thje heart, mixing rage, heartbreak and one of the best sneers in music.Stylistically they stay exactly where they are comfortable - blues, country and full ahead rock 'n roll. Outstanding tracks include: Oh No Not You Again, Back of My Hand, She Saw Me comming and Sweet Neo Con.I know its fashionable to sneer at \\"strolling bones\\" but get over it, because they sure have.

There's something to be said for that -- even though my intention (before reading those reviews) was to simply say that this record is without a doubt their most satisfying work since Some Girls.Although the album is marred by the way-under-par \\"Infamy\\" that closes the CD, this is, all told, a vibrant album with, out of the 16 songs, at least 10 that are top-notch Stones.

If anyone needs proof that drugs kill brain cells, they only need to look at all these Rock stars trying to be political scientists. The Rolling Stones should stick to writing songs about cheap sex, boos and partying. anything deeper than that could risk the loss of thier few remaining brain cells. Of course, the president and the conservatives needent be offended. Criticism from a bunch of old brain dead, stoner geezers should be taken as a compliment.after all, advice about character should come from one who actually has some.

I actually think Bridges to Babylon is one of their finest record (I don't dislike a single song on it) but A Bigger Bang is just not very good. Stuff like \\"Streets of Love\\" is just awful easy listening, and \\"Sweet Neocon\\" is just the Stones trying too hard to create controversy during the Bush Years. I did like \\"Rough Justice\\" for about ten seconds then realized, again, they were trying way too hard to \\"rock\\".I think the Stones will eventually admit that this record stinks.Thank God for the second side of the Exile on Main St. reissue. It more than makes up for A Bigger Bang being the Stones final studio output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Fit for the Toxic Waste Dump!!","review":"I recently heard this played straight thru at a small party consisting of mainly over-50 types. Mainly third-rate guitar blasting and thumping, vocals that would make a howling animal sound good, and lyrics that were simply non-understandable. I listened (or really tried to close my ears, but that was impossible), and politely refrained from comment. If this is the best the \\"Greatest Rock & Roll Band\\" in the world can do, then the state of current pop music is at least as bad as I though. Compared to Brian Wilson's recent \\"Smile\\" this is a D-. For comparison, listen to the 40 year old CD's by Sinatra/ Basie, also recorded while the performers were over 60, and you'll realize how bad this \\"Bigger Bang\\" really is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should be called a bigger blow","review":"Let's face it--the stones are a concert band PERIOD.This cd is pure drivel--sweet neo con is the dumbest song I ever heard with the dumbest lyrics i ever heard.When Mick swears in concert we shake our heads and go that was cool,when he swears on this album i think he did it just to hear the words.They mean nothing.Being an optimist that I am the 2 richards songs with him singing are pretty good--other than that this album is a major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to get excited about.","review":"Imagine everything you've hated about the Rolling Stones studio output during the past 15 years.

The first time I put this album in and started playing it, I felt time warped back to another time. A time when bell bottoms were coming into fashion and music had a real feel to it. This is the Rolling Stones of old in a way, but with a touch of newness to their music. Songs like \\"Rough Justice\\" and \\"Biggest Mistake\\" could be right from albums of that time period. Which to me is a much needed thing now adays. The Rolling Stones have brought music back to music with this album. If you like Classic Rock or are just a Stones fan make sure to pick this one up as soon as you can. Actual rating: 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang Bang Bang Bang!","review":"The Stones finally make a GREAT record! I have been waiting for this since Undercover (voodoo lounge and Bridge had some decent cuts) This is a more raw, Leaner stripped down Stones....like they sound best....I think the licks tour really breathed some life into this corporation of Rock and Roll....most all the tracks are rockin'....sweet neo con is a little lame musically (I hate Bush too....but its still sort of lame cut)...NOW IF THE STONES WOULD KEEP THIS UP AND GET RICK RUBIN TO PRODUCE THE NEXT ONE.....GET RID OF DON WAS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones rockin' with power","review":"A number of old rock acts have come out with \\"new\\" albums lately, but the Stones have actually produced one with power and lyrics and melodies that stick in your head. They impress with creativity and energy that many of the \\"modern\\" acts don't. Some highlights:\\"Rough Justice\\" and \\"Oh No Not You Again\\" are some of the more powerful rocking tunes on this CD, good for cranking up when you're p'd off, or maybe need inspiration for a good workout.\\"Laugh I Nearly Died\\" is a bluesy, moody piece, good for those rainy days. So too is \\"Rain Fall Down\\", a bit reminiscent of the dark, steamy scene set in \\"She Was Hot\\" in the album \\"Undercover\\".\\"Back of My Hand\\" is a good bluesy tune in the style of the classic bluesmen with acoustic guitars and such.All in all, this CD should be one that will sit in your player for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this album","review":"I like Driving to Fast and also Sweet Neocon(even though Jagger said it is not about Bush-yeh right).

Mick and Keith can still crank out a fine set of tunes, and there's a great set of them here. To be honest, I can't think of one song that I would skip on this disc. Even the \\"Angie\\"sequel \\"Streets Of Love\\" has grown on me, and is actually pretty good. Of course, \\"Rough Justice\\" \\"Back of My Hand\\" \\"Look What the Cat Dragged In\\" \\"Dangerous Beauty\\" and all vintage Stones tunes, and stand out to me more than anything of Bridges to Babylon. The real stunners for me are actually \\"She Saw Me Coming\\", which some knock as repetitive but I was bowled over by it upon first listening, and Keith's closer \\"Infamy\\", which has yet to stop playing through my head. All Stones fans should own this, no doubt. Its just a matter of time until this one gets thrown in there next to \\"Some Girls\\" \\"Tattoo You\\" and \\"Aftermath\\". Probably not the big four though, as no one will ever top that batch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stones are back and SpookyChick is an IDIOT","review":"First of all, IGNORE Spooky Chick, she's a moron, to put it plainly. \\"Neo-Con\\" is a great track, and it's even better to hear the Stones actually saying something!

Please retire for all our sakes or the VERY least, stick with the concerts and continue to scalp your richest fans for $150 per ticket. That's what you do best Stoners, playing live at outrageous prices for the biggest fans with the biggest wallets. At least until one of you has a heart attack or something and then all your millions you are so greedy to obtain (that you cant possibly spend) will go to your relatives. Hats off to bands like Pink Floyd who knew when to quit, never got greedy, are happy with the money they made, the royalties they still receive, and when offered 200 million to do a reunion show said stuff it.

Recently I loaded it into my Ipod and have been rocking out to it regularly.First of all, I find it to be great fun. Okay so it's not the best Rolling Stones effort, and no comparison to the greats like Exile on Main St. But there are some rockin' little tunes here, and certainly enough to rationalize the purchase.Of course my favorites are the ones that most reviewers list as the weakest and least favorites.Streets of Love (had to be written with Jerry Hall in mind and heart) & Sweet Neo Con. (Politically charged and my sentiments to a \\"T\\") Second favorites are Rain Fall Down & Laugh I nearly Died.They may be looking like little old men who have been around the bush and back a million times, but they still rock and roll like nobodies business.I would have given this 5 stars, but it just doesn't stand up to some of their older and better masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterile production","review":"Stones albums of late have suffered from sounding too clean, too precise. When I look at the credits - well, what do you know (and big surprise): produced by Don Was. They need to get the hell away from these old, outdated GOATS and get with some new blood, bring in some people who will bring out some much needed organic grit and warmth.

Real musicians only get better with time... it's the public that stop listening really listening to what they are saying once they are not \\"pop\\" \\"mainstream\\" or young enough.Listen to the record, yes it is a great record...Oh one last thing, Sweet neo con, IMO is the best song on the album, music and lyrics, it stands on it's own as a great song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to pin down","review":"The first time I listened to A Bigger Bang, I was unimpressed. The songs all seemed lackluster, and either too trite or too contrived. But after a few more listens, I have started to warm up to it. While it might not be a GREAT album, it is a good one.What I find interesting about many reviews of A Bigger Bang (not just those on Amazon, but those from many professional reviewers), is that everyone seems to agree that the album is too long. They all say it would have benefited by omitting a handful of tunes, but then they vary about which tunes are the keepers and which are the losers.Here's my list of the expendible tunes:- Rain Fall Down- Back Of My Hand- Oh No, Not You Again- Dangerous Beauty- Driving Too FastI fully expect that other reviewers will disagree with my selections and prefer to punt a few different tunes. But that's the whole point of my review: it's hard to pin down what's good or bad on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from someone older then my grandpa ever!!","review":"This is one of the best Stones albums in a while, The last couple albums havent been the greatest but this is a comeback,I'm not going to go into detail but if you like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Experience, or any of the other great bands from the 60's and 70's this is for you.EVERY SINGLE BAD REVIEW IS FROM THE SAME GUY UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME... read them you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painted Melodies, Rocking","review":"This band's musix never gets old.

I love the Stones' version of Pain It Black as well as the version of Paint It Black by the Animals, Vanessa Carlton, Corinna Fugate, the Who."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"As a lifelong Stones fanatic, I'm sorry to say Bigger Bang is rubbish. It joins their other 2 rubbish efforts, Undercover and Emotional Rescue.

It's too bad that Mick, Keith and company didn't pull the plug after \\"Tattoo You\\" (1981).

For another book with good case examples of customer relationships, check out Cram's book \\"Customers that Count\\".Another good point, Seybold puts up an interesting form of measuring customer relationships in chapter 8, called the \\"Customer Flight Deck\\". Structurally, the book has three principles: 1. Customers are in control, 2. Customer Relationships count. 3. Customer Experience matters.

Seybold, author of the new-economy classic, Customers.com, discusses e-business techniques for improving your customer value. Based on the premise that customers are much more informed, and thus are aware of competitors and pricing, she describes how to embrace the e-business revolution and respond to these new demands. Seybold includes many examples of companies that successfully adopted these strategies. However, it should also be noted that as this review is being written, many companies that espoused the ideals offered here are closing up shop. That being the case, the imminent and dramatic changes to the nature of business identified by Seybold might be a bit less imminent and dramatic than advertised. Nevertheless, we [...] strongly recommend this book to executives, sales managers and customer service pros, all of whom will benefit from her innovative business strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on The Daddies!","review":"This Cd kicks!

Even so, it is worth slogging your way through to the end for the piece de resistance: a brilliantly performed monologue by Lynn Redgrave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Bore","review":"This movie runs around 2 hours, I was checking my watch at an hour and fifteen minutes. Wooden peformances abound. In some ways, Kinsey patterns itself after Shindler's List -- down to the teary finale and participant interviews.There are more than a few heavy handed moments; a lesbian who redeems Kinsey when all seems lost, the sexual predator with a massive hardback volume documenting his exploits, and last but not least around 2 minutes of silent credits at the end designed to encourage applause. But I was laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one too many","review":"I have never written one of these reviews before, but I felt compelled to warn potential KINSEY viewers that it is completely wretched and overflowing with awfulness. Do NOT be fooled by rave notices. This is a movie about people who are uncomfortable with sex that will make you uncomfortable with sex. And the sex? It's clumsey and passionless.The miracle of KINSEY is that it manages to make some very actors look talentless and stiff. Did I say stiff? Sorry. But I did not believe one minute of one scene. Maybe it improved in the second half, which I did not see.If I had paid to see this ugly cur in a theatre, I would have cried like a baby until they gave me my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore","review":"The real Kinsey was no 'hero'; he used stats for his 'study' on the sexual response of children - the information he took from one source, a convicted paedophile's own journal.With such scientific 'backing' as this, the real Kinsey then published these derranged fantasies as fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, interesting history, makes a point.","review":"The self-proclaimed morality police won't like this one much because part of the point of the movie is that they get in the way of people understanding important things, like the science of how their bodies function.Other than that, it's a good movie. Well acted, moves along quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're All Transformed","review":"Because of Prof. Kinsey's work.That's the premise of this movie. I was fascinated to learn that Kinsey was, by background, a zoologist and self-described taxonomist. I guess he was very unqualified to do the work that he did.In fact, that precise lack of qualification is what allowed him to think outside the box (a worn but apt cliche) and make his scientific study of sex.Our society's commitment to non-judgmental treatment of sexuality derived so much from his work. Our society's fanatical dedication to pleasuring ourselves also resulted. The core question: are we happier? The character portrayed by Lynn Redgrave would certianly say yes. I wonder if all would agree as unreservedly.My only carp: the movie sells Kinsey to such an extent as to exclude other very significant \\"sexual taxonomists,\\" such as Krafft-Ebbing and Havelock Ellis. Movie makes you think Kinsey was the first on the field with this; he was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully acted, clinical bio","review":"Kinsey is a very well made film. The performances are uniformly excellent. Neeson and Linney(as always)are great in this. Lynn Redgrave turns in an absolutely heart-breaking cameo at the end and the research boys (Saarsgard, Hutton and O'Donnell)all have their moments.While sexually explicit, it is very clinical in it's presentation. It serves to distance the viewer enough to make the in-you-face sex more palatable for those who might be more reserved, but also takes a good deal of the passion or emotion out of the story. Not a major gaffe for the research subject matter, but it feels a little cold.Beautifully filmed and acted, I still highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and enlightening","review":"This film is very interesting and enlightening. It answers many of the why's and how's how Kinsey's scientific interest into sexology.Be forewarned....if you disapprove of frank discussions about sex, homosexuality, visual depictions of nudity and intercourse, this isn't the film for you.The extra features in the double-disk set are well worth the extra price.

Firstly a breakdown of different aspects of Indian vocal music, Druphad, Kyhal and the types of ornimentation used in singing and secondly a good listing of a large number of ragas in all of the different thats with examples in different Tals.As with Tabla playing vocal music is something that should be taught teacher to student rather than from a book. This book would no doubt be very useful to someone who has a either a good grounding in Hindustani music or has had a couple of lessons and wants to push themselves a bit futher however I wouldn't go for it if you are a total novice.

I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative."},{"rating":"1","title":"exit wounds","review":"This was my first Joanna Brady novel and I am just disapointed. After about 150 pages I gave up and decided not to finish it. I was OK with a female sheriff in conservative Arizona who had a stay at home husband who could do everything. Joanna was pregnant and I was thinking that the guy might find a way to nurse the baby when it arrived. It was fine when the Chief medical examiner in the next county was female. But when the local priest, or minister turned out to be female the book starated becoming unbelievable. When I discovered that the book read like a romance novel with a political agenda and that it seemed to be written for a teenage audiance, then I decided that there was a far more rewarding use of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exit Wounds","review":"This was my first J A Jance book and my first one in the Joanna Brady series. This mystery is packed with twists and turns that keep you reading to see what is going to happen next. I also enjoyed how the author addressed the town and family dynamics in the book with out being \\"wordy\\". This book was a fast and exciting read with a suprise ending. I look forward to reading all the books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating Reading","review":"For all the hype, (NY Times Bestseller??!!!), I was absolutley floored by how bad this book was. The writing is so poor I had trouble concentrating on the plot, which was probably a good thing.How many times can each character say something \\"grimly\\"? Other repetitions with adjectives, verbs and adverbs (often in the same paragraph) drove me to distraction. Someone please buy Jance a Thesaurus.Conversations between characters were vacuous, and Joanna's thoughts in italics were just plain stupid. Did I mention the exclamation points? That's 12th grade stuff, folks. Who the heck was the editor on this book?The only mystery about this book was why I read the whole thing. Guess I wanted to see how truly bad it was, and I was not disappointed.If you want good tight writing and twisting plots, try Karin Slaughter's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating and painful read.","review":"I did not make it past page 168. Only 25% of the book related to the primary story line, the remainder was morning sickness, her dogs, other people's dogs, dog names, dog food, her Mr. Mom husband, her resentments against mother, husband (cooking) town people, mother, brother, mother, co-workers, mother, morning sickness, what foods nauseate her, what she can eat, how the smell of coffee sickens her, etc. If I wanted this kind of personal turmoil and drama I would have my mother spend a month at my house. I simply could not manage to get through this 75% put my story on Oprah and have Dr. Phil analyze me part of the book. Fortunately I keep my recycle bin close at hand. Excellent alternative for sleeping pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a sleep inducer.","review":"It took me over 2 months to slog through this muck. Character and plot development is so jerky that by the time Jance returns to a thread you no longer care. The last two chapters get better but it's not worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage","review":"I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller. Goes to show you some people have really bad taste. The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog. It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc. I would NEVER purchase another book by this author. Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can... Charlie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Audio Book Reader","review":"Exit Wounds, by J.A. Jance, is my second Joanna Brady mystery. This review is based on the audio version. The reader, Debra Monk, was a little annoying. Everything she said was pretty monotone.This story started off really well, and caught my interest immediately. Carol Mossman, a loner, is found shot to death in her mobile home. Carol's seventeen dogs, were trapped inside her mobile home, and all except a puppy are found dead from the Arizona heat.What follows after this was several subplots: Joanna's unexpected pregnancy, every minute detail about her home life and her job, and another subplot about illegal immigrants. None of these subplots were needed, in my opinion, as I felt it just made the plot drag, until we find out what really happened to Carol Mossman.This was my second Joanna Brady, Jance novel in the past month, and at least for now, I plan to pass on this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quilt Club Review","review":"As a member of a small quilting group, I purchased six copies of Jenny's Country Kitchen: Recipes for Making Homemade a Little Easier by Jennifer Wood for group members.

I have been scouring bookstores for it for over a year. I used Cartwright's book extensively while I was working on an undergraduate thesis project on Isabella d'Este's patronage. The main pitfall of the book-which is by far the most complete \\"portrait\\" of Isabella d'Este-is Cartwright's own sentimentality. She creates a true Edwardian heroine of the Renaissance, however, she provides enough epistilary evidence to allow the reader to interpret for herself what Isabella was like. I have read a few books on Isabella, and each of them use the Marchesa for their own purposes. Isabella's unique position as a patron of the arts makes her a frequent target of lavish praise and damnation. In Cartwright's book, the reader is allowed to see a more complete picture of Isabella, although much work still needs to be done on the Marchesa in order to really understand her and her milieu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy's Back and It's Great!","review":"It's been a long wait but this album is worth it.

She begins to get messages from him beyond the grave. It sounds scary, but it's more suspensful than actually scary. This movie was worth seeing, despite the sometimes poor acting, and the slow pace. Andy McDowell doesn't give the amazing performance that another viewer claimed. It's in par with her performance in the movie Green Card. You decide. Tim Roth is a minor character here and has very few speaking lines, and the French man in this film can't act. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Because the story is interesting, well developed, and I liked the subtelty of the theme of abuse and forgivness. Well done. I can't help but wish this script had been given a bigger budget and a better chance to shine.

The abusive husband was more like a tortured husband whom the wife could not help nor understand and was led to alcoholism and self destruction. The only decent performance is Tim Roth's who only seems to be in the movie for about 5-10min. There is very little suspense, or horror beyond a few weird phone calls and a wife with a guilty conscience seeing her dead husband. Worth seeing if you are a Roth fan but I wouldn't waste too much time otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentioned and well acted but oh so dull","review":"This movie is fairly typical of the \\"romantic/ghost\\" genre. A grieving widow sees \\"signs\\" that her deceased, alcoholic, husband is trying to somehow contact her. In the meantime a romantic love interest moves in next door.The movie is well acted, Andie McDowell is excellent as a confused, grieving widow trying to take care of her kids. Even Margot Kidder (superman) is good as the psychic co-worker.The film ultimately falls flat when the \\"signs\\" and the message are a disappointment. Granted the movie is more about grief and forgiveness and if that's the case, why do we need a ghost story to do it?Last but not least, shame on whomever decided that Samuel Le Bihan needed to be dubbed.Rent it but don't expect it to be as thrilling as the box cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Film","review":"Congratulations to First Look Pictures on showing Hollywood how to produce asuperb DVD with neither violence nor four letter words - just a great script, excellent actors in all cases, and great photography and direction.Don't miss this one.

However, the choices are extremely limited in comparison to what can be received on a PC. News options are very limited, for instance, and there is no option (at present) to listen to the BBC, MSNBC, CNN, World Band Radio, etc. Music choices are pretty good, and there is certainly more variety than the usual AM-FM radio. The sound is excellent and the ability to play rewriteable cdrw's is a huge plus. Would be fantastic if the unit played MP3 or WMA discs! On the dissapointing side, I've had the unit over a month and though I was supposed to receive MP3 streaming software for PC MP3s on registration, there has been nothing sent yet, and no response from support despite more than 4 attempts. I hope this is just a busy time for this usually superb company. Kudos for a great first try at an \\"internet\\" radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice stereo , near ZERO network radio","review":"It's good Stereo. I must be the ONLY person who actually bought one.

The mp3when run from computer connected by the iMjukebox really sound great and you are listening to them through the 240 watts instead of your computer speaker system.

It's a great little stereo, much better than listening to internet audio and MP3's over my cheap computer speakers. The ability to create MP3 playlists and stream them from your computer to the i1000 is a big plus for me. I'm impressed with the sound quality for a bookshelf system of this size - it won't rival my dedicated home theater system, but it also costs a lot less.

Brosnan has an elephant-like memory for conversations and the batting history of every hitter he faces. You get to see every aspect of a game, from the pitchers discussing how to pitch to a batter to who's got the best pitch to the manager's pep talks before the game. Brosnan has an excellent grasp of the language and even perplexes some of his not as scholarly teammates with some of his words. Overall, a great read from a talented pitcher and author. I look forward to reading \\"Pennant Race.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball cards come to life!","review":"What a joyous book for baseball fans. I've read it probably twenty times. Brosnan brought to life the players who were just pictures on baseball cards. The book reads as a breezy, humorous, conversational diary written from the inside of baseball. Where else would you go for a contemporary account of how one pitched to Mays or Aaron? Want to know what kind of teammate Stan The Man was? Or how cold and windy it was playing at Candlestick Park? That and much, much more is in this page-by-page gem alongside the other players, umps, the managers, wives and fans of late-50's baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Eh. I was expecting more frankly. Guess I'm used to books like Ball Four which I would give 5 stars. Not real dishy (this was '59 after all) but not real interesting either.

Although that statement isn't completely accurate since some of the songs on this album show a softer side to Davidson than his outlaw side.When I first heard this album, my immediate thought was that we now have someone to carry on the rock, outlaw, blues country. The sound is a familiar southern country sound that Travis Tritt, Hank, Jr. and Waylon Jennings perfected years ago.Davidson showcases a strong voice while adding lyrics that aren't forced. His voice is haunting as you remember some of the best of genre and wonder if they aren't coming through Davidson. It is wonderful to see the industry signing artists such as Davidson.... it proves that the industry isn't abandoning the strong southern country sound in favor for the new country-pop crossover acts that are all too frequent.

Many of the numbers are almost impossible to get out of your mind.Donny Osmond is even better than he was when I saw him live, on stage.The whole cast is equally good - even Joan Collins in what is really a bit part.

But I would never let my children watch this video. I can't believe how the women are portrayed in this production -- obviously there are none in the story, so the women can't be anything but chorus members. But that doesn't mean they have to be chorus members from a burlesque show. Jacob even gets seduced by a sexy dancer! Was this necessary? Especially in a show marketed to families! The production was overdone, and I don't care if the man IS Richard Attenborough, he can't sing. How about hiring singers for a musical? What a radical idea!

I saw this movie and was deeply disappointed. The singing was alright but everything else about the movie was horrible. The directing was bad and the characters seemed to be making fun of the story instead of portraying it as a true event that actually happened. After seeing it I feel that the rating should be at least PG-13 because of the many sugestive scenes and revealing costumes. If you are thinking of buying the movie I suggest you rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","review":"I was disappointed in the DVD version of Joseph. The background looks like a cartoon. The Broadway production was awesome, but the DVD is nothing like it. The music is the same, but moves slower on the new release. Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Play Gone Bad","review":"This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations, but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality. He seems to be the only actor in the movie who uses breath support while singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below expectations","review":"Don't get me wrong, I've thoroughly enjoyed the music from Joseph for years and the several college-level productions I've attended. I had such high hopes for the video and couldn't wait for its release. I was sure it would be a video to watch over and over as I do other videos of Lloyd Weber's music. Sad to say, one viewing was plenty for me. The music was as good as ever but the sets and the staging were terrible, and the costumes far too risque for a play aimed at a younger audience. I was unsettled by, and uncomfortable watching, sets designed to look like children made them with costume design obviously aimed at a very adult and mature audience. All in all, I thought it was a very amateurish production from a company who I know is capable of doing better work than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","review":"I liked how they had so many different types of music that they sang. And I liked how they had all of the kids singing too. Another thing that I liked was that the teachers were the acters."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Musicals","review":"We purchased this because my oldest daughter was wanting to try out for a local production of this musical and wanted to familiarize herself with the music. We really like the music in it and Donny Osmond was great as Joseph. There were times that it seemed to drag a little, but once it picked up it was engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a family bible story","review":"Great music, great story, mostly wonderful presentation, but there is a surprising amount of slutty wardrobes. Shirtless Donny isn't an issue to me an my family. It is the highly provocative costumes of many females (Potiphar’s wife and dancers around Pharaoh quickly come to mind) makes this inappropriate for families. Surprisingly provocative for a bible story retelling. Inappropriately so."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC AND AMATEURISH PRODUCTION","review":"JOSEPH etc was a great and memorable show on stage (if rather short). This production is appalling and amateurish and the staging is on the cheap side. Many cast members are seen looking directly at the camera when they should not be doing so.It looks terrible.Who directed this rubbish.The Jason Donavan London stage show was far superior.Get a copy of that is you can.It's brilliant.Wait for a better version.This one is woeful and forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","review":"We have seen this movie many times but did not have it in DVD format. We no longer have a VCR. I loaned the movie to our retirement center where we live and the people here really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Funny!","review":"Knowing the music well but never having the opportunity to see Joseph on Broadway, I was thrilled to buy this video. The only things I would change are the narrator and the outfits worn by Pharaoh's women! Yikes! Otherwise I found it entertaining, hilarious and well put together -cheesy props and all! This is typical Andrew Lloyd Webber and I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully stays to the stage version","review":"We saw Donny Osmond in Joseph in 1996 and loved it, and when we heard the show was coming out on video we got apprehensive that they would try do more with the story and change our overall feelings of the show. We couldn't have been any more wrong, they did an excellent job of bring a Broadway show to video without screwing it up. The opening was an added dimension, Donny Osmaond was excellent and the narrator was also great.I recommend this video to anyone who loves theatre and a good musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting way of telling the story","review":"Well done musical which displayed Donnie Osmond's vocal talents well. He truly is a gifted performer"},{"rating":"2","title":"dreams come true","review":"this was a great movie. Donny did a great job. It was interesting to see how they created a biblical character to music and added some comedy as well.Yet it was very tastefully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I remember watching a production of this musical in my country over ten years ago. So I bought both the CD and this version with Donnie Osmond. I find it amazing how Webber and Rice were able to make such a great musical from a few passages in the Bible. And they must have been so young when they did it! There is an innocence and catchiness to the entire musical. And like the Bible, it is very timeless. I can identify with the character when he goes through all his trials.I would listen to the CD over and over and watch the video as well. I never get tired of it. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound is good, not perfect","review":"I bought this the other day for my daughter's 9th birthday. I was a bit worried about the sound after reading some of the other comments here. Well, I am no audiophile, but there is definitely something not quite right about the sound. But at worst, it sounds to me at times as though the visual and audio are a tiny bit off-sync, so that you lose the impression that you're actually watching them sing. Not often, but it's noticeable. And I agree with other comments about a number of the costumes being too suggestive.Having said that, my daughter loves this DVD, and we also got the original Broadway cast CD, so we are all Joseph, all the time (for now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children Love It!","review":"I can't keep my five children from watching this DVD. Pharoah's Elvis impersonation is a big hit. It is all quite colorful and entertaining. I had to forcefully turn it off last night and tell them, \\"Enough already!\\". Some of the scenes (Potiphar's Wife) are suggestive, but no more than the Biblical account. I would highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","review":"Wonderful show. All my friends have borrowed it and love it also. The only problem I have with this DVD (and most others, to be honest) is that the volume of the TV needs to be turned WAY up in order to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"Well done and entertaining, we watch it over and over and always enjoy it. I especially enjoy it because it's a TRUE story of forgiveness"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE this movie wish it wasn't all whispered though","review":"I LOVE this movie! BUT! The sound really does suck. It's all whispers and no matter how loud you turn it up you only get whispers. UNLESS you have surround sound as I have just learned.

The whole production is fun, very playful and colorful, the music easy to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman (the Narrator) were outstanding! My whole family loved watching the video. I was, however, a bit disappointed in Joan Collin's attire since it is billed a \\"Family Musical\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! A Must See!","review":"Well, I must admit I am not a fan of Stage shows recorded on video e.g CATS. But Cats was done beautifully and so is JOSEPH. The color and look of it is outstanding. The newly developed sets and scenery are a real feast for the eyes. It's much more dazzling than the stage revival. Andrew Lloyd Webber should be proud with the final product. But I hope with the rest of his stage shows stay like that, a stage show and not made into a movie, unless it is done well. In my last few words all I can say is that this video is great and nobody performs the role of Joseph like Donny Osmond can, I give five out of five stars. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect region code","review":"Bad News ! The DVD what I purchased from you, I cannot see, you send a copy with an \\" Incorrect Region Code \\" which in South Africa I cannot play back.

Regards Attila Sauzet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short but boring.","review":"AS an admirer of the great JC Superstar and Cats, I expected much. But, this was really disappointing. What's the point? What's the narrator for? Songs are weak (no memorable song). Nothing special in story. No enjoyable dance. Strange mood of adult (costumes! and even the narrator herself). And school boys and girls...for what? I really enjoyed JCS and Cats movie but I cannot recommend this(Joseph) at all. Boring and nothing enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was given this movie as a gift. not only is it inaccurate, but they imply a lot of sexual interest in Mrs.Potifer when Joseph had none! he was trying to get away. they don't do much with the choreography and they have they narrator interacting with the characters. if your life story was being told as you lived it you wouldn't see the narrator. yes, I realize that it's a movie (& originally theator) but really! some accuracy would be nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for children","review":"We bought this DVD for our kids -- but I'm glad we watched it before showing it to them. The movie is a \\"irreverent\\" version of the bible story, and the sexual innuendo, not to mention the revealing and suggestive costumes, makes it unsuitable for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Silliest Musical Ever Made","review":"Even for the musical genre, even for the Christian theme genre, this movie is silly beyond words, without being funny.It is \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" as envisaged by Zero Mostel in the Producers with every trite dance move ever invented.Joseph's brothers as would be Elvis/Billy Ray Cyrus impersonators takes the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly inaccruate version of the story, not worth it...","review":"This movie is not worth the cash it takes to get it, a terribleshowing of the original story -- it almost makes fun of it.

If your looking for something that gets the bang for for buck, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let your kids watch this!","review":"Where do I begin?..... I was VERY disappointed in this film. I thought that it would be something my kids and I could enjoy together. The women are dressing very badly, they look as if they don't have any clothes on at all. Let's not leave talk about the sceen with Donny and Joan."},{"rating":"1","title":"not family entertainment","review":"I am a conservative. Our WHOLE family had seen a local production of the show and enjoyed it. I thought with such an all star cast we would enjoy it even more. Wrong. I object to the costumes, the women are wearing pasties. I have rewound the video three times to make sure this is what I saw. And sadly it is. The local production did not have such costumes. My children are ages 6 and 10. If I wanted them to see this kind of production we could go to Las Vegas. Donny Osmond you should be ashamed of yourself, I am also LDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!! Ü","review":"I have the video but not the DVD I would buy the DVD but it is in WIDESCREEN and I HATE WIDESCREEN! I agree with a lot of you I love the music but some of the costumes was a little much. I wanted the soundtrack (the CD) to be like the movie (I mean the motion picture) instead of the Original Canadian Cast Recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is defective","review":"When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"viewer in atlanta","review":"Wow! What a fantastic production - it was a hit with my children and us parents. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joseph DVD","review":"This particular DVD had some sound troubles. At times the volume would go down and it was hard to hear. Then it would go up and be too loud.I have another copy of this musical and it had no problems so I think I just got a faulty DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"MariaFriedman/Donny Osmond; superb casting!","review":"This edition of Joseph achieves exactly what it sets out to do. It was designed as a musical with broad appeal, with something for everyone. Lloyd Webber and Rice succeeded at several different styles of music in this musical (country, pop, disco, 60's rock, calypso). I challenge you to name another musical with the same attributes.However, for me, the real sell in this video comes in the performances of Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman. In relating a story, Friedman is a most convincing narrator because of her remarkable facial expressions. She makes the story seem new and fresh with each viewing. Granted, she may not be the most gifted vocalist in the musical market, but I would rather be moved by the authenticity of the storytelling. Donny Osmond is perfectly cast as the youthful, naive and honest Joseph.This video is taking a beating from some, and getting raves from others. I belong to the latter group and would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Performance","review":"I was waiting with great anticipation for this video and it was worth the wait. Donny Osmond was excellent! He is truly talented. The narrator lacked a little on her singing ability, in my opinion. I saw the Dallas production with the second generation of Osmonds and they were wonderful. I think that Jodie Benson would have been the better choice for the narrator. My children, teenagers I might add, really enjoyed this video. They wouldn't really admit it, but they watch it when I'm not around. I would love to get the opportunity to see this in a live production with Donny Osmond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good effort!","review":"As someone who was in a production of Joseph as a kid, I really enjoyed this. It was an interesting premise to switch it from something the kids did, to having the teachers act out the parts. And if I take things right, a musical for children was the original intention for this work.I've never seen Joseph by a professional company, so I can't really comment on this. But I felt overall, the cast worked well together, and that, while others feel like it didn't match up to live stage performances, perhaps a direct comparison is not totally fair. Judged on its merits, its an enjoyable show, with an intriguing mix of musical styles and good set design. I particularly had fun with the Pharoah character, and Richard Attenborough leant a great dignity (with a hit of comedy) to his role too. The narrator adds a lot to the character of the work. Overall, I'm pretty impressed, though I agree, the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"more scenery than i cared for","review":"I bought this based on a recommendation from church. Donny and Maria sing superbly, but my objections deal with the costumes. The skin-tight provocative dancers was totally unnecessary for a supposedly family-friendly version. And Joan Collin's outfit as Potiphar's wife was overboard as well. My boys turned there heads when watching it with me. I can not recommend this to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound weakens a great show","review":"After seeing the stage production, I had great hopes for this DVD and was eagerly looking forward to Dolby Digital 5.1. It turns out that the 5.1 encoding is so poor that the only way to listen to it is analog Dolby Pro Logic. In chapter four for example, the brothers and narrator are center stage but only the narrator's voice comes out through the center channel - the brothers are \\"lost\\" in the left and right channels. This is not the case with analog decoding. Also, 5.1 levels are a good 10-15 db below where they should be and 10 db below the analog. This is the poorest 5.1 mix I have ever seen.This was so bad that I sent the first DVD back and Amazon graciously exchanged it for another. The second was just as bad.If you have a Dolby Digital, don't bother, unless you want to use the analog channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for the costuming","review":"I was delighted to see this appear in video several years back. I am a music teacher and I have wanted to use this in class. Generally it serves its' purpose, but I was extremely disappointed in the racy costuming. It is totally inappropriate for elementary age children. I was surprised since I assumed it was aimed at children and families. You will want to pre-view this and make your own decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of all Time!!","review":"The value of this DVD is great. The brothers are a Motley Crew and the interaction of the Narrator is also original. I do feel that some of the musicality and singing is compromised by the dubbing of some of the voices. Also the soundtrack is more exciting than what we hear when watching the movie. However, the stage settings are great and I really enjoyed the special feature of the history of Joseph. You should not pay more than $15 for this DVD.. Making it a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Joseph\\" is a musical that is heavy on production...and","review":"..a little light on plot...but that does not mean it is not enjoyable. It is very enjoyable and colorful and just a LOT of fun. Donny Osmond is amazing and most of the staging is very much like the touring companies that I saw a year or two ago. The difference is that there is a documentary side that tells about how \\"Joseph\\" came about...and how it is very frequently produced in schools (in this case, schools in Britain). Most of us are aware, after all, that \\"Joseph\\" is really about forty minutes worth of material..padded out handsomely with production and glitz. It is also nicely paced and very energetic. And, if you need further enticement... Joan Collins is here in several guises..but mostly being her naughty self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","review":"Very entertaining. Wasn't as good the stage presentaion I recently saw, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"The producers of this film have done a wonderful job of taking a Broadway play, and converting it to the cinema! My only complaint is that it is not listed on the list of DTS DVD's at Amazon! The DTS encoding was pure genius! I hope that this DVD lasts long enough for my children to watch it. I can't wait to watch it again! Go Go GO Joseph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GIVE DONNY OSMOND A BREAK!","review":"This video was fabulous! But my main reason for writing this review is to tell people who are having concerns about the video because of Donny Osmond, GET A LIFE! Donny is no longer a 15 year old teen idol. Some people who still see him that way need to get out of the 70's. He has grown up into a fine performer. Give him a break. Everyone in the video was fantastic and it is definitely a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph entertains wonderfully!","review":"I ordered this video to use as a wrap-up for a unit I was doing on musicals with my 3rd and 4th graders. They really enjoyed watching it and absolutely loved the music. For many, this was their first exposure to a musical. There were some parts where the women were very \\"scantily clad\\", and that, of course, got a big reaction out of them - I reassured them that the actresses were wearing costumes to make them \\"look like they're not wearing anything.\\" Even being a pro actor myself, I have little criticism for this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love It.","review":"As a person who will probablly never see a real stage show, I love this movie. Donny Osmond is perfect for this roll. \\"Close every door\\" is my favorite song. I have the movie and the cd. I believe it is a wonderful movie for children. An introduction to a bible story that makes it fun to learn. Alot of the reviews are being based on the real stage play, but if you've never seen the real play..... It's like reading the book and then seeing the movie. For us who have never seen the play on Broadway, it is a real treat and I'm glad to of had the opportunity to see it on video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Fun!","review":"What a hoot! I was enchanted! When I brought the dvd home, my husband raised an eyebrow and said \\"you're going to make me watch THAT?\\" before turning back to his computer... 15 minutes into the movie, I caught him tapping his feet and whistling along under his breath.Some of the sexual innuendo had me a little thoughtful, at first, about showing this to my godchildren -- but it's nothing as bad as they see on TV every day, and certainly not enough to make me decide not to show it to them.Great staging, good choreography, good wardrobe (that had me taking notes, in places, for tribal belly dance costumes). The cast obviously enjoyed themselves tremendously which made the show that much better. This one's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment - Not for small children","review":"I was excited to finally find this title on DVD. I'd seen the show live in Chicago years ago and loved it. We've had the soundtrack on CD (fabulous) for years and it's one of my daughter's favorites. Unfortunately, the video version of this production is significantly different than the live show and, in my opinion, the music is not nearly as good (as the show or the CD soundtrack). Even more disturbing is the addition of several scenes that make this video inappropriate for small children. I can't understand why these sexual innuendos were added, they certainly don't add anything to the story and as far as adult entertainment is concerned they're pretty lame. With just a little effort this could have been a great family video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music- Great Production","review":"We first rented just to see it, when we returned it we went out and bought the movie, we just couldn't do without it. We first saw it five days ago and already we know most of the songs. I really love the Narrator she is one of the best characters in the movie. Also, I thought Elvis is really funny, but I think my favorite part of the movie is the 70s' song. Donny Osmand as 'Joseph' was a really good idea, he is so good looking you just like the movie as soon as he appears singing \\"I closed my eyes\\". I just LOVE that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good production, poor sound","review":"This is a fun staging of a fun show. Certainly not deep, thought-provoking theater, but a fun little show nonetheless. However, I must echo the sentiments of those reviewers who said the sound on this DVD leaves much to be desired. The sound level on the vocals is extremely inconsistent, with some soloists being nearly inaudible. In fact, the sound on this disc is so poor I must grudgingly encourage buyers to opt instead for the VHS version, which doesn't have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"One of the few musicals that I regret spending the money on because of the absymal recording quality. The narrator was fairly easy to understand, but some sound track key singers were almost inaudible.The tunes would have been most enjoyable if the technical quality was acceptable.As one who enjoys musicals and muscial shows, I was very disappointed in the recording quality and video quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is FANTASTIC!","review":"I work in a video store and enjoy the privilage of seing new releases before the general public, thanks to \\"screeners\\" (tapes/DVD's supplied for promotional use by film companies). I had heard of this video through the grapevine, and couldn't wait to check it out when my store got the screener. It is absolutely fantastic. Donny is excellant, but the person that really blew me away was London Broadway star Maria Friedman as the narrator. She is exetremely talented! Together, with the aid of a superb supporting cast and wonderful children's choirs (really adorable kids), Donny and Maria make this video production of Joseph a \\"must-have.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality!","review":"I had the VHS tape of this video and loved it, so I just recently purchased the DVD. Not thinking there was any reason to do so, I WISH I had read the customer reviews, as many of them commented on how terrible the sound quality of this DVD is. And I'm here to back them up. I have tried watching this on both my surround sound system and the television alone, and in both cases, it's horrible. Background singers and music are barely audible, but the narrator's part will blast out your ears if you turn up the volume to hear the music. What makes this even more disappointing is that Amazon will not refund your money in full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was ecstatic to find the DVD of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat available at Amazon. However, when our granddaughter was ready to watch it--and its her favorite musical--the DVD was not formatted to play in our area of the world. Since I had purchased it from an \\"in country\\" dealer, I didn't think there would be any problem. So now I will hesitate to buy ANY DVD from Amazon. (Actually, I didn't even know that DVDs could be improperly formatted, so I hope this helps others that are unaware of that technicality!)As for the musical itself, we LOVE the music and I especially like the bonus trailers about the history of how Joseph was written and how it has evolved. So it is a HUGE disappointment to not be able to view this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible production - Don't waste your money","review":"I put 1 Star sonce Amazon doesn't have 0 Stars.Our high school production was at least 10 times better.

I have seen this performed twice by groups other than Donny and co. and enjoyed it so much more. Give it up Donny!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Having seen the play, and loving the colorful, musical presentation of Joseph's story, I was disappointed to see the movie cheapening the theatre experience. The \\"narrator\\" is a modern woman who doesn't blend into the story at all, but is present in almost everything. The audience of children are included in the movie which also detracts from the play itself. The performers are talented and accomplished, but the above distractions ruined the experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that!","review":"I was excited about this movie coming out... I had read all the updates on the reallyuseful web site which is the official page and when it came on tv I was really happy... notice the word WAS really happy. The movie started out ok, interesting school asembly concept, then it went WHOOP down hill! The narrator didn't do justice to her role and the children cheering were unbeleiveably annoying. It seemed more like a music video than anything else. I was also dissappointed by the brothers who were a bit too gay to my liking. I was expecting somewhat straighter brothers, no offense to anyone who is gay but it was not what I had in mind. The movie did have some good parts though like Donny's \\"Close Every Door To Me\\" but then a very unentertaining Pharoah brought it down again w/ his terrible impression backed up with not what I would call the 'best' choreography.

Donny Osmond is very experienced in the role, and still had a very youthful look to him when this was filmed, even though he was about 40 at the time!The music is not jarring, and easy enough to appreciate.

With music by Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice (Aladdin and The Lion King), the songs are so catchy you will be singing them for days afterward. The entire movie is one long operetta-style musical (aka. No stopping for just talking.) The songs range from ballad to rock-n-roll to Calypso. Wonderful costumes, phenominal acting and great sets make for a fantastic visual extravaganza. No CGI here. This is all live. Osmond conjours up a superb portrayal of Joseph, Jacob's most beloved son, all the way from his youth through to adulthood. With a star-studded cast this movie is one to keep for the next generation and the next. Dream on, Joseph; dream on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible!","review":"This DVD is adored by everyone in our house. My 8 and 4 year-old girls sit through the whole thing, totally entranced and my 2 year-old son gets through 20+ minutes (a minor miracle). For myself, the songs are very catchy and each is a different genre. I enjoyed seeing the celebrities like Sir Richard Attenborough and Joan Rivers but the 11 brothers really steal the show. Donny Osmond has an incredible voice and really shines in this adaptation of the biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors. Its a great addition to any DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in Substance and Sadness","review":"This is a fine book, full of beautifully rendered characters. I love the painful and powerful picture Gaskell paints of life among the English working classes-- the struggles for physical and spiritual survival against horrific odds is rendered with compassion and depth. Her writing is emotionally rich and I found myself truly moved by the all the characters. The friendship between Mary and Margaret, the gentle, but rock solid faith of Alice, the passion of Jem, etc. This book is certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed and read only half of it","review":"I ordered the book after watching \\"north and south\\" tv adaptationto another of elisabeth gaskell's book. i was curious to know more from this writer.but this one was nothing similar:the plot is slow, including irrelevant and too detailed side stories.the main characters are not clear and are very distant to the reader,in a way it's hard to care for them. so it was easy leaving the book in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhuberant","review":"A good quality novel, with somewhat a cheavanistic attitude on life.

Much of the book concentrates on life in a manufacturing town, however, the love story has a prominent place. The characters in this book are lovable and fallable, as usual in Gaskell's work, and overall very realistic. This novel is set up much like \\"North and South\\" yet not as well put together, and with quite different characters. There is the struggle between masters and men and a love affair unrequitted on the female end with family and friends dropping like flies on account of mental or physical anxiety. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes Gaskell, Dickens, and the time period of early industrialization in England.As to the edition, Everyman's Library always makes a nice hard copy. It includes a biography and timeline of work as well as the author's preface and an introduction by Jenny Uglow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy..","review":"This product gets used allot in my home and its easier to sit and not hurt our backs like the traditional toilet seats do.

However, reading the book to her was difficult. It's very long and wordy and a little hard to follow. She likes the pictures and if I simplfy it as I read it, she loves it.

The best part, for me, is that it's a science and art lesson combined!If your child enjoys the Little Einsteins series, this is a great book for kids aged 5 and up.

Great color, great quality in paper for a paperbook.**Here's a helpful tip----leave your child the inexpensive, dollarstore hardcover or boardbooks on the floor for your child to read on his/her own, but put these more expensive and better quality books up high on a shelf for supervised \\"special moments\\" when you read together. This way the book is always taken care of for repeated reading which everyone enjoys. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled","review":"My problem with this book is that it is wrongly titled by the reprint publisher (it was originally published in 1925) something that the current editor must have gone along with. The correct title is The New Negro: An Interpretation. This is important for two reasons. All sorts of sloppy readers are citing the book as The New Negro: Voices of the Harlem Renaissance (1925) when no such book exists. Second, the writer of the introduction criticizes the book for not covering a variety of aspects of the Harlem Renaissance when that was not the book's intent. It was \\"an interpretation!\\" It allows for other interpretations. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best interpretations because it covers more areas of literary and social interpretation of 1925 than any other.

There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution.

Note the length of the chase scene, Leatherface chainsawing through his 'own' back door. The photography is stunning for a guy straight out of college and the whole production gels incredibly well. This is a horror film only in that these guys could very well be your next door neighbour right now. I prefer to see it as a modern prescient American fable......Hans Christian Anderson would be proud of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ingenious work","review":"I have watched TCM and loved every second of it. Though it is not a gorey and disgusting as TCM II, the feeling makes it much scarier. All the special effects and the whole setting made TCM II seem like a Comedy. TCM is another story. It is about 5 friends who go to visit a relatives grave, and end up at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The mystery in the video is so scary...they all dissapear one at a time...Leatherface popping up and the least likely times. This movie willkeep you on the edge of your seat, trust me. At the end you will be dying to see what happens to the girl when they capture her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Man Creepy","review":"Talk all you want about the blair witch project. If you are looking for a really scary movie this is it. Although shot in 1974 which seems like a million years ago the film is still very disturbing. This was my first viewing in nearly 15 years and it was a hell of a lot better than I remembered. No CGI no special effects no cheap thrills This movie is an all out assault on your senses and well worth it. The Dvd has some great extras definatly worth buying. For fans only"},{"rating":"2","title":"O.M.G.","review":"I thought Halloween had the scariest plot ever!!!Not anymore...okay, Imagine that you're on a trip and stop by a small farmhouse for gas...and the family who lives there are psychotic cannibals with crazy rituals, meat stores, and chainsaws! One scary movie! A genuine horror classic, right over in the front with Halloween and all those!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chainsaw classic","review":"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will be reinterpreted by critics, fans and theorists for decades to come. This movie is Tobe Hooper's brilliant debut, a brutal, uncompromised horror about a perverse Texas cannibal clan (inspired by the story of Ed Gein) and the teenagers that wander into their home (decorated in furniture constructed from human bones) and their meathooks. It's unrelenting and unforgettable and its raw gore remains its strongest element.The cinematography is exceptional. Watching the Special Edition, you'd never know that this was shot on 16mm in poor light.The new edition has been newly remastered in high definition and features newly remixed soundtracks in addition to the restored original mono soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the '70s--no kidding.","review":"I can't tell you what an original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, nothing else like it in the world and completely successful in its dogged pursuit of capturing something intensely disturbing (and yet completely satisfying and jubilant--go figure). The deeply weird all-male family is quintessential Americana dementia--the goony birthmarked hitchhiker, bulky Leatherface in his black tie, the frustrated father (\\"Look what your brother did to the door!\\"), and of course, the blood-hungry nearly dead Grandpa. Will you think I'm mentally balanced if I say that they evoke pity and sympathy as well as horror? They do! There is something undeniably bittersweet about them. The thwarted Leatherface swinging his chainsaw impotently through the air at sunrise on the highway at the end of the movie is one of the classic images of cinema. You must brave this movie. Any reluctance on your part will be redeemed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a oldie but a goodie","review":"The first and very scary look at a dementet psycho family but for the younger generation it is slow and borring until the ending but still a cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scariest film ever? No way","review":"TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is in a word, awful. There is virtually NO plot whatsoever. The whole film centers on about 5 teenagers who, due to their immense stupidity, fall victim to the demented Texas Chainsaw Man. It's a lousy movie, with lousier acting. Some call this the scariest film ever made? Ha! You could sleep through this nonsense! Do yourself - the valued customer - a favor and give TCM a skip ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID MOVIE! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!","review":"This movie should be banned! Only some sick and perversed idiot would watch \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\". This is such a horrible novie. Should be rated X! Not R! I litarlly had to rush for the bathroom to hurl everytime I saw a leg chainsaw off or blood spilling everywhere, not to mention the horrific screams of the victims. How can you stand it? And what's with the shaky camera. Must of been run on a 16mm camera(like the Blair Witch Project). The TCM is all sick and wrong. It should be banned forever. Anyone who likes this movie has to be some messed-up sick guy who likes to watch people getting chomped up."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this supose to be one of the greats?","review":"This film failed to deliver any plot whatsoever. I mean I get that the crazy family wants to butcher people, but why? Did the grandfather go mad after losing his job. Are they inbred? Is it a cult thing? All it is, is the fat kid running around with a chain saw. They didn't even show proper dismemberment. And that girls screaming! You couldn't hear a word they were saying over that constant yammer. It isn't a terrible idea for a movie. Family out in the boondocks are depraved and feed off the living. It really had potential. Instead half the movie is them ridding in the van, and the other half is the fat kid running around with a chainsaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Shipping and Awful Customer Service","review":"I requested for two day shipping and was then informed that I would not receive this product until after the new year, being almost two and a half weeks later. ( December 20th - January 5th - 7th ) After checking back with the website in January I was then informed that I would not receive the product until possibly January 19th. That's a full month without having this dvd after purchasing it. This is inconsistent and childish, I would expect service such as this from a twelve year old who's trying to make his first sale on a cheap product that doesn't work. I will never buy from here again, especially around the holidays because doing so is apparently a waste of time and money.

It may have started the slasher genre, but it's no \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Halloween\\". Those are the only two slasher films that are actually classics. \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" is just stupid ... None of the teenagers in this film are ones that you care about. By the last half of the film, I wanted Sally [Marilyn Burns] to be sawed because all she did was scream for a whole hour. The cannibals were more sickening and laugh-inducing than scary. For a better serial-killer film, go for \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Psycho\\" of course. Those films are subtle and truly, deeply scary. \\"TCM\\" is over-the-top, grainy, crude, and masochistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORROR CULT CLASSIC? WHY?","review":"I always hear people say what a great movie this was...a classic...so controversial...so horrifying....THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. Too bad Amazon didnt have 0 stars as an option. After hearing all the hype, I finally decided to rent this movie, expecting to be frightend to death. Sure the movie had a few OK parts, but I found the movie to be slow and boring. It was like...Kids in a van...Kids find abandoned house....Kids die...THE END. As for the ending...what was so good about it? Guy swinging a chainsaw around and screaming like an idiot? (sorry if I ruined it for anyone). Thank god the store I rented it from had a \\"not satisfied? get another movie for free\\" policy! If you want to see a GREAT horror movie, buy DEAD ALIVE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The second most overrated horror film next to \\"The Shining\\".","review":"\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" is yet another overrated horror movie. The reason for that is that you don't care about the teenagers who are in it. Especially Sally and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin. They are so annoying and stupid. As is this movie.

Well, all I can really say is that the only reason people hype this is because they like sick things. Now, trust me, I am not weak hearted, I enjoy horror movies such as the Halloween series but this movie is just blood, gore, and guts. No plot whatsoever...just murder and screaming. I enjoy scary movies but the difference is that unlike great horror flicks, this is just horribly brutal with bad acting. If you are easily scared or even have the slighest idea of what a good film is, don't see this. I for one was not scared, just disturbed, I do not get scared over movies unless watching them alone at night and this was not the case. I was eager after it was over to log onto here so that I can stop atleast one person who was interested in watching this moronic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!","review":"This is by far the worst texas chainsaw massacre movie ever.

Why don't people complain about movies like these? when there are blood-curdling chainsaw murders, and when A godly movie comes out thats more graphic than usual, why do people everywhere complain about how horrible it is, when there are plenty of other horrible disgusting movies? it really annoys Me.Oh, and by the way, don't get this 0 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"gore classic","review":"Yup, this 1974 independent horror flick set the basis for most horror films to follow: A group of teens is victimized and butchered by a monster/psycopath/etc... the only person who survives is a girl.The heroine of the tale.This movie is remains very creepy and gross after 30 years of its production. The dvd has very good image and cool special features.the guy they picked up in the van is surely scary enough to make not want to go drive in rural Texas. leatherface likes to wear girl's faces, how weird and twisted is that? and good ole grandpa in his wheel chair... what the hell is he? some kind of living dead person? this movie is so realistic it gives me the creeps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only movie that ever scared me.","review":"I saw this movie abought 3 years ago when I was 12 years old.It scared me.It was the first movie to ever do so.And whenever I watch it again my heart starts pumping.i break out into a sweat.The whole atmosphere of the movie makes you scared.So,now that TCM is 25 years old,I say,Happy birthday to the first and only movie that ever scared me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not scary at all","review":"some people are saying this is the best horror movie of all time.im just like \\"what? \\"this movie was not scary,it was funny! for the whole last half hour all it was,was this bigbreasted girl going \\"ahhhhh! god,no! help me! ahhhhhhhh! \\"and the guy with the chainsaw going \\"argharhgarhgarhgarhgarhg! \\"and yelling like a retard.it cracked me up.then at the end it was just about these crazy people beating up that girl for no reason.and that chainsaw was lasting forever.it would have run out of power after going that long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"New Transfer\\" \\"Special Edition\\" Is Neither!!","review":"Buyer beware. This release of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the same identical Pioneer Special Edition that was released several years ago, just with a new packaging on it.

This is one of the most dishonest pieces of marketing I have ever seen.Make no mistake, the film is a fine and important movie, well worth owning and watching over and over.But if you already own it: beware of buying a duplicate copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done - But can you honestly ENJOY something like this?","review":"This movie has a long history of controversey and a wide range of opinions. It is VERY original and VERY scary, but something just never seems right. You walk away from it glad that you were able to walk away from it. It is such an experience to have to endure that you feel emotionally (as well as physically) exhausted. It is really too much to have to handle while trying to enjoy yourself at a movie. It is a must see for horror fans and film buffs alike, but I don't recommend it at all. It is cruel, vile, messy and disturbing; all too effectively. Nothing is light in the approach of this movie. If you are not easily repulsed, see it. If you have a serious problem with heinous violence, steer clear. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for bloody, horror flicks. I just found it tried to hard to shock, and that took away enjoyability."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste!","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it was sick.

Do not see this deciving and crappy nonsense.P.S. I forgot to mention that the sequels and remake were even crappier than this train wreck. One last thing, if you want to see Tobe Hooper at his best, see Salem's Lot (the original 1979 version) and Poltergiest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"This movie was a waste of time. I saw the newest version (2003)about a week ago and loved it. I read so many reviews about the original version and that made me want to rent it. Most people agreed that the original was so much better. I was severely disappointed after watching it. You could definitely tell that it was a low-budget film. It wasn't scary at all. Leatherface killed 4 out of the 5 people within minutes. The only suspenseful part was when he chased the remaining character. The sequels look better than the original. I am going to rent those and see if they are any better.Bottom line:Don't waste your time with the original. The 2003 version is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chainsaw POP Phenomena!","review":"I truly think this movie is way overated. The gore was weak the movie was just plain dramatic.

I was excited that I was going to see it,thinking I was going to be scared out of my wits. I stayed up from midnight till two in the morning to watch this and I was so agrivated.

I watched it and was sickened by how awful and boring it was. It is mind blowing how little blood there is. One scene, the lead is completely clean and the next she's soaked in what looks like ketchup. And all she does is scream and run in place. Suddenly, she runns into a tree branch. There are absolutely not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this was.Oh, and just thought I'd let everyone know that in it we see Letherface sporting a pair of BLACK HIGH HEELS AND A WOMAN'S FACE!!! What IS this CRAP!!?? If you wanted a good TCM movie, go see the remake because it is out of this world scary, gory, and Oscar-worthy acting.What a waste of my time and money.

If you are a BIG horror fan (i.e. you hate Scream and the crappy Hollywood \\"Horror\\" flicks that come out now) you will have a blast watching it. This film gains respect from me because it truly terrified me (and I've seen PLENTY of horror films). This was the only film I can remember that got my heart beating, and I almost dreaded to see some of the heinous acts played out in the movie. And TCM scares you without resulting in a bloodbath; in fact, it's nowhere nearly as gory as its famed to be. TCM leaves a lot to your imagination; believe me, that is VERY effective. Overall, I can't recommend this terrifying masterpiece enough. It ranks up there with the classic and influential horror films (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Suspiria, Halloween,etc...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chainsaw Massacre Again and Again","review":"CHAINSAW is by far my favorite of these horror franchises... Each new chapter is grand... (Even when they're terrible!!). I just love these characters and this little world solely created to scare the heck out of us. I found another good movie with a very similar feel (very much an hommage to the chainsaw films) calledRoadside Massacre. It too has a great feel and wonderful sense of its own little wrold. Freaked me out honestly. If you love Chainsaw Massacre films and are looking for an undiscovered little gem in the horror genre, then check out ROADSIDE MASSACRE. It's worth the purchase and you'll feel as if you're seeing an all new Chainsaw film too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible Horror Classic","review":"This is a classic, no questions asked. It's a classic because it stands the test of time in many ways. First, it is a very engaging and entertaining film. It'll never let your eyelids get heavy or let you fall asleep in boredom. Second, it is still one of the most disturbing and scary movies ever made. Since 1974 it has frightened its audiences because of its disturbing nature. It is definately one of the most unsettling movies I've ever seen and one of the scariest. This is a movie that needs to be seen to be believed. I can't just write to you to \\"see the movie, it's scary\\", you actually have to go and see it right now. Tobe Hooper and co. have created one of the greatest horror films to date, and this DVD does it justice.

Note: Avoid the sequels, remakes, and prequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure unadulterated horror","review":"This is the purest horror movie I have ever seen, and easily the scariest. No comic relief, no supernatural b.s., no social justice (\\"These monsters are created by greedy corporations!\\") b.s., no absurd plot twists, no gaffes by the actors or the director, and no hope. Nothing to take you out of the movie or distract you from the straight line descent into hell that Hooper has paved for us. \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" depicts a world in which evil is inexplicable and irresistable, a world in which we are powerless to understand, much less avoid or fight, that evil. It is a world that is utterly, and horribly, believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Masterpiece","review":"I have seen this movie at least 20 times before but when I watched this version it was the first time!!! This just put the dvd over the top. The second disc was amazing. It went into the charactors and props and interviews which really put a new light on the subject.Being from Austin and finding out that many of the actors still live here and are in business.Gunner Hansen the best Leatherface ever spent a few days at a retardation center where he studied and watch the people to act like them. What ever happened to Franklin's knife??????Anyway this is the best version I have ever seen,and I have them all.

I have seen this one though, and it's errie filming, in that 16mm hand-held camera type style, alaBlair Witch Project really added to the effectiveness of the film. This film was also made to allow your imagination to actually frighten you more than they actually showed. This film is ultra creepy, no doubt, and I wouldn't suggest watching it alone late at night. However, in all honesty, it's short on the gore, much like the Shining. In fact, by today's gore standards, it would probably only rate a PG-13. If you like imagining horror more than seeing it, get this film, if not, perhaps you may like the newer version better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING","review":"This is so boring I dont even want to review it , HA HA, P>S - new one coming out 2006 of october"},{"rating":"1","title":"sick","review":"this movie is sick and discusting . nothing butkilling. dosent have a good storyline at all. and thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even remotely close to resembling anything great","review":"How can you call this movie one of the greatest ever???

First time director Tobe Hooper has an undisputed talent for creating mind numbing tension that explodes into extreme violence. \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" is a harrowingly effective horror film. Due to the low budget, it has a raw, gritty documentary feel to it. It's as if your watching actual footage tooken during a night of torture and mutilation.

After viewing it I was so disappionted with it I felt like taking it back! There was nothing remotly scary about it, it is just a film that lasts for ages and is absoultly boring. There is no gore in it, nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat and basically, it is just pathetic horror movie!

Little by little they are hunted by Leatherface, a cannibal weilding a chainsaw.MY THOUGHTS: A very sick and twisted movie, TCM is quite scary. It acts like a documentary and that adds depth to it. The movie looks really good in widescreen, and the DVD picture quality makes it more detailed and greusome. I once went to a haunted corn-maze where Leatherface and Michael Myers chased me.

It is not suspenseful at all, and it is remotely entertaining. Other than that it is pretty boring and overall plotless. The ending was dumb, the opening was slow, and how somebody could walk out of the theatre in a \\"state of shock\\" after seeing this poorly done film.However, there were a few points that I found entertaining. Such as the pursuit scene through the woods, and at least Leatherface rakes in the bodies here. Hammers, chainsaw, hooks, etc. All that stuff is here but it wasn't the gothic, dark, dirty, creepy bloodfest that the new one was.The new one was far more entertaining and suspenseful, not to mention Leatherface was much scarier looking. I mean, in the this one (original) you do not know that his mask is made of skin, but at least you figure out that they're cannibals.All in all, I give the original TCM about a 2.5. It was good enough to keep, but I kinda wish I had gotten those three other Freddy movies instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most over rated movie ever","review":"I thought that being a film , which hasn't been released on video / DVD format for so long .

This movie did not SCARE us, it just SICKENED us. THE WORST MOVIE WE'VE EVER SEEN. This movie literally makes you want to vomit. We read online reviews that said don't watch it, but we thought we could handle it. We didn't listen to the warnings. Well this is true advice, rent a comedy.

Dumb girl just screams throughout the movie.4. Dumb fat wheel chair bound guy dies so unconvincingly, even worse when I look at it now.5. Dumbest camera angles in movie history.6. This is just plain dumb.Why do people call this a classic, I would agree this could be considered as a classic example on how not to make a movie, this is no great movie.

I really like the Scorcese combinations with DeNiro but this one just doesn't cut it. This Scorcese film seemed like a practice session of directing until he got into his more later works. In this movie DeNiro plays a wild young man who is trying to still find acceptance and trust in his older and much wiser collegue and caretaker(Keital), but this movie should not be in any mob movie collector unless you just want it cuz everyone else says so. This movie doesn't really hold up in today's movies. I mean i really appreciate other movies made during this era...like Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver,Chinatown, etc......Those movies should all be in any collector's collection.

(I thought the ending was a real letdown, in contrast to those who thought it was so terrific). After reading positive reviews I was really looking forward to a great tale, but didnt see much of a plot. It seems to me that if it wasnt for the big names in this film, it would be a forgotten one. If you like DeNiro, and dont mind older films, Deer Hunter is a much better film and much more thought provoking. That film has a point (perhaps Mean Streets had one but if it did it was too boring for me to notice), and is worth multiple viewings. I probably wouldnt waste my time watching Mean Streets again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Streets","review":"After (re-seeing) Taxi Driver recently, I was eager to see Mean Streets on satellite.After 25 minutes, I couldn't stand it anymore, and deleted it.This movie is drivel, about a group of worthless losers who somehow think that their pathetic lives are important to anyone but themselves.Yes, there are some stylistic similarities to Taxi Driver (along with some of the same actors, of course), but the result is dramatically different.I am guessing that a good bit of the dialogue in this movie was improvised, but in order for that to be a success, it would need to have some reasonable framework to hang on.This movie is tedious, a total waste of time.It may be that \\"students of film\\" find this movie worthy of study, but it's a clunker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, bad DVD","review":"Scorsese's Mean Streets is a great movie and probably the best acting effort by young Robert deNiro. This is a excellently told tale of friendshipt and mob in the streets of New York, and in my opinion a lot better than Goodfellas.The DVD has its flaws and honestly, this movie deserves a DVD rerelease on a anamorphically enhanced DVD with better sound and many extras.But until that happens, grab some bucks and get this, because for Scorsese fans, this is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my ten 10 desert island films.","review":"While leaving a liquor store in a blizzard, I ran into a friend. We ducked into a dirty little movie theater to avoid the gale and Mean Streets was playing. We wound up staying for the day and a big patch of the night. Four bottles of wine and half a bottle of whiskey later we left laughing and enlightened. This is a seminal film for three careers. Its' the groundwork of many Scorsese films to follow, its' DeNiro's finest performance and it gives you the directors soul through the art of Harvey Keitel.If you're not from a city, this movie is a hoot. If you grew up in one, you will know these people.Dennis Caporiccio"},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make movies like this anymore","review":"This movie is basically the opposite of the polished epics Scorsese is making today. I actually like this better than his latter gangster epic Casino, but not as much as I like Goodfellas. Some truly amazing sequences with unforgettable characters are set to the wonderful pop/rock soundtrack. Check it out; Scorsese and DeNiro don't make films like this anymore and may never again (though The Departed was a nice return to form for Scorsese).Ivan Rorick"},{"rating":"1","title":"PHONEY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MOVIE","review":"Nerd Score Sleazy would like everybody to think he actually grew up tough in NYC----though this allegedly autobiographical junk was written by somebody else AND rips off scenes from lots of other movies.Keitel with his hand over the fire was ripped off from \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" for one thing.And, Deniro is annoying----a lot of Deniro performances in 70s movies are annoying, which is why he only really became known to a mass audience with his later comedies.Deniro getting shot at the end is the best part---cause Deniro and his character are so annoying he deserved getting shot in the movie.This movie was a big influence on Hong Kong action movies, and Hong Kong action movies aren't exactly known for their realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I ordered Mean Streets based on a review I seen on a special on gangster and mafia movies.

I can only hope that when I'm 60, I'll look as good as her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tina saves herself","review":"As a diehard fan and her harshest critic, I'm happy to report that this album is the best she's released in years. While the production could've been toned down a bit, it's nowhere near the bombast of her recent recordings. I absolutely hate the first single - Why do Cher when you're Tina Turner? - and if it bombs it will ruin the chances of any of the other far superior tracks to become hits. My favorites are \\"Go Ahead\\" simply because it's totally new ground for her, and the title track because it's old-fashioned rock and roll as only Tina knows how. Perfect for driving with the top down and could be a summer smash if she's smart.Of course, most of Tina's recent unfortunate choices in music have been dictated by her manager Roger 'trapped in the '80s' Davies, so I'm not too optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stronger and Better Than Ever","review":"\\"The Grandmother of Rock\\" scores again with the amalgamation of rock, pop, R & B, and dance. Every song bears the unique Turner stamp of gut-wrenching vocals backed by super arrangements from the band. High marks go out for the dance-friendly \\"When the Heartache is Over,\\" the seductive \\"Falling,\\" the rocking \\"Without You,\\" the emotional \\"I Will Be There,\\" and the title cut. Not as good as her last release \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" but still a worthy effort from one of the giants of contemporary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Star In Sad Decline","review":"It's always hard to bow out gracefully when your time is up, and I just wish somebody would have took Tina to one side and told her how bad this album is.

This is her first album of the 90's that is sure to go multiplatnum in the U.S. Her last few albums have been less than spectacular, but Twenty four seven is jam packed with hits! The album cover all genres; Dance, Pop, R&B, and rock. The songs are not only new and fresh but they are trend setting and pull you into the melodies at first glacne. They sound destined to become hits. I'm 22 years old and there are really no other 60 year old artists that have this type of mordern and hip music out there that a younger generation can appreciate. This album is definatly her best ever! it's assertive, the vocals are beautiful. I cant wait to go to a club and jam off of of \\"Absolutly Nothings Changed\\"! Thanks Tina for this musical jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Four Seven...A Bomb","review":"I have always been a big Tina fan and have always looked forward to new material from her. However, I was extremely dissappointed with her latest outing \\"Twenty Four Seven\\". Listening to this CD filled with European Pop songs, it left me yearning for Tina to return to her R&B roots, which made her famous. Unfortunatley, Tina has not actively sung R&B since 1984's outstanding \\"Private Dancer\\". Every album since has seen Tina move farther and farther away from her R&B roots. With this latest CD, there is not a trace of Soul to be found.I think only die-hard Tina fans will like this CD. This will go down as one of Tina's less popular CDs, especially in the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"first of all Tina Turner is a musical Genius,Legend etc,etc...she has done it all and continues to perform at top level.alot of the younger acts should watch a true Pro in action.however she chooses for the most part safe&lightweight music to put out.this album is no exception.i really liked when the heartache is over&the great remake of thelma houston's don't leave me this way.but overall it's pretty much formula that shes been doing already.if i could recommend something for Tina it would be Robert Crays last disc.the Memphis soul.if this is truly her last hurrah she should go out with her true soul roots.she can do most of this album in her sleep.the Lady is bad but this doesn't reflect that."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's love got to do with it?","review":"Partnered with sadistic old Ike in the \`70s, she was R&B's most physically provocative interpreter of howling, cat-scratched hedonism. But Teen's mellowed gracefully over the last two decades, so much so that someone must of forgotten to wake her up for this latest entreaty of adult contemporary zzzzzzz. Strictly speaking, 247 is a embarrassing formula album full of the same old hurtin' songs Turner's being turning out since Private Dancer; muted and predictable shrill globbed up with overripened hip hop/soul and wedding dance beats. While she's still effective when she's engrossed in full throttle balladeering, gone is the Tina who was once able to sing any sentiment and make it sound like it was torn from the flapping patchwork of her soul. Today, she's more like Aunt Jemina, drowning her R&B inclinations in a syrup of stiffened emotions and predictable studio belabourment. What's love got to do with it? Not a damn thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Usual...Just Great!","review":"I'm not really under 13. I just didn't want to sign in. Anyway, this is a great album. Tina's most recent album of original material since 1996's Wildest Dreams, another gem. This is a wonderful album. She seems to be going the Cher route here. \\"Whatever You Need,\\" \\"When the Heartache is Over,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me This Way,\\" and the title track are among my favorites on this album. Also recommend Tina Live in Europe and Simply the Best (2 other Tina albums). Enjoy!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Tina","review":"To speak from one of her songs..\\"She's simply the best, better than all the rest\\"... I love this album...We should all strive to be so real, gutsy and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postmodern masterpiece 2 years before Scream","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by the intelligence of this film. Horror movies have a tendency to rely on cliches and the same old scare tactics, but this is one case where I wasn't really sure which way the movie was going. By placing the Freddy Kruger mythology within our reality (and not that of the film itself), Craven achieves a sardonic, cynical level of intertextuality. People point to Scream (also by Craven) as the father of the new horror genre, the realistic, self-aware and ultimately very postmodern type of film, but New Nightmare does it all --and in many ways better-- some 2 years earlier. It opened to critical raves but didn't do so well at the box office, no doubt being ahead of its time.If you are one of those people who goes to see cliched horror films and are expecting nudity and other staples of the genre, you'll be disappointed (see reviewers below), but if you'd like a new take on an old classic, this is a great opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best since the first","review":"A wonderfully done film with great performances by Heather Langenkamp and Miko Hughes. Miko Hughes performance sent chills down my spine. I can not believe this the same young actor who had an reoccuring role on Full House, one of the worst TV series ever. He is up there with Haley Joel Osment and Elijah Wood for great young actors. Heather Langenkamp pulls of the role to a \\"T\\". Her nightmares and the confusion they are causing between the lines of reality and dreams is something she has obviously done before, but she is more believeable now. The most chilling scene is when Miko Hughes, who plays Dylan, attacks his Mother, Heather Langenkamp, with his own version of Freddy's glove. In my opinion if a kid can pull off doing such a role, they cause more chills than adults, because in these kind of films you expect it to be an adult. Truly, a well crafted film, one of Craven's best. GRADE: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"The all time worst","review":"I will never understand what people see in this film, however it has a huge following? Wes Craven, and any director really, should stay out of his own films because HE CANNOT ACT! As for the stupid premise and barely existant script for this film, I wonder what Wes Craven was thinking? Everyone is OVER the \\"ironic\\" horror movie plot which is so present in the 90's. Wes Craven is the champion of this and how many times can we see it done so badly? It's very hard to beleive he made the first one. Very hard. Two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay money to watch this film","review":"I borrowed it from the library so watching it didn't cost me any money. The video cover is scarier than the movie.This film dragged...poor plot...and worse acting. Thank God, for the pause button because it would have been difficult to sit though this whole movie without a break. I did enjoy the mother decking the smirk off the nurse's face after the mother protested them giving her son a sedative. It's too bad it wasn't one of those nasty nurses who died instead of the nice babysitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real joke to the ANOES series","review":"This was a movie turned into a movie that has to be a real joke to the series. This was a movie where the original stars of the first movie have trouble with Freddy and then Freddy comes to the real world and then kills people. The weird part of this movie was how director Wes Craven made the movie like a documentary of Freddy's life instead of a sequel. The special effects weren't too good nor bad either but you could see why the special effects were mediocre because of the low budget. Freddy would star in his next movie Freddy Vs Jason that was a lot better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is generous","review":"this is the worst bloated piece of garbage crappy disgusting boring \\"film\\" i have seen in a long time. it is not interesting, it is not scary, there is no redeeming quality. it is stupid, pointless, and not fun.

Picked up this steaming pile of shart in the $5.50 bin. I watched it years ago, and didnt remeber any of it so I watched it again. That was the worst mistake of my life.This is a bastard son of a decent series. Its kinda like Seed Of Chucky in the way that the prevois seriers were movies. The actors of all the old movies realize Freddy is real becuase he lives in the script, or something lousy like that. Not to mention there are only like 3 murders and Freddy looks totally lame, especailly with that retared Robot Glove.If you like the Nightmare movies, and never seen this movie, DO NOT WATCH IT AT ALL COSTS!

I thought this movie would be better since Wes Craven was directing/writing it.In my opinion it's everything but scary.The concept of this evil entitity trapped in stories for eons is interesting, however not very well explored in my opinion.The scenes remind us of the first Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit cool when it comes to nostalgia but they completely have no surprise effect whatever.It was nice to see some people of the original movie, like John Saxon and Nick Corrie. Yet they have such small roles which undermines their presence in the movie.Corrie doesn't even have a line.The \\"scary\\" scenes are actually hilarious at some points. This movie could have been better in my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction and reality blurred","review":"The movie was not the best effort by Robert Englund or Wes Craven. They did a good job at blurring fiction and reality, but all in all a disappointment. As I watched this movie I thought to myself, why is Wes Craven so famous for? Sure he's made two classic movies- Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but thats about all. I love Wishmaster, but im sure people dont even remember it. Last House on the Left was bad or at least I thought so. The last three or four movies he's done has been flops. So why is Wes Craven so popular? He really hasnt done much. Come on, I know there is a reviewer out there dying to answer this."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Nightmare","review":"I guess this movie is alright. I didn't like it that much cause freddy dosen't really come until the end of the movie. But I thought the first nightmare on elm street was better. The dvd was pretty cool though. It has Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the film, it also has a really cool commentary by Wes Craven, It also has a Jump to a nightmare Scene Navigation, It has a original theatrical Trailer, and IT also has original animated menus.So this dvd is a good one for a horror fan like meI SPENTED EXACTLY 2 MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS WATCHING THE REALLY ONLY ONE FEATURE ON THIS DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This is very original, with the original Wes Craven spice. This enters when Heather is working on the seventh Freddy Kruegar movie with Robert Englund (who plays himself and Freddy Kruegar) and Wes Craven, when Freddy is trying to reach into the real world by Heather's son. She then tries to stop Freddy once and for all, before he kills again. Very good, very scary.

It's long, because it's 112 minutes, it's confusing, because it barely makes any sense, it's annoying, because you predict every scene, and Heather's son dylan screams for no reason all the time, and you hardly ever see Freddy. There are only 4 kills in this one, the first three all happen in the first half hour of the movie, making the movie slow. The kills are for the most part terrible, the only good one was where Chase was gashed in the chest by Freddy's claw which came out of the car seat. So overall, this ranks #6 in the Nightmare series for me. Those of you who dont like this movie and feel lonely for it, don't, i barely watch this one. So don't buy this movie, unless you just want to complete your freddy collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't freddy ever die?","review":"O.K., now this is just getting rediculous, in this one all the actors in the nightmare on elm st series play themselves, and freddy becomes real.

The things that made this movie so great are Heather Langenkamp appearing in this series for the third time. Her role in NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST 1 and 3 were vital roles for the complete series, and in this one she shines more than EVER as an adult rather than a teenager who has to once again deal with Fred Krueger. She gives so much emotion as a mother who is very protective of her son and who is guarding him from Freddy tormenting him. This movie gived Freddy new life by bringing elements of the dream world crossing in to real life. I like the fact that WES CRAVEN who directed the original Nightmare on Elm St brought Freddy back to being scary rather than a smart off comedian as he had become in the previous films in this series. I say Check this movie out. GREAT FLICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Wes Craven shows his true genius with this film-\\"New Nightmare\\" is a stunning and horrific reinventation of Freddy. No more a man of dreams he is making his was up from hell to reality, and causing a lot of havok on the way! One of the most memorable scenes in the film is the funeral scene-watch it and find out why. Wes also related some of the material to his original(and best) nightmare. The scene in which Julie is dragged across the ceiling a la Tina and also by using some of the same actors.

Instead of creating a fictional show, he bases this one in the real world--Freddy comes after the actors and filmmakers involved in the films. It's highly original and really well done. And after listening to the commentary track, you realize just how well made this movie is (Wes Craven does a good commentary). The acting isn't anything spectacular, but it isn't bad. And Miko Hughes (the little boy) plays these chilling kids very well. He does a great job. And Freddy seems a bit more sleek, and darker than the previous films (except for 1 and maybe 2). I like the series, and this is one of the better (and original) installments.

I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS AND NIGHTMARE 1 AND 3 TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE SOME GOOD HORROR MOVIES. THIS 6TH SEQUEL IS NOT THE END. FREDDY WILL BE BACK THIS YEAR IN ''FREDDY VS. JASON''."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad script","review":"Wes Craven decided to make a Nightmare on Elm Street movie by mixing reality with fantasy. This was a good idea but the movie itself just wasn't good. The fist half of New Nightmare is slow and drawn out while the second half barely picks up and leaves a mediocre ending. If you are curious to see this film then go ahead and rent it. Still, I think the chances of New Nightmare being dissapointing are very high."},{"rating":"2","title":"hesssssssssss back","review":"the scary sequel wes cravens new nightmare is a scary sequel with a darker clawer with different make up and nancys back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again it never ends.","review":"They've come up with titles again and again with the final nightmare or the final chapter or the final friday. It never ends. Our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren will be watching the 45th nightmare on elm street along with halloween and friday the 13th it will never end. They tried to mask how many they made by taking away the numbers and just putting in a name. Nice try it didn't work. I love horror movies and Freddy's my hero but making the other 6 just movies and making this 1 real life is dumb. Next it'll be Wes Craven's 2nd New Nightmare. Getting Nancy a son was a good idea considering the plot was gettin old but Freddy Kruger a TV character. Come On. If something's fine why change it. The nightmare on elm street's are great so why tamper with it. Still though next time they make one the movie better not be a movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie doesn't follow the other movies","review":"I watched this movie on cable last night; and it was horrible. It was the worst Nightmare on Elm Stret Movies ever. It doesn't follow the story line at all from the past movies. It took forever, for anything scary to happen. Also, the movie wasn't as gory or bloody like previous movies. Not worth buying at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hello Heather, miss me?\\"","review":"Wes Craven's New Nightmare, is played out in real life with the actors who played the characters in the Nightmare in Elm Street series. It starts with Heather (Nancy in \\"N.I.E.S\\" series), her husband and 6 year old son reciving threatning phone calls that contain the Freddy Gruger rymes. Heather's son Stats to have Freddy nightmare's but of course no one will believe him until Heather has the same nightmare's . It appears that Freddy has jumped off the screen and into real life and the only way to stop him is to fall asleep.This movie lacked classic horror and reaked of petty scares and not any real gore but did had it's moments. Though Freddy did look a lot more scarier with updated facial apperance and a long black jacket he was to comedic. The grafics were not great as it was just played out in real life except for the battle with Freddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new expierience!","review":"Wow!

So much for 'Freddy's Dead'","review":"What could have been an interesting insight into the effects of films and the Freddy myth in general is no more than an excuse to drag out a now tired character yet again. There are good moments, but also a lot of padding, and you can't help but feel all the way through this film that Freddy should have been laid to rest a long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"And don't miss the companion book","review":"This video series is stunning, but don't miss the companion book by John Reader. He also wrote great book on Africa which came out before the National Geographic series, so you might give it a try: http://www.amazon.com/Africa-Biography-Continent-John-Reader/dp/067973869X.The only minor quibble I have is that they used the same Lisa Gerrard song in back-to-back episodes. Since I was glued to the sofa I did see those episodes in one sitting, and therefore that song (which is one of my all-time music faves) did seem to be over-used. More Lisa Gerrard and Dead Can Dance music, plus a track from Run Lola Run, are used to good effect.If you love the Planet Earth series, watch Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Africa DVD Series","review":"I am using this series in my middle school geography class. We are studying the culture by looking at the biomes and how people live and work among the land. This has been a good visual for the student. In the desert biome we learned about the Tuareg people group and followed a young boy on his first caravan trip across the desert. It held the students interest and opened their eyes to another culture and hopefully a heart for Africa and its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up (...and the Big Toes Too...)","review":"I just treated myself to this DVD collection and didn't quite know what to expect. I must confess that it's well worth every penny I spent on it and I highly recommend the collection. The visuals and the sound are great, the stories are well-chosen and varied, and the narration is beautiful.Usually documentaries about Africa (and Africans) are all too predictable, too stylized, too hackneyed. Not this one. Whether it's the story of the dreams of the Ethiopian shoeshine boy, or that about the budding love of the Sahelian Tuareg girl and his herder boyfriend, there's a universality in the themes the various stories cover which most viewers will relate to.A word of caution though: some of the stories are tear-jerkers, and so have some Kleenex handy or else your macho cover will be blown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Africa made accessible","review":"Irresistible vignettes depict real Africans carrying out their life journeys presented in an intimate and compelling fashion.

I didn't care for them.It could have also been a little longer. I would have liked to have seen \\"Irish Whiskey\\", \\"Suicide Kings\\", and \\"We'll Always Have Paris\\" on there. =)To me, it just doesn't qualify as a Greatest Hits album for this. It's good, but not for a Greatest Hits album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band guys swing!","review":"I first heard the Cherry Poppin' Daddies (CPD) several years ago in a small club as the middle act between the opener Rancid and the headliner \\"X\\".

Thanks for such great music, Daddies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Or, if you want good swing...","review":"Then check out Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. I picked this up because of Zoot Suit Riot. The vocals are weak and somewhat whiny and the lyrics are lame. The only thing saving this disaster disc from the lowest rating is the music. This band can play! Unfortunately, I just can't get past the vocals and lyrics to listen to it and enjoy the instruments. If you want a cheap copy of this, check the shoulder off of I-405, that's where I've tossed mine. Seriously, for the complete package, do yourself a favor and check out BBVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here!","review":"This album is very repetitive, that sums it all up.

I liked Setzer's CD a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, crass imitation of the real thing","review":"Next to the REAL genuises of Swing music (Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bennie Goodman, Louis Prima, and even Glenn Miller), these guys look like the foul-mouthed wannabes from the other side of the tracks.I really like the Swing revival (and yes, the word is correctly capitalized). Some of the bands are fantastic, and I especially like Brian Setzer's great Orchestra. But Cherry Poppin' Daddies are a black mark on Swing music. Lest some of you younger folks think that Swing music originated in this decade, please do yourselves a favor and check out the big band stuff of the '30s and '40s. If you think big band music of yesteryear equals Lawrence Welk, think again. In terms of compositional style, musicianship, and just plain fun hot tunes, you can't beat the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find the CD Zoot Suit Riot Great","review":"I find swing the greatest type of music ever originated.

My son digs him."},{"rating":"1","title":"the music may be swing....","review":"I was majorly disappointed with the lyrics. Call me fickle if you will but, the sexual overtones in the lyrics were just too blatant. Swing to me has always been a refuge away from this. If I want to hear music about sex and such, I listen to rock, it's expected there. However, the music is first rate with tight rythms and wonderful horns. Peace........"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess record sales were low!!?!?!","review":"Well, like always when records aren't selling good, we have to recycle old crap again to a whole new generation of listeners. The music is ok for what it's trying to do. However, i could of sworn i heard the exact same beats on my grandpa's old records. The lyrics are stupid, pointless, and most of it is talking about sex, to get the listeners attention. All in all, this is BORING. Not inovative AT ALL. Furthermore, all the songs sound the same. It's like listening to an hour of the same weak beat, with a guy mumbling over lines. I'll never shop at the GAP again becuase I know that they are the biggest reason for this \\"craze\\". Without that commercial this band (And all other swing bands) would probably be playing shock rock dressed in drag, or whatever else sells albums these day.P.S.

However, these guys are a little more hardcore than anybody else... lyrics are a little fun to listen to, as the name of the band can imply. The tempos are a little more variant, ranging from a nice slow gander to a fast lindy. But the music is still excellent! As mostly original songs, this album can give quite a bit of spice to a night of swingin. The band does have a few other albums, I believe, but as hardcore as these people are, I think this cd (a compilation of their best music) is just the right amount of their kind of swing music. It is a little more modern than all the other swing bands... but that's also what's fun! Check it out. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"I've got to give props to the Cherry Poppin' Daddies for starting the swing revival. But for anyone out there who is just starting into the swing scene this is deffinitely not IT! Yes, there is a lot more to swing than just \\"Zoot Suit Riot\\" and \\"Jump, Jive, An' Wail\\" I suggest trying Blues Jumpers and Colin James. Listen to some of this stuff and you will realize that Zoot Suit Riot is nothing but a song for banwagon swingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherry Poppin' Daddies are the GREATEST!","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it but I bought this CD because of Zoot Suit Riot. From the first time I listened to the whole CD, I was in love. I was freaked out by the language at first, then I realized \\"It doesn't matter as long as it's good music.\\" And it is GREAT music. I love it. And \\"Zoot Suit Riot\\" isn't even the best song. I like \\"Ding Dong Daddy\\" the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first law of swing","review":"I think that it is absurd that the Cherry Poppin Daddies feel the need to swear though out their album. Swing lyrics are supposed to be fun, light hearted, and make fun of the times both today and of yester-year. I wrote them off my swing list until they can clean up their act - it is a shame because they have a real tight horn section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear torture, and a waste of money","review":"The instrumentals and musicianship itself are great, but the lyrics make this hard to listen to.

I bought this as a \\"buy it together\\" with another CD, listened to four songs, and turned it off. I won't listen to it again. The themes of the songs are sex-charged and the language vulgar. I guess I should have known by the title, \\"Cherry Poppin' Daddies,\\" but I was thinking more along the lines \\"poppin' = jivin'\\" rather than it having a sexual connotation. Shows how out of the loop I am, I guess. Some people would probably love this CD, but as a Christian, I'm offended by the themes and the language. There was a low-class knock on God, too, and that was the end of the CD for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy 90's swing good beat","review":"this is good . as a leader in the return to swing band sound the zoot suiter's are a excellent group .

These songs are certainly a mood lifter! They may me laugh, dance and feel good ! Great background music for a party for all age groups.Don't miss out on this sound in your musical collection.

Unfortunately, the CPD was nothing like I had hoped for. First of all, 'Zoot Suit Riot' is a great song, but the rest of the album sounds nothing like it. As you go through the album, you can hear how the lead singer changed his voice for ZSR to get that jazzy sound. His real voice, heard in most of the other tracks, is squeaky, and quite annoying, to me. You might be interested to find out that the CPD were originally a ska-type band, but with the lead singer's voice, not a great one. Those who've listened to older swing will be very disappointed with this album, it's like a tourist's version of the music. It sounds like a bunch of guys just trying to sound like a swing band, but they just don't have it. Get the ZSR single instead, and most of all, don't waste your money buying their former albums--it's not neo swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal on CPD and their latest c.d.!","review":"If you like to \\"shake your lovemaker\\" and hear a sexy smooth voice provided by Steve Perry then \\"Zoot Suit Riot:The Swingin' Hits of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies\\" is a must for your c.d. collection! The Daddies take you from fast and upbeat songs like \\"Zoot Suit Riot\\" and \\"Brown Derby Jump\\" to a more sly mysterious sound like in \\"Here Comes the Snake\\" and \\"Pink Elephant\\".The instrumentals in this c.d. are awesome you can end up listening to a song 50 times in a row and still not get enough! I love the catchy lyrics which can sometimes be so blunt it's hilarious! The thing I love most about this c.d. is the passion these guys seem to have for their music! It really shows, you'll almost be able to see the energy these guys have bursting out of your stereo! Bottom line it's awesome, you'll love it no matter what kind of music you listen to!

But CPD has another reason to be criticized: they are foul musicians without a sense of rhythmn or unity to their playing, yet teenagers seemed to be convinced they are listening to \\"real\\" swing. Kids, go out and buy any one of the following: Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Charlie Barnet, Duke Ellington, Louis Prima, Bennie Moten, Gene Krupa, etc. and toss your CPD CDs out the damn window (believe me, you'll never listen to them again)!

This does not. The songs are so repetitive it makes me want to vomit. I thought these guys were a ska band anyways. Why all of the sudden are they swing? If you want some real swing goodness, try the old school big band stuff from the 40's, or buy an album from The Mighty Blue Kings, Indigo Swing, or the Squirrel Nut Zippers. When listening to this CD you can just hear the trendy vocals and lyrics, creating a sound that not only is a disgrace to the uprise of swing, but it has no soul at all, and stirs no emotion in the listener.

They are basically a strong cover band re-doing things that were done 50 years ago only not as good. Likely a great band to see live and dance too but too repetetive and un-original for CD. If you really want to Swing, with lyrics pick up some Louis Jordan from the late 50's. He was a great song writer, lyricist (catchy, entertaining, pure), and alto saxaphonist.

They mix it up with their own style of music, which makes it sound completely new, instead of just another wannabe nostalgic song. I can't stop poppin' this cd into the player. It's amazing. This is one cd that you'll never want to skip a song on. And let me tell you, CPD are even better in concert. I mean, they are spectacular live! Go see them as soon as possible! You'll be hooked too. -Keep Swingin' -Jen"},{"rating":"1","title":"good musical quality ruined by foul lyrics","review":"This album was good for music quality but the lyrics were at times foul. There has been a lack of new musical ideas, everyone is trying to make it on shock value and pushing the envelope of social acceptability. People are tired of being screamed at and assulted by \\"music\\" and that has helped the resurgance of music such as swing. The Cherry Popin Daddies have taken the revival and put some tasteless lyrics to add the 90's garbage influence. I played this CD one time and took it to the local store and sold it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars is genorous if you ask me.","review":"This CD i bought because of Zoot Suit Riot.

If you are looking for a good CD this ain't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddies Best You Can Get","review":"These guys are positively the best band for your money. Their music is wild and entergetic while Steve Perry's lyrics give you something to chew on while you dance your brains out. It's wonderful fun and genius music. Just listen and try not to be affected in some way. The Daddies rock and swing and it would do you good to appreciate their music as what it is- the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw these guys in concert and they rock!!!!","review":"the CD is great and I saw them in concert it was awsome definetly buy the CD they have a great beat and everyone can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete trash.","review":"Stupid, lewd lyrics coupled with songs that use on average 8 or 9 instruments and still manage not to be rich. \\"Zoot Suit Riot\\" is ok, but the album just went downhill from there. \\"Here comes the snake\\", for example, is one of the most disgusting things I have ever heard.I do not scorn all modern rock. I am 14, and like modern rock as much as the next teenager. I'm not one of those classical-music-loving kids who thinks that everything made after 1900 isn't worth listening to. But this CD isn't.Don't buy it unless you feel like throwing up. And if you want good ska, try Big Bad Voodoo Daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to ska - wait, they already are","review":"I've been swinging for about a year now and I've heard Zoot Suit Riot so many times I figured that I should buy the album thinking that the rest of it is really good too. BIG MISTAKE. This is your typical one song album. You see, the CPD used to be a ska band until the swing revival and then they jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. The whole album is just a compilation from their two past albums, really making this album a ska album. The lyrics are horrible, the songs aren't even swing songs, and the album will give you a headache. If you are into ska, by all means, buy this album. However, by swing standards this album is as bad as you can get. If you aren't into ska, do yourself a favor by not buying this album and by getting a real swing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.... then there's this.","review":"If you're the type that thinks swing dance belongs on the same radio station that plays the top ten Billboard, and/or If you like jazz but don't know who Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Count Basie are, get this!If it's so good, why are so many people selling it used???No offense to the band, but there are many, many better albums (and bands) out there that are *so* much better. Granted, some of these songs are catchy, this would be my last pick for this type of music. Closer? Big Bad voodoo daddy and Setzer. Even more? Indigo Swing and Rhythm rockets. Ray Gelato. Lavay Smith. Steve Lucky & Rhumba Bums. Want to really get closer to jazz and / or swing? check those out first. Closer? Look into the real evolution of swing dance. But please don't look here and start on the wrong foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no","review":"These guys are a ska band, not a swing band. It shows. You listen to their horn arrangements, and they sound like bad rips offs of the 30s style. Listen to how they try to swing - it sounds mechanical, forced. How on earth can one listen to this and enjoy it? How can one dance to this? It just doesn't work.Maybe their ska is okay, but their swing is sickening"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Explicit lyrics and subject matter\\"","review":"The name of the band shoulda warned me, but it really didn't sink in until I started to listen and read the lyrics. I really don't understand why they have to use such foul language and subject matter. It completely takes away from the enjoyment of the music, which isn't bad. And Steve Perry's voice certainly isn't anything to write home about. In fact this album would have been perfect if it was an instrumental. And it is a shame, because the music is pretty good. The only thing that stopped me from giving it one star, was for the fact that Kenny G doesn't play on it. That alone bumps it up to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a CD!!!!","review":"I usually listen to Pop and Rock, but when I heard Zoot Suit Riot I knew that Swing was going to be big song.

So get this CD and you'll see what I mean =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"[Howl!]","review":"A friend of mine played this in the car... the next day I was humming one of the tunes, the day after that I bought it. I played it probably 3 times daily for the first two weeks, and here it is a couple months later and I'm not even close to being tired of it yet. If you just read the lyrics, there are some really depressing and downright nasty themes here (sandwiched between humorous stuff)... but the music is just so fantastic and so full of energy, it just picks you up and carries you along at about mach 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good!","review":"Lot's of fun!

I say \\"that I've heard\\" because I gave up on this album halfway through it - it was getting that bad! There may be other good songs towards the end, but I'm too shaken by what I heard in the middle of the CD to try to find them...

Hoku has a pleasant voice, the video is well done, and she is lovely to look at. And since she is Don Ho's daughter, I wonder if there will be a teen version of \\"Tiny Bubbles\\" on her album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we need ANOTHER \\"dumb blonde\\"?","review":"When I first saw the video to this song, I honestly thought it was a parody of all the blonde teenybopper girl singers. When I realized it was a real video..I just laughed. The song itself has nothing special about it to distinguish it from any other teen fluff that has come along, in fact it only shows that record companies are trying to milk the blonde girl fad for as long as they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last night I went to a party hoping Hoku would be there","review":"This is a great song. The words and sounds are excellent. She is becoming one of the new stars like Britney Spears and Mandy Moore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dumb Blonde","review":"She sings that he never loved her and she never loved him, so what is her complaint? Both were leading the other on. She dances like a stiff giraffe, and the camera keeps changing angles to hide the fact. Like the others said, she doesn't have the vocal range like the other teeny boppers out there. A single with one song only? c'mon, give us a taste of what else you have to offer, because if you don't you'll end up like so many other one hit wonders out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOKO AINT A DUMB BLONDE","review":"HOKO SINGLE\\"ANOTHER DUMB BLONDE\\" IS GREAT.

AND SHE WILL BE ON MTV'S SNOWED IN NEXT WEEKEND."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Another Dumb Blonde","review":"I thought that Hoku as an artist was about average compared to the other teen acts that we have today (Britney, Christina, Jessica, etc.) but I really liked this song. It was catchy and upbeat and set the record straight for guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another dumb blonde stikes back","review":"This song is pretty cool. It gives guys a message that they shouldn't take advantage of a girl's love. However, in her MTV video, the strap falling off her shoulder wasn't nessesary, it basically contradicted everything her song stated. For that, I think she threw herself back into the dumb blonde category, but the song's cool. Hopefully she'll find a way out of the rut of being a dumb blonde. Sweetie, skin is not the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, she really knows how to identify herself!","review":"Hoku is just another dumb blonde. She has a horrible voice, and have you noticed that the lyrics to that song are kinda like Whitney Houston's \\"It's not right but it's okay\\"? My advice? Go find yourself ANOTHER blonde, but make sure it's NOT Hoku!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dumb song","review":"I don't understand what people see in this song. It doesn't even sound like she's TRYING to sing on here. All she's doing in talking (in a bored tone of voice) in the same melody of the music. I'd even listen to Truth Hurts over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst kind of pop music.","review":"This is the kind of song that really hurts legit pop acts. The song is more or less catchy and well written, but the \\"artist\\" is terrible. Hoku can not sing any better than most people I know.He voice is very weak in the first place- she has a limited range that is very evident during the high parts, and when you add to that the fact that her voice just SOUNDS unappealing, well, the song is a recipe for disaster.But I am sure it will get lots of play, which is unfortunate since people like Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey at least have vocal talent, and probably the same songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wouldnt even give this one star","review":"HO-kuwho names their album another dumb blond? why would you call yourself a dumb blond, especially on the front of your CD.

But there is something different here. Each of the Teen Pop Queens has something to their name. Britney has the controversy. Mandy has the voice. Christina is the diva-in-training. Hoku is the sweetheart. Mixing a little electronica, pop and her sweet voice, she comes out with piece of pure pop. But this cup of sugar also has a positive girl-power message to put up with no one, and to let no one use you. Hoku has recently released a full-length CD. If the material on it is as strong as this, we can look forward to great things from this singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT ANOTHER ONE HIT WONDER","review":"comon people, u call this music? For one, she cant sing, for two, watchiing her try to dance is just as funny watching her sing. \\"Another dumb blonde\\" is the most pointless song ive ever heard.

When I saw the Another Dumb Blonde video on TV I thought the song was OK. Well I figured it only costs about 3 or 4 bucks so why not buy the single. Big Mistake! I would have to say that this CD is one of the worst I own. Hoku is nothing like Britney Spears or Mandy Moore. Her style is a cheap throw off of the Pop stars we all love.

They found another \\"dumb blonde\\" (a formerly famous artist's daughter), gave her a make over, a song, placed her in some promotional lines, and here you have it, a produced \\"artist\\". There are plenty of these sorts out now to begin with, but what makes Hoku even more distressing is that her vocal range isn't very... agreeable. Then tune is mixed up in a blender with all other sorts and the lyrics... I won't even start with that. It's a cutesy little getup, but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another note from Another Dumb Blond, PLEASE !","review":"Come on everyone, how can you be writing these praises of Hoku and her debut, \\"Another Dumb Blond\\". One of the few times Britney Spears outshines another artist can be found when comparing this single to any of Spears' works ! The lyrics speaks for themselves ! The entire song is nothing but \\"make no sense\\" lyrics and loud background music coming from a keyboard piano ! Not a catchy song, horrible music, no well written lyrics. Simply don't buy Hoku's, \\"Another Dumb Blond\\" unless you truly are another dumb blond !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather weak","review":"This is an unfortunate example of pop music.

In one of the lectures he spent considerable time spotlighting this book and expressing his conviction that NO serious student of the history of science takes this book seriously. It is full of errors; the author misquotes sources and is generally thought of as a great example of how a book should not be written and how an author should not do his research. Read this book but don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good short history of science vs the Catholic chcurch","review":"A very good review of science vs catholic church with a short (very telling) history of the church.

Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such. For example, the ancient Christian polemic of Bahira, the heretical monk, is repeated as historical fact with no indication that it is at best pure legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapas Perfectas","review":"Today I'm ordering the book TAPAS for my cousin's bride to be.

We all respect those who actually try to live by their convictions, but living with them can be tough.I learned a new swear word, 'rutting' an ingenious way of inserting harsh reality to the dialogue without resorting to course language.Whoever said that stories of faith have a happy ending, this one has a kind of bitter sweet conclusion. I loved the book and I smile at the recollection of some of the classic lines. Would Jonah work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah is probably turning over in his grave!","review":"Supposedly witty and humorous, as a devoutly religious person, I found the book to be way too irreverent for my comfort level; it seemed to mock God (as well as Noah), and I couldn't force myself to read the last half (although I skimmed a few sections). Noah was not pictured as a Godly being but as somewhat of a tyrant, and I didn't feel that the sexual \\"escapades\\" belonged in a Bible story.I'm sure there are those who are in disagreement, but this is, honestly, how I felt about the book and cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous! Not just a retelling of a biblical event.","review":"David Maine has produced a modern masterpiece in what is one of the best books of the year so far. The Preservationist (or The Flood in the UK) is the story of Noah told from the perspective of his family, who are variously confounded, angered, excited, nervous or just plain stoic about his Holy orders.Maine's strength is his stunning portrayal of the women in Noah's life, viz. his wife & three daughter-in-laws. Clearly Maine loves his women and portrays them as storng characters without whom the men would fall apart ion shambles. And most of us know how true that is at any part of time or place.This is a realistically funny, poignant story told with a great sense of good humour about it, and is bound to be of enormous interest irrespective of whether one is a believer or not. A strong recommendation to anyone interested in literary fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I am just lost of word to describe this book.

I only was able to listen to a very little of the first disc because of language and content. I was expecting something totally different than this. Very disappointed in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is honestly one of the worst books I've read all year. You can tell the author probably isn't Jewish OR Christian just by the messed up theology in this book. He also potrays Noah as a abusive husband, Shem as a son who blindly follows his father's faith. He also doesn't understand that God would have kept the animals on the ark alive (he has several animals dying, including a rabbit [which means there would be no rabbits in the world. Rabbits are unclean, therefore there would have been 2 of them. Kill one, there are no rabbits.])It also gets sexually graphic at points, which really doesn't have a place in this book.Overall, if you must read this book, borrow it from a library. It's not worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book of a wonderful series","review":"This book, along with all the others in the series are worth reading time and time again.

I do, and simply cannot recommend them highly enough. One of the reviewers here states that Anne and Serge are born storytellers but is misinformed: Serge did indeed produce writings, but he was primarily a scientist and he provided invaluable research for earlier Angelique books; their historical accuracy, human insight and fluid yet economical prose were, and remain today, the key to their enormous success. Anne and Serge Golon combined their very different talents but Serge was adamant in crediting the authorship to his wife. For your information, Serge died in 1972 but, so far as I know, as of May 2007, Anne is still alive and resides in Versailles.

I simply have to found out about the faith of that wonderful and strong character nicknamed Marquise of Angels.I understand that the last three books of the series have never been translated into english, which, to me, is kind of preposterous, since english readers will never know what happens to Anne Golon's mesmerizing character.Thank God, I don't have this problem, though, for I'm French-Canadian and can easily purchase all the books (which I intend to do as I go along with the series), but to my fellow american readers, this unfinished business of translation is a big let down.So, all you publishers out there : wake up and smell the money ! -----------M.

I have read and re-read this book over the last 25 years and find it as fresh and entertaining as ever. A real highlight for me is the well crafted background of 17th Century France for teh extrordinary character of Angelique, but she is not so extraordinary to be unbelieveable or unsympathetic. I really consider this is a historical series to compare all others against and I would love to see the books reprinted again. I have most of the series (picked up from 2nd hand shops) but I dont have Angelique and the Sultan and it is very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of the best books i've ever read!","review":"I've read it when i was only 12 years, and since then i've tried looking for the same books because i've read mine so many time that they are falling into pieces.Also, the last books of Anne Golon aren't printed in English yet!

This thing is just so disgustingly bad that I feel sorry for all of you who own this. Not only are the lyrics blatantly secular with the exception of a few words tossed in here and there, but it's so downright boring that almost every time I've tried listening to it I've ended up falling asleep during it. This cd is just plain rotten and is hands down the worst Christian cd ever made and also is one of the worst cd's ever made period. Steven's Heaven in the Real World and Signs of Life are pure masterpieces that deserve a thunderous applause from Heaven, but Speechless deserves to get boos all around and should be tossed in the dumpster. The only redeeming quality is the maginificent song Speechless, but anyone who's intelligent should instead find some way to get that one song and not buy the whole album for it. The song doesn't even deserve to be a part of this. Please DO NOT buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Sucks!","review":"This cd stinks worse than decaying flesh and rotten hamburger meat. SCC has really messed up with this release. I just don't understand Christian artists anymore. They put out a few great remarkable feats of achievement, and then all of a sudden they start putting out smut like this. Jars of Clay is the latest band to have committed this heinous sin. Jars hasn't done anything truly remarkable since their debut, and SCC hasn't done anything groundbreaking since Signs of Life. It's been more than 6 years since that wonderful album came out. Would it be too hard to assume that by now he would've created something either as good, almost as good, or God forbid! even better. Steven Curtis Chapman I'm sorry to report is just another artist in a long line of Christian artists who have steadily gone downhill in an awful big hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite SCC Album yet!","review":"Speechless is by far my absolute favorite of the SCC albumns I have heard. The first time I listened to the CD I found my toe-tapping to songs like \\"Dive\\"- A song about diving right into the river of life. \\"The Change\\"- A song that says we should not only appear to be a Christian, but also live the life of a Christian. \\"Next Five Minutes\\"- Which talks about the preciouness of every minute, and how we should live the next five minutes as if they were our last. and \\"Whatever.\\"- Which reminds us that it's not what we think we can do to best serve God, but what He thinks.I also found myself weeping to songs such as \\"The Journey\\"- a BEAUTIFUL instrumental. and \\"With Hope.\\"- A piece that reminds me that I always have hope in Jesus Christ.Though all the other CDs I own of his are phenominal, this one simply shines brighter than the rest. I heartily recommend this wonderful album to any SCC fan.

The startup song, Dive, is awesome and then transitions right into the title song, Speechless, which is masterfully done. You can really tell that he's recording this with the band, as it's so seamless. Get this CD, you'll be....well, you'll be Speechless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And God said ,\\" let there be light, and there was\\"","review":"Steven Curtis Chapman has tapped into the generational gap with this, his latest album, Speechless. I was left in awe at the inspiring and magnificent poetry that flowed within the words. This is a CD that merges breath taking ballads, car dancing guitar jams, and a twist of calming classical music. The world needed to remember that music is not only an art with instruments of sound, but also with utensils of knowledge, dreams wrapped in beautiful phrases that reach down and grab your soul back to life. The love songs on this CD were not just about God, but TO Him. Hats off Steven! You have renewed my hopes that christian music can and will be taken to new levels. Music is after all, the poetry of ones' soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Relationship","review":"These days there are many asking the question, \\"How does Steven Curtis Chapman continue churning out songs that speak to so many so spiritually?\\" The answer is really a simple one. Steven models relationship with Jesus Christ. Yes he knows music. Yes he knows how to pen poetic lyrics. Yes he still know how to match the right music to the right message. But these are extras. Steven sings from the heart. He sings from his own relationship with the God of this universe. That's how it's done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but I still prefer Signs of Life","review":"Signs of Life introduced me to Steven Curtis Chapman, and still remains my favorite. It is not surpassed by his newest album in my own opinion, but that does not mean his latest isn't a good buy - I don't regret it. Dive is an extremely catchy song that immediately made me want to listent to the rest of the album. And Be Still is a beautiful tune to end the album. The strings are very noticeable on the CD, giving it a somewhat different feel from previous CDs, and as fun as it is to listen to, I don't expect the addicting quality Signs of Life had on me. But it is fun, and it is uplifting - certainly a success. Who knows? Maybe it will grow on me just like his previous album did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!","review":"I heard the song \\"Dive\\", and I just have to get this album. SCC has topped himself this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Team Praise God","review":"These songs touch the depth of my soul & I just know Steven Curtis Chapman feels what I feel about the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!","review":"More hip hop then his others. I think this is one of the best he has done! I would recommend it to any one!!!!!! God bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM WILL FUFILL ALL YOUR \\"GREAT EXPECTATIONS\\"","review":"I am amazed and in awe of this wonderful work created by Steven Curtis Chapman. As a songwriter myself, I am astounded by the incredible writing on this album, and the incredible production. This is Steven Curtis Chapman at the top of his game. He has a created an album that is fun, exhilirating and profound. Favorites on the album for me include, \\"Dive,\\" \\"Speechless,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"Be Still And Know.\\" I can't find a single flaw on this album, and I beleive that God has truly touched Steven with an incredible gift. You won't be dissapointed with this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't remember if I've reviewed it yet...","review":"...pweese do forgive me if I have. It's a great, great album. It was the second SCC album I ever got (after falling in love with Greates Hits I was overjoyed to get Speechless for my birthday!), and it remains one of my favorites. \\"Dive\\" is a wonderful song, another one of those that makes you want to get up and dance (or, in this case, dive in!). The title song is pretty good, and, well, all the rest are great, most especially \\"Fingerprints of God\\", \\"The Journey\\" (actually J.A.C. Redford gets credit for that, as it's instrumental), and \\"With Hope\\" can make you cry if you're not careful. \\"What I Really Want to Say\\", though not as acoustically pretty as some other ballads to Mary Beth, is touching and so, so true. \\"The Invitation\\" is the only song you'll want to skip. So, all in all, this new entry from the incredibly cute Kentucky boy gets five stars.~ Child of the Burning Heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommend this and his other albums","review":"Though this album is different than his other ones, I find it still very consistent with his genre. I find myself thinking of my friends when I hear \\"Fingerprints\\", and want to dance to \\"Dive\\". I continue to enjoy every album he has put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great C.D.","review":"This is a great c.d. It has upbeat songs, and is really fun to listen to, and it's about the most important thing of all... GOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He just gets better and better","review":"This is a great album. What makes it so great is that the same spirit of worship and awe of God is there as it has been in his other albums, while the emphatic musical style is different. Notice the symphonic arrangements (\\"Be Still and Know\\")and heavier guitar and bass lines (\\"Last Five Minutes\\")-- the album has a more 'concert feel' than his previous albums, but lyrics are still very powerful (\\"The Invitation,\\" \\"Be Still and Know\\") and worshipful (\\"Speechless,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\"). He continues to make great albums without compromising the message or watering down the musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD I own...","review":"Stephen Curtis Chapman is at his best with \\"Speecheless\\". It is his finest recording yet. His songs make me want to praise God. He has inspired me and he will inspire you if you this to this awsome CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless by Steven C Chapman","review":"This is one of my favorite Steven C's CDs. The last track on the CD is my favorite. If this song does not move you to tears and awe of our awesom God, then nothing will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range is just awful","review":"Ok, how do I explain? I've been picked up off and on during the years. Each time I'm picked up, I get probed. And not just by a little gray. And not just once or twice. The whole darn ship of 'em line up to probe me. Repeatedly.So, I bought this device, thinking that if it went off, I'd have time to escape to my lead-lined safe room, or at least grab a weapon. So what happened? Not what I expected. It didn't give me any warning at all. The range is extremely limited. Only later did I see the disclaimer: \\"For best results, hold directly under saucer.\\"Anyway, I woke up in the ship as I was being probed. And this stupid product was beeping. It kept beeping the whole time that I was being probed by every single crewman. Do you have any idea how annoying it can be to hear tinny beeping as you are being probed by a ship full of grays?Worst of all, the company would not give me a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been Abducted Twice!!","review":"After my first abduction I sought out to arm myself with something that would prevent this from happening to me again. Alas, the UFO Detector.Since then my microwave, TV, radio, and cellphone have been causing the device to alarm several times, sending me in a state of panic where I'd hide under my bed for days. Next time it went off it was no false alarm. And I was, again, on board an alien vessle with probes hanging from every opening of my body.I'd guess that for this \\"Detector\\" to work you'd need to be in an environment free from all electrical interferences. Above all, I DO NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item sucks","review":"Seriously...After like two times it breaks. The first time, upon encountering the UFO the device started to shutter and shake REALLY bad and then lost all power. The second time, well...that time was mostly okay, but the third time it didn't work at all. I had to get out of bed with a flashlight and when I finally got the UFO to come over, the device just sat there like it was a toaster or something. Seriously, if your looking for a GOOD UFO detector, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"stupendous","review":"I loved this product, it would have received 5 stars if I hadn't had to sell my ray gun to purchase it. Anyone serious about UFO hunting and exploration. needs this for their kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't need no stupid detector to know I'm going up again!","review":"Ok, I bought this stupid thing and I'm driving along feeling safe and peaceful when all in a sudden my engine stalls and my ford starts floating towards saturn and THEN the stupid detector goes dead and it hits me. Electronics fail when a UFO approaches anywhere near!Besides that I don't need some gadget to tell me I'm beaming up again!This thing is like buying those silly weather rocks - by the time the rock is missing, the tornado is already there!At least the rock is environmentally \\"Green\\", not like the batteries this thing requires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works outside the Body","review":"I read that Aliens like to do Anal probes so I thought if I hid this in my Bum I could detect them before the got me. Well needless to say I am writing this on my way to Epsolon Epsolon Ack Ack Bivivito 7. I am amazed at how good the Interweb is in space but disappointed that the detection kit did not work as intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got me abducted!","review":"I was fishing at a lake not far from me and had the device with me. It failed to detect a UFO, and before I know it, they scooped me up in a giant glowing fishing net and carried me to Neptune where I was then probed, injected with I have no idea what, and mercifully, fed quite well. They gave me steak, they were quite nice after the probing actually.I would not recommend this detector, I would not want anybody else to get probed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works too good","review":"I bought this to see if there were any aliens here, but since I was in Texas near the Tex/Mex boarder, my alarm would not turn off! Every time I went to home depot or walmart it would go off and I could never get it to turn off! Also when I take it near my vegetables and fruits it goes off, so I have to wrap them in tin foil, which is a hassle. I wonder if there going to release one that detects immigrants.....misc was here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"UFO detector is an oxymoron","review":"I'm very upset. Sure the device works fine and immediatly detects all UFO's in the area. Unfortunatly, once the UFO's are detected they no longer qualify as unidentified. How am I supposed to keep believing in UFO's if they no longer exist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"are you that stupid ?","review":"Really? The other reviewers bought this piece of &*%$ ? Can you say shills. Rather than buy this why not take your money and flush it down the toilet as a way of communicating with the little green men?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read","review":"I like this book, it contains basic information on the Sabbats and includes some handy crafts for you to perform during each Sabbat and some history on them. However the writing is so random you can hardly spot *where* was that thing you saw and wanted to do. But it's nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple, Honest Book. Recommended!","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this book is a bit rambly, but that is part of its charm. It has a very conversational voice, and you can tell the author feels deeply about the subject matter. Still, if you are trying to learn about the traditional holidays, you should not use this as your only text. Try it in conjunction with other books: The Wiccan Cookbook, The Wheel of the Year, Celtic Folklore Cooking and any of a dozen more will give you an organized look at the seasons and traditions. Good luck on your path!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff.","review":"I use this almost exclusively.You need very little, a little goes a very very long way.I've been using exclusively eros pjur woman for maybe 3 years, and I've had to buy 2 bottles, through long distance relationships, and actively living with beaus... a couple drops will do ya hehe.plus its very mild and me, I'm allergic to most things, but this I have no adverse reaction to."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm mmmmm good","review":"oh the gauntlet of lubes can be overwhelming but in my searches i have found what i consider to be the best. pjur woman.this is not a thick, goopy, heavy feeling lube. this is light and sweet jesus, it is so smooth and sexy.

Silky smooth and rich. Good for massages too, so very versatile all around.

Since coming off of birth control, I've had dryness issues and painful sex. This product was not helpful. The feel is silky, yes, but not slick. It took a LOT of the product to get any kind of benefit, and even then it just felt weird. Afterward, it was very difficult to clean off, and left an \\"after\\" feel about which neither of us were pleased. I can't imagine wanting to be covered in it for a \\"massage,\\" either. I don't see the point of this product in any respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Stuff","review":"Product not as pictured.

There are beter silicone-based lubes to be had. Highly recommend Wet Platinum instead. It's superior in all regards and is of the quality I was expecting Pjur Eros Origiinal to be. The interesting thing is that a small sample of Wet Platinum arrived with the Pjur Eros order, or I would never have known about it. Wet Platinum can be found at staywetlonger dot com, among other places."},{"rating":"1","title":"oil??","review":"even though is not oil, it feels like it. that might be good to an extent, but if you can't wash it off with water, i don't think you want it inside you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't disappointed","review":"Have awlays used Pjur or Eros... and they haven't disappointed.

I will never use anything else after trying this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I loved the feel of this lub but it left me itchy and sore after using it twice.

I didn't realize he had written the book the movie was based on! It was fabulous, and after re-watching the movie, I enjoyed both equally!

Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, bad discs","review":"I bought this series two years ago and loved it! The only problem I had with the discs was what one reviewer stated, that disc one got stuck part way through episode two, and all the rest of the discs played fine. A few months ago I sat down to watch the series again and now almost every disc will not play past the half way point! I have A LOT of DVDs and this has never happened. But there is good news! The entire series is available in a boxed set from Yesasia.com. It is the Korean release with English subtitles (which are pretty good)and is on sale for $230. I've only watched two discs so far but have had no problems. Apparently MBC Korea has something that MBC America does not... quality control! Almost forgot, there are extras on these discs (no subtitles) that include interviews, photo shoots and outtakes.

This company cares about its rating and achieves this with good communication and follow up with the customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Korean Historical Drama","review":"This is the first historical drama that intrigued and entertained me thru the whole 62 episodes. I started watching this drama from a local Korean DTV channel that went off the air at episode 28 (we now have 2 Korean DTV channels). Then I found it and finished watching on the internet. I have been watching Japanese, Chinese, and lately Korean historical dramas since I moved here to Santa Clara, CA twenty years ago. This is the first one I have ever bought. It looks real good on my Plasma. There is so much going on in the drama it will take several times of watching it to catch all the details. This has English subtitles and set the highest TV ratings in Korea of high thirties to high forties thru out the showing last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FAKE AND MEDIOCRE PRODUCTION","review":"After watching some great Chinese productions (The Banquet, The Golden Flower etc.), I bought this based upon the five star rating here.

This is a must for anyone who likes blaring brass mixed with punkish guitar sounds.Even better is that the album is named after my old hometown, Rapid City, and has a song, Skyline Drive, named after the most well known street in town. Plus Hazel SD is less than 50 miles from my home in Brookings SD.If anyone knows what the connection is between the Daddies and Rapid City SD, please email me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on Swingin' Sweetheart!!","review":"If you don't love these guys from the moment you press play, there must be something wrong with your stereo.

THIS MOVIE AIN'T NO BETTER OR DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER DIRECT TO VIDEO ACTION MOVIES THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE ACTION SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfactory & inadequate effort","review":"I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as I expected to. I thought the characters were unrealistic & behaved improbably throughout.While there is a certain suspension of disbelief that a reader engages in while reading fiction, this book went far beyond these limits. For instance, the protagonist, Callista, dislikes the telephone because she prefers to spend time gardening, yet allows her sister to repeatedly insist she answer & return calls when she doesn't want to; the casual way she ignores being locked in the shed is also extremely unrealistic, as is the loss of the straight razor which she left in the seat of an unlocked car. The gardening information was excellent & interesting, but the story itself disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook for beginners and experts","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift some years ago, and it has served me well. It's a great resource for all those staple homecooked dishes from south asia, but also for less common variants and some Persion and Middle Eastern dishes that have seeped into our cuisine. For such a small book, it covers quite a bit of the cuisine.Many of the recipes are simple with the minimum of ingredients, and the directions are fine with only a few slip-ups here and there. On the whole a definite necessity in a desi kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"books 3-9, not 3-4","review":"Contrary to the reviewer who says it is not clear that this is only one volume of 3, I thought there was 6 or 7 volumes altogether. The title clearly says \\"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4\\", so obviously this is volume 2 of a collection. Knowing that the original Elements had 13 books, my assumption was there must be several more volumes in this new edition. Actually, Amazon's title of the book is wrong! If you look at the front cover, or the index of this book, you can see that it says \\"Vol.2 (Books III-IX)\\". And if you are interested to know, volume 1 covers books I and II, and volume 3 covers books X through XIII so altogether they cover the original Elements entirely.Update (10/14/2010):At the time I wrote the previous review, the book's title was \\"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4\\". Obviously Amazon must have realized the mistake and corrected the title to \\"...: Books 3-9\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror on life","review":"I have been a fan of Rush for almost 20 years know, this started when I was a kid of 15, the rythim they use and the \\"fairy tale lyrics\\" just sounded cool to me.Now after 20 years I find the music still inspires me and through life's ups and downs the words can give direction and peace. As a non native english speaker I wanted to \\"understand\\" the meaning better. This book really gave a new depth to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers remorse that inspires anger...","review":"I can't believe I bought the back cover hype, and purchased this book. Mr. Roberto should have begun most sentences with, \\"Uh...\\". Lacking confidence, he speculates on the shallow, obvious sides of Neal's brilliant lyrics. I can only surmise that a Writers Club Press saw dollar signs, conspired with a bogus editer, and convinced Mr. Roberto that his internet thoughts would make a good book. But, c'mon Len, this book is in your name, and your reputation. How could you have not fleshed out this manuscript to make it readable? Skip this book, and read Mystic Rythums."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's short and cheap","review":"I don't really have to say anything more than the reviewers before me have said. Thankfully the book is short so if you do fall victim to reading it you won't have wasted much time and if you've purchased it you won't have wasted much money. The only reason I've given it even one star is because it is about Rush and their music. It is just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"A Simple Mind's Mirror\\"","review":"Really Bad. Embarrassingly bad. In fact, this book is so bad that I don't want to dignify it further by saying any more than that.On the other hand, if clarifying and delving deeper into Neil Peart's prosaic and allegorical lyrics is of interest to you, then I strongly recommend \\"Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush\\" by Carol Selby Price and Robert M. Price (5 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic in the extreme","review":"For a book on the lyrics of a band as complex and intellectual as Rush's, this book is a joke.

I am a die-hard Rush fan and I still could hardly get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love how this book is set up!","review":"I love the short concise chapters--so zen. He gets to the point and doesn't let the reader forget why she started writing--for joy! For fun! He encourages; he makes us laugh.

These girls give electronic pop techno a new meaning! they really know how to hit it off. Every song is worth mention in this album! they all talk about stuff you could understand and like!

Check them out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"t..A.T.u rocks","review":"this cd rocks. I love the songs \\"All The Things She Said\\", \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" & \\" Show Me Love\\".

I heard a lot of their Russian songs, and I loved all of them. That's why I was so excited to hear that they were coming out with a English album. It's hard to put t.A.T.u's music in a certian musical category, it's a mix of lots of kinds of music. The lyrics to their songs are great. I'm bisexual so I can relate so most of the songs, but even my friends who are straight can find something that they can relate to. I can't pick one song that stands out on the album, they are all amazing! Anyone who has enjoyed their first single off this album, \\"All The Things She Said\\", will enjoy this album.So, if you are still debating whether to get '200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane', go ahead and get it!

It is a fantastic album and the mixture of dance and pop work really well.My only problem is that one of the tracks \\"stars\\" has large sections in russian and as I dont speak russian I dont know what they are singing about.but that is my only problem. The album is superb and I will be looking out for future releases from the duo."},{"rating":"2","title":"TATU FOREVER","review":"I bought the album because some collegues told me, there are two russian girls who have produced a very good album, i heard the song ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID, and i was fascinated of them, so i went to a CD Shop in Switzerland and I bought this CD. All the other Albums i have there are 2 or 3 good songs but the rest aren't very good. So i heard to this Album 200 km/h in the wrong lane, and all 12 songs are very very good. Julia and Lena have very nice voices, i hope they will come to Switzerland, and i wish they will give the best concert we ever had in Switzerland in the Hallenstadion in Zurich.

I would greatly suggest that you buy it and really get a 1st hand look and see how great it is yourself.. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Russia with Love","review":"As contrived as t.A.T.u. may be, there's no denying this album has a kind of over-the-top grandeur, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for misunderstood teens...The roaring guitars and hard beats are better than the contrived pop of their American and British counterparts. The track selection is rather skimpy; only 8 songs, followed by two Russian versions and a slightly extended version. The latest Russian counterpart to this album has about 15 songs, the best of which should have been added. Listening to this is a guilty pleasure, like listening to ABBA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fame can kill","review":"A great re-release from Russia with love. Definitely on the light side of the bubblegum scene, but with Trevor Horn behind them it may go good. Everyone has heard/seen \\"All the Things She Said\\" and I don't think anything more needs to be said of that. Just to prop these babes up from the one-hit classic bunch, I have to give a thumbs up for \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" as well as \\"Show Me Love.\\" I just hope that they don't let their image eat away thier chances at making a musical statement. We saw this in the last decade with Fem 2 Fem. I hope this helps open the door to more of the talent hidden in Mother Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not actually an Audio CD!","review":"The music of Tatu is great ... but be warned that the CD they are selling is not actually a music CD at all. The CD I received is labelled as [ENHANCED], and apparently that means no music. All my CD contained was a Music Video and some Behind the Scenes content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Beats, Horrible singing.","review":"I highly respect the producers for making such nice songs. Unfortunately it's ruined by two Russian \\"lesbian\\" couples. The singing is horrible; they use their \\"good enough\\" voice and edit it on music software. I have no idea why people think they're so good. It's because most people are only attractive by the lesbian acts or their cute looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated and I hate it now","review":"My sister got this thing, and made me listen to it. I really don't hate a lot of music, but this. *shudder* This is terrible, on all levels.First, there was the \\"lesbian\\" stunt, which was simply disgusting and cheap. Even if they WERE actually lesbians, they way they played up that angle was just... repulsive.Well, fine, publicity smublicity. If the music is good, we can forgive that cheat stunt.Ha. The music? Generic, forgettable dance. And the voices are annoying and ear-drum shatteringly shrill. And repeatative. Since I didn't get enough of the singer's shrieking out \\"They're not gonna get us\\" the first time! Eugh... And they don't even write or anything on their songs. All they do is sing. In short, UGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tatu Stinks!","review":"Tatu will never appear on the cover's of the pop magazines like Justin Timberlake and Avril lavigne did when they succeeded on their first albums.Tatu are just obnoxious with their songs and music.The lyrics to the songs are constantly repeated and they look like their everywhere when you look at them by analyzing. Those background laughs in ''30 minutes'' are annoying and know this none of Tatu's videos appeared on muchmore music but Avril lavigne's did.It's easy to explain how come ''not gonna get us now'' didn't make it on the countdown which pop videos usually do because it wasn't popular and not very good. It looks embarassing when the British banned a Tatu video and not letting Julia into a Mcdonalds.It just looks so phony that these girls are homosexual and they probably aren't...they probably do what their manager told them what to do. Tatu are shams and you should feel ashamed by wasting your money on this disgraceful exploitation of a Europop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alvin and the Chipmunks Go Techno/Electro-Pop!!!","review":"If you don't belive me, listen to track #7.Several of the songs on this CD try to evoke emotion, put fall flatly on their collective face. I don't blame the vocalist(s), but the struggle to phonetically get through the English lyrics is at times amusing. In contrast (and in all fairness), the two tracks that are in Russian, in my opinion, are far more provoking. It's a shame that the marketing machine has managed to bury their talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick, marketing package with absolutely no substance","review":"Music continues to go further down the drain to Hades. T.A.T.U is another fine example of great marketing but no substance whatsoever underneath the slick, marketing appearance. First of all, WTH were they thinking of covering The Smiths' classic \\"How Soon is Now?\\"? Have the girls in T.A.T.U even heard of The Smiths? Whoever thought it would be a swell as to pass off two underage girls as lesbians singing chirpy pop songs is a 'genius' to come up with that ploy to sell records. If anything, the person responsible for T.A.T.U's image needs a swift kick in the arse for giving lesbians a bad name. \\"All the Things She Said\\" is an awful song. I would take Kidneythieves' \\"Before I'm Dead\\" over this duo and I'm no fan of Kidneythieves either but at least that band has a singer who can actually sing and music that doesn't make me nauseous."},{"rating":"2","title":"a complete rush","review":"This cd is absolutely perfect!... It also happens to be the most catchy set of tracks in the history of compact disks. You will constantly have this cd \\"running through your head\\". Well this cd may not appeal to all people it certainly hit a sweet spot with me. You can just hear emotion pouring out of your each verse, not to mention this is the perfect driving music. To summerise there is alot more here than a marketing gimmeck, I personally insist you purchase it now!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"All their songs are great in their very own language, but since the release of the english one, ive been wanting and waiting for them to come on tour already! i love the beats and the lyrics plus the extended versions! they are great"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen....","review":"This cd is a great listen, I really enjoy the \\"How Soon is Now?\\" cover (an old the smiths song). There is a few flaws in there english songs but they are obviously new to the language and I wish Lena and Julia could express themselfs more through the english language when it comes to the enhanced movies on there CD but they run into there language barrier.It does seem that they are a heavily produced duo on stage and off but there is so many pop acts in America currently that are worse so I don't see this as much of a problem since they are both young and need direction til they can find there own musical journey to take. Hopefuly as there english learning progresses and they can express themselfs more through lyrics and interviews they will be a fantastic act to watch in the future.Good luck breaking through into the USA, it is a tuff journey and I hope you plot it well else they will become a one-hit-wonder in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Hello. I think that this Cd is 2002 best cd (well, maybe the second, after Springsteen). The songs are very good (they are 8 new songs, very good, songs). My favorites are: All the things she said and Show me love. The rest (30 seconds, not gonna get us, malchik gay, clowns, Stars) are, also, great. There is a new version of \\"how soon is now?\\", a very good songs for this girls' voices. Well, the songs are fantastic, but THE BEST of the cd is Julia and Lena's voices; THEYR VOICES ARE INCREDIBLE. Please, belive me, YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD NOW !!! NOW!!!. Thank you, and TATU FOREVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of room for improvement...","review":"t.A.T.u (translated into 'she likes that girl') is so new and shocking only because of their image. They kinda make it seem like they're only in this for a publicity stunt (namly because they're lesbians.) I kinda find that sick, and despite that, their lyrics are just nothing by rambling on and on and on. However, I will give them thumbs up for the rythm on most of their tracks (which is why their music is appealing aside the fact that their foriegn.) I just hope that next time their lyrics would be more important and defining in their future albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool!","review":"This is one of the best cds I have listened to. All the songs are exellent! Definately recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Product\\" in every sense of the word","review":"I suppose every year needs a flimsy pop record for people to dance to. The very fact that the hype over their sexual orientation overshadows the music should serve as a dead giveaway that these two girls are about selling records more than making music of any lasting importance. Having said that, this is disposable pop at its most crass. Turning the Smiths jangle-pop classic \\"How soon is now\\" into a mindless Euro-dance track is not only a travesty, it's rather ironic given what the song was originally written about. Subtract out the pouts, contrived hype, and cheesy beats, and your left with a disc I suspect will be easy to find in the used bin in 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars!","review":"One word for this album would be, amazing. 200 km/h in the wrong lane rocks, and there first single, All the things she said has a total pop/dance beat, My favorite song would have to be 30 min though. This song has the best lyrics and relates to me the most. Everyone should check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistable!","review":"The first time I heard \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio, I was hooked. I couldn't get that song out of my head. So every time I was in my car, I was hunting through the stations madly trying to find it again. Then, I decided that song alone was worth a purchase of this CD. And I was pleasantly surprised to find an album full of songs so catchy that you will be dancing furiously when you are listening to them and humming them constantly when you aren't. On top of the 8 or so original songs, you get a couple interesting Russian versions and even better, a music video AND an interesting behind-the-scenes look.What else can I say? The duet are sexy Russian lesbians(this alone will gather much attention and interest from the guys) with pretty voices and beautiful, melodic tunes. I look to T.A.T.U's future with much interest. Don't miss this album! It's so much better than most of the ... out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the Wrong Lane is true...","review":"Flash in the pan. In the United States anyway. This duo may be popular in Russia, but I don't see how these girls will ever be more than their one hit \\"All The Things She Said\\" here in the U.S. Their music is over the top bubble gum pop. They have a couple of songs that have a catchy beat to them which make them passable, but the majority of the album doesn't even have that going for it. Their sound tends to remind me of music from an anime film. They have two things going for them... 1) They're very attractive girls and in this day and age appearance matters as much if not more than the music itself (see Britney for proof)... and 2) Their songs are already synth pop so it's easy for Dj's to remix them into electronica dance songs.In the end they have only two songs even worth listening to... \\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Clowns\\" because of their catchy beats. I would suggest buying these on singles instead of the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listened first","review":"My son enjoys a variety of music and often will hold out something to share with me, which is what he did with T.A.T.U.I sat and listened to the entire CD and found myself enjoying it beyond merely *OK*.After I listened to it and decided I quite liked it, I did an online search to find out what they are all about. What interesting reading. I guess it doesn't much matter to me if they happened because of a 'marketing ploy'. The fact is I enjoyed the CD - which is what's important to me. ...If a lot of people enjoy what they created well then they should make money, eh? I don't get all the fussing about these two girls. It's entertainment, I enjoyed it quite a bit. A nice change from some of the drivel the local radio stations play! If their subsequent music is as enjoyable- one of us will be spending money to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing i've ever listened to.","review":"I just want to say that this cd has brought a remarkable insiration in my life. There are so many words to explain it that i cant possibly think of. They shed light on girls around the world who are scared to let out who they are and what they beleive in. Anyone who is everyone should buy this cd just to experience a little on the wild side. And if your Russian I'm sure you know what I mean. Please go buy this cd and make T.A.T.U a worldwide favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Refreshing Change","review":"I rarely buy albums because it's usually only a couple tracks that drives you to buy them in the first place. After downloading their tracks from the net to check it out (all now deleted I must add!) I decided to order their album. I must admit to preferring the Russian version best as it seems more traditional Russian than English dance music. After having to put up with UK's fabricated bands & charts t.A.T.u's music is welcome with open arms. Future albums will be bought straight away as will all single releases. All I need to do now is find somewhere I can order the Russian version from. These girls, even though they're *not* lesbians (who cares anyway?) are going to take the globe by storm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'All the Things She Said' won't stop runnin through my head!","review":"t.A.T.u's '200 km/h in the Wrong Lane' is a complete sucess. I just can't will myself to take the cd out of my cd player. Julia Volkova and Lena Katina from Moscow, Russia have \\"#1\\" written all over them. Great songs ranging from the upbeat \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" to more serious \\"Stars,\\" all of these songs will be played on radio stations nonstop. I highly recommend this cd, buy it and experiece this for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Discovery","review":"I went through hell to get this cd. And it was worth it. I bought the single first, and had to wait until December 10th to get the full length one. The best part of Tatu is that they have a great edge and I like the fact that they are not \\"Backstreet Boys\\" Big (In America). In all honesty I would like to buy some of their previous cds. I really like the beat and sound that I heard from this cd. Also they have a great look about them, very real and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If there is anything more mainstream than this CD I would quit listening to music. 1st off they are not musicians and probly never will be. They used they're good looks and kissing each other to sell records. Don't get me wrong wvery guy likes to see a couple of hot chicks make out together but come on, the misicianship is not there. Nice try, I'm gonna go ahead and do the honor of labeling them a 1 hit wonder. \\"All the things she said\\" had a catchy beat but I just wish they would'nt have said anything. I give this CD a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"So they're lesbians. Who cares?!","review":"The only reason for their fame is because they're lesbians and there are people out there that would throw away 12 bucks just to listen to lesbians sing about nonsense. I don't have a problem with lesbians at all, I'm just saying that's the only reason why people would listen to tatu. So what if they're lesbians? Does that mean they're talented? In this corrupt world where money is God, people will buy anything. I agree with other reviewers that this group is nothing more than a project created by some fat, middle aged guy who just wants to fatten his wallet. I remember seeing a commercial about tatu on TV. Corrupting our youth? Heck yeah, because that's what the middle aged guy wants. He wants to fool everybody into thinking this is real music so he can get more money. It's not working on me, however. I'm not buying this CD. I actually buy good music. Just a word to the wise, don't buy this CD. They're not that hot and the lyrics are stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicks don't make good music!","review":"It's hard to take the music seriously when I doubt that they're even being honest about their sexuality.Music-wise, it sounds like old-school Britney Spears trying to rock out - horrible on paper, even horribler live (I know that horribler isn't a word, but this stuff is so bad, that it deserves a new word for bad that means ten thousand times worse than CRAP!) Clever idea, trying to capitalize on an industry driven by sex appeal, but little more than that. Even watching them make out on stage gets boring after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of vocal ability","review":"While this CD may be good for dancing purposes, it has no depth in terms of lyrics and the vocals are very weak artistically to call the two girls who pretend to lead a gay lifestyle for publicity purposes singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"TATU","review":"This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite albums","review":"This is one of my favourite albums, Since I am a Russian, I've been listening to Russian versions of \\"Not gonna get us\\" and \\"All the things she said\\", only recently have I heard the English versions, They are very good in both languages, but they're cooler in Russian, I love this CD and I reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I bought dis album a long time ago, I'm still happy with it, I'm sick of people dissin' them, Just 'cause they think der fake, They are not fake, They have real talent, Unlike alot of people, *Cough* Britney Spear Me, Christina Gagulair *Cough*, Anyway, I do think you should buy this album, It's amazing, Also, Watch out for dat new album soon!t.A.T.u. is forever! =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected But","review":"I was pleasantly surprised.

Great vocals and good compilation of both english and russian songs.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Songs","review":"As a native of Russia, I thought t.A.T.u was going to be a band with no talent, who want to show the world that they are proud to be lesbian. But after my English friend gave me this cd in English, it has grown on me alot. So what if they don't write their own songs? Britney Spears doesn't, but that doesn't stop people from liking her. So judging them by not writing their own songs is narrow-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a lesbian gimmic to sell records","review":"ok, this gimmic of theirs is clever because they're both pretty damn cute, but aren't very talented in the singing area. one of my friends bought this CD several days ago and i thought i was going to insane because of how they sounds. in \\"not gonna get us\\" they sound like a couple of off-key chipmunks. some of the lines in \\"all the things she said\\" just plain don't make any sense.maybe i'm one of the few who can see right through this gimmic for what it really is....an attempt to sell [bad] records with hot girls who claim to be \\"in love with eachother.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I really liked this cd. The songs are great they come across as lite and fun but when you listen to the lyrics you see how deep they are. True the girls didn't songs but that doesn't make them bad. I love when artists write there own songs but it's not a requirement for a great song. As far as the lesbian thing who cares if it's real or marketing. Too much importance is put on musicians personal life who cares. These girls have great voices and sing great songs with terrific music. All the Things She Said and Not Gonna Get Us get all the praise and are good but not the best the album has to offer. Stars is touching even though part of it is in Russian. How Soon is Now wonderful the first time I heard it I was trying to figure where I knew it from I finally did. Clowns and Show Me Love are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dyke Drama!","review":"This album is a hell of a lot of fun. It is filled with a great pumping rhythm and makes you bump to the beat! There is no folk music or sad sad problems drawn out in horrible harmony. This album may have it's angst ridden lyrics but it is just so much fun to dance to. Many of the songs are written like action movie scripts with lyrics like \\"Not gonna get us\\" and \\"Do we run? Should I hide? For the rest of my life?\\"I originally bought this CD after hearing \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio. Lo and behold this CD kicked my butt and then I got a look at the insert pictures. Hot, my friends. Definitly HOT. The music is awesome, the singers gorgeous. What more could you want?!?! I am definitly waiting impatiently for a new album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album from these Russian teens!","review":"This is a fun, catchy album. I wouldn't expect too much from this album- it is what it is! The first release from two teens with strong and pleasant vocals. They have a lot to say and are supported by awesome beats/tunes. I think it's good to put out there 'pro-lesbian lyrics' (if you will) and a little controversy for more PR is not such a bad thing either. If you are not uncomfortable with what these girls have to say/sing - which isn't really 'in your face' nor mentioned much anyway- then you'll likely enjoy this album. Hopefully they will release a more vocally-refined follow-up album within a decent amount of time as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I was very surprised at how much i liked this CD. The first song i ever heard was on the russian version of the 30 minutes video. It drew me in and kept me there, and combined with the American version it's one of my favorites on the CD. Clowns is my favorite though, if you listen closely you can hear a russian beat similar to the original Tetris by Nintendo! Sure the vocals sound like someone's torturing mice, but these days with all the hate and hipocrit \\"music\\", mice aren't so bad. The only slight disappointment i had was that only like 6 songs are American and the others are Russian versions of those songs. While it's a good multi-cultural experience, i'm looking forward to more original content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it LOUD!!","review":"I saw the T.A.T.U. video on MTV and I really like the song Not Gonna Get Us, so I decided to get the cd. The lyrics are kind of simple, but the beats of most of the songs are great. I believe that about three of the songs are in Russian as well.All in all, I think this CD is worth buying, just for the simple fact that it is a fun album and you can dance to it. Plus, it is really fun to drive to as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian version is MUCH better","review":"If you really want to hear this album the way it was intended to be heard, get the Russian version. You could probably find the translation somewhere on the net. While their English debut is intended to captivate the North American crowd, it is clearly inferior to the Russian release. Due to their accent and unsuitable voice for English lyrics, a few songs sound a little comical while some of their best tracks are missing. Whatever happened to Robot and Ya Tvoi Vrag?? Nevertheless, I gave it 4 stars for their well spent effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"POPSA","review":"Its no secret that this band is a product. It has everything it needs to sell in the West: controversial as always lesbianism, iron courtain feeling and catchy melodies. I cannot imagine a better plan. With this in mind, just enjoy the cheesy music. By the way, this is good pop, with a smart musician behind and really good mixing. I think its the most crude evidence of the music industry of our times, so take it as historical evidence if you want to. I'd rather listen to this cyborg of a duo than to [bands] who really believe in their punk like Sum 41. Its all about who lies less to themselves.TATY is not TATU in russian - its just the \\"y\\" in cyrilic sounds like a \\"u\\" in latin alphabet. Al though they are from Moscow, they are not such a big thing in Russia. You see, Russians are not so easy costumers, and are not thrilled by the controversial, as is the West. And regarding the girls, they could be any two girls walking down Tverskaya St - they are ALL as beautiful, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could be better???","review":"These girls are great, the album combines great dance music with truly inspired lyrics. The enhanced content is great, especially the music video for \\"All the things she said\\", which is my favorite song on the album, particularly the russian version. Buy it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy from strangers","review":"Fun, frothy stuff from more girls with a bunch of guys putting words in their mouths and beats behind them. Not really a new concept, is it?\\"All the Things She Said\\" works fine and locked itself in my head for days, but then so did \\"The Sign\\" by Ace of Base when it came out. The whole of the disc is fine and has plenty of electronic samples and sterile echo tricks to amuse one, and the Russian versions of the tracks are nice little surprises.Though I would be delighted to see Tatu grow as artists, I cannot help but think they are the Chumbawumba of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.a.T.u rulz","review":"Tatu is a wonderful display of talent and courage.

T.A.T.U's album really rocks! After All The Things She Said was released months ago I anxiously awaited the release of their album ... and it was well worth the wait! Both girls voices carry a very wide range and the combination of their styles makes for a very unique sound. But aside the much hyped lesbian relationship of these two Russian teen vamps because once you hear the cd you'll only want more. The music speaks louder than any marketing stratagem and it screams FIERCE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly produced work","review":"This duo might have talent but it is hard to tell from this alblum. As is far to common to pop the producer over uses synthetic effects to alter the voices of the singers. While te music is fast and can be danced to it has a forced and artificial feel to it. After listening to most of these songs once or twice the novelty has worn off and the CD is put back in its case to collect dust until the next garage sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely DIRE!!","review":"This is the latest twist in a failing music world, if you can call making two teenagers sing as a lesbian act and be managed by nothing short of a paedophile music, then i have nothing more to say, the quality of music continues to decline, teeny boppers and people who bought this CD and their singles thank you very much for supporting this dire enterprise, the sooner they are gone, the better! Listen to the real musicians with talent, i have more respect for Christina Aguilera than this 'act', and that's saying a lot! Hey how about i go find two of my girl friends and tell them to kiss and sing, gee i'd have a lesbian music act, no talent, just rubbish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitting title","review":"I think it just highlights the state of the music industry nowadays when record companies have to go as far as russia to reel in the money. Although i think it was a really well executed plan to bring two very controversial, easily manipulated youngsters to our ears. Musically the album is pretty good and the songs show some degree of emotion, i think the vocals are grating at times but that's all down to taste. \\"How soon is now?\\" is a very tame effort, which was a song written by \\"The Smiths\\" in the 80s. The record company wanted to produce easily digestable pop and it succeded. You'll love the songs just long enough to go out and buy the album which will be forgotten in a couple weeks of listening. If you think you've created a special emotional bond with the fore metioned artists think again, they don't even understand what their singing (They Don't speak English) Vocals are dull and unemotional. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly shrill","review":"If it weren't for their lesbian and contraversial image, this group would never have gotten to this point with just their \\"talent\\" alone. This album comprises of nothing but them shrieking, and singing shrilly the same lines over and over again. A good example is the song Not Gonna Get Us in which they scream the title line repeatedly till you feel like punching your stereo or the TV. If you relish giving yourself a pounding headache then this is the album for you. If not, stay far far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical explosion from the upcomming music country","review":"Adding \\"200km/h in the wrong lane\\" to my CD-collection is probably the best thing I've done for a long time. The CD has a good mix of slow relaxing songs and up-tempo songs including both songs in English and Russian. By having the two girls singin at the same time it lifts the song to a higher level. Together they make the songs even more powerful. The lyrics isn't always clear but, probably, that's the good thing about those, a bit, mysterious girls from Russia. It's also great that Russia, as a country, shows that also they produce modern and good music. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is great!!","review":"t.A.T.u is the greatest duo of all history even if they are lesbians,but I dont care.This album in my countdown is defenetly in the #1 spot.The lyrics ,the music,their voices,I mean everything is all perfect. t.A.T.u. defenetly rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I wasn't expecting much from these \\"lesbian posers\\" but I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the album. The super-addictive \\"all the things she said\\" really got to me so I bought the CD. There's some pretty good stuff on here despite their high-pitched singing. Tracks like \\"not gonna get us\\", \\"show me love\\" and \\"stars\\" are really well done.On the other hand 200KM/H IN THE WRONG LANE IS a really short CD with only 8 songs. The other 3 tracks are Russian versions of \\"all the things she said\\", \\"not gonna get us\\" and an extended version of \\"show me love\\". Lyrically this CD deals with gay love. Even the straight forward \\"malchik gay\\" deals with being in love with a gay boy.Despite Lena & Julia's girl-on-girl gimmick, 200KM IN THE WRONG LANE is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The sound that T.A.T.U. has is very interesting, and while their image is being marketed to overly-hormonal straight teenage boys, their message is great, even if ignored, and something to be paid attention to by all people.I'm saddened by the way they're being portrayed and reviewed. Being lesbian is not something to \\"turn on\\" the boys. It is not something to sell their music. It is the way they are, and making music about it is no more remarkable than any of the hundreds of artists making songs about heterosexual love.The album is awesome - but buy it for the right reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for my best friend","review":"She loved it. It's one of her favorite bands. Also, she received quite early. Couldn't be happier. Great album and in perfect condition.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Russian finally.","review":"I first bought this album in Moscow in 2001, when the album was first released. It became a instant hit in Russia, and I loved the album. According to the Russian press, they are not real lesbians, but that does not interfere with the album's popularity at all, in fact it only makes it that much more interesting. THe English lyrics have been altered somewhat, the Russian title to \\"All the Things She Said\\" is, translated, \\"I've Lost My Mind\\" (Ya Soshla s Uma).THe same points are made however. THe musik is upbeat and fun, and a great listen.If you liked this album, and are interested in Russian music, some other Russian artists are Strelki, Ruki Vverkh, Linda, Zemfira, and Alsou (whose album is also available in English) I can only hope that some of these artists make it here also."},{"rating":"2","title":"TATU rocks THE MUSIC WORLD","review":"I REALLY HAD DOUBTS THAT THEIR ALBUM WOULD BE ANOTHER POP-BORING ALBUM.

Those who hate this album and judge it based on its content and its artists are just down-right STUPID and NAIVE. These girls worked hard on making their albums and they deserve all the good credit for it. This album is worth every penny so if you don't currently own this album...purchase one here or at any music store within your location!! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"I must say that this album kicks butt. Not only am i impressed by the lyrics and beats, which astounded me even more on how fluent these girls are at english and russion, but the fact that these girls dont give a $hit about what other people think. One thing that puzzled me though was why Japans album got bonus tracks, but not europes or the US one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Translation Accuracy","review":"This is really a very good album and it represents a real cultural cross-over. I wanted to reject notions that translations might be suspect, as expert opinions on the subject are readily available (My Wife) and the translations capture the context and the meaning very well. T.A.T.U. is comparable to the musical revolution of the 60's and 70's in the states. The music is socially revolutionary in a very real sense. Buy it and see!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Effort!","review":"When you look at the girls of t.A.T.u., you can't help but wonder if these girls are really lesbians or just two variables behind a music marketing scheme. All questions are answered with their debut album, \\"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane,\\" where listeners are taken into their world.The strongest tracks on the album are \\"All the Things She Said\\" (which hints to girl-girl relationships), \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" (an amazing cover of the Smiths' classic), and \\"30 Minutes\\" (a hautingly track of hopelessness and confusion).This album is truly of rare talent. A defenite must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD; i enjoyed mostly all the songs","review":"Normally this style of music gets annoying to me after a few minutes. However, I found that I could listen to song after song and I really enjoyed them. Even the songs that are not completely in English I was digging because they had upbeat, cool sounding music and the chorus was catchy even though I didn't know what it meant. Most CD's I have bought recently like Britney and Christina only have a couple of good songs and the rest of the CD I don't bother to listen to. But with this CD you get about 8 very good songs and the other songs r pretty ok too. I give this CD praise!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it...","review":"Wow...finally the United States is playing music that has been around for a very long time and is very popular in Europe and most of the World. Industrial electronic EBM music has been around for quite some time from the likes Covenant, :Wumpscut:, VNV Nation just to name a few. It's a shame that Madonna's fans know more about EBM than American fans that have TRL stuffed downed their throat everyday. The music industry in America stinks and should realize that there is better music out there that dosn't revolve around the Inquirer's front page and who is dating who. Who cares music is supposed to be music and these girls are at least out there now and hopefully more bands and singles will creep from the wood works to shake American \\"music\\" as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"t.A.T.u.~Open Love","review":"Although many people don't agree with their video or lyrics, t.A.T.u. speaks to many of us positively. Their lyrics show all the sides of love for all people, not just lesbians. They took the United States by storm with their unique sound, a mix of pop and techno. This was just what the pop scene needed, a refreshingly new sound. Fans of Daft Punk and Moby will share an interest with those who like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. t.A.T.u. unites these two completely different tastes in just one album. I highly recommend the purchase of this album if you're into airy, angelic vocals and dance worthy beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"po russkiy, dazhe *s*","review":"the funny thing about this album is most of the stuff IS them covering their own songs, albeit in english. i was studying russian in school, and a friend of mine pointed out their album to me (which is now in my computer, in russian *nods*). although their translations aren't anywhere near accurate, it doesn't matter, because the extra base and synth lines in the american versions are extra rocking *g*"},{"rating":"2","title":"200 KM/H In the Wrong Lane---What a Rush!","review":"T.A.T.U's debut album \\"In the Wrong Lane\\", is a no -holds barred, knock-out, inspiring experience. These girls really let their vocal range rip and let their lyrics set them free! The Russian Dou are slowly making quite a name for themselves here in the U.S. with their unique pop-rock style. The CD features a sample of the Smith's Lonely boy-anthem -\\"How Soon is Now\\". The first single, \\"All the Things she Said\\" is playful and empowering - have you seen the video - very cool! With this CD we uncover the remodeled version of pop...everyone should check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a hot CD","review":"I'll try my best not to be drone. The CD comprised of a series of rock songs and a couple of ballads offers listeners a variety of listening.Aimed more for the younger crowd with songs like \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and \\"All The Things She Said\\" offering GREAT driving beats, and \\"Stars\\" having a more mellow tempo the CD has a great listening selection. The CD also offers 2 songs in untranslated Russian, those being \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\" and \\"Ya Shlos U Ma Ya.\\" If you are into the rock scene this is a great CD choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !!!

Their manager is their mouthpiece, as they don't really speak english. How convenient for him, I suppose. At least he's honest, though, because he comes right out to tell you that TATU was created as a product, the theme being underage sex. No really, their manager was brazen enough to say it. Now, as to the music, it's so-so. But the whole lesbian act is just that. They don't smooch or cuddle off-camera. They're just two underage girls being paraded around in wet t-shirts and school-girl uniforms. If you want to pay for that, go ahead, but usually it gets you arrested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick! Bring me a bag to barf in!","review":"If they really want so much attention why don't they just go jump off a cliff? Britney Spears already did the school-girl act, but now, making out? Who wants to watch two lesbian girls make out in the rain? Everytime I see the video I want a bag to barf in! Now, I'm not saying anything bad about lesbians, but, this is too much! The first time I saw them on MTV I thought, \\"Oh look, new singers\\". Then --- I saw the video. I went online to read about the interview with MTV and they said \\"We aren't lesbians we just love eachother\\". Ok, alright....so why are they making out?!

Really. Little kids too. They were 12 when they shot it. It's one thing to use sexuality in your music to express yourself. But having them making out in the rain is utterly disgusting.But, on the MUSIC. They need to learn English. Again. They should come back when they've matured their creativity, image, and style. They sound pretty good in their russian tracks, but man, do they have to be the ultimate high-production-no substance-group to sell? Yes and NoYes, cause they haven't developed as musicians, and need to find a better company to deal with.No, cause they have potential, but must find it themselves. They shouldn't have to make out in a rain-storm to get publicity. The album leaves a bad taste in the listeners mouth, and they need to wipe it away. After they become true musicians, that is.I don't blame the duo. They aren't true musicians, and shouldn't be judged as musicians.But for Heaven's sake, what a [strange] producer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trevor Horn + Teenage Europop Lesbians = Powerful Pop!","review":"As he did with Propaganda oh-so-many years ago, Trevor Horn proves that Europop synthesisers and an interesting female accent make for a potent pop combination.

But I didnt find out until I saw the music video. Its not your typical teen cheesy type of music. True, it is somewhat pop-sounding, but its original. The album is wonderful. Their voices are beautiful. You just have to be in the mood to accept something new, or at least give it a chance. Its a great deal for the price, as well. Its a great CD, its enhanced and it doesnt cost much. So you should stop being cheap and buy it ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"200 Km/H in the AWESOME MUSIC Lane","review":"t.A.T.u. is a very unique duo. Their voices are different from the rest of the music today and that is great. Lena and Julia (the girls of t.A.T.u.) are truly talented and are not just studio creations. The first U.S. released single \\"All The Things She Said\\" is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs including \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and \\"Clowns\\" shows their unique voices.

I think that just about anyone can listen to this album and be completely satisfied.Not to mention the fact that there is Russian on it too. Emagine how many people out there, actually know russian? And how many of T.a.t.u's fans are out there learning the words to they're russian songs? Tons, which says something. The album is great from the first song to the last.

For a bonus, Yulia Volkova (The Noisy One) could cover \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again!\\" ;-)It's a shame the act is self-destructing. Under better management, and more jovial songs to balance out the \\"I'd DIE without you!\\" theme off the album, they could have been a cooler version of the Village People. They'd have been the toast of the club circuit! Unfortunately, their manager was an eejit.Now if I was managing that act, I'd have them do a disco-opera about Original Gangsta Lesbian Poetess Sappho!

The songs totally reflect the big work the traslators have done to change the language of the can't-be-deeper lyrics from Russian to English. This is totally worth buying.

Sure, they may have the screechy voices which can be made to sound better with some enhancement of the computer (Examples: check out \\"Malchik Gay\\" (a very wimpy song) and the video \\"All the Things She Said\\" (the lyrics go before their mouth are running). Just like puppets, there's someone behind them controlling every movement. Everything is previously set up in this album without any effort from themselves. Another trend, similar to those boy/girl bands. First making to the top then falling to the bottom. Can they really survive without the gimmicks? Where will they be in five years?

I love the scene with Bilbo and Gollum and I think this Gollum with his appearance and voice charaterization is the definitive Gollum. I wish Rankin Bass would have done all 4 books instead of just 1 and 4. Sure they are simplified, but they are far better than the aborted version of Lord of the Rings done by Bakshi."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most entertaining Cartoon Movies ever.","review":"a Hobbit goes in search of treasure from the evil dragon smaug. i know it may be a bad adapation of the Book but it still is very awesome and never a dull moment exciting. for those who love The Last Unicorn, Oliver and Company, Dark Crystal and Neverending Story then this Movie is for you. i would also Recommend similar Movies: \\" Return to Oz\\", \\" Princess Mononoke\\", \\" My neighbor Totoro\\", \\" Transformers: The Movie\\" and \\" Watership Down\\". and this Movie is also another of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't they just give us the original movie?","review":"There's lot's of problems with this DVD. First of all, they've added some kind of bloom effect that makes everything look glowy. I assume this was to make look new and shiny but it also makes everything look especially dark. You can hardly see the Riddles in the Dark scene because it's so dark!Then there are random edits throughout the entire movie. At the very beginning, the video stops and the frame literally spins around the screen. Why? And there's tons of skips and cuts and audio missing throughout the rest of the movie. Why did they find it necessary to add this stuff? It's like they didn't even watch it and realize how bad it is before they released it. It sucks too because this is the only DVD version I can find that isn't 99 bucks. You're better off finding a download or VHS copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful movie, but do not buy this DVD","review":"This movie is one of my favorites and I was ecstatic to find it on DVD. I was so excited, I bought it despite the negative reviews citing terrible image quality and missing audio. Unfortunately, all of the negative reviews are true. This DVD is unwatchable. Entire scenes are too dark to see, almost all of the sound effects are missing, random sections loop, and certain lines of dialogue have been cut entirely. This beautiful and exceptional movie has been butchered. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, light-hearted version.","review":"A Rankin/BassTV animation version. Relatively true to the story, though omitted scenes or summarized them in order to fit a time slot. Do not expect gory realism from Rankin/Bass. It was done in a light tone/feeling. I believe it was aimed at younger children in that era. Still a good watch just as are some of the Bass/Rankin Christmas shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This DVD is a cheap copy of a great film. I bought this DVD thinking it was a remastered copy of the original, and I was greatly disappointed.

If you want a good copy of this movie, make sure to buy the one with the WB logo on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"frodo","review":"my great grandchildren are just discovering these movies.. to us they are the classic j.r. tolkin tales and the music is great much better than the new movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"The film left out significant characters","review":"I noticed in this film that my favorite character Beourn was sadly left out.

The author is certainly entitled to his own interpretation, but unless it's a vaguely entertaining one I really wish he wouldn't try to foist it off on others.

The quality is surprisingly good for a transfer and the story is still just as effective. I personally prefer this series to the 'real' ones made recently.

I remember watching this movie when I was little, and I enjoyed it quite alot. My children also enjoyed it.

The sound and video quality are sub-par. There are moments where awkward video transitions are inserted as if there were cuts in the available print and in places the scene skips or repeats itself for a second. I would not recommend this to anyone.

That's probably the onyl reason I like it. The music is hilariously funny, since there's a guy in a wobbly voice singing a twisted up version of \\"Roads go Ever On.\\" The lines are so lame it's laughable. An old family quote of ours is \\"Eggs and bacon...my garden at twilight...a pocket handkerchief...\\"Though the movie is pretty lame, its worth taking a peek. If Peter Jackson ever decides to take a stab at \\"The Hobbit,\\" it will be the ultimate lame movie. Fortunately, I don't think he will since \\"The Hobbit\\" is so much lighter than LOTR.I like it, and I might recommend it, but its not a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticks to the plot, but horribly adapted, with worse music","review":"Put quite simply- this adaption does not even come close to feeling like something from Tolkien. I'll admit, the animation isn't bad (although not really what I pictured when I first read the Hobbit), but if the creators felt they had to dumb down the dialouge as much as they did to appeal to a younger audience then they shouldn't have even bothered, and just let the book speak for itself. I can see where a five or six year old would enjoy this, and if it gets them into Tolkien, all the better I guess. But for anyone looking for a deep, faithful adaption of even the most simple book concerning Middle Earth- AVOID THIS MOVIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobbit: Animated (dvd)","review":"I was looking forward to watching this animated version, as i havent read the book. I was expecting it to be like the original Lord Of The Rings animated classic... but was dissapointed by a few things. Firstly the animation is aimed at younger children of about 2-5 years old. The songs are really really annoying & too american style, as well as american accents which, i feel spoil it. The atmosphere is great & the backdrops wonderfull. As well as some really beautifull effects....The main thing i hate is that Golem looks more like a frog than how he is supposed to look.It great to see The Hobbit on dvd, but i prefer to watch it with the sound OFF.Why didnt they just make this & \\"the return of the king\\" amimation, the same as the original? or mabe just tweak it slightly here & there?visualy impressive, but a sonic failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmares","review":"I saw this when I was a kid and after seeing the NEW LOTR...found a renewed interest in The Hobbit. So re-rented it and immediately wished I hadn't. No, I haven't read the books yet, but I intend to. However, that doesn't excuse how gross this cartoon is. As a child it scared the (insert expletive here) outta me and today it still does. The only interesting character is our heroic wizard and sometimes I wished that he'd just zap Baggins right off the screen for good. The film really didn't delve into any depths the book, I believe, touches on...and I was left with questions...lots-o-them. So, I guess for real entertainment I should read the trilogy from Tolkien, ... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The one word that sums this movie up is dreadful. I love the story, but the little Nazi-style elves sprouting leaves are just one example of how this interpretation went wrong. With only one exception (The Return of the King, also by Rankin -Bass) it is it is the worst adaptation of Tolkien's works that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why \\"dumb down\\" a children's story?","review":"People have written reviews here that suggest that this movie should be viewed as a movie for \\"kids\\" and should take it's departure from the book with a grain of salt. However, JRR Tolkien initially wrote this novel for children, and NOT for mature adults. (That came later with The Lord of the Rings.)So why in the world would you take a story that was ORIGINALLY written for children and further \\"adapt\\" it for children again? Are they \\"adapting\\" for dumber children? I think Tolkien had a good idea of what children enjoy; Rankin/Bass' production, however, is just another example of what adults THINK children want to see. I would not recommend this for all but the very smallest of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaiting a Theatrical Release","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful cartoon epic based on J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 classic. For a film that was made in 1977, a time when the quality of animation was already in sharp decline, the artwork and scenes are quite superb.Though I would like to have seen more than just 78 minutes portrayed on the screen, this version, nonetheless, is a good series of highlights from the story, itself. Also noteworthy is that the transition from one scene to the next was done in such a way that the characters, both individually and as a group, were easy to identify and remember.If you are looking for good-quality entertainment for nearly all ages, The Hobbit is highly recommended. For the audiophiles out there, there is neither Dolby nor DTS stereo surround sound, for the release is presented only in mono. Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"fond memory","review":"I first saw this movie on TV in 1978. It introduced me to the Hobbit and led me to read the book and all the Tolkein series. Orson Bean does a fine job as plump, placid Bilbo who would've spent his whole life in the Shire if he hadn't met some dwaves and a wizard. Gollum is still scary and repulsive after all these years. Yes, the film leaves some things out but this is a children's movie afterall. This is a good way to introduce your kids to Tolkein."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF..","review":"a great way to make kids familiar with some of the greatest books ever written, in fact me being 14years old read the book after watching the hobbit animated film,another great way to turn kids towards books"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"horribel its a copy of the origanal and it is so dark that you can hardly see ant thing that is going on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor print of a wonderful film","review":"My review is for issues with the DVD print, not the actual movie. In fact, I love this version of \\"The Hobbit\\" and watched it multiple times as a child. I purchased this DVD to refresh my memory of the movie and compare it to the book before seeing Peter Jackson's live-action version of the story. The story and animation hold up, but the print is ATROCIOUS. As other reviewers have stated: the print is too dark, the sound mix is terrible, and the picture jitters and skips. This print is nearly unwatchable, and that is such a pity because this film really is a classic and deserves better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad recording","review":"I was very disappointed in this recorded version of the classic animated Hobbit. It was poorly recorded.. it skipped in several places, even cut out some of the Dialog and lyric from the Bard singing. Or it would repeat itself like a scratch on a record player would or a scratch on a Music CD. Which is very strange for a DVD that is BRAND NEW and w/o a mark on it's playing surface. Plus the dark scenes (which was most of the movie) was so dark you couldn't see anything.I would be better off finding me a VHS player and watching mu VHS copy.. or find a place that would be willing to tranfer it to DVD format.DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. Don't waist your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality!","review":"This movie was cheaply converted to dvd. The colors are too dark and it skips a couple times.

This version is choppy, with random bits skipping parts of dialogue and on loop. The worst part of this DVD is the coloring, which is horrible. The contrast is FAR too dark and this causes the scenes to become lost and, more often than not, you end up watching a pitch black screen and wondering if it's your computer or DVD player. It ISN'T.

The problem is that the characters are freakishly non-human looking (not that kids would mind, i liked it then). Also, this movie was made in the 1970's and they haven't made any effort to fix up the old film, so it looks like a bootleg; seriously! JUST BEWARE QUALITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok...Lots of key parts left out of the film","review":"I agree with the fact that it is great for kids. I liked it overall, but there were a lot of mistakes. The most blatent of all was at the end of the number of dwarves that dies in the book as different in the film.

It was loyal to the story, but that's not enough to save this lousuy movie. Hey, is it just me, but when the dwarf was telling his death wish thing, I coulldn't understand him because the background music was so loud. And the lighting sound effects was done by some guy.

So when I saw they had an unedited version of this wonderful childhood memory I bought it up. After all, it seems many of the other versions have many flaws.Well, so did this one. It seems to be heavily edited, sometimes in the middle of a song. Also, it seems very dark, as if they used a bad version of a overused VHS tape. There even seems to be commercial breaks - you know where it goes black and then they repeat the last scene before the TV ad. Of course it could be that I just have a bad DVD but it seemed to be more edited choices than DVD problems.The end result makes me want to search for my old VHS tape or even go buy another. Why screw up such a classic? How hard was it to find a good, clean copy and to copy it on some good DVDs? Unedited? UNEDITED? Liars! LIES! This is a horrible, butchered version of The Hobbit.Do not get unless you can find a DVD that is truly unedited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drained of emotion","review":"As many have said, this version of the film is inferior to it's earlier incarnations. I've watched this film on TV and VHS since I was a child. I've loved it ever since and never got tired of it.I was SO disappointed in the Warner's DVD release. Half the music is subdued. And worse, half the sound effects are missing. The clanging of swords. The screech of the Eagles. The sound of Sting slicing up Spiders. The sound of Glamdring cutting down Goblins. Many more. All gone. They even cut bits of dialog. At one point, Bilbo looks like he's just talking to himself because the off camera dialog is gone.The movie has been rendered dead and lacks of emotion. I hope they correct this with a future release. H3ll, if nothing else, they could just get the Laser disc (remember those? *heh-heh*) and rip the soundtrack from that. Anything is better than this, Warner. You're an old company.

I have always had this movie in my collection and know the lines by heart. I have bought this DVD and the DVD stinks! Warner Brothers ruined this story on DVD. How? The sound was re-mastered for the DVD and there are sound effects MISSING! They used an old copy of the soundtrack that was used on a four record set that issued in 1978. If you want the complete soundtrack I recomend you buy the VHS tape. (The older the copy the better) They have also added new sound effects and lines that are NOT in the the original soundtrack! There are also problems with their DVD's of The Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King.

Unfortunately, if you want to experience this movie for yourself you will be better off buying the VHS version. The sound dubbing in the DVD version is inexcusable. There are portions where all of the background sound is missing entirely. The most notable points are during the spider attack in Mirkwood, and inside of Smaug's cave, although after watching this several times I realized that the sound problem was endemic. It made me think that the DVD was cut with a first draft of the sound recording instead of the final draft.Do not buy this DVD! You will be disappointed, especially if you grew up watching this on TV as a kid (as I did). Buy the VHS tape instead.WB (or whoever produced this DVD) should be ashamed. I personally think they should be flogged as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful movie, flawed DVD","review":"While the picture quality excells, several audio tracks are inexplicably missing. I even dug out my VHS copy and compared the two, and sure enough, there are several places in which there are missing sound effects!

The wonderful features of Tolkein's Middle-Earth are done no justice in this loathesome and pathetic excuse for an anime (Japanese style) TV movie. For instance, the worst change, in my opinion, is the change of the Wood-Elves. According to Tolkein, the Wood-Elves are graceful, peaceful, and quite beautiful, although they are somewhat prejudiced against the Dwarves. This sad film shows the Wood-Elves as ugly and war-hungry goblin-like creatures who walk with their bottoms sticking out.

High definition just exaggerates the poor quality. I wanted to love it, but that really got in the way of the overall enjoyment. The kids didn't really care too much though. The story is still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete veriosn of this classic cartoon movie","review":"First the picture quality id terrible & it's missing a good portion of the sound effects. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. You would do better finding the old vhs tape from the 1980s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I do not agree that this DVD is the original \\"unedited\\" animated classic of The Hobbit. I have the original on VHS and it has better quality then this DVD. The sound skipped and some of the sound side effects were missing. Also things were added or changed. It's annoying and not worth buying. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to the wonderful VHS original classic, this is a dim, hollow Dvd version","review":"Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed by the lack of sound quality.The Story is basically the same and therefore still wonderful and enobling,but try to find an original version, rather than this DVD remastered.This one isn't worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"this is painful to look at-avoid it like the plague-it has not much to do with the Book of the same title,except in some plot details"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give us live-action!","review":"I know there are legal issues with making a live-action version of The Hobbit, but in the name of all that is good about Tolkien, let it be done so I can stop showing this version to my students after we read the novel! The songs are grating, the animation is poor (especially the Battle of Five Armies), and leaving out Beorn is just plain unforgivable! I've actually had students say they would've preferred doing some other English work than being subjected to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobbit is scary","review":"The Hobbit, in my opinion, is the scariest children's movie of all time. All of the dwarves are incredibly frightening and look very similar to the stereotypical alien depiction....big eyes and over sized facial features. The music also adds to the terror, once you hear the tantric chanting. The goblins are also horrific beasts. I'm 18 years old and this is the scariest thing I have ever been a witness too. I strongly recommend not showing this to any young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Book","review":"While it is difficult to transpose succesfully most books to film, this version fails completely on at least three counts. First, this rendition fails to capture the richness of Tolkien's images a with the use of 2-D animation and pale, washed out colors.Second, the interjection of songs that are sophomoric belies the scope of the potnetial audience and misses the essence of the characters.Third, stick to the story, why do movies change the plot whether it be Dune or Harry Potter?Separelty, The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, someime published in three volumes. The Hobit was written in 1937. Giving into a desire for more information about hobbits The Lord of the Rings was written in inervals between 1936 to 1949.Read the book, it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me.","review":"I'll save you the money. But if you like completely horrible interpretations, give a listen to the tune, \\"Frodo of the Nine Fingers\\" and hear some hack vibrate through one of the worst ideas for a song in at least a century."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a fan of the LOTR movies but this is worth skipping","review":"I went to my grandmas house and she had rented this for us to watch i thought it would be cool that gollum was in it (since i LOVED gollum in LOTR) but i found this movie very disapointing.1. the animation is HORRIBLE2. i was very disapointed with gollum he looked like a frog and a horse mixed together and his voice i couldn't even understand3. sometimes it was hard to understand the charactersi found myself wanting to shut this movie off i would have if i were all on my own. Save your money for LOTR it is worth seeing not this. I found it hard to follow who was who. So rent/buy lord of the rings it will be way better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary as Heck","review":"Never before has such an evil, creepy film crossed my path. Years of psychological treatment have not undone the scarring caused by this movie. I first encountered this movie with its terrifying musical numbers and frightening characters at the tender age of 11 and I still suffer the repercussions of it. I do NOT recommend this film to anyone under the age of 17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a children's film","review":"I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 5 years old. I am 21 now, and seeing this movie even today makes me feel great anxiety. I think this film may be a little too frightening for young children--after all, some scary creature is trying to kill our heroes at every turn. I would hate for any young child to believe any world, even a mythical one, could ever be as scary as Bilbo's! While I believe this is a good video for older children, instead I recommend they read the book when they are a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD COPY of a Great Movie","review":"This is a terrible copy of a good movie. The film is dark in scenes making some of it unwatchable. Some scenes are cut together in imovie or something. Also (as mentioned in another review) some sound effects are missing. The Rankin Bass cartoon is great but this is a pirated disc or copy of a torrented file. THIS IS A BAD BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is great, DVD picture and sound quality are poor","review":"Grew up with this movie, but unfortunately this particular DVD was poorly mastered. As others have mentioned, many scenes are so dark you can see nothing, the sound is poor such that you can barely understand most characters and, at least playing through my XBox, there seemed to be a compression issue because the video became pixelated very frequently.Nevertheless, it is worth getting for $10 just to have it in your collection since the art, narration and music are all super. If you have a VHS player, that might be a better way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"This is the worst picture quality on a dvd I have ever seen! Any night or dark scene, like the scene in Golem's cave, is too dark to make out anything. I wish I could have waited for the inevitable release to go along side the new movie's blu ray/dvd release. Terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning-this is taped @ SLP and is a multi-generation copy.","review":"Do not buy this version - get the Warner Brothers version instead.This version, from Movies on Parade, is not worth buying. The production value is extremely low. The recording is of a very poor quality and portions are inaudible (particularly the critical riddle game with Gollum). At times the video 'skips' and it looks like it was taped on a machine that needed the heads cleaned.What a shame, as this is a otherwise a reasonable atttempt to take Tolkien's story and put it on the screen, remembering that it was done with 1970's technology and for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Animation from 1977, this is top notch","review":"This is obviously just an opinion, but I think that anyone who feels the urge to give this feature 1 star or less is just a biased Tolkien fan that will never be happy with any representation of his work. That said, Rankin and Bass pull off a great adaptation, with great vocal casting and solid realization of Middle Earth. I grew up watching this cartoon, and while it scared me a bit, it really captured my imagination, and got me interested in Tolkien's work. I can't wait for the movies 2001"},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound is horrible","review":"This is a decent adaptation of my favorite book ever, however the sound got horribly edited for some reason. The best example is when the dragon Smaug is flying around, screaming, breathing fire, wreaking havoc...and all you hear is utter silence. Many times the mere background music overpowers the dialogue and some lines were cut making some scenes not make any sense (the escape in the barrels for example). The special features aren't worth mentioning, the characters on the front cover don't resemble how the appear in the film, the summary pretty much says The Hobbit is the first part in The Lord of the Rings trilogy (which is blatantly incorrect), and the case is so cheap it might as well have been an envelope. I'm returning my copy and I'd suggest that if you want to see this movie then dig in the closet and pull the old Beta version out cause you'll have a better experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie ever","review":"This movie is a laugh riot. Just one joke after another. I still stagger over to my roommate Andrea and giggle \\"my precious\\" or \\"Dear Lord what is that horrid hobbit doing to the goblin\\". We can't stop laughing over the lines in this movie, in which each one is funnier than the last. Gandalf should open a comedy club."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was an attempt...at most","review":"Ok I have read the book several times, and enjoy it. Tolkien is great. This movie is not. The plot jumps from adventure to adventure giving no time at all for anything to be enjoyed. What is with the American voices! Gandalf isn't from Alabama! The soundtrack is alright. But I can't believe that they put in that song where the goblins are chasing them with that awful 70's rock drum beat. This movie is only worth it for little kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the book again: the pictures and music are better","review":"Awful. Shabby animation, horrid music (the other reviewers impugn hippies by alleging the music is somehow \\"hippie-ish\\").The story is cut to pieces and the \\"acting\\" is elementary school quality. It's obviously edited to be shown as a TV series (read: commercial schlock).It's a great story, totally trivialized by this crummy production. Avoid at all costs. The single star is the least I can give."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for the whole family","review":"This video representation of the hobbit is excellent. I am playing Gollum in my school play, and the move keeps up wonderfully with the original diologue. The whole family can enjoy this movie whether they are familiar with the book or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbit Cool","review":"This is a great animated feature that I think very well portrays the story of \\"The Hobbit\\", and it's magical lands and people. Some of it, me thinks, was a little cheap at times, but I love it. (especially Bilbo's song, 'The Greatest Adventure')"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real good classic about how the good guy uses his brains","review":"To anyone who likes a good cartoon classic this would be one of them. Practically a Ralph Bakshi type movie only without the rated R contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??","review":"Based on another review, I have to agree that the sound to this DVD is terrible! MANY sounds are missing! And I thought I just had a bad transfer. Why did Warner Brothers do that? I do love this movie, but the little details of sound that are missing does destroy the integrity of the movie as I remember it as a kid. You may want to just keep you VHS copies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite movies, but...","review":"I loved this movie as a child. I watched it easily over 100 times on the VHS copy. The problem I have is the quality of the DVD itself. The DVD goes unnaturally dark during the night scenes causing all the detail to be removed from the movie. Since there are a lot of scenes where the movie takes place at night/in the dark about a good 50% is almost ruined.Otherwise I love the story and the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg, terrible picture","review":"This is a terrible transfer. Definitely not a legit DVD, some kind of bootleg. Dark scenes are almost unwatchable, and there is some skipping and stuttering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The DVD quality was poor. A lot of the scenes were too dark to see and the scenes would skip brief moments of the movie or replay moments of the movie. Overall it was a very poorly produced DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a replacement","review":"I bought this movie to replace my VHS copy of it which I had watched to the point of no return. This copy isn't really worth it. If I had known that Warner Bros. had actually produced a DVD version (which they do, it's about $20), I would have boughten that instead. Honestly, the sound effects on this thing are lost which is really annoying when you're expecting them to happen. I wouldn't buy this copy of it. What I'm waiting for is when Warner Bros. releases a collection of all the cartoon Lord of the Rings series as a whole. That would be much more enjoyable as long as they are correct and the way they should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragically disappointing","review":"I can see I'm not the only one. What the heck happened here? The visual quality of one my favorite childhood movies is pathetic. The picture is so dark that most of the movie is unwatchable. I found myself not even looking at the screen, but merely listening to the dialog and shaking my head in sorrow at the ruined treasure.More, when the action gets busy, like when fire is swirling around, the picture is pixelated.Third, I counted at least four times where the content skipped or repeated. There are no scratches on the disk, and these instances did not occur during the \\"commercial break\\" parts. Gandalf's line about Mirkwood was cut off midway through his sentence, the content mysterious gone, and Bard's welcoming the dwarves to Laketown repeated twice. It's like an incompetent rip-job off YouTube.This is the lousiest conversion to DVD I have ever encountered, and it makes me so upset that anyone would put out something of this quality and expect money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies on Parade VHS - terrible","review":"This is a wonderful animated movie in its original form. This particular product (the \\"Movies on Parade\\" VHS version from [...]) is terrible with poor audio and video through-out - very dark and garbled in sections. I missed the other reviews about this specific product and would not have wasted the money on it.I wish that AMAZON would sub-group reviews by actual product (not the movie, but the actual tape or DVD by a particular company) or allow a dual rating system - one for the movie and one for the media product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE VHS VERSION!!!","review":"Buyer beware! I bought this under the assumption that it would be the original VHS version with the original soundtrack. The cassette I purchased was not. The case looks professional, but the label on the cassette was a home-printed Avery label. This didn't inspire confidence. Upon actually watching the movie, I first noticed that there was no intro. After about 1.5 seconds of black, the movie just started... Highly unusual for a professionally done VHS. Throughout the film I also noticed a lack of sound effects that would be expected from the DVD, as well as many instances of skips and jitters. At the end, the credits rolled and then a screen came up that said \\"JWIN DVD VIDEO\\" with a little \\"play\\" arrow in the upper corner, etc. The copy that I received was just the DVD copied over to VHS. Keep a sharp eye out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies on Parade Version.","review":"I can't speak for the other version that Amazon is going to group this review in with but don't buy the one with the Orange banner on the top that reads Movies on Parade. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The pictures varies widely from too dark to see anything to washed out bright. The sound is just as bad. It looks like someone put a videophone on a tripod. Watched a decent recorded a decent version of the movie and then made a DVD of the recording from their phone. It is pretty much unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"That's more or less what this is. The picture was so bad my eyes were straining to see it, especially during the dark parts, which take up a huge chunk of the movie. No matter what picture adjustments I tried, nothing helped. Also there were places that were overlayed and there were even small pieces of scenes that were missing. The characters would be in the middle of speaking and suddenly it would jump forward a few seconds, and I know for a feact it wasn't the disc just skipping. Sad to say, I'm planning on returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"This is not the version I remember as a kid, because some of the awesome sound effects are missing (wailing spiders, anyone?). However, that wasn't my problem as I was expecting this. What I wasn't expecting was the terrible quality of the dvd itself. It was fuzzy, WAY too dark, and the sound skipped around at least a half a dozen times. I reccomend buying the version with Bilbo and Gandalf over a blue background on the cover (I bought that one last year for my Godson). It still doesn't have the awesome sound effects that the VHS had, but at least its good quality!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There really needs to be a better DVD transfer than this one","review":"I'm a huge fan of this old Rankin Bass production. It takes a lot of shortcuts from the book and has a very different tone in places, but the designs are good and I even have a lot of fondness for the music, goofy as it can be.However, this DVD transfer is really poor. As others have said, it looks like it was just straight-up copied over from a rough VHS. There are skips and repeats, artifacts everywhere so that it looks like the lowest-res YouTube imaginable, and overall is too dark. It feels like you're watching a bootleg. I'm not entirely convinced it's a legitimate production, honestly, it's so sketchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage animated version of the first part of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy","review":"It is my understanding The Hobbit is the first published work of J.R.R.Tolkien-independent of the other two later parts of the Trilogy. The storyline is classic-a fairy-tale good vs evil. The music is folksy, the animation vintage, with voices provided by top-notch actors of the time. A charming version for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful transfer","review":"This is an awful transfer from the original source material to DVD. Most of the film is muddy or dark, the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum being the worst. The soundtrack has several errors including gaps of silence, skips and lines being repeated. The movie itself it great, but take my advice and spend the extra few dollars to get the official Warner Bros. release. This version isn't suitable for The Dollar Store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"I was so excited to get this dvd and share it with my son, as it was one of my favorites growing up. I was terribly disappointed in it when it came. The color quality is awful, the darker scenes, like Gollum's cave, are so faded out you can barely see it. The soundtrack is missing in places, the special effects (Smaug's fire, Sting's vortex sound, etc) are completely missing. They repeat themselves in places. Utterly let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a better copy!!!","review":"I looked this movie up and ordered this copy because it was cheaper. I waited with anticipation to see this film that I had enjoyed as a child. Fortunately, it arrived in two days, and I was thrilled. I immediately open the packaging and put it into the DVD player. And immediately I was let down.This copy is horrible. The transfer is terrrible. Some lines are cut short. While some lines are repeated. It is so dark that you can't see half of the movie no matter how much you adjust the brightness. I was very disappointed.Do yourself a favor and find a better copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies on parade bootleg?","review":"This DVD version was horrible! I vividly remember this being a brighter video. This DVD was so dark in the scene \\"riddles in the dark\\" you could only see Gollums mouth. Sting didn't even glow the video is so poor.

No stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad copy","review":"This movie is good, but this is a review of the copy.

The animation is incredibly well done for the decade in which the film was made. Middle-Earth looks so much like I had imagined it when reading the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The voice acting is superb, and the music is very fitting. They may have taken some liberty with the story, but for the most part the movie is very accurate to the book. Two of the most vivid scenes from the book, Biblo's confrontations with Gollum and Smaug, are elaborated upon in the film. The film also deeply plays upon the angle of the story about Bilbo's simple life as a Hobbit, and displays the messages Tolkien wished his readers to understand, in depth.This is probably the most accurate to-the-book film based upon The Hobbit. I recommend it to all Tolkien fans. This film will take you to Middle-Earth, There and Back Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version.

The company who did this, Movies on Parade, should be ashamed. I love this film and don't know why they tampered with it so much they made it unwatchable. This butchered version should not be sold or given away! This wonderful feature was ruined by an idiot ( or team of idiots ) that didn't know how to color correct or export, which is bad enough, but the spinning screen and page peel transitions were like an ungifted child doodling on a Picasso. The Warner Bros. distributed version looks a million times better but sound effects with the spiders, Smaug, and Battle of The Five Armies are missing; leaving long annoying gaps of silence. Maybe Warner Bros. will re-issue \\"The Exorcist\\" for kids without those scary sound effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Quality","review":"The quality of this DVD is terrible. Anything dark gets completely lost. This makes entire scenes, like the goblin lair and Gollum's cave unwatchable. And it looks like someone was experimenting with do-it-yourself DVD \\"special effects\\" in the beginning by having the picture randomly rotate 360 degrees and then have a cheesy page turn effect. The sound is not great either, unsurprisingly.Some will argue that this is the only one available now that the better version of the Hobbit DVD is out of print and ridiculously expensive on Amazon and Ebay. And some are willing to excuse this DVD's terrible quality because it was made when the format was brand new in the late 90's.But any and I mean ANY version is better than this.

I love the way that ESV puts things. I was very imressed with the cover. Great details. However, the print is too small for every day use in my opinion. I gave my copy to my mom, and she seems to really like it. So, if you're concerned about print size, check out the TruTone Personal Size Reference Bible. It is slightly larger and has bigger print without being bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, great Bible","review":"My regard for the ESV translation is very high. The rest of my review will be to this individual product. This is a simple bible, small in size, it has a nice leather feel too it, easy to read print because unlike trade Bibles, the paper is of high quality, so there is a crispness to the words. It is not a study Bible, it has very few references, if this is your first Bible purchase, I would recommend the ESV study Bible. This is a great size to throw in your bag, car, or pocket if you have cargo shorts like mine.Great quality, great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and eloquent","review":"I am really pleased with this Bible. The translation is great for personal study and the size is great to be carried in your pocket everywhere so you can read it as you walk or look up anything as it iterests during the day. The binding is holding well and shows no signs of wear. The leather cover is great as it has already saved it from some moisture, and it has a great smooth feel. The type is a bit small than other translations I have seen, but that isn't a problem. The ribbon page marker is designed well as it already has the crease in the top so it easily marks the page without haveing to work to get it so there is no crease in it in the middle to cause extra strain on the binding (a highlight I think). As all ESV Bibles, this has an eloquent touch on the font of the book titles and its presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful and Attractive, Too","review":"The ESV has established itself as a faithful translation of Holy Scripture. Originally published in the Classic Reference edition with abundant, helpful cross-references and an extensive concordance, this edition is a welcomed addition the present line-up of bindings. The print is dark and clear, the binding attractive, and the size convenient. All-in-all, a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily My Favorite Translation","review":"I am not a Biblical expert...just a believer in the Word of God. I have enjoyed the ESV translation since it came out in 2001, and now it has been released in a higher quality printing. Previously, there have been problems with the quality of the ESV printings and bindings. With the current deluxe version of the Classic Reference Bible, all those binding and printing problems seem to have been solved. Now I can read my ESV without worrying if the stitching will come loose or the glue on the binding will detatch!

Within the margins are dates for the readings to be done on each particular day. Each day has readings from the Old Testament, the New Testament, and Psalms. It is perfect because I began the new year with a plan to read the bible through this year. The only reason I'm not giving this bible 5 stars is because the font is rather small in my opinion.

I have both the hardback andgenuine leather editions. The hardback is very good andput togther quite well. The leather comes only in blackand looks and feels very nice. Crossway has done a betterjob with this edition of the ESV, but I would love to seeCambridge publish the ESV!The translation itself is excellent for study, preaching,teaching, and devotional reading. It is \\"literal\\", but notso much so that there is no literary style. The literarystyle is very much in the Tyndale/KJV tradition. This isdue to the fact that the ESV is a slight revision (6% I'mtold) of the RSV. The RSV still remains one of the besttranslations available, but needed some updating.I recommend the ESV Deluxe Reference Edition withoutreservation. Again, it is the best edition of the ESVin print and the ESV is a good translation for study ofthe Holy Scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESV- Highly Accurate and Readable Translation","review":"As a student learning Greek in College, I have been amazed as to the accuracy of this version. If I learn a new concept as to how the Greek is to be translated and I look it up in the ESV, it will be translated as the scholars have suggested it be translated. This accuracy however, does not sacrifice its readability. It's almost poetic flow makes reading it devotionally a complete joy! I would highly recommend it for serious scholars as well as the average church goer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great translation, not so great packaging","review":"After my dog literally ate my last Bible, I was looking for a replacement in the ESV (my favorite translation). When I came across this Bible, I thought \\"Great price, I'll take it!\\", but I should not have clicked on \\"buy now\\". The imitation leather feels terrible and the gold tipped pages also look cheap. If you are looking to give it as a gift, there is no presentation page, or place to mark down important family dates. If, on the other hand, you are looking for an inexpensive Bible that you can give away, this would be a good one to buy.

I have been impressed by all aspects of Crossway's publication: the cover design, the solid translation, the typeface. The ESV is a great new translastion in the formal tradition much like the NASB but without the wooden feel of the language.This particular edition is perfect! The outside cover is gorgeous, the construction is solid, the reference notes are easy to follow, and the whole thing is slim and trim. All of that pales to the fact that you are reading God's word though. Pick up a copy of this Bible and fall in love all over again!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bible","review":"Very, very nice attractive cover here. Beautiful colouring, and smooth to the touch. Binding glue-bound, but tight. Doesn't feel shoddy. I'm glad that Crossway is putting some of their nicely coloured covers into the larger sized Bibles.

It is wonderful. It fits in my pants or jacket pocket easily. The one downside is the ESV translation. While this translation is fairly word for word, it seems to go out of its way to be obtuse at certain points. I do not know if this translation will ever gather the following it is hoping for.

I was surprised to learn that it is an available option AFTER we bought the receiver. It's such an important accessory, that one would think the Yamaha marketing folks would have included it in the point of sale materials. Go figure.Anyway, it is simple to install and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an IPOD.Playing music from the IPOD is certainly easier than selecting CD's to play and then inserting them into a CD changer.Now that we have the IPOD dock, we may no longer need to have a multi-CD /DVD player. When it comes time to upgrade to a Blue-ray, we may only need the single CD/DVD player which will $ave a few shekels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall I'm satisfied","review":"I echo the other reviewers' thoughts for the most part. I'm very pleased with the sound quality, especially compared to listening to my iPod through a cassette adapter in my car. Since I notice missing portions of music resulting from compression, and since I have high-quality home speakers, I was relieved to hear the good (but not audiophile) sound quality.In addition to the other reviewers' tips on getting video to work, I'd like to offer my own. Since my DVR is directly connected to my TV via component video cable, I had no video cable connecting my receiver to the TV. Thus I hooked up a spare yellow-tipped composite cable from the Monitor Out jack on the receiver to a \\"video in\\" jack on the TV and got video.

This book, first published in Britain, reminds me why British fantasy remains among the best.In \\"Lady in Gil\\" Rebecca Bradley has managed to take that classic fantasy plot of the reluctant hero, and turn it in to something that is uniquely and wholly her own.From the first, the reader suspects that the scholarly and hopelessly unathletic Tigrallef will make a far better hero than his musclebound and unimaginative brother. The wonder of the story is in how Tigrallef achieves this transformation, as the author turns familiar cliches on their head, culminating in Tigrallef being transformed into something that even he did not expect-- a genuine hero, who achieves success for his people, but at a terrible cost to himself.Here's hoping that Ace will soon release the sequel in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple nice story","review":"Fantasy novels come with varying degrees of complexity. Plot, magic systems, characters, and character interaction with other characters.Lady in Gil is simple. This isn't a Jordan/Goodkind delving in layers of intrique and plot that leaves the casual reader's head swimming/drowning and it isn't a boring one layer book with overly predictable events.The author keeps to her story, there isn't any meandering on tangent plots, and the story is nice...with a goal that is reached by the end of the book with only small loose ends to draw you into the next book in the series.Personally I like more depth in my reading, but I don't mind a good simple story now and again.

My friends and I purchased a few of these to put in our cars because we do long road trips, and it's nice to get information and communicate without cell service. I cannot comment on the range because just putting the antenna in the trunk is sufficient for what we do (a couple miles distance between cars at most - usually several hundred feet). I can hear truckers many miles away, but I haven't checked to see if they can hear me.The unit itself mounts easily on the dash of your car. I was a bit surprised at how thick and weighty the handset itself is. It's kind of nice to have something solid, so I am happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This CB radio is excellent!!!

Used in Jeep for off road activity, car for easy communication while traveling with others. Motorhome while caravaning in a group. Car to motorhome is a great tool while husband is parking the motorhome in a camp site, I can guide him with the cb in the car. A good antenna is necessary for clear reception.

The controls are easy to use and see.I connected an external speaker, the connector box has a plug for it. the speaker is in the mic, so it needs to be adjusted depending on whether or not you holding it close or have it stowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"cobra 75wxst","review":"this is a great product that takes up much less room and works well. i would definitely buy this product again if needed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Compact CB For A Small Vehicle","review":"Jeep Wranglers have limited space so this CB was an easy choice. I've owned full sized Cobra CB's installed in full sized pick-ups and they never let me down & always performed better than I expected. This little Cobra 75WXST compact model also performs exactly as advertised. It scans, receives weather broadcasts & installation was easy. The tiny speaker is functional but with windows open on a noisy highway, hearing can be difficult ... but it has an audio out mini-jack so it can easily be connected to a radio that has an audio input mini-jack. This is a great accessory for emergency, off-road or just listening to & chatting with other drivers on the road.

I put jacks in three cars so I could easily move it from car to car. The thing worked nice, though the control dials are awkward. The squelch dial on mine was nearly impossible to turn but I put that up to the usual lack of quality control in China.Happily I talked for three weeks. Then it stopped. No audio output.The speaker went dead. Chinese garbage.So after several ignored email's I'm sending the trash back to Cobra with a receipt and a letter and we'll see if they make good on their warranty. Maybe the next one will last a little longer.UPDATE: Cobra quickly put a new speaker in the unit and returned it. (They say they will not honor warranty issues on sets paid for with PayPal or bought through ebay) Problem is that in opening it, they broke the plastic nibs holding the case together. They glued it back together with black silicone -- quite befitting of it's junky Chinese heritage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"out of freq.","review":"i bought one of these .it worked fine for about 4 hours and all the sudden it went off of freq very scrachey sounding sending back asp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power from vehicle battery","review":"I was looking forward to using this product.

Overall once you get used to what function -is-where, it's easy and comfortable. With these newer compact CB radios SWR tuning is very important. Ive read where many people have difficulty after about one month--the older CB's had larger final transistors which were capable of handling more abuse- these newer ones have smaller, easier to burn out transistors and making sure your Whip and cables are tuned properly is an absolute must(if you want it to live a while). This unit will still talk if not tuned properly, however it wont last very long. I paired this up first with a cheapo $12.00 mobile antenna from Wal-mart and it talks > 2 miles (properly tuned) just fine. When I put a K40 on it- I got in excess of 5 miles,and I can pull in signal from > 8 miles down the road. If youre looking for a quality unit in a compact area, this one is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little radio...","review":"I'm using this in my Jeep for our off-roading trips. Installation was a breeze. Took me about thirty minutes. Sound is not great, especially at highway speeds, but since I bought it for trail use, not that big of a deal. And having everything in one, small unit makes securing it when I leave my Jeep even easier. Two thumbs up on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cobra 75WXST All-in-Handset Mobile 40-Channel CB Radio","review":"This product is simply wonderful if you are worried about security. I own a Jeep and having the ability to quickly disconnect this unit and store it my lockable console is truly a peace of mind type feeling. I haven't tuned the antenna yet so reception is a little bit messy but it picks up eveything from my runs with my club and transmits great. My hands are fairly large so gripping and using the handset is fairly easy but someone with small hands might have some problems with all of the buttons and dials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installed in 2004 Miata","review":"I use this CB in Miata road rallies.

I carry the knife on my tool belt and use it on rough odd jobs. It is very satisfactory for digging up grass burrs.

The design is very poor and apparantly not properly field tested before it was put on the market. The unit will get stuck (everytime) on the corner of the pool steps(and every pool has steps). It then sits in that position and grinds away at your pool finish and the unit itself. I haven't had mine for 6 months and the unit is worn down where it rubs against the steps. I must then be constantly be fishing the unit out of its stuck position. I have now resorted to lowering a stone-filled empty detergent bottle in that corner to try to get the unit to bypass the corner....ugly. P.S. it doesn't even pick up medium sized leaves, they all get stuck at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak fragrance","review":"The lemon citrus scent is weak compared to the other scents out there.

None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful.

This book talks about what it was like to grow up in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. I think that this book does a good job explaining the experiences of a family. Also it talks about what Piri Thomas does and what kind of problems he is involved with, like drugs, in gangs, and that's very similar of what is going on now. I think people who don't want to be in a real trouble should read this book.

The author gives the reader a realistic view into the world that was apart of his daily existance while growing up in Spanish Harlem. He also makes a self-realization about his ethnic identity and his addiction to drugs. He shares his thoughts about being involved in the criminal elements that seemed to be all around him. The author offers graphic images of his experiences in Spanish Harlem, that remains with the reader long after finishing the book. The author's family struggles and his disappointing moments are things that most kids today experience in their lives. I believe this book can serve as an inspiration to anyone who has felt they were an outsider while growing up in a tough neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visceral Horror Masterpiece....","review":"\\"Nutbag\\" left me speechless. This film is nasty,vicious,cruel,and very near unwatchable.That being said, it is one of the best horror films I have ever seen.The fact that it was shot on digital-video with a small budget is all the more remarkable.At last,a real horror film! I have not seen a movie this powerful since John McNaughton's Henry:Portrait of a serial killer.To watch this serial killer live out his doomed life is akin to the fear I had the first time I jumped out of a plane.The way the director designed his set pieces and set up the murder scenes was simply brilliant.The photography and the lighting was amazing for a movie shot on video.The entire film was just completely engrossing and at the same time utterly depressing.This is a must see for horror fans.Nutbag will offend to be sure,but you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it very much","review":"I have been a fan of his for many year's.

The flimsy metal tabs that record the number of each coin type wore out quickly, so the amount shown on the digital reader is worthless. After about six months the motor jammed, and I've been unable to use it since. They make a model without the digital counter, and I would recommend that one over this one.

He is a bit repetitive and production costs were kept to a minimum, but it serves his purpose well - to re-educate people. Great basic nutritonal primer.

The book should include a sample schedule or meal plan for feeding your dog but it doesn't. The author just provides some very broad feeding guidelines. Other than that, the very idea of feeding your dogs the way nature designed them to eat makes perfectly good sense to me. I first experimented with my own dog by giving him a raw chicken wing and my dog devoured it with relish!!! No hesitation there, as there was when I gave him cooked chicken.

This is an intensely rich work of art which uses the best screen language from cinematography through editing, score and sound to create a haunting love story quite unlike any other I've ever seen. It is almost mythic and therefore no actor stands out - it's all a seamless fabric of emotion and beauty.

The scenes are linked in a impressive way, so you can easily understand the plot.You are overwhelmed by the flood of pictures from world war II or how the Japanese people are treated.The cast is pretty good with actors like Ethan Hawke, Youki Kudoh, Reeve Carney.A must, for everyone, who love love-story's and exciting movies about prejudice segregation and ww II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling on a Suck Movie","review":"I don't normally turn off a movie until it's ended, but I couldn't stand the complete boredom from this one.

The Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is barely mentioned, the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians that led to the unjust internment of Japanese Americans omitted. But the film goes even furher, referring to the camps as \\"concentration camps,\\" which they were not; this is a deliberately misleading lie. These omissions and false impressions can only stir up bad memories and provoke renewed hatred.

Triggerfinger and Barricades are decent songs but overall the lead singers voice fails to flow smoothly with the aggresive play of the guitars and only Arrows has a really fresh, polished sound that makes you yearn for more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic survey methods text","review":"For anyone who conducts online surveys, especially academic researchers, this is an essential text. Dillman's text is far superior to The Survey Kit by Arlene Fink. The only criticism I would offer is that Dillman assumes researchers are designing their own online surveys rather than using commercially available websites such as Survey Monkey. I would contend that the majority of survey research is conducted on commercial websites. Although these websites are changing rapidly, I would like Dillman to address this subject as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Helpful","review":"Actually, I was kind of disappointed when I got the book because its geared toward caring for Chipmunks as pets. I was looking for something that focused on them in their natural habitat. However, it is helpful as it gives plenty of info on the cheeky critters, so we can still use it to cater our backyard feeding program. Lots of color photos and good basic text. I would recommend it as it is useful to our purposes, however, I just would have liked something more specific to chipmunks in their natural habitat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chipmunks","review":"We love wild animals, especially chipmunks and squrrils. This book is wonderful to look at and our whole family loves it. I highly reccomend it for nature lovers of all ages, but primairly school aged children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Thrilled to finally get this after wanting one many years ago. Came in great condition with a perfectly mint tag. Highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of Birds","review":"Once again David Attenbourough, in conjunction with the BBC, has produced an excellent nature series. The series is very informative, as well as interesting and entertaining. The photography is up to the BBC's usual superlative standard, and the commentary is well written and witty per Mr. Attenbouroughs' style. I highly recommended series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"I received this last month. I had previously seen it on PBS late one night while I was up with my son. I loved it so much I ordered it. It is just amazing...beautifully filmed...it's just a wonder how some of the species of birds do what they do to find a mate..little dances, collect colored items, make a wonderous nest. I recommend this 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series, less than stellar picture quality","review":"My husband and I are great fans of David Attenborough's nature documentaries and love this amazing series on birds. Unfortunately, I have to take one star off for the poor picture quality that does not do justice to the beauty of the birds and their natural surroundings. The colors are rather washed out giving it the appearance of a much older production (like the shows made in the 70s and 80s). This is a pity as such an amazing production which has obviously been meticulously researched deserves better treatment.There are 10 episodes on 3 discs:Disc OneTo Fly or Not to FlyThe Mastery of FlightThe Insatiable AppetiteDisc TwoMeat-EatersFishing for a LivingSignals and SongsDisc ThreeFinding PartnersThe Demands of the EggThe Problems of ParenthoodThe Limits of EnduranceAspect ratio is 1.33:1, in English with interactive menus and scene access. Fans of David Attenborough will want to own this set, but do take note of the inferior picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic series!","review":"We watch it as a family and my 5 year old loves it. It's educational programming that is fun and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon offers POOR quality video","review":"I'm new to \\"Prime\\". Just watched this wonderful documentary (again) but I'm deeply disappointed by the quality of Amazon's streaming. The video quality is SO BAD that it took all the fun away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing pictures, entertaining explanations, great quality","review":"As Sir David Attenborough has acostumed us. Life of birds is just another must see in the history of documentaries. In this case maybe pictures are not as amazing as inPrivate life of Plants where motion was shown in a reign that looks still and quiet, discovering a new face of plants. Birds are pure movement and maneuverability, so what you can show to impress is amazing pictures of undiscovered behaviours or strange species bird-fans didn't know yet. That hidden species and features, and the usual charming style of Sir David Attenborough makes you stay stuck to you seat and grasps your interest since the very first minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this series","review":"I wasn't interested in birds when I recieved this series as a gift. But it is so remarkably well done that I'd recommend it to anyone, bird lover or not.Attenborough's talent is to present fairly detailed information in a very interesting fashion. He doesn't fail us in this series...the photography is remarkable as well.Perhaps the most remarkable footage is of a bird that does a convincing imitation of a camera shutter, a car alarm, and a chainsaw. You must see and hear to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great documentary","review":"After buying 'Planet Earth' and 'Life', this was my first choice for what to buy next. It is amazing, especialy for a bird lover like me. It's nice to have Attenborough actually on the video. Some of the best parts include: (spoiler alert) kakapos booming (courtship call), Aincient Murrelet babies running to the sea, and the weird Calf-bird in the jungle. It's a great documentary. I give it four stars only because the quality on some of the vids was not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Hour With the Birds","review":"I got to watch this show for free as a perk of having Amazon Prime. Had I paid a couple dollars to rent it, I'd have no regrets. The narration is wonderful and easy to listen to. Slow motion effects of hummingbirds, owls, falcons, and others is spectacular. The photography is first rate, so realistic that my bolognese started barking at a close up of an owl.Super show for bird lovers, nature fans, or families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meticulous, creative and awesome look at nature.","review":"David Attenborough has created an exceedingly meticulous, expansive work, and included a sense of humor, which the birds contribute to in their behavior. The variety of birds, their amazing behavior in the quest to survive, is breathtaking. Whoever did the camera work also needs to be congratulated. There were obviously hours and hours of work, both physically and in terms of research to produce this stunning footage. A magnificent gift for any child, or adult who retains the capacity to feel the awesome gift of divine nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, surprising, funny, thoughtful","review":"If you've never seen anything by Attenborough, you really have something wonderful to look forward to. Like with all his shows, you'll see things you've never seen before, things you've seen but have not understood before, and things you would never imagine existed in nature. Everyone alive should see these shows. And then go outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least 30 \\"Wows!!!\\"","review":"If you love birds, nature, or nature photography, this DVD series will do nothing less than overwhelm you with great narrative, truly consuming photography (not to mention the sound editing is awesome) and troves full of information. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed Sir Attenborough's magnificent telling of the 'Life of Birds' and are actually looking forward to watching the entire series again and again. Even if you are an avid birder, you are sure to discover new species, new habitats, and new facts about bird behaviors that you weren't aware of before. One of the most rewarding things about these stories are that you may find yourself wondering out-loud, \\"How did they find out about that???\\" over-and-over, as we did, to find that they actually take the time to answer those questions at the end of the episode. I'm only here to give credit where it's due, in my humble opinion, and to order 2 more copies as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked even a non-birder","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my husband, a knowledgeable birder. I had not intended to watch, but from the beginning it was riveting, fascinating, and very thorough in its explanations and observations. The photography is stunning. I didn't expect to like, or even watch, this dvd, but I am very glad I did. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great program with INFERIOR picture quality","review":"I love BBC's programs, but the quality of these DVDs is disappointing, and frankly offensive when you consider its high price. Just compare this against PLANET EARTH or BLUE PLANET and you will see what I mean.I suspect the problem may be that this particular set was licensed to Warner Brothers for DVD production, and they obviously didn't put any effort into it. PLANET EARTH and BLUE PLANET, among others, are not. Why they gave this to Warner I do not know. Perhaps they are recording an all-new bird series to replace it.In short, buy this set because it's a good program, but get a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"very realistic, though a bit political","review":"While this video has stunning photography, it also obviously tries to make a point regarding human interference with wild life habitat, and the devastating effects that can have. Some scenes simply were not suitable for my kids to watch (such as birds dying/drowning in oil sludge.) I would have appreciated some sort of warning ahead of time with that regard. While that is a part of life, I think it appropriate to wait until the kids are a bit older (9 or 10 or so) to view it. Otherwise, for teh most part, it was a beautiful video showing many kinds of birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs are failed!!","review":"Be careful when you order this item. Some discs are failed, as the ones I bought. The problem: Image freezes every few seconds, which makes the documentary impossible to watch. This is very frustrating. I understand that -under Amazon's policy- you cannot return CDs once you open them. Buy the CDS rather from a physical store, where you can actually return any failed merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"the life of birds","review":"The Life of Birds is actually very good!

I put it on to cheer myself up, to work out, and regularly add it to my \\"party mix\\" of music. \\"Suicide Kings\\" is my favorite, \\"Flovilla Thatch vs. the Virile Garbage Man\\" is awesome and of course the album offers the BEST CPD swing song, \\"Drunk Daddy,\\" as well as other favorites like \\"Answering Machine.\\" This album is a MUST have and makes listeners realize just how versatile and talented the CPD's really are!

It wasn't warm enough fast enough for 10F weather in a camper. I bought it for low power consumption, but a smarter idea would have been to buy one with adjustable heat setting which I could have turned down. THis one has no adjustability so either leave it on or unplug it... but no matter what you do it will never keep you warm in extreme cold and isn't large enough for a single person. It's smaller than it seems when you factor in that it has to wrap around the body in a 3D fashion and that takes a lot more than the width of your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first","review":"I bought the electric blanket for my husband because he is an over the road truck driver.

Looking at this series, it is amazing to see how the equipment, plot lines, and characters form the foundation of many SciFi programs today. It is still fresh and exciting for a new generation to discover the Tracys and their supporting cast of friends and foes. Already used for one live-action film, there are scads of not-yet-used story lines ready for sequels. It is still well supported by sales of toys, clothing, and figures as well as this collection of DVDs - and at great prices. See other Gerry Anderson items too."},{"rating":"2","title":"thunderbirds megaset","review":"This collection of all of the original episodes is a great watch, for all ages.

Original. Aspect. Ratio!All that said, buy the SD DVDs instead. Thunderbirds is still one of the greatest sci-fi action shows ever! I can wait 'til they get their OAR blu-ray act together. When they do that, I'll buy it in a heartbeat. My dad loved Thunderbirds, I love it, and my boy loves it too. F.A.B.! O.A.R.!I know people will slag me off for writng this before it's out (the British version IS already out and people ARE already upset), but I think it's better that I write this before it's perpetrated on more unsuspecting customers.

The Mickey Mantle/Lou Gehrig scene is priceless. The remainder of the movie is maddening, mediocre, meaningless and maudlin. In addition, the baseball scenes are poorly done.

The author does a fantastic job of explaining why the revolution happened. I had no clue that two generations earlier, the American colonists in MA were more free. With that knowledge, the revolution makes much more sense. Also, the idea that the revolution was not Americans vs. Brits, but a war of ideas I had never heard.The author clearly states why Washington was so needed.

Very little plain English, but instead lots of conclusory assertions paired with rattling off of terms that might make the Math Club all giddy, but that leave you scratching your head at what the heck they just told you. Only when you do a few problems do you realize, oh, [point that could have been made much more clearly], is what they were saying! Truly, a horrible book, one that has inspired me to volunteer for my school district's textbook selection committee. One comment above made a particularly excellent point: this book tackles factoring relatively early. Factoring starts off easy, but the water gets deep quickly.

I have a great math teacher, so she explains stuff that I am not quite sure. But this book should be used only by advanced and intermidiates math students. This book moves with a fast past and it uses a lot of difficult math terms for special eds. I that because of my friend and I know their pace. [...].

Or, if you have really little kids (like, under age 3), you can use the blocks for building imaginary things, like the Great Wall of China. You can use these blocks as a one-person game or with a bunch of people, and there are no winners or losers. It's just a good be-together or be-alone activity. Truly \\"Zen\\" blocks.

I bought this one because it is light, not expensive and has a beautiful design. Despite its price and weight, this binocular is able to provide great picture. I used it in a starry night to watch those fantastic celestial objects such as M31, M42 and the Jupiter's satellites, and the binocular showed me sharper and better images than I expected. It might be a good choice for beginning stargazers before buying a specific and much heavier telescope. Though as mentioned in other posts that this binocular has a little chromatic aberration, you can hardly notice it unless you can hold it quite steady."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"I purchased these binoculars from Amazon based on the Nikon name and customer reviews. I suppose my expectations were too high. The optics were respectable, with well lit imagery. The disappointing part was the made in China construction, they felt cheep. They were bulky and heavy and the focus adjuster felt crappy. I returned them, and purchased the Bushnell Legends, they are constructed in China as well, but they are very nice for the money. The glasses feel great and work exceptionally well, plus they come with a great case and extra goodies. The truly amazing part is you can get such incredible binoculars these days for such a little amount of money, doesn't seem realistic.

Beautifully crafted and skillfully mixed, this album is an often-overlooked masterpiece.

Dark and brooding, while at times being confusing, TCDA evokes every emotion from fear to anger to ecstacy.I don't really need to bother highlighting the best tracks... every song is amazing. The album would be considered experimental and strange to most electronic music fans, but Thrussel has been doing this for years and no longer needs to experiment; he's got it down to a science."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie should be 0 star","review":"This movie is terrible, Milla Jovovich cannot act and the scenes of this film are horrible!!!

They have changed a lot the real history of Joan D'Arc. I don't think that Joan of Arc was angry all the time like they present her in the movie. Joan, according to the story heard voices from three saints, St. Catherine, St. Margaret and St. Michael. But in the movie they present three images and they never speak. Is like the same angel or saint in three different ages. The movie has more o less a slow pace and it turns really boring after 3/4 parts of the movie had elapsed. I think the version of Joan of Arc, starred by Lelee Sobieski is more loyal to what really happened than this one. Even the one in black & white with Ingrid Bergman was even better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Effort","review":"I like the work of Luc Besson very much.

The camera tricks are something out ofThe Blair Witch Projector the oldBatmantelevision series and not something one would expect from a movie with a real budget. It is apparent that historical accuracy was a low priority compared to vain attempts to make the story more dramatic through the overemphasized breathy monologues and tilted camera sequences. This is particularly sad in light of the fact that the history behind the story is truly interesting in itself and the Hollywood tricks rob the viewer of any interest in the story at all. The one good thing about this movie is it will make you want to go back to reading instead. And when it does, tryJoan of Arc (Ignatius Press eBook)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and moving","review":"I do not know how historically accurate this movie is, but I sat glued to the screen for the whole movie. This movie is not for people who want to see Joan of Arc as a simple saint, and it probably will not please many Christians. Although it is clear that Luc Besson thought that Joan truly believed she was a messenger from God. The issues raised by this movie are not simple, but are extremely moving. What is Good and what is Evil? Is any war a just one? Why did she believe in the goodness of the King of France who eventually sold her out to the English? The movie is as much about the God and Man as it is about Joan of Arc. Was it her destiny all along to be burned at the stake, just as it was Christ's destiny to be crucified? The movie seems to suggest so. Some other reviewers didn't like Milla Jovanovich's acting. I thought she was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE !

Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.It's just a terrible movie.

Especialy a little scene at the begining when Joan is a little girl and she just had that vision with the sword and she comes back home just to see her mother (am not sure if it was her mother or not) killed with that same sword and then raped. The scene is disgusting in that even though it is a bloody and violent scene and the viewer is raging with disgust for the rapist the director decided to make it a \\"fun\\" scene by portraing the rapist as a fool and clown.

I really expected a better job from Luc Besson. While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role. To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luc Besson didn't understand God in this movie","review":"He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a \\"grown up\\".

Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend \\"Beatrice\\" and \\"the ninth gate\\"(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course.

Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero.

No. I don't think so. She tries, she really does. She invests her all into this role, and sometimes she does very well. But does she inspire legions of men to defend her and to defend France? Does she convey the kind of passion and compassion that could inspire so many men to believe in her? I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the \\"insanity\\" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure? In this portrayal though Jovovich overacts and instead of conveying the passion of someone for whom her religion is sacred she conveys insanity.

The settings and costumes are decent, but that\`s all there is to find here.Director Luc Besson also made the useless \\"The Fifth Element\\", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too.

First though, great performance by Milla Jovovich.I only hope Hollywood gives her more dramatic type roles as i find her acting more moving than any 'hot' actress (like Angelica Jolie) in Hollywood right now.The erratic behaviour of Joan, is similar to one of a young man seeing his first sign of real combat. And I think that twisted side of the plot only enrich the movie.Bottom line, if you are looking for a nice sweet good versus bad movie, then get a mediocure End of Days.

But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a 0 stars?","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever conceived. Not just made, but conceived. Milla Jovovich can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I thought The Fifth Element illustrated that. The following people wasted their time and talent on this project: Dustin Hoffman, John Malcovich, Tchéky Karyo, Faye Dunaway. The insane in your face cinematography and the disturbing screaming and gestures of Jovovich's are just awful. Why does Bravo: The Film and Arts Network include this in their 5-Star Cinema series? It's fertilizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Luc!","review":"8 out of 10 for technos; 3 out of 10 for drama; 1 out of 10 for history. Besson's Joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real Joan of Arc, so well documented by dozens of scholars. Don't for one minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star and a saint. I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism that the real Joan so patently did. Her trial and life are among the most well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or ignores what the best scholarship has long established. A modernist gothic horror it might be, but it's cheap cinema (because this Joan is just not credible) and even cheaper fiction. Don't infect your children with this a-history."},{"rating":"1","title":"i made it! ..........through the movie","review":"excellent supporting cast, terrible lead actress and sooo incredibly long. oh, and dustin hoffman mumbles at the end. a must not see."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is being very generous","review":"This movie of Joan of Arc is the WORST representation of her life ever produced. The history is not very accurate and Joan's mission was totally missed. The director seems to have forgotten that this 19 yr old girl was the catylst that eventually ended the Hundred Years War, but under God's command. This is a cheezy \\"Hollywood\\" production; looks are very deceiving. Don't waste your money. If you are truly interested in seeing a GOOD and more accurate movie, I suggest THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, the 1928 silent film, or JOAN OF ARC with Leelee Sobieski, from 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable Travesty","review":"For the easily pleased, simple-minded, less discriminating viewers only. John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman couldn't even save this one. I even think their characters dragged this story down, but there was so little hope and promise from the moment this movie was conceived. Mila what's her name was so thoroughly annoying and unconvincing throughout this mess I just wanted to fast forward to the end to see her burn. At least it has a happy ending. The best thing I can say about this movie is it took pathetic and lame to new heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Joan was not crazy, was not a schizophrenic, and did not look like that.

CAN WE??!!\\" Disagree? ...I am very vehement about this subject and would be glad to prove you wrong...I mean...talk with you about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total reinvetion of the legend","review":"Where to start with what is wrong...The costumes and weapons are not the correct period, Jesus has fair skin and blue eyes. Joan has black hair not blond, the accents are all over Europe and not correct for the English or French except the few times a real Frenchmen is cast, and because of research done by French historians such as Roger Caratini, Its clear today that Joan's influce in battle was less leading the charge and more along for the ride.Lets not talk about the acting, but rather the over acting. I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.The real Joan of Arc was zealot that heard voices yet was charismatic enough to rally the French at a critical time and was sold out to the English when her usefulness to crazy ratio dipped too low. This movie portrays her as a raving loon that got what was coming to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Jeanne a Heroine or Not?","review":"Is the director French? Is Joan not a French heroine? If the answer is yes to both questions, then I have a hard time understanding why Besson makes her \\"confess\\" that all her great deeds were a mistake. It doesn't bother me to interpret Joan of Arc as a lunatic - for all I know she may have been schizophrenic indeed! (What else makes you hear voices?) What I don't like is the notion that Joan herself lost faith in her own cause, questioned her own motives and regretted what she did, as apparently Besson makes her do at the end. That's not my idea of a heroine or hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postmodernist","review":"Despite a promising start , I found the movie extremely disappointing.There was some good acting but the storyline completely distorted the message of Joan of Arc.Instead of the courageous and noble young lady that I believe her to have been ,in this post-modernistic , oversophisticated era of cheap thrills she is portrayed as a pschotic ,ultraneurotic who the movie seems to suggest was motivated by selfish and bloodthirsty reasons which anyone who has studied Joan of Arc would know is not true (Read or see George Bernhard Shaw's Saint Joan which shows more genius in one sentence than this movies wise guy writers and producers could ever write in their collective lifetimes) I am going to see the other Joan of Arc video and hope it is better than this one and reflects the genuine values of freedom and justice which so many older movies (but also quite a few new ones ) more satisfyingly portray"},{"rating":"2","title":"History in action...","review":"If looked from a historical point of view, the movie has little to offer. But if you want to see some Middle Ages action flick, it's almost as good as it can get thanks to incredible battle scenes. As one reviewer noted before, it's on par with those seen in Braveheart. Movie is a bit too long and sometimes I though they should have skipped some parts, esspecially after Joan was taken prisoner. Overall, a decent action movie on a historical theme that is fun to watch. But if the history is what you are looking for, my best advise is to look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Full of inaccuracies and anachronisms, \\"Joan\\" looks like she has been doing aerobics for years and has a Hollywood stylist as well.

Sadly the movie is highly inaccurate to the story about the young French warrior maiden who saved her country. They start off with her childhood (might I add she was 13 when she first heard her voices, not 7 or 8 like the movie seems to think) where she watches the murder and rape of her sister. Joan did have a sister, a younger sister not one who was between the ages 16-18. While I think that Milla Jovovich is a tallented actress she wasn't right for the role in this movie, she made Joan of Arc seem like a lunatic. To make things worse her voices seem very satanic. If you want my advice avoid this movie and watch the Joan of Arc movie with Leelee Sobieski, it is very intertaining and has a more realistic view of Joan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good diplomatic history of a key neutral country in WW2","review":"Book examines Turkey's relations with the major powers during WWII.

A $30 cb on a good antenna will have considerable more range than a $150 cb on a cheap antenna. Inexpensive cbs do have less sensitivity and features of more expensive cbs, but if you are just starting out, I would suggest an inexpensive cb with a good antenna such as a Wilson 'Lil Will' magnet mount. If you purchase the antenna at a cb shop, normally they will be more than happy to install and tune the antenna for you free of charge. The antenna normally runs around $30 and is one of the better entry level antennas out there. I have ran a cb for 10 years and I still use one as a back up. But remember, the secret to range is in the antenna system.. not so much the radio. But whatever you choose.. do not get one of those 'through the glass' or a 'rubber magnet mount' antenna. These are poor antennas with very limited range, usually less that a mile. Get something with a steel whip equal to or over 36\\" in height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"A rather remarkable piece of equipment.

It comes with a calibration kit and very simple instructions for adjusting the barometer to local elevation and calibration of the hygrometer. The storm glass is quite fascinating. It's larger than it appears in the photo and very easy to examine crystal behavior. It's been pretty rainy here of late and I noticed that within hours of arrival the storm glass became quite cloudy with suspended crystals near the top with sparkles suspended below. Pretty neat! Glad I spent the money for it, hung it in my living room and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. The only drawback....

Faith takes her version of \\"SSBM\\" to another level, giving it a more gospel-type feel, the result is awesome.\\"This Kiss\\" is pure bubblegum pop (not necessarily a bad thing). \\"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\\" (with Tim McGraw, surprise!) and \\"Let Me Let Go\\" are powerful ballads.

I some songs on the album, like This Kiss, Love Ain't Like That, Let Me Let Go, Me, and My Wild Frontier, but even they fall victim. The album is pieced together, also - for example, the guitar rhythm to Let Me Let Go sounds manufactured and not in continuity with the other songs. I've never liked the song The Secret Of Life, both on this album and the version by Gretchen Peters. \\"Somebody Stand By Me\\" is too bombastic.

One of my favorites is Love Ain't Like That but, unfortunately, it failed at radio back in early '99. And unlike most country albums of the '90s, the unreleased songs aren't filler. In fact, my very faves are Better Days, My Wild Frontier and I Love You - all unreleased songs. Surprisingly, Faith's version of I Love You is much better than the original Celine Dion version.

It's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change. \\"The Secret of Life\\" has taken some getting used to. It is not my absolute favorite on the CD. \\"Me\\" is the song that means the most to me since I have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship.

Several of the plates would not fit the barbell due to excessive cast material. I contacted CAP and sent pictures. After an initial e-mail acknowledging that I had lodged a complaint I have heard nothing further and in the mean time I have several plates I can't use unless I grind the excess myself. My set has a baked on enamel finish and this would require removing the paint. Next time I'll buy YORK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Weights","review":"The only thing I do not like about these weights is that they are heavy which shows me how weak I really am.

The ends on my bar was a little stiff. A little WD-40 and they are spinning fine. Overall, I would buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy going 70s fun","review":"Lets set things into perspective, Jaguar Lives is not going to win any oscars or awards for acting. Its not designed for that, its a film designed for Joe Lewis to show off his fighting credentials. Sadly it was filmed at wrong time, during the early 70s around time of Enter the Dragon this film would been a hit. It is what it is good old 70s fun and you be an idiot to get this film if your looking for plot and great acting. Stick to Godfather no this is for martial arts fans and people who like bit of old fisticuffs and old school action from 70s. Its same with Professionals you like it for what it is. I enjoyed this movie and Joe Lewis is similar in style to Mr Bruce Lee just he came at a time when interest in that type movie had wavered a little until the rise of arnie,stallone,chuck,van damme,snipes etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not a top 10, but it is good","review":"I am an avid music fan, I have over 2000 CDs (I call my tastes rock-pop-modern alternative). \\"Dacapo\\" is a good record, but placing it in the top 10 is a little more difficult. The music from this CD has changed my mood from bad to good more than once... (not an easy thing to do). It's very uplifting every time I hear it. \\"Luck Don't Know My Name\\" and \\"Round and Round\\" are 2 of my all-time favorite songs from this CD. I wish more bands made more albums like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as some of their other music","review":"There are some very good songs here. What I think is missing is the power of the their other albums. This is more on the pop side of things. I will say the music is very catchy and put together pretty well. It's a very good album for what it is, I just don't like it as much as the other stuff. I guess I like louder kind of music better in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country-Rock","review":"I got the download for \\"Luck Don't Know My Name\\"here on Amazon. I can see why it was a #1 download, with its clever lyrics and rockin groove this song really moves me. This CD is one good song after another. I would say the style here is mostly Country-Rock, Folk and some bluesy stuff. I have always loved vocal harmonies, and this record is chock full of them. \\"Round and Round\\" (my other favorite) sounds like tons people singing. If you like twangy, melodic music with nice harmonies a bit of Country and folk flavors thrown in, thats what this album is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar-Pop","review":"What a nice find. I found a used copy of this in a shop here for a few Pounds. Initially I was drawn to this CD by the cover art. I asked the clerk if I could hear a few songs and he obliged. I was immediately drawn to Round and Round, the vocal harmonies are just great. Next was Half a Heart, a super-catchy guitar-pop song. Finally Mystery Train (of Love), a great Country/Rock song. I find myself playing this CD a lot. I think I will explore some of their other albums. This is a really cool CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-frills rock that rocks","review":"This is a straight-forward album so I will give it a straight-forward review: The music here reminds me of a mix between the Bangles and Creedence, good songs with nice harmonies and catchy guitar parts.

There are also several bonus songs (3) recorded in Stockholm in 1978, and a bonus documentary, released in 1985 that has some excellent interview footage of Bert that gives very good insight into Bert as a person (not a singer).The sound was not supposed to be super surround, Hollywood style technology. The sound, though is just fine.This film is a good contrast to the several films (BBC and other) that show Bert toward the end of his life. It is just wonderful.

Definately he is one of the Biography's bad guy. I noticed that the Biography (and interviewed american academic professors) hardly says anything good about Lenin. Was it really a political propoganda that made quarter of million people come out in that freezing cold when Lenin died? No interviews with Russians to find out their present feeling toward Lenin. Although I get irritated with the Bolsheviks I was interested in Lenin's personal life apart from his political life. Not much detail about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or fiction","review":"The DVD was entertaining but it gave you the feeling as if Lenin who was such a great figure in Russia has led a very passive life...Lenin was a very weak figure always in exile.

So you have to do a little bit of thinking.Hosted by Harry Anderson with appearances by Criss Angel and Lance Burton. Entertaining and informative to watch. Just wished they added some extras on the DVD. Great for fans of magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly compelling","review":"This book was recommended by Amazon.com and I threw it in my shopping cart for fun. I found it surprisingly compelling. I do not remember ever reading Hardy before. His writing is wonderful and not at all old-fashioned, in fact, it is a modern book in sensibility. If you like books that care about characters and place, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun introduction to Hardy","review":"This is Hardy's third novel (1873), and is set in the southwest area of England (Cornwall), where he met his first wife. It is the story of young, impetuous Elfride, and her romance with two men: the young architect Stephen Smith and the urbane, educated lawyer, Henry Knight. As common with his other novels, it reflects elements of tragedy, irony, and class advancement. Elfride and Knight are low middle-class persons trying to advance in society and in love. Though not as intricate and challenging as his later novels, it is an entertaining and illuminating read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very easy to read","review":"Although meant to be an introduction to Relativity, this book is hard to read right from the start.

It captures the plots and dangers of business and finance in Hong Kong in a way that makes it so the story never gets boring. Clavell has a knack for historical fiction and insight into Asian culture that few if any western authors seem to. Clavell's personal experiences as a prisoner of war in world war II form the basis for King Rat and perhaps help explain his fascination with Japan and Hong Kong. Shogun met with great success despite it also being a rather long novel and Noble House builds on this story several generations later with the same vibrant and multidimensional character development that makes this book a great read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times challenging but rewarding","review":"Set in Hong Kong during the 1960's, the plot of Noble House concerns the business and political dealings of all of the most important and wealthy people on the island. Along with Tai-Pan, I would rate this as the best book of Clavell. Although at times he goes into too much detail on some topics, such as finance, this is generally a thrilling book, with some genuinely exciting plot twists. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys long, sweeping epics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap operatic saga full of caricatures","review":"I just finished this book, and I am hugely disappointed. The book could have been condensed down to a third of it's current form. There are ramblings that go on for pages that repeat information that just felt like page fillers. It seems like no editing had been done for this book. Clavell tortures us with poor writing, shallow characters, and caricaturization of all Chinese characters and especially completely distorted view and depiction of all women in the book. Perhaps Mr. Clavell suffered from seeing all women as virgins or whores. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble House - A Huge Disappointment","review":"After reading the previous four novels of Clavell's Asian Saga, I was very disappointed in Noble House. Shogun, Tai-Pan, King Rat, and Gai-Jin were absolutely fantastic; exciting with a lot of action and colorful characters. The characters in Noble House are excellent, but the constant detailed diatribe about the finances of taking over the Noble House was way overdone and constantly repeated. I'm amazed that Clavell wrote this book because all the hashing about money consistently stopped the ACTION of the story. The first thing a writer learns is to keep the action going. I found most of this book as boring as watching paint dry. The plot lines about espionage were good and Clavell should have expanded that story line and cut out the constant rehashing of the bank's problems and Casey's \\"drop dead\\" money. Like, we got the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"I like James Clavell. I liked \\"King Rat\\" very much, and later I enjoyed both \\"Shogun\\" and \\"Tai-Pan\\". So why did I find this book so dull, so boring, in fact, that I didn't finish it? The characters are uninteresting, the events trivial, the politics weird. The book's understanding of business and business practice is naive. Really, it could have been ghost-written by Harold Robbins. And the depictions of modern Chinese are not quaint and amusing, as in the distant world of \\"Tai-Pan\\", but racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAIPAN","review":"This is a real page turner, and that's really saying something considering that this book is hella long. Clavel is a real student Hong Kong high society, and it is fascinating to watch the Anglo Ian Dunross navigate his way through the Asian way, the mini series of this book is exceptional, I saw it as a kid, and I remember how much I wanted to be Pierce Brosnan, nobody could have inbodied Dunross like Brosnan. If you enjoy a good read and love learning about a different culture then you will love this book, but be forewarned, is is LONG, and be sure to pick up the mini series it is a wonderful compliment to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Noble House is by far one of the best of Clavell's works! I got so caught up in the drama between Quillan Gornt and Ian Dunross that I couldn't put the book down. I didn't want it to ever end, and when it did I was very very very upset!! I enjoyed the book so much that I found out I wanted to learn more about the characters. I learned about the stock market and bank counsels, etc. I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone and anyone!! It's the kind of book that once you start reading it, you'll never ever ever want to put down. If you're looking for a book with drama, passion, intenseness, murder, mystery, and thrill, you should read The Noble House. It's a wonderful tie in of all of Clavell's books and I simply loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Plotting","review":"I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here. But after 450 pages I gave up. Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters. I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years. I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"One of my 10 favorite books of all time. Better than Shogun. Great plot, well developed characters - I couldn't put the book down! Simply awesome work. Clavell's best and that says much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel House","review":"It is a great book, need to read Tia Pan first. Great history of Hong Kong. This is my second time that I have read this book. Would love to hear others comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many blunders about Russians","review":"This book is a gripping as other Clavell books. However, I hope his sources of information on Chinese stuff were better than on Russians. Some Russian names and factoids are downright ridiculous. For example, he clearly can't tell Kazakhs, Mongol-related people from Central Asia, from Cossacks, militaristic communities of Russian origin living in Southern Russia and Ukraine. Too bad he couldn't find a Russian person to help out, I would have enjoyed the book immensely if not for this nagging doubt whether the whole book would sound similarly ridiculous to a Chinese person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition contains many type flaws","review":"I am not sure why, or how, so many typographical errors crept into the Kindle edition. For some examples, many words, lines, or parts of whole pages appear in bold type or italics in the Kindle edition but are not that way in the printed edition. There are also missing quotation marks, especially the end-quote marks. There are misplaced lines, apparently due to missing carriage returns. I enjoyed the story but the print flaws are just annoying. Please, Amazon, if you are going to charge so much for these electronic books, put a little quality into the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This book is one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, but it also has that rare quality of making one feel smarter. I understand the history is not completely accurate, yet I still feel like I am learning about a group of times, places, and cultures that I have never truly encountered. Clavell's writing style and his depiction of protagonists and villains alike are stirring and engaging throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy the digital version","review":"Long novel with an intricate plot. I enjoyed it a lot. Other reviewers have covered the plot and given their opinions. I'll just give one tip. Unless you can clear your calendar so you can read without interruptions, I'd recommend buying the Kindle version of this book if you can. That way if you have to put it down for a while and come back to it, you'll be able to search back through the book electronically to remind yourself of plot details that happened several hundred pages ago. This will help you tie everything together.Be warned however, you probably won't want to put it down in the first place. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"noble house","review":"excellent read.follows the pattern set forth by the author's prevous works in the asian theme. where may I find the Whirlwind book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Grab You and Hold On!","review":"This novel will grab you in the first five pages like no other I have read. Although some of the subplots become a bit Byzantine, you hold your breath through the twists and turns of a crisis where the firm fights a corporate takeover, kidnapping, murder, and love affairs.The novel Nobel House is all the more interesting because it is based on a fictional version of the trading giant Jardine Matheson: a company which was founded by the colorful opium smuggler/Taipan William Jardine in the 1830's and 40's in Canton and later Hong Kong (he was called the Iron Headed Old Rat by the Chinese). Jardine's decendents persently control this company which employs over 200,000 people around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a great Tai Pan Sequel, but a bit slow in places","review":"This is a worthy sequel to Tai Pan, with excellent continuity (the coins, come to mind) and plenty of action, intrigue and asian exotica. The only areas where I thought it was weak was in the intricacy of the financial details (I am no CPA) and the very poor tie in to Shogun with the Japanese reporter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monumentally slow and tedious","review":"I found the characters amusing for a while, but after it just slowly grinds on and on for page after page I started to just wish they would die.I can't believe this relatively simple story takes so long to tell. Worse than that it is padded with repetition, so it isn't a huge painting with a small and interesting subject, it's a lot of nothing much with some minor relief to the boredom.And then in five minutes it's all sorted out. The main character does the obvious thing, which would probably make anyone else a pariah. Everything before and after those five minutes hardly matters. Even the disasters don't really matter to the story. Though they do matter to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This is a must-read for first time moms.

Buy Me a Rose just says it all for me. Fits my life to a tee. Best album since his Greatest Hits album. I view that song next to Lady for sure. And of course The Greatest speaks for another side of Kenny, the creative side. All songs on this CD are superb and sung as only Kenny can sing them. Sung with feeling and natural appeal. They are warm and romantic and relaxing. This album is going to fly off the charts. Kenny is back in full swing and it is so refreshing for the music industry. Every song on this CD i can relate to in some way. It sings life and reality and true situations. Hats off to a superstar and I thank him for such a wonderful CD. I have seen 13 of his concerts and he is awesome. The Music industry owes a lot to this great performer. He will always be the best.

In this case, the 18WXSTII has one channel that seems like it always has a signal on it, and that signal is the birdie. I think it was channel 4. The birdie signal was loud enough that it would block out any medium or weak real signals. Now, in other wide-band general-coverage radios that use synthesized frequency generation, it is common to hear a few birdies. But, since CB only uses 40 channels, you'd think they could design it so that there would not be any birdies on those frequencies. When I talked to the Cobra technical support person, he admitted the birdie was a design problem and all the units have it. This was several years ago. It may be fixed by this time. Anyway, the tech agreed to exchange the radio, and I ended up getting a slightly more expensive model. I was happy with their support but sad about their design problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the $$","review":"The radio is good for the $$ but i wish i paid $30 less for it! there is no RF gain which would make this a sweet deal, i pick up farther than i can transmit but cannot block out what i want to hear, if only i could turn down the RF!

I often have to have the squelch set so high to block static (from everywhere), that I don't get reception anyway. It also makes a little static \\"tick\\" noise as it does it two channel priority watch scan, which I find very annoying. In fact, I no longer turn the radio on when I'm in the vehicle. I would not buy this model radio again and am planning to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of junk that works, but not well","review":"here is why. 1. the frequency wonders on this like crazy if your on chanel 22 you are heard on 21 and 23 as well.2. this cb dont like other mics at all! it wont work.3. the sound quality is crap at best put a couple marbles in your mouth and talk and thats what you sound like3. front facing speaker is a great idea so construction and design is okay4. digital anologs just plain dont give accurate info5. this \\"sound tracker\\" kills your output (ive tested this)6. everything feels cheapto back up my claim that gos against all other reviews read this as well[...]my advice, this is not a bargain buy get a real cb not this plastic paper weight"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed with this CB Radio","review":"We were impressed with the speedy delivery and no damage to any of it!

The radio worked flawlessly; it has good range when paired with a good antenna. The weather feature was a nice addition that I used often as well. I sold the radio when I sold the truck in 2011 and the new owner is still using the radio and he likes it too. I am on Amazon today to put another one just like it in my shopping cart for my pickup and camper. I have been using CB radio since the mid 1970's off and on, and this little Cobra is a good solid radio; the weather feature makes it worth the extra few dollars over a bare bones radio.

Be prepared though, to learn the business and the magic of writing along with a thing or two about yourself. Musings manages to findthe common thread of spiritual truth within the film business and artfully weaves both together in a way that shows her great respect and love for all writers. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is either embarking on a writing path or is already on one. Even non-writers will enjoy Ms. Merlin's anecdotes of Hollywood and her depth of feeling for the process of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"This sleeve fits the Apple MacBook Pro 15.4 inch perfectly, and it has fabric that protects the zipper from scratching your computer. This extra fabric does add a little extra room around your computer, but it's barely noticible (not like the InCase I had originally bought, which had about 3 inches of extra space!). Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it didn't come with the cord pouch like the other ones do, I think you have to buy that separately maybe.

The same phony acting that he keeps showing for years and years...it never dies for him, does it? That was the first mistake of Homicide. The second was the terrible theatrical dialogues everybody was engaged in. It was all artificial to me. The third was the contrived, horribly outdated plot with the stupidest plot twist imaginable. Honestly, I thought for a minute it was going to be confidence game thing, but that never materialized. At least David Mamet more than made up for it in The Spanish Prisoner.

The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s.

He is happy and adventurous, and in his travels he charms everyone he meets with his friendly cheerful attitude and his concern for his friends. Shyamalan throws away the entire plot and recasts Stuart as a mopey little rodent looking for his real parents.

Slow-moving at times for adults, I admired the filmmakers for deliberately crafting a wonderfully imagined movie that is never TOO scary or TOO loud or TOO disturbing for the youngest viewers in the audience. There are not enough of these movies today, the kind of movies that draw youngsters into the theatre to experience the joy of movie-going with an audience. The familial message is warmly relayed, and the movie's New York City is alternately delightfully whimsical and just scary enough in the nighttime Central Park scenes. The special effects simply amaze you, and the vocal antics of Nathan Lane will make you laugh out loud, regardless of your age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too coarse and perilous","review":"Show this movie to little kids?

This movie is foul. Let's set aside for a moment that the plot of the movie is unrelated to the book. The movie as it stands does not measure up to what it could have been.Poor Stuart is so pitiful and miserable through 75% of the movie. Wasted potential.I wish it could have been a movie to love.

It is essential particularly for the busy executive who wants to work smarter rather than harder. Alan Lakein offers straightforward, no nonsense advice on how to manage time more efficiently.There are many good points in this volume, and to mention all of them would require a lengthy review. A few of the most outstanding nuggets are as follows:Set priorities.Ask Lakein's question - \\"what is the best use of my time right now?\\"Use the Swiss cheese method to reduce intimidating tasksEmploy \\"The Magic If.\\"Cut off your escape route.Since I am a person who savors managing time as wisely as possible, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done\\" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world.

The modern household and the roles of women in the workplace have changed dramatically in the decades since Lakein wrote this book. The men in my class LOVED the book, but we women found it to be irrelevant and, quite frankly, patronizing to women. To follow his extensive steps consistently in prioritizing life's responsibilities would take more time than actually DOING those things. Ladies, there has to be a better, more timely volume of advice out there for us on this subject.

The first two pages of each chapter was all I needed to get the point.

I was disappointed. The book uses its own package of classes which teach the student nothing of real Java. After using this book, I found that I had to start all over again when I wanted to learn Java, and it took me several months to unlearn the material in this book.

It's problem is that because it is \\"public domain\\", anyone can release it, and hence we get lots of techincally terrible versions of a great film. The some studios even have the audacity to declare that they've released a remastered or enhanced version, which is an outright swindle as the release is stil CRAP! I'd love to name names but those of us who've dealt with this company know it's tricks! (I returned these two \\"enhanced/remastered\\" DVDs and got all my money back!)But back to our film.....I'm hoping that Kino gets a little less snobby and gives this film the attention it deseves. If not, I'm sure Image Entertainment or the Roan Group could do good jobs. Finally, why not let Legend Films colorize it?????

Bob Hope was on the top of his game in the 1940's, and this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the movie is practically unwatchable due to one of the worst transfers to disc that you will ever find. The sound and picture quality are bad beyond my ability to describe.

Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr... what more could you ask for! The version I watched 20 years ago on the late, late show was miles better than this horrible transfer. Since this movie (incredibly) got forgotten by the copyright office and ended up in the Public Domain, all you can find are cheap, HORRIBLE tansfers to DVD's like this god-awful loser. It's better you never even watch this film than to see it in this terribe representation. Why Hollywood wouldn't want to protect gems like these is beyond me, but since they don't give a flying leotard, don't you. This grainy, blurry, audibly incomprehensible, hardly watchable transfer is a complete loser. Don't waste your money.

(BAD COPY) We were willing to watch Bob Hope on full screen and sacrifice the widescreen experience. Our family had to suffer through rough footage and low sound to watch this film. I stress film. Because of all the lines left from the reel to reel film my husband and I were surprised not hear the sound of a reel to reel projector. I believe we would have enjoyed the movie more if we had watched the movie projected from a reel to reel. The sound was so low we had to turn our sound all the way up.

Can Ronnie stay one step ahead of the bad guys and save his precious skin? Oh yeah, and the girl's skin too?This is a fun old movie, combining Bob Hope with siren Dorothy Lamour on the one hand, and the likes of Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. on the other. It's pretty lightweight, but also pretty goofy and a lot of fun. If you like that oddball humor that Bob Hope did so well then you will like this movie. I know that I did!(Review of My Favorite Brunette starring Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Above Average Bob Hope Movie - LOUSY DVD!","review":"This review refers to the Alpha (Gotham Distribution, as listed on Amazon) version of this movie on DVD. The print used for this DVD is absolutely horrible. The opening credits are barely readable, and the movie itself looks murky and has tons of scratches and dust. It's a shame that Alpha couldn't find a better print, but from some of the reviews I've read it seems that some other companies have had the same problem. It would be better not to release it at all than to use such a bad print. This is a really fun movie, and it deserves a lot better than this.

Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable detective spoof with Hope in his usual form.","review":"Bob Hope stars as a wanabe 'hard-boiled' detective who stumbles into a mess of mobsters and mayhem. Hope is in top form with very funny one-liners throughout the film. Character actors Lon Chaney and Peter Lorre provide great screwball villains for the film. Two cameos add icing to the mix (you should be able to guess one of them if you know your Bob Hope films). The quality of the transfer is average and the DVD package is lackluster but the low price makes up for it. Recommended for the family and anyone with a good sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour at their Greatest","review":"My Favorite Brunette is a hilarious spoof of the spydrama.... Bob Hope plays a baby photographer who has a friend who is aprivate eye. One day, when the detective is on a trip, Bob is snoopingaround his office, and Dorothy Lamour comes in to hire adetective. Bob doesn't tell Dorothy that it isn't his office andbefore you know it, he's on the job.Before long, Peter Lorre andLon Chaney Jr. are trying to kill Bob Hope.This movie starts andends with two very funny surprise cameos and is one of the funniestfilms Hope and Lamour ever made together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too cynical for my tastes","review":"I agree this film is too close to being a real crime drama. I don't care for the death lovers who want so badly to see Ronnie Jackson (Hope) get lynched. That part of the movie always bothered me. But it is only a movie! As most of the filmis told in flashback you can't be sure that the events took place actually just as being described. So if it is already stereotypical that can be why."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet.","review":"I've read every single one of Pratchett's Discworld books, most of them more than 2 or 3 times, and I say without a doubt that this is the finest one yet. It seems to me that Pratchett has invested more in Vimes and in Vetinari than in any of his other characters, and it shows. This glimpse into Captain -- sorry, Duke -- Samuel Vimes's past, present, future, and soul simply astounded me. Simply put, I hope to see more Discworld books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as humorous as previous Pratchett books","review":"With Terry Pratchett as my favorite author, I really looked forward to Night Watch, especially since out of Pratchett's wide range of characters and character settings, my favorite is about the men, troll, dwarves, werewolf, etc, in the nightwatch division of the police force. It is so easy to escape into a Pratchett book, with the characterizations so well done and the humor intoxicating. I would recommend Jingo, Men at Arms, or Feet of Clay over Night Watch though. It was not as humorous as I would have liked, except for the parts with Nobby Nobbs as a young street urchin. Those parts were excellent! Overall, the book is a good fantasy with Vimes going back in time and seeing things from a slightly differnet perspective than he had experienced them before. Cleverly written, just not quite the caliber of previous books. Still very much worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book poorly read.","review":"While Night Watch is one of the best of the Terry Pratchett novels, this reading of the book is completely disappointing. Although I have read the book with enjoyment many times I can barely tolerate the audio version. The reader's voices and manners are deep and serious with a downturn to their phrasing which is in total contrast to the tone of the book. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the timing of the changes between readers, attempts at british accents are weak and erratic, and the brilliantly written unique characters have no distinction as read. This is especially disappointing because of the excellence of Terry Pratchett novels read by Nigel Planer. I regret purchasing this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still better than a lot of books out there!","review":"Let me say that I love Terry Pratchett, and for over 10 years I've eagerly awaited each new book. I've read some of his early discworld books so many times I've lost count.Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to to really like this book, it was very disappointing. Another reviewer got it in one when they said, \\"just not funny\\". Yes, all of his books are social satire, but this was verging on just 'social'. Even the jokes that were attempted seemed forced and unoriginal, like I had read them in his other books before. I even read it again (because I always read ever new Pratchett books several times right away since there is normally so much I miss the first time through), but it never 'caught' me, I never laughed, and I just set the book aside.I have been disappointed in the last two Pratchett books, and while I'll be certain to pick up his next book as well, I really hope to see some new, refreshing material in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Pratchett","review":"This is a strange book, quite good, but it reads like well-informed fan fiction, not at all like Terry Pratchett himself (i have read all of the Discworld series, some titles several times over).The style is dry, the characters non-developed, the pacing and structure do not have the same feel as other works, and it lots of ways this story is flavorless.It doesn't feel right...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Watch is One of the Best","review":"Although there isn't a Terry Pratchett book that I don't like, this one is special because we are given glimpses into the early lives of characters that we have previously only known as adults.The reader does an excellent job and this is a recording that I will listen to over and over again when I want some humor in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal flaw","review":"There was one really fatal flaw in Night Watch. It just wasn't funny. Instead of the usual hilarious humor, we had Terry Pratchett pontificating on revolution, repression and who cares? This may be an occupational hazard for best-selling authors: deciding that they have a mandate to Share their Views.There was one good joke at the start of the book, where Vimes get depressed because the Guild of Assassins is no longer trying to kill himl, but that first joke was the last. I was used to laughing out loud at Discworld, but this time I barely smiled. Calling the secret police \\"The Unmentionables\\" could have set off a satire on The Untouchables, but no such luck. Just one more missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! Another hit!","review":"It's rare that an author can keep writing one series, churning them out at speed, and still keep the novels fresh! Pratchett's secret seems to be that he doesn't spit out novels about the same characters over and over: he has essentially split the Discworld into many almost completely separated series, connected only by cameo appearances of some favorite characters.Night Watch focuses, not surprisingly, on Captain Vimes the Night Watch. This particular story reads much more like a science fiction novel than many of his works, with a pretty common sci-fi theme, but made fresh by Pratchett's perspective.The reuse of such a common theme was why I only rated this a 4, not a 5. However, this book is a great read, totally worth the money, and the time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The past, future and present","review":"This is the best Watch book yet. I would give it more stars if I could. It isn't a good place to start reading either the Disc World books or the City Watch series. While this book does contain the expected funny satire and puns they are for the most part found at the beginning of the book. This book is a darker, more serious look at the characters and the city. The book introduces the younger selves of many of the older watch members and Vetinari. It explains how Vimes went from an idealistic newbie to a disallusioned drunk. This transformation isn't spelled out but can be discerned from what the older Vimes sees in his younger self and what we know of him from the previous books. It is a book about heroes, redemption, evil and the price of freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Temps des Cerises","review":"The best Discworld to date. That means, it hits you very hard under the belt. It's all been said in the other comments, except I just wanted to pick up on the word poignancy, and link it back to one of Pratchett's inspirations for this book, the Paris Commune. For 'the wearing of the Lilac', read 'cherries behind their ears', and idealist revolutionaries barricaded in the Montmartre cemetery who know they will soon be dead. Anyone touched by this novel could read up on that particular passage of history. Poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Discworld book","review":"I've been a big fan of Pratchett for a long time now and I've re-read most of the discworld books. This one holds up to the test, even through the third reading of it. Great introduction to Detritus and Angua. Vimes and Vetinari become very real, especially through their weakness and faults.Definitely in the top five of my favorite discworld books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story but does not feel like Discworld","review":"I have read several Discworld books and enjoyed them all. I enjoyed this story too but it is much darker than the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading this book will give you great hair.","review":"This is one of the best Pratchett books I've ever read. I don't need to go into details, they're already mentioned, suffice to say that I read it in one sitting, lent it to one friend and got it back from another. One thing annoyed me though, anorak that I am; at the beginning of the book Keel is buried under a 'simple wooden cross' but at the end Vimes finds himself pinned up against Keel's 'headstone'. Aaargh! Where have all the copy-editors gone? 'Nuff said. Read, enjoy and become enthralled by the Discworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Pratchett Book","review":"Being a prison guard (no, not like the ones in this book, a REAL one) I find great comfort in Sam Vimes. Moralistic humor, nice twisty view of the world, yet always trying to do right - even to himself. This book has gotten me through hard times when I needed to be reminded to be true to myself, to do what I know is right, to look to the greater picture. I adore Terry Pratchett's view and agree wholeheartedly with it. Acceptance that people are who they are, but we need to be who we need to be also. I believe all his books are quite readable, enjoyable. I am currently in the process of reading the entire discworld series in chronological order and am impressed to watch not only the characters grow, but the author also. Thank you sooooo much Mr. Pratchett! Not only are your books entertaining, but provide the view more of us need to see the world through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the series so far","review":"Sam Vimes is my favorite Discworld character, and this book is his triumph! I've read all of the Discworld books to date, and this one is my favorite. Keeps the reader in suspense, and I couldn't put it down. Great characters from the Discworld are seen in their younger days. A must read for all Discworld and Pratchett fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is mainly a book for the die hard fans of Discworld. As one reader commented here, the cameos and some briefly seen characters are mostly enjoyed by those who have already met them.I personally love Vimes, even back when he was portayed as a drunk (Guards! Guards!), I feel he is a very human hero (and cynical, disgruntled, rumpled, etc.).In this book Pratchett delves into destiny, fate and the individual, something he had not done since \\"Small Gods\\" and carries it out succesfully. I look forward to his next book.I agree this might not be the best book to start the series with but there are plently of others to chose from. Just pick one.For new readers I say: \\"What are you waiting for?! Get yourself into gear and visit Discworld\\"For the die hards: \\"Aren't we lucky? Pratchett continues writing for us.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poverty Does Not Isolate You From Giftedness","review":"The argument that growing up in poverty causes one to be overlooked with regard to giftedness doesn't fly with me. The author lays it on pretty thick about how poverty negatively affects how teachers view giftedness in their students. There was little in this book I found noteworthy when read with common sense as my guide. Our American educational system needs a serious overhaul and the focus on \\"feeling good\\" simply because you're in the classroom needs to go by the wayside. Poor or rich, all students are capable of giftedness. They just need to apply themselves and make the necessary effort to achieve success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for the narcissistic woman's needs","review":"For the last five years I've been well acquainted with a middle aged couple, where the wife has read, and been determined to put into practice all of the suggestions in this horrible book. The husband is a very kind hearted person, who has always been one to pull his own weight, with the children, household chores, shopping, etc. But, no, that wasn't enough for her. The wife runs her own business, and has decided that he needs to buck up and do more. While she sits on the phone with her clients, he has to jerk around his own office schedule to meet her needs. I have seen him go from a pleasant, smiling person to a sad, exhausted, numbed robot. His wife has zero empathy for his needs, or those of anyone else, for that matter. But this book will probably sell well, as our society becomes more and more narcissistic. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst design of a phone","review":"I got this phone thinking that the name brand would stand for quality but it completely did not.

Clearly IBM does not care about their customer base. Their service after the sale is extremely bad. Their design on this phone was so poor that the phone only almost worked for 1 day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic...","review":"This book is excellent for someone who is just starting the hobby of archery and who has not yet learned ANYTHING about different types of bows, arrows, and shooting stances.

For anyone else involved in the hobby, this book is very basic and is probably below your level of skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naturally Playful Front Porch Playhouse","review":"It was easy to put together and strudy enough.

Mo'Nique talks real on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Funny","review":"what I did not expect from this show was as to how very insightful it was on women's prison and their inmates and how they cope with their lives as they serve their time. Mo'Nique very cleverly throws in a mini documentary throwing light on the background of a few of the inmates and the prison guards and their coexistence. Mo'Nique is bold, honest and most of all extremely funny. A beautiful comedienne who should bask in all her fame and glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"MONIQUE'S PERFORMANCE LACKLUSTER; THE PRISONERS ARE THE REAL STARS HERE","review":"A couple of reasons why I didn't like this project:a) Monique tends to tell the same jokes in all of her routines. These women have been locked up for many years, many are never getting out. I thought that they (and those who support Monique) deserved a better show.b) Too much profanity. She is already a funny lady. Lazy people, however, lean on profanity when creativity is lacking (see above). I know for a fact that she could have done better. She isn't a lazy woman by any means, but it is painfully evident that she wasn't motivated here.What I loved about this project, however, was the interviews she had with some of the inmates, and that rousing encore song by one of the female prisoners at the end. She had everyone crying (including me!). I hope that Monique kept her promise to that young lady long after the cameras stopped rolling. For these reasons alone, I gave two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute book","review":"This book is full of the famous love is... cartoons. It's cute and on the smaller side.

It never really states how changelings make war in the 20th century. Things like tactics, what happen's when ordinary people happen across the rather large battle's are all glossed over if they are mentioned at all. One thing I have held that was unbeleiveable about the world of darkness is how people could remain ignorant about the vampires, changelings, wraiths, werefish ,ect around them when there are constantly large to small scale conflicts going on all around them.

(Wayne Rogers' part isn't very long---only one or two episodes??) The mystery and the way the story weaves is good. Hope you enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chiefs TVmini-series review","review":"I have been looking for this TV mini-series for a while. Saw it back in the 80's.......very suspenseful!!!

The sheriff looks out for his buddies with little concern for his clients, the county citizens. It also shows the ugly face of racism in this case also the criminal actions of the Clan aka the KKK. I'd recommend all Southern Rednecks to watch this movie and learn from it. Lots of brutality. Carlton Heston as the city of Dalton's Patriarch did a superb job.

For its first chief, Delano decides to hire \\"a good man,\\" so Wayne Rogers (Trapper John on \\"MASH\\") is the choice. Next was the corrupt officer (Brad Davis), followed by the town's first black officer (Billy Dee Williams at the height of heartthrob-ness, having just been Lando in \\"Star Wars\\"). Charlton Heston and Keith Carradine have recurring roles.

Not only was it cut down with many segments chopped or eliminated, the editing was a horrible job. It's as though a 5 year old with scissors was turned loose.

Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story. I wish that I could have enjoyed this more, but there was little to make me love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising premise, disappointing and remarkably dour delivery","review":"Twain spoils a promising premise with bloated preachifying, colorless prose, and an uneven, nigh-absurdist plot arc."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I did not think this was a good book at all. I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery. Besides that, many things in this book are too unrealistic and not well thought out in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on every level","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Mark Twain classic... but I couldn't say why.","review":"Mark Twain is, of course, a famous writer and a producer of a number of US classics. But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, yet meaningful","review":"With each Twain novel I read, I am amazed at how he can be so funny while packing such astute insights about life. This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaaay ahead of his time","review":"I remember I loved reading Tom Sawyer when I was a kid and I continued reading him in college. So when I started reading this, I had high expectations - not disappointed. This story is waaaaay ahead of its time in terms of morality and the social order. There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless. Do yourself a favor and read this book because its highly entertaining, very humorous, and definitely an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Classic With Tiny Flaws","review":"In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\", Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel. Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twain's Most Important Work to Me","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

And, by the way, in response to the reader who gave this book 1 star, and said it was \\"horrible, and was out of touch with modern times\\"--please. This book was written in 1889!

I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long and unfocused","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't MY kind of book","review":"This book was a required reading for my school for summer. I did not enjoy the book in some parts because I found it to be very confusing and boring. There were some chapters that I found interesting and suspenseful. I would not recommend this book for readers. I think it just gets boring after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Twain's best","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, I thought it was one of Twain's worst, and that comes from someone who loves many of Twain's other works. In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blast From The Past Yea Right","review":"A Connecticut Yankee Takes A blast from the past. Yea right! this book is extremely long and rarely has any action to keep you awake if I were a book rater I would give this book a two out of ten thumps up . this story takes place in the 6th century and the only good part was when they were going to burn Hank Morgan and to top it off they didn't even burn him because brought his knowledge from current time and fooled King Author by saying if they don't let him go he will shut down the moon but it was acuity a solar eclipse so the moon slowly faded away so they let him free. Honestly I think this book is not for kids our age it's more for adults. Because I couldn't even stay focus it was so boring I started reading other books.

THE HIGH WINDOW, published in 1942, sees Philip Marlowe, perhaps the most hard-boiled of all classic hard-boiled detectives, searching for a stolen rare coin and once again involved in the sordid affairs of the Los Angeles underworld, dealing with wealthy widows, tall blondes, showgirls, cops, and hitmen, and handling each in turn with the panache that only Marlowe could.

Shame on Disney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not about Space - but still good","review":"The only disappointment about this DVD is the title. I was expecting an episode all about space, but there simply are 3 regular episodes. The space refers to the episode where one of the 3 little pigs ends up in space at the very end.

Of course this is conveniant for Toshiba since it has a 3-month labor warranty and 1-year parts warranty. The local authorized repair shop says labor will cost ...

Recently while playing a flawless DVD, the picture froze up while audio continued to play. Powering down the player and restarting it solved the problem. MP3 playback is a problem on this unit also. The instructions include a nice \\"disclaimer\\" about how certain types of MP3 media may not work. All MP3 media sounds terrible on this machine. Playback is interrupted by \\"pops\\" and \\"chirps\\". MP3 discs also cause the unit to freeze and not advance to the next song (though you can advance it manually by pressing the skip button).Picture playback is good and the unit has many features not found on other players, such as screen capture (allows you to use a scene from a DVD and select it as \\"Wallpaper\\" for your TV) and zoom capabilities.I have not utilized the player's progressive scan output yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in the Water","review":"A wonderful product that worked right out of the box for all offour months!

Obviously, I am not happy with this [money] purchase and cannot recommend that anyone else buy it. Something that was supposed to be very good should last maybe five months?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par progressive scan player...","review":"You should realize initially that progressive scan dvd players will have a better picture, even if you don't own a HDTV. So the picture and audio quality were a nice improvement when I first got this player...and at a great price. However, it does not age well at all. I've had it a little over the year, and the freezes when it switches layers (many movies use 2 layers of the DVD disk) are becoming more pronouced. It is becoming more frequent that you cannot see the dot or highlight that lets you know what you are selecting (you can select, but it becomes a guessing game) until you power down, eject the disk, and start all over again. Finally, it is starting to completely freeze...and I mean completely (you can't even power down from the front buttons, you have to pull the cord at the back).

The DVD picture and sound are Ok, but this is the case with most DVDs. Now for the fun part: the remote is not designed to be used - there are rows of buttons, similar in size, and not very conveniently placed, so if you want to fast forward, pause etc. without looking at remote - forget it. It does not play SVCDs. I've gladly replaced Toshiba's remote with the universal, never to touch it again. But i can't do anything with mp3 playback - it totally lacks features: you can't program, you can't go directly to a certain track, you can't fast fast forward, it doesn' show titles etc. Finally, it comes with a disclaymer about what types of mp3s it is supposed to play. Well, it doesn't play even those, and it comes down to the fact that it won't play most of my mp3s at all. So, if mp3 is even slightly important to you, you will be better off with something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie Experience, Mp3 needs minor improvements...","review":"First of all, I'd like to start by saying that this DVD player does a awesome job on playing DVD Movies! Picture and sound are excellent....For the 4-stars :I took away 2 stars because my primary use of this machine was MP3 playback.....There are lots of improvement to be made in the MP3 portion of this machine::Positive : 1.Attractive on-screen mp3 layout2. Program, Repeat and Random features...Negative : 1. On-screen display only shows the first 8 characters of the song filename. (Which sux!)2. No fast forward or rewind during MP3 playback...Which is insanely disturbing to me...3. The player has problems playing CD-RW discs. I regularly hear pops, clicks and zips during playback. Im not sure if this is only on CD-RW discs...That's it!!If you'r an audiophile like me and into MP3....You might turn your head towards the JVC XV-S60BK.But if your into mostly watching movies....GO FOR IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Problems - Avoid","review":"I had high hopes for this unit given what we paid for it, but have had MANY problems. About half the DVDs we have played in it have had serious sound problems, as if you were turning the volume up and down randomly. It makes many movies unwatchable. Plus, you get plenty of picture freezes. Most cdr/mp3s that we have tried in it also had serious audio problems, lots of pops and the like. These cdr/mp3s play fine on other players.I've had lots of problems with other Toshiba products lately, so my advice would be to avoid them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut to the Chase - Its a good cheaper PScan Unit...","review":"The unit functions well. Chasis and disk drawer are a bit flimsy, but that is to be expected at this price range. Audio and Video DAC performance is optimal. 540 PScan picture quality is optimal on my Toshiba 65X81 \\" HDTV. The only feature missing that I would want would be the center voice amplification enhancement that some newer models offer, but then again my Sony ES tuner takes care of that for me, so it really doesn't bother me. Not remotely interested in playing MP3s, which is what other folks complain about. Why in the world would anybody want to play MP3's on a proprietary home unit anyhow, its not a computer folks?

First it was due in June, then July, and I still challenge you to find a dealer that actually has it.It's too bad that Toshiba is failing so pitifully in bringing these seemingly good products to market.

Rather then just keyboards, bass, stick, guitar, drums and percussion theres violin, doudouk, harmonica and a strong female vocalist.

The only drawback is that some of the tracks work better visually and musically then just musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite live, but it will have to do.","review":"Peter Gabriel is an outstanding live performer and this concert recording makes a valiant attempt to capture the emotion brought forth by a Gabriel performance. A solid list of great songs and true concert recordings help, but the element of joy that is found in Gabriel's live performances is missing. This album gives an approximation of what a Gabriel concert is like but misses the immediacy and power of the performance. The material and performances are excellent; it just can't quite truly recreate the experience. For alternate versions of many of Gabriel's best songs; however, it can't be left out of any fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter at his best","review":"I could not think of a better live album. The sound is great, the musicians are very good and the songs.... you'd better look by yourself. Tony Levin makes bass and stick sound tough and clear. Manu Katche is clockwork and Jean Claude Naimro creates sound ceiling in the concert. But the best is Paula Cole I think. Peter's voice has no changes: the same as always. The compositions are the same as always. The difference is the musicians and their buen rollo. El mejor disco en muchos años. Lo que venga después será peor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert recordings..","review":"I went to see this tour when Pete came to Birmingham in 1993 and I was blown away. This record is good stuff - the recordings sound great, \\"Sledgehammer\\" has got more life here than ever and \\"In your eyes\\" is AWESOME and much longer than its original. It's a shame there's no \\"Biko\\" or \\"Shock the monkey\\" (which Peter actually played when I saw him), but the best thing about this album is the tracks off \\"Us\\" sounds tons better!! \\"Secret world\\" being the best, \\"Come talk to me\\" sounding great also (cool drumming from Manu Katche). I give this album 4.5 stars - better song selection would have been 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal","review":"I'm sorry for the woman who got converted from country music by this album, because there ain't nothing in the world wrong with Travis Tritt and Reba McIntyre, but if this album brought her to the other side of the fence, it was the right one. I'm probably not the only person in the world who really discovered Peter Gabriel when MTV played the \\"Sledgehammer\\" video about 500 times a day for about six months, but once I started exploring I was hooked. I envy the people in Italy (of all places) who saw this show -- I agree with the previous reviewer about the magnificence of \\"In Your Eyes\\", and I would add \\"Don't Give Up\\" to the jubilation -- I suppose Kate Bush can't travel with Peter Gabriel, and I sort of missed her ethereal voice on the song, but the female backup did just fine, too. The bottom line is that Peter Gabriel is one of the true greats of 20th century music, and this live album showcases him at his very, very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Live Music","review":"If you have ever had any kind of reaction to a song of Peter Gabriel's--i.e. if you have a pulse--then this album is for you. This \\"reviewer\\" hasn't attended a whole lot of concerts--I hadn't even heard many of these PG songs previously--but this album has to be one of the best productions of any live album ever. The music, the energy, the band, the production--all combine to make this a near flawless masterpiece of sometimes driving and sometimes reflective emotion. Nothing else--live or studio--comes close. Trust me. Peter Gabriel is a musically and emotionally expressive genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"PETER THE GREAT","review":"I'm not crazy about live albums but this is an alltime classic. I say this because my two top favourite Peter Gabriel songs sound much better here than in their studio versions: Come Talk To Me and Blood Of Eden. There's more passion and more excitement here, I just go wild when I hear the choral break in the middle of Come Talk To Me, it's a truly transcendent experience. All the other tracks are great too, and just at random I can mention Shaking The Tree, Secret World and In Your Eyes. I recommend his album to all lovers of serious rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG VERSION OF IN YOUR EYES. . .","review":"once again, peter gabriel has offered an inferior version of \\"in your eyes\\" and cannot make the connection to the live promo that came from the \\"say anything\\" movie sountrack. the soundtrack promo has spirituality that has not been duplicated since. if one can remember the live video from 1989 that had the version, they will know what i'm infering. there was nothing like the backup singer's voice that carried through the air on that promo recording, it was divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars, I would.","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS LAMINATOR.

Suffice it to say that it is a great rendition of Spiderman and well worth it for any fan to pick up. What I want to pass along is that at least now (with the most recent lower prices on each disc) it is worthwhile to actually buy these as separate volumes. If you want Season 2 (the last season) of Spectacular Spiderman you need to pick it up as four separate discs (Vol 5, 6, 7, and 8). Each disc is now priced at approximately $7 so a full season still costs more than it should have, but if you are a fan of the show I think you will think it is worth it.

Second -The ringer on the phone is very \\"wimpy\\" it can't be heard in the next room even when set to the highest level.

This got me to spur into action... This last summer I purchased the Princeton Review's Cracking the SAT I & PSAT; after thorough studying and practicing I took my PSAT again in October. This time around I received a 1190. Nothing to brag about(I want a 1450 now; I'm planning on taking a course offered by the Princeton Review), but if you analyze this score and compare it against my previous score, you will find a 130 point increase.

I hate how the book never really explained the answer but just told what the correct answer was because it \\"made the most sense.\\" \\"Is a vagrant a person without a domicile.

Even their vocabulary list is somewhat simplistic. Honestly, this book probably raised my score no more than 20 points. A waste of money and time.The practice tests are also not like the actual SATs. If you want to learn about how actual SATs are, don't expect to find the answers in the back of this book.

He's also stated that he \\"loathes\\" rock and roll and wants no part of rock \\"history\\" or the Hall of Fame.So, while I may not love the music bands like MCR make, at least they make music they like and have a passion for. The only thing Lydon and SP \\"mastermind\\" Malcom McClarren had a passion for was defrauding the public and trying to cash in on a punk movement that ultimately died off because of the Sex Pistols and other zero-talent acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMFG THIS IS SO GOOOOD!!!!11!!!!!!1ONE!1!

The songs themselves are great - interesting arrangements, tuneful, echo in the right places to give that mid-60s \\"crunchy\\" guitar and drums sound. The group only issued one more single after this before essentially breaking up. If you have an interest in UK 60s beat-orientated music that goes a little deeper than the usual suspects (early Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks - all fine groups by the way) you won't be disappointed in picking this up at the right price (under $10)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poets","review":"This CD is one big rip off.

In both of my units, the same problem occured, the cable between the battery case and headband failed within months of purchase. I have fixed the cable to prolong the life of both units until it simply got too short to solder. In the case of the last pair that died, a cable became crossed and it nearly melted while I was wearing them.

Lacking examples or much of anything for the reader to bridge the gap his terse prose leaves. A Font so small that indices are lost on some equations. It is no Differential Geometry. The difficulty is not within the subject matter, but with it's meager presentation. Not at all the quality you would expect from this author.

This squeeze bottle version allows application of small amounts more precisely, with less mess. Either way, DuPont has a great product that penetrates easily into most any area. It goes on water thin, dries quickly, and leaves a light, dry, waxy film fortified with Teflon. Though the bottle version is 4oz. it probably will last as long as the 11oz aerosol as there is much less waste.I started using this product to lube O-rings motorcycle chains, at which it excels, but quickly found it a preferred lubricant for most anything that one would want a lightweight lubricant.

Some of Dolenz's singing is not up to the standard he set on \\"I'm a Believer\\" and several other notable Monkees tracks, and some of his compositions are not the most distinctive rock or pop of the mid-1960s, and maybe he didn't know how to play the drums when the Monkees cast was assembled, but Plastic Symphony proves that Micky Dolenz really did have a pop music background before the Monkees.

Hooked up to TV for a few days, then it started skipping and freezing up. Got as a christmas gift, so now we have to figure out how to return it for a refund. Would not recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPRESSIVE LITTLE MACHINE","review":"I liked this machine so much, I bought a second. It never skips and plays everything that is shoved into it. The battery goes a little more than 3 hours, the internal speakers with the little ear piece sound wonderful, the external speakers sound great (though I have always been no more that 3 ft way and have never had the sound on full volume). The slender size you can't beat. You can do everything \\"manually\\" on the machine that you can do with the remote. I'm very careful with both machines, so I'm not sure how it would hold up in a rough enviornment i.e. kids, . I would have never considered a Audiovox, but I checked out MANY machines and read every review. I'm happy with my purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this...","review":"I bought this after considering all brands and thought that for the price this would be a great player. The next day I sat on an airplane for 5 hours. The only problem I had this day was that it would skip once in a while and sometimes the picture and they audio were not in sync. On the return flight there were major problems. I turned the unit on and it worked for about 2 minutes. Then the monitor went out. After planning on relaxing and watching a movie this made the flight very long, boring, and frustrating. I took this player back when I got home and purchased a better brand. For anybody considering purchasing this I have just this one piece of advice. Forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't plan to play rented DVD's on this","review":"This is an attractive player. The accessories were what sold me on it, and I was pleased with the package. I was disappointed, however, when I tried to play rented DVD's on it. It skipped very badly. I contacted Audiovox and was told that this is a low energy laser and that DVD's need to be clean to play in it. The same DVD's that skipped so badly in this player played fine on my husband's Toshiba laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best investment for a young traveller.","review":"We bought the audiovox for our seven year old for Christmas. She's thrilled and we've already had two pleasant, long trips. Easy to operate, perfect size for a small lap, good sound quality and the picture is excellent. I'm impressed with the battery life, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted !!","review":"We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002. In July 2003 the player quit entirely...disc would spin but the screen was flat gray. No picture. Called Audiovox, they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back. Spent $10 to return via ups. They could not repair so sent a replacement. The 2nd one worked until January of 2004, then quit also. This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired (from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement) I was out of luck. I could send it back for repairs at my expense. Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year. Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit. The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This system is outstanding for my use;","review":"After some research on several systems,This product is perfect for my needs.Its been used in both an airplane and car.The size,non skid bottom and accessories were perfect.I have not found another system that offers the extra accessories for the same coast as this.Its perfect for what I use it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful","review":"I have been looking for a portable DVD player for a while.Found this (...)in the target stores during the Thanksgiving Sale. I was a bit skeptical about buying this one, but went ahead and bought it thinking I could always return it if I do not like...I was very very happy with the picture quality, it comes with everything you need (headphones, rechargeable battery) etc. Plays MP3, VCD,SVCD, DVD etc etc. I has a built in speaker too.The viewing angle for the TV is very restrictive, but heck..for the price I paid.. cant expect any more.The rechargable battery costs extra. I had to get it from Audiovox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please avoid this Unit!","review":"I bought this Portable DVD player at Super Target on sale and when I got it home it played very well and had a nice picture until I tried to watch a complete movie on it. It seemed like it got really hot about halfway through the movie and when I tried to adjust the brightness of the screen it was unresponsive. Then the movie froze and totally locked up so I had to unplug the unit and replug it back in to get it to work.I took it back to Target the next day and got my money back. Target gave me a little hassle about paying a restocking fee but I talked them out of it. If it locks up the first time you use it what's going to happen a year from now? Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bang for your Dollar","review":"I have used this for about 2 months now. A friend was so inpressed he bought one too. I take this everywhere I go. While waiting for the wife, I watch a movie in the Van. (Using the Van's speakers the sound is great.) My wife & I took a trip & she used it & loved it. (This after telling me \\"I was wasting my money\\"). The picture is great! The battery lasted through 2 movies. You get everything you need to hook up to your TV or home theater. The remote is a credit card size gadget. It does alot. The size is perfect & feels solid. You can't go wrong with this unit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"I purchased the AudioVox 1680 for a trip to Florida with the grandchildren. We had quite a long plane ride and they were totally consumed in watching Harry Potter. It played with no trouble, but I noticed it was hot when the movie finished. My husband devised a stand that would allow the air to circulate under the unit and it has worked beautifully. I also use it when my husband watches a western on TV. Put the \\"earbuds\\" on and he doesn't even know I'm around. I like the \\"earbuds\\", as they allow two to listen. I think I made a good choice in the AudioVox 1680."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another review...\\"If only it worked...\\"","review":"I purchased an Audiovox DVD1680 prior to a series of trips across the country. It remained in its case whenever not in use, and I was very careful with handling and precautions.Just as with the previous reviewers, all of a sudden the unit started freezing up..then refused to play ANY DVDs. Further, the spinning of the DVDs in the unit started to make a squeaking noise, and I was concerned that continued attempts at getting it to work would probably only result in damage to the DVDs themselves.So, back to Target it went, where it was cheerfully accepted back, and my credit card credited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent Two Back","review":"I purchased this player and it worked fine with movies, but was incapable of playing a music CD all the way through without pauses, glitches and other problems. I wound up sending the first back, got another and had to send IT back due to the same problems playing audio CD's (store-bought.) I also found the Audiovox info-helpline impossible to access either by phone or internet. Too bad, because it played movies just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suprisingly Good Value","review":"I have had this player for three days now and I am very pleased. Image quality is sharp, and I have not found any DVDs it wouldn't play. The sound from the tiny speakers is tinny, but it makes it easier to understand dialog through background noise. I compared this one to a slightly cheaper RCA model. Both could play MP3s, SVCDs, VCDs and DVDs, but in my experienc RCA players don't function as the description or even the manual describe. In fact that ties in to my only complaint, the manual. It contains a good description of playing DVDs, nothing else. No help in formatting MP3 files on CD-Rs or any other reference material. Just DVDs. I was a little skeptical of choosing Audiovox from experience in the past with their stereos, but this player feels solid and well designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Well, I've gone through two of these and both malfunctioned repeatedly. The first unit was a Christmas present. Worked the first time, then would not load dvds (several were tried) and once I got to work again it was very inconsistent, froze up, and often would not load. Put it in the car for our kids to watch in the second seat of our minivan and it took many tries to get it to work.After return to Target got a new one and while this one worked the first few times, it was not possible to hear it at full volume on a plane, a big disappointment. Once overseas, it started freezing up and doing strange things again.I've learned my lesson on this one. The Audiovox is not ready for prime time and i would recommend being very wary of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Audiovox should be ashamed of selling a product this unreliable. I think it worked for the first month and then completely went downhill. One out of twenty DVD's (maybe) will work in it and it's practically brand new.

Amazon.[com] accepted my first return and sent me a new one. The second one worked the first few times, however this one has also begun to malfunction. After inserting a DVD, the player will simply not play the movie. Amazon.[com] would not accept my second return and passed responsibility to the manufacturer.My experience has been very frustrating. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ON THE MARKET!","review":"I have tried them all, and this one works. I have several DVDs that freeze or skip at certain points of play that I tested at several offline retailers as well as Amazon.com. This unit comes through with flying colors. It played them all! The price is right. I highly recommend this DVD player.It also has amazing image resolution and sound. I have this unit next to my bed and use the input jack which is connected to my digital cable. When using ear plugs I can watch TV without disturbing the wife at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Unit Didn't Work Either","review":"...I found that it played maybe 1 out of every 3 dics I put in it, and even the 1 it would play it would sometimes freeze up or slow down. Well, I thought that every assembly line is entitled to one lemon, so I returned it to Amazon. Well the 2nd one has been no better. The first couple of discs did play (one with a couple of slow downs), so that lulled me into a false sense of security. Since then, no disc I have put into the unit has played. Tonight I put a brand new disc of the \\"Great Escape\\" into the unit 26 times and it did not play once.I'm 43 years old and this is without a doubt the single worst consumer product I have ever purchased. As I said above, I'll give every manufacturer one bad product, but not two. And to top it off, I waited too long to really test this 2nd unit out and Amazon won't let me return it.

The website for Audiovox was difficult to navigate and find answers to my questions. The customer service department was rude and not helpful. I had to pay $16.00 just to send it back to them to be repaired!!! I think I'm stuck with a very expensive paperweight. What happens if it breaks after the 12 month warranty? I was very disappointed.

We have only watched about 4 movies on it so far, but every time we do it gets very hot in the base near the AC/DC adapter, and the last time we used it, very hot in the upper left corner above the screen. It works fine so far, although the volume could be louder on the speakers. I cannot believe that it is good for the unit to operate at these temperatures, and with all of the bad reviews, I plan on trying to return mine to Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"After a single day's use the DC adapter quit working.

I'll wait for better quality at a lower price."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Worth the Aggravation!","review":"The product was a good price so we purchased it as an intro to portable DVD players. Not worth the aggravation! Has a terrific picture. Easy to operate. Sound/Volume is definitely too low for some situations. BUT this player gets hot way to quickly! We have placed it in well ventilated areas, raised it, kept the lid open when playing it thru the television -- ALL to keep it cool. Not long after purchasing this, it started to malfunction - freeze up - misqueue dialogue, skip. Then very soon after it simply wouldn't play most DVD's. Discs would spin intermittenly while attempting to load - never loading - no way would movies play. Then a few days later, it might work for a full movie or part of a movie. Then nothing. Exchanged it for another. EXACT same problems. It a shame. It had a great picture the few times it operated properly.

My 2 year old loves a group called the Wiggles. they are from Australia. The Australian format is PAL which won't play on most USA DVD players (home or otherwise).

I think this is an excellent collection, particularly for anyone who does not own any of Peter Gabriel's albums and wants a \\"taste\\" of what his music is all about. I don't understand why \\"In Your Eyes\\" was left out. Not only is it one of the great songs on \\"SO\\", which itself is a masterpiece, it is one of the best of Mr. Gabriel's songs that played regularly on the radio, right up there with \\"Games Without Frontiers\\",\\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\".

I bought the CD entirely because of one song: Biko. To me, this is the ultimate statement by any artist ever of what being an artist is all about. And, above all else, it's about caring what happens in the world. Nothing I have ever read, seen or heard expresses that caring more eloquently or more powerfully than Biko. I'm almost ashamed to say I haven't even listened to any of the other songs on the CD (though, like most casual listeners, I am at least marginally familar with his work). I owe it to his artistry to listen to the rest of the CD; and I will some day. Just not yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of hit but...","review":"If you are a great fan like me and already have all the cd collection, there's no need for this one. You already have most of it, what is missing is \\"Shaking the tree\\"... there is a better version of it on \\"Secret World Live\\", a piano version of \\"Here comes the flood\\" ... there is a better version on Growing up Live (DVD) what's left is a new mix of \\"I have the touch\\" and \\"Zaar\\" which is not a memorable song.Be aware also that some of the songs have been edited to a shorter version.I would add that the hits are not the best songs of Peter Gabriel, the rest of his material is better. This cd is for completist or for someone who want to own only one cd of the artist (which is a mistake !)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaking The Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats","review":"Absolutely outstanding! One of my personal top 5 CD's of all time. If you are not a die-hard Peter Garbiel fan, you really should buy this one.

Although the purist might be offended by the alterations, someone who is not a Gabriel fan will become one after hearing so many excelent tracks all on one CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the new greatest hits","review":"Even though its not a double cd, this cd is special for having the song \\"Shaking the Tree\\". A must in the Peter Gabriel collection. Downfall of this album is the fact that its outdated. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, Gabriel II, Us, So and Up.

Also there's the fan favorites \\"I Have the Touch\\", \\"Biko\\", and \\"Don't Give Up\\", with \\"Kate Bush\\". It's all here and more, and only really missing \\"In Your Eyes\\". Fortunately, he has a new 2-disc collection out called \\"Hit\\", and that has twice what's here, with songs from \\"Us\\" and \\"Up\\", and yes, it includes \\"In Your Eyes\\".

One of the things I most appreciate about this collection is that the songs are not simply arranged chronologically; there is an attempt to mix and match the songs to form a cohesive album.

I gave it 4 stars because they changed their sole. At least that is my opinion. I am going to call the manufacturer to check.

But most of all, when I put them on the first time, my instant response was \\"Ahhhhhhh\\" - they are so very comfortable right out of the box. No \\"breaking in\\" at all.

From the Spanish Civil War to World War II, the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love.Instead, it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism, narcissism, social responsbility, and sheer stupidity. You end up caring less about the characters, andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in. This was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and not very interesting","review":"This period piece seems to run on forever. The characters establish themselves well enough but there is no compelling story to grab our attention. The sets also had a fake look to them - I don't think this was filmed on location.

I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend. She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably. He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie. He has sex with the Charleezz character often. That he knows how to do. And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting. The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused. No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early. Is this the fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan? The cinamentography is lovely. The costumes are fine. The story is ok as well. Its just shown in a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction.

This is alright, but nothing worth writing home about."},{"rating":"1","title":"head in the crapper","review":"The people are pretty, the settings are pretty. The entire first half of the film is devoted to gratuitious sex -- gratuitous because there's no chemistry between the lovers OR between them and the audience. Why would hedonistic Gilda fall for an intellectual cypher like Guy? Why wouldn't he be infatuated with the sex, thinking he was in love with her? I WANTED the erotic scenes to move me; they didn't. G&G move in together, life is boring. Mia moves in, life gets giggly. War approaches, Guy and Mia are suddenly impassioned by it rather than Gilda, who pouts. Yaddayaddayadda. No suspense, no depth of character, blahblahblah. I think the fault lies mostly with really poor directing and editing. Can't believe Theron performed like a such ham after her previous roles. Penelope tried and failed to overcome the script. Probably a 17-year-old would think the story everything that it isn't -- exciting, romantic, sexy, deep....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie, different from the mainstream.","review":"This movie did document one of the most painful events in modern history of Europe.

The primary issues are ...(1) You always have to press the \\"Talk\\" button 3 times (not once) in order to get a dial tone.(2) When a voice message is waiting, the phone beeps loudly every 30 seconds. Very annoying when you let the phone take a message because you are preoccupied or have company visiting.(3) If you have the base wallmounted, the handset does not rest securely in the base -- Half the time it falls off when you set it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is perhaps the worst electronics purchase I have ever made. The phone would sometimes auto answer from the base when you picked it up, sometimes not, so half the time you were either trying to talk into a ringing phone or inadvertently disconnecting someone when you pushed the talk button. A real design innovation. I once pushed the hold button when hanging up the phone, causing the line to be busy for about 12 hours. Why would the hold button stay engaged after a call is ended? It makes no sense. The static was deplorable after a while, and the phone was unusable if you ran the microwave. Was this product not tested? Finally couldn't stand it and replaced it after less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone!","review":"This phone is c**p. It is outsourced to some company and bears the IBM logo, but the quality is low (like a lot of things manufactured in China). My battery died after 5 months and I cannot find a replacement. I talked to the company that manufactures this phone and they promissed me a replacement but I did not get it yet.The headset works only in one position. If the microwave is working in our house, I am getting static. Sometimes you would have to press a couple of times on the Talk button to get a tone.SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless phone","review":"Speakerphone part works alright. If you get the handset to work you have to be right on top of the base unit, sometimes even then it will not work. The phone hangs up on you when trying to connect.

I recommed this book if your a Janeway fan! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Voyager?","review":"Although I have enjoyed Carey's past Trek novels I found this one to be a bit dull. Voyager's strength is in its' ensemble cast. Writing an entire book around one character (Janeway) with no interaction with other crew members is a mistake. And why give so much attention to aliens? I thought a requirement for Trek novel publication was to adhere to Trek characters...not base an entire story on non Trek characters. If I buy a Star Trek book I want to read a story with STAR TREK CHARACTERS. Are you reading this Pocket Books?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something good came out of Voyager? I'm shocked . . .","review":"Incredible. Of all the excellent Captain's Table novels, so far I'd rate this one as the best (although I'm 99.99% sure that Peter David's Calhoun book will utterly destroy that rating). Since I read the novels one after another in marathon fashion, the break from the bar scenes such as from \\"The Mist\\" was welcome, although I can see how as a standalone novel in the series one would wonder, \\"Whither the Captain's Table?\\" In any case, an excellent story and an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"diane carey could do alot better","review":"the \\"fire ship\\" actualy goes down in flames. the beginning of the book isn't understandable and doesn't match the tv episodes in any way. the story itself isn't fluent and doesn't catch the reader. the book could have been writen as a reguler book with more success and not as a \\"captain's table\\" episode. it misses the actual atmosphere of a story told in a bar (e.g. \\"the mist\\"). the book is also acompanied with many spelling and grammer erorrs. i hope carey will do better with her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more original of the latest crop","review":"The Captain's Table series has been a pleasant surprise. Fire Ship with Kay Janeway getting back to basics is excellent. Some of her actions and words don't reflect what we've become accustom to from other books or the TV series. But it's a good diversion.If anything were wrong with it, I'd have to say that the ending was a little rushed. Lots of details in the first chapters but they dwindle in the later ones, left me wanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best addition to the Captin's Table yet","review":"An ever so excelent story. Well executed, and Janeway is excelently protrayed. Just imagin what it would be like for Janeway to lose her ship and be dumped with some backward technological race. It was great, and deserves the best of reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced original story, odd portrayal of Janeway","review":"Although my biggest complaint is that I couldn't imagine captain Janeway doing or saying many of the things that she is purported to have done in this story, overall the story was pretty original. So often, star trek novels fail to flesh out the cultures that litter the stories like so many props. The aliens here are definitely more thought out than normal. Very involving, quite a fast pace and it kept me turning the pages. I would actually have liked it to have continued another 300 pages or so, and then we could really have had something quite worthwhile. Alas, the 275 page limit that seems the standard for Star Trek is still in force here. Still, for voyager fans, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Although not as good as its predeccessor in the series, it's an interesting look at Capt. Janeway in a role of a subordinate peon rather than a fearless, take-charge leader. I could see her confusion as she enters the bar, feel her frustration as she knows the answers but isn't allowed to speak them, and all the emotions she goes through in this book. The story itself isn't as thrilling as Capt. Sisko's, but the way it's told makes it a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had the opposite problem as E. Alpos ...","review":"I was expecting a fun, campy b movie. Instead I got a well filmed low budget chick flick version of a zombie movie that took itself way too seriously. This movie had huge potential considering the story line. It seemed more like a lecture about the bad people who are wrong to hate others. Even going so far as to have the people speaking out against the zombies quote the Hitler. Most of the things they tried to make humorous failed to be funny. I would suggest saving your money if you are looking for a fun b movie. If you are looking for a zombie social commentary, than this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I bought this set a month ago from amazon.com and I've been using it everyday.

It contains just enough pieces to replace some of my existing old pans, and not too many useless pans like in other larger sets. The quality is wonderful - the nonstick is great, cleans off easily even when I don't wash right after cooking, and seems pretty resilient.I love the stainless steel finish - gives these pots a luxurious look. You do haveh to be more careful about not leaving prints on the outside but they are very easily cleaned and dried with a soft cloth. The handles do not get hot, and neither do the lid handles. The pieces themselves are a good weight - not as light as some of my older farberware pots but not as heavy as my cast-iron calphalon pieces.I have not used these in the dishwasher - even if the instructions say dishwasher-safe, nonstick pans never last long being washed in the dishwasher.I got this set with the $25 kitchen and housewares discount, plus another $50 gift certificate.

Flowermouth is full of lavish orchestration, deep and resonating tones and a certain tranquility with a creative calmness all surrounding it. Musically this is deep contemplative music as sung by Tim Bowness put to the creative instrumentation of Steve Wilson.On a number of No-Man albums King Crimson's Robert Fripp made a guest appearance as he did on Flowermouth. Wilson also ropes in the likes of Richard Barbieri , Steve Jansen, Chris Maitland (the usual suspects) to assist in musically portraying this album.And to top it all off Lisa Gerard's voice of Dead Can Dance graces this album on \\"Simple\\".

The Stones and fans talk about how important the 1969 tour was, new guitar player, new live sound, new quiet audience. They were right, sure. But the 1989-90 tour was far more important. They basically got up and played song after song they never played before or at least not in many years. They never sounded that good live. They never stayed in tune thru the whole show before. Sympathy/Devil with the piano and congas just like the studio version. Where's all the songs from these shows???? Where's Undercover, 2000 Light Years From Home, Salt of the Earth? At least they included Factory Girl, good move. I'm glad I taped the Atlantic City show off the air.

The live version of \\"Start Me Up\\" is to kill for. \\"Sad, Sad, Sad,\\" is just so cool. \\"Miss You,\\" not one of my favorite Stones songs, is done so well here that I've changed my opinion about it. Then there is \\"Ruby Tuesday,\\" \\"Factory Girl\\" and \\"Paint it Black,\\" songs that the Greatest Group on Earth managed to make even better then they were on those earlier studio albums. Hard to believe it could be done, but this is the Greatest Group on Earth, after all.

They run through new songs like \\"Sad Sad Sad\\" and \\"Rock and A Hard Place\\" without much feeling, appearing to play them merely to promote the Steel Wheels album. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" and \\"Miss You\\" are play with real fervor though.

As controversial as this process has been with Tangerine Dream, Froese has jumped into the blueprint for change with his solo catalog.While Froese has constantly shown an evolving artistry, the original four numbers - clocking 43:09 - were fascinating in what they represented in their original form (which was some of the best music by Froese).

So there is a trade-off. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars out of 5 because of the audio mastering & 4 out of 5 if the mastering was good. The performances themselves are excellent.

This album features some very good synth heavy songs all performed well not just by Gabriel on synthezizer and piano but by his backing band as well (on mainly nonsynths). Theres no ommisions here. All the best songs from Gabriels solo works up to this point are here and even better in mainly elongated versions plus an additional single I Go Swimming all written by Gabriel (beat that Phil Collins!).

But why take REAL names of REAL people (some of them fortunately are still living) to tell a story which, for the most part, is completely inaccurate. Other reviewers have rightly pointed out the most blatant inaccuracies that this film carries. But as I have seen and met most of the artists involved in the plot (and for some of them - like Muddy who went dining at my home in Lyon (France) - I've had the fortune to know them personally) what worries me the most is that their personnality are also very inaccurate. For instance, Muddy who had an incredible charisma is portrayed here essentially as a very tepid character who thinks mostly to chase women. And Howlin' Wolf - a tough man certainly but a very bright and articulate one - is here portrayed as the terrorizing Wolf he PLAYED on stage and never out stage. The true story of the Chess saga (and the Chicago blues) is yet to be told properly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Much Better","review":"What happened to the Chess Brothers? Was it just Leonard Chess? NO it was not. Can't stand when right from the start they get it wrong. At least mention the guy. And speaking of the guy - what happened to Buddy Guy and Bo Diddley? I guess Phil Chess took care of them. I would have liked to see some complete performances, especially of Muddy Waters. There are too many musicians represented here that deserve a movie of their own. How can so many movies be made this way. They know the facts, but refuse to make it right. What bothers me is that someone makes a conscious effort to do so.I like the music, but I'm not grading the music, I'm grading the storyline - 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic. If You Mean Epically Bad.","review":"I hated Cadillac Records but I stayed with it for the soundtrack and the hope that it would get better. Len Chess isn't the only paternalistic thing about this film. A mishmash timeline of race cliches and lazy storytelling, Cadillac Records can't even be bothered to get it's facts straight. Saving it from one star are the performances of Columbus Short, Mos Def and Eamonn Walker, all of whom are far better than the material deserves. The film provides about as much context as a 1950's Looney Tunes featuring celebrities of the day. Even if one allows for the need to condense a large story into a short time frame, have some continuity of character inside the abbreviated version. Disjointed, relying on race role tropes instead of characterization, Cadillac Records is a lazy film that does a disservice to all whom it portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!!!","review":"It was a great movie...fast delivery & good price.

The casting was excellent - I particularly liked the way Howlin' Wolf was captured."},{"rating":"1","title":"paternalism w/o character development","review":"The music was good. The people seemed real but skin-deep: booze, drugs, guns, stupidity, self-destructive violence and instant sex. There's no depth to any of the characters. The question remains how can you make a movie with Chess treating his artists like children financially (read\\" PATERNALLY), but the movie doesn't make clear if he is scamming them or not. Muddy Waters doesn't seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why. Chess buys him a car as if he's an empty-headed girlfriend, and as such gets paid with whatever Chess decides to give him. Etta James decides he \\"loved her\\" because he left her the deed (doesnt say mortgage is paid off) of a house that cost in 1970 (year Chess died) about $35,000. Chess sold his company for over $6,000,000, and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up. In short, they had an opportunity to make a complex character, and instead make a superficial and (almost boring) one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole lot of mumbling going on","review":"The music is good.

Had even half the energy employed in fabrication of events and relationships been turned to representation, this picture could have been great.As it stands, it is merely OK, and an insult to those who it alleges to portray.

To see it unfold in a well made movie version was awesome for me. Most movies leave some things out but at least this was well done. Do Chess's family really want the real deal out there where as this movie is nice to him but we know in reality he cheated his artists. That part is glossed over. It is being reported not only here but in the news that it is not 100% on the mark so I say to viewers keep that in mind with any movie based on or inspired by a true story. Facts can overload and take away from a story.

Jeffrey Wright is one of the best actors of this generation. His ability to metamorph into each character he portrays is always believable and refreshing. Immediately, you understand the complexities of Muddy Waters and his passion for the blues. Beyonce also delivers a believable performance, transforming into the broken young Etta James. This is one of those movies that can be quoted for ages from Beyonce's line, \\"You bettin' a thousand on being wrong\\" to Wright's, \\"You ain't hungry, but you ain't ate!\\" Newcomer Chyna Layne should be looked out for in upcoming films and Columbus Short and Eamonn Walker offer the greatest character polarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions gone awry","review":"I looked forward to seeing this movie - but it was a huge letdown. Besides the historical inaccuracies as detailed by earlier reviewers here on Amazon - I felt the actors chosen to play these music icons weren't based on ability, but to try and get a younger audience to pay attention to the film. Mos' Def is NOT an actor in any way, shape or form - his portrayal of Chuck Berry was wooden and inaccurate. On the other hand, Eamonn Walker's take on Howlin' Wolf was STUNNING. I'm sure the makers intentions were good - but the obvious budget restraints and poor choices in actors left me feeling like a great opportunity to shed light on an otherwise under-documented period of music history was squandered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cadillac Records","review":"The movie was informative as a history of the blues but did leave a few things unanswered.Overall it was a good movie and if you like the blues, the music is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT","review":"This is such a great movie! Everyone in it did a fantastic job! I've seen it three times and it's one to own. The music is great, and even Beyonce - who comes in about two thirds into the movie - is the best she's ever been. Columbus Short was my favorite. His Little Walter was a trip. And Howlin' Wolf was scary. Mos Def was great in his short role of Chuck Berry. I think it should have been in the theaters much longer and promoted more. There are so few movies with a black cast that aren't comedies. And Jeffrey Wright was great as Muddy Waters and Adrian Brody was very believable. My Mom and boyfriend loved it also.

I can see doing that for a few scenes for an emotional look, but after a while, it just got to be ridiculous.That being said, this thinly veiled account of Motown Records was pretty fascinating!

And like any good movie, it gives the viewer a sense of time, place and character while telling a compelling story. This movie does so brilliantly. The acting is impressive - and why not? Jeffrey Wright and Adrien Brody are respected actors. Beyonce steps outside her comfort zone and gives a performance one would only expect from an experienced actor. The music is performed with love and respect. The sets, wardrobe, cars - everything gives you a real sense of the southside of Chicago in the 1950s, and of the people who not only sang but lived the blues. Don't quibble over details; go read a book on the history of Chess Records if that's what you're looking for. But if you are looking for a compelling story with a strong script that is well acted and directed, and so much more deserving of the little attention it received when it was in release, then you must see this film.

Played against the backdrop of race relations in American society of the 1950's, the movie provides insight on the inner workings of the music industry and how talent was not always all that an artist needed to get play time on the radio. One wonders what path the Blues and it's transition and effect on popular music would have taken if not for Chess Records.

He said he was getting a lot of calls with the exact same problem and suggested I return it and try another device.

Both machines are reasonable quiet and create a sharp pencil point but they do have one small disadvantage. Both machines have small catch basins to hold the shavings that tends to fill up after 8-10 uses, which is unusual for the Heavy-Duty model. So if you do allot of sketching consider yourself warned.

I am a regular reader of short novels published on New Yorker and seems most stories in this book were published there, according to the introduction. I have to admit that I still could not understand why Ms. Munro is such a big figure in North America's modern literature world. The stories are full of too many pieces of ordinariness and dullness, and make you feel the heaviness of your life. Her stories makes you feel like, \\"Why do I have to read in words about some DULL things I've seen/experienced in my life?\\" By the way, I've lived in eastern Canada for 9 years and have very warm feeling towards that region.And her writing is also so plain and REGULAR!

Why would the baby be hers in any way??? Bizarre, just a weird thing to say. And the end was very annoying, when Anne and Gilbert fight to get Green Gables back and then decide to move away!!!

It's not even a good film by itself - the plotline is really silly and none of the characters or their actions are at all appealing - as another reviewer has said, the part where she gives away Green Gables is just WRONG.

When they showed Green Gables in ruins I felt like someone punched my in the chest.I wanted to barf at the thought of Anne and Fred together! Anne would never do that to her dearest friend, or her beloved Gilbert. I won't even go into the Jack nonsense. Anne would never be attracted to such a loser.Oh and the wedding! Or lack there of I should say. Nothing from the books. Nothing. In this dumb movie they had a quickie wedding so Gil could go off to war.They also took out all the national pride.

Anne, Gilbert, Diana and Fred are all present, but that is the only resemblance to the book this movie has. One of many low points was Anne going across Europe by train dressed as a nun, drinking liquor from a flask (not kidding).

How many times did she interrupt legitimate work to ask where her husband was? Was he the only man in the war?THE UGLY: This character (and the plot in general) proved to be too unbelievable for my liking - Anne would have more common sense than to endanger others lives and her own for a nonsensical rescue mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewer discretion is advised!!!","review":"If you loved the first 2 annes, do NOT watch the 3rd one. Personally, I think the movie should be recalled by the FDA due to the hazardous and painful effects on the hearts and minds of Anne fans everywhere. Might as well watch Anne and Gilbert get divorced. That actually might be less painful. They should just remake it. I'll chip in my $0.02(literally and metaphorically) to help fund a redo of the 3rd one; and they should only release it to the unsuspecting public if it's deemed viewable by Anne fans. Anyone want to petition/hold fundraisers for a remake? In the mean time, just reread the books and use your Anne-like imagination.Dear Mr. Sullivan-In case you are listening--I have GREAT ideas for the remake, just email me and we'll talk;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the real deal, but not bad","review":"I am an avid Anne of Green Gables fan. I've read the books and own the two box sets of the movies. I can't tell you how excited I was when I heard there was to be another Anne of Green Gables movie coming out. I waited in anticipation to see it. Although I must admit I was a little disappointed this movie diverted from the books, I did enjoy watching it. It would have been nice to have the story follow the books and pick up with Anne's married life with Gilbert in Avonlea. Other than that, I thought this movie was done fairly true to the feel and tone of the orignal movies. The music, sweeping views, and nostalgia were fairly well represented. I was thoroughy excited to see the original actors in the first two set of videos return to play their characters. For me there is no other Anne Shirley, Gilbert Blythe or Diana Barrie than played by Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie and Schuyler Grant."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they do this???","review":"I was so disappointed to see this movie. I loved the first 2 and was pleasantly surprised to see that a third movie was being made. But, this one had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the true Anne story. I know the first 2 movies had small variations but this was total fiction. I can't believe the took the story of Anne and Gilbert and made it this way. What a sad day for Anne fans when this movie was made..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne 3:","review":"I have to say this is a great movie, unlike the first two, this one holds it's own. It seems to be a darker more sinister side to the \\"Anne\\" tells, but it's story is great and well worth seeing.The only part of the movie that I found disturbing was when Anne \\"gave\\" Green Gables to Diana, that was totally disappointing and wrong. I felt as much as Anne fought for and loved \\"Green Gables\\" she never would have given it away, not only because she spent some wonderful years there with Marilla and Matthew, but because Gilbert bought it for her. To give it up like that was just out of context and didn't fit well in the story line.Other than that little blunder, it was a great movie and I recommend it to anyone that loves a tale of heroship, war and the true worth of the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shock!","review":"Watching Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea, was always a favorite activity for myself and two of my nieces (aged 12 and 10). When I got a hold of the Continuing Story, they insisted we watch it together for the first time. We were in for a shock! I had to completely calm them down before they went to bed - for they have of fear of terrible nightmares. I enjoyed it - but there should be some kind of warning that this installment of the movie, may not be appropriate for younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing!","review":"I like Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series of books and I loved the movies Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea, The Continuing Story was on TV the other night and sadly I have to say I was disappointed with it, it was dull, had no resembalance to the books or the other movies and I was so bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and sad","review":"Sure the movie isn't in line with the books but if you consider it as a separate entity, it's really a beautiful story.

About halfway through the movie, I had the most confused look on my face. Sure these were the same characters, and the same great actors portraying them, but what in the world is this story about?I was looking forward to having this third movie pick up where the last one left off or at least keep true to the books by L.M.M. It was such a let down after expecting a great closing movie after all the years Anne of Avonlea first came out. By the end of the movie I felt no closure whatsoever. It was as if Gilbert and Anne were still standing on the bridge at the end of the second movie. This just isn't how the Anne series was supposed to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne The Action Hero","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this movie. They might as well have called it 'Anne The Action Hero'. Instead of staying true to Lucy Maud Montgomery's story, Anne and Gilbert go off to the war, the war their children were actually fighting. Instead of seeing Anne and Gilbert settle into family life with their children, the writers instead made up this crazy movie with so many plots and basically a lot of chaos. It was so sad to watch this movie knowing that they had officially ruined the Anne of Green Gables trilogy. Sadly too, the movie was made so many years after the second one that Anne looks very aged. It would have been much more appropriate to follow her family life and watch her children growing and all the great adventures they had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Adaption Award","review":"This movie based on a book should at least have some recognizable story threads from the original. This movie did not. It felt like the Scouring of Avonlea. It is depressing with such an out of character and time period soap opera storyline. It starts with a feminist conflict for Anne at a publishing house in New York, then drops that to move into the anti-war war plot. Anne the romantic goes to the battlefield chasing Gilbert, gets roped in as a spy (a naive, incompetent one, don't get caught drinking Anne-nun) and has some \\"McGyver\\" moments. Rooming with Fred and Jack's baby was the worst example of out of time period behavior. I could go into all the details but that's already been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash - completely abandoned the true Anne","review":"As a young girl, I read these books over and over and over again. I cried when Anne's children died and I laughed when she dyed her hair green.After watching this movie with another Anne fan (who hadn't read any of the books) I was simply appalled. This is completely contrary to the original story-line and demeans the innocence and virtue of a truly wonderful character.It pained me to see how Anne and Gilbert behaved here while knowing in my mind how things should have unfolded.If you're a true Anne fan, please just skip this entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! No Stars For You!!!","review":"I grew up on the first two Anne movies and all of LM Montomery's works and this movie just sucked. Big time.

What a disappointment it was.There could have been so many other ways to write the third installment of this beloved story but, this writer decided to start a whole new story using Anne and Gil in totally different unbelievable tale of war and unhappiness.Would have loved to have seen Gil and Anne live at Green Gables, raise their family and have such friends as Morgan Harris' sister, a librarian, and Katherine as a school head mistress in Avon lea.This movie has been so disappointing to me it is almost traumatic.Please everyone save your money. I wished i had listened to others before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far from the books.","review":"This last installment of Anne on PBS was a complete disppointment. This movie marks a complete departure from anything vaguely resembling what LM Montgomery wrote.The inconsistencies are glaring. Diana and Fred living in Green Gables? Gilbert being the one going to war and Anne following as a nurse? Not even close. By WWI, Anne and Gilbert had been married for years and had 6 kids. The kids are the ones who fought in WWI.There are other problems as well with this movie and it is directly related to the writers not following the books. The movie does not have the same joy and charm that has been attributed to the other 2 movies.If you have not seen this movie and are a fan on Anne, stick with the first two and don't waste your time on this poorly conceived last movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong in so many ways","review":"Im only giving it one star because the option of giving no starts is not available.I too was totaly disapointed in this film. The only thing that resembled the Anne of Green Gables series was the names of the charachters. Why the producers decided to go so far away from the series story....I have no idea. It's the wrong time frame, the wrong story line, the wrong character profiles. They set Green Gables on fire for goodness sake...absolute sacrilege. They set the timeperiod in WW1, with Anne and Gilbert just getting married. Please!!!! In Rilla of Ingleside (Montgomery's last Anne book), Anne's three sons go to fight in the war. The first two films were perfect so I don't know why the producers had to ruin it. What were they thinking? I can only hope that someone else will redo the series and include the great stories that begin in Anne's House of Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"For any real fan of Anne's, this film is a mammoth disappointment. It doesn't follow the books AT ALL, but goes off on an improbable storyline that is both absurd and unsatisfying. In addition, for those who have read the books and know that Anne's SON goes off to fight in WWI, the idea that she follows Gilbert to Europe in the fracas is ridiculous. The only plus to the movie is seeing Megan Follows play Anne once more. She's so good at it... my reccomendation is to BORROW the movie from someone to watch it. It's not worth spending your money on. Hey, if you want the VHS, I'll GIVE it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Anne Fan","review":"I have been a devoted Anne Fan for as long as I can remember. I grew up watching the movies from the age of five or six, and I have read all of the books so many times that they are falling apart. So naturally when I heard that a third movie about my favorite literary character was coming out, I was so excited I could barely wait until it aired. What a disappointment that third installment turned out to be. While I was very happy that so many of the original cast were involved, I was upset by the extreme departure from the story line of L.M.Montgomery's books. The magical feeling of the first two movies was not present in the third. The spirit of Anne was gone. Plus, the time frame was completely off. In the books, Anne and Gilbert have sons fighting in World War I. Not at all consistent. The movie did have its good points. The acting was well done, and the scenery was lovely. But for such a long time fan of Anne, it was not what it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is not for the deaf to enjoy, because no CC","review":"I am a deaf person and really enjoyed watching the first two movies with closed caption. I'm very disappointed that this movie don't even have closed caption in it. I noticed that the ones with closed caption have Walt Disney label on it. Obiviously this one doesn't. I know other deaf people would enjoy watching it. BUT it will be disappointing for them not able to watch and understand the movie. So I'm asking you PLEASE consider to have your movie closed caption. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total departure from what we all loved...","review":"I have to wholeheartedly agree with all of the negative reviews of this movie. Disappointing is not even the word for this movie! Why was it made if they weren't going to do it right or stay true to the books or the television movies that we all grew up loving? This sorry excuse for an ending to a trilogy of sorts was painful to watch. It was obvious that this adaptation was trying so hard to be something that it was not. For stories and characters this beloved by so many people, it should be a crime to put something like this out to fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This movie wasn't based on LLM books. Even so it was great, full of excitement, laughter, and the beautiful romance between Anne and Gilbert. The ending was rushed and so was the wedding scene but the parts with Gilbert and Anne made up for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick review","review":"This sequel should have been called \\"Anne of Gone with the Wind.\\"It had no light-heartedness of the first two movies, but I tried to like it. It had a sappy ending that made me cry the first time I watched it. On the plus side, it's better than the last season of \\"Buffy.\\" I know all fans of \\"Anne\\" are going to watch it, so brace yourself and try to remember the good times."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it! Wish there were more...","review":"I love all of the Anne of Green Gables movies! I was afraid this one would be different because it came out several years after the 1st 2 movies. It WAS different, because much of it takes place overseas during WWI, while Anne tried to find Gil, but I still loved it! I am so glad they used the same actors for all three movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest and most disappointing conclusion to a series ever!!","review":"I received the triliogy of DVDs for Christmas this year and was so excited to finally see the finale of Anne of Green Gables. I had heard it wasn't as good as the first two but I thought I'd give it a chance. I wish I had that 3 hours of my life back. This has forever tainted my impression of the series- I wish I could erase it from my memory. If you love the first two, just don't watch the last one. It isn't worth your curiosity. I cannot even rate it one star. It is that bad. I don't know what Kevin Sullivan was thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shocking heartbreak","review":"To a stranger who has never been in the world of L.M. Montgomery's novels, this movie would be systematically constructed, with enough romance and intrigue to satisfy anyone. However, myself, being someone who has read and loved all of L.M. Montgomery's books since I was young, this movie has been a heartbreak. I had in my heart a perfect mirror of Avonlea and all of Anne Shirley's doings. Marilla and Rachel Lynde lived in Green Gables while Anne and Gilbert moved to Four Winds. There was no war, no going to New York (which inflicted a horrible modernish streak to the setting of dear, old Avonlea). To add events at the end of Montgomery's books I could tolerate, but to smash them in the middle does not fit. I was in a state of shock; my mirror smashed with events that I could never imagine would have existed. A stranger could never see a crack in this mirror, but a kindred spirit can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Sullivan sold out!","review":"Think about it, the 3rd movie in the series comes along approximately 15 years after the other 2. In my opinion, Kevin Sullivan saw that the popularity of the first 2 beloved movies was still strong, and decided to capitalize on it. But instead of understanding that the reason people loved the first 2 movies was the simple elegance and innocence of the story telling and setting, he decided to take the \\"Hollywood\\" route, and make a war & violence tale. I guess following the stories in the book series (Anne & Gilbert get married, settle down, have a bunch of kids) was too boring, and didn't have the $ making potential for Mr.Sullivan. It's a shame, in the quest for the almighty dollar, he let down a lot of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are Anne and Gil?","review":"...certainly not in this dismal disappointment of a follow-up to the previous 2 films. I have never read the \\"Anne\\" books but I have fallen in love with the characters as interpreted in \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and \\"Anne of Avonlea\\". Unfortunately these characters do not appear in this third awful film. Anne has none of the charm, imagination or wit that she had in previous films, and Gil is barely in the film at all. Why in the world would anyone make a continuing story and then leave the main characters stranded in a dull plot, bad dialogue and minimal interaction? Badly done all around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPOINTMENT","review":"3 Days after seeing this \\"Movie\\", and I'm still mad! How in the world did this happen. This movie has nothing to do with the spirt of Anne of Green Gables. Oh it's so bad! So sad that someone could have taken such a sweet gentle story and turned it into this mess! and sell it to the public as an Anne of Green Gables sequal. GRRRRRRRRR! Save your money and your time, Run from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter TRASH","review":"Anyone who was ever read the Anne series is well aware that WWI didn't occur until the final book of the series, Rilla of Ingelside, and that skipping the ten to twenty years between Anne of Avonlea (upon which the second movie was losely based) and going straight to war is just ludicrous. That and moving the story to New York. Please!!! Did the writers of this junk ever even both reading the books??It's an insult to Anne fans the world over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Fiction with Anne Shirley","review":"First I have to say that I am an Anne of Green Gables book fan. I've read all the books several times. We all know that movies WILL BE different from the book upon which it is based. But this movie is a version of fan fiction. Kevin Sullivan took the AoGG characters and wrote a whole different story from anything L M Montgomery has ever written!! There is no resemblance between this series (movie) and the sweet flavor of the first two AoGG series (movies) he produced. If you are not a book fan you may enjoy this movie... if not, don't waste your money and read the books again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disppointed","review":"I was so shocked as I watched Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story, This is not Anne and Gilbert's Story.We had waited so long, and were over the moon when we hear that Part 3 was on its way.To be honesty, Mr Sullivan you should NOT have bothered and got our hopes up so. Rilla,s story yes, difference characters a whole new story great, but this was not Anne of Green Gables. It is so out of sync.Buying it was a waste of money, watching it a waste of time for LMM lovers and any one who loved and cherished the First two parts. If you just HAVE to watch it borrow it from the Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STAR OPTION PLEASE!","review":"It's been several years since I watched this movie on PBS for the first time. I can't tell you how excited I was to hear that the final part of the AGG Trilogy was finally here! I even convinced my husband to watch as he knew how much I loved the first two movies. Til this day, I still cringe at the memory of that first viewing. WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! For some strange reason, Kevin Sulliven chose to completely abandon the books and concocted this cheap melodrama that has the most random and ridiculous story line. How completely tragic. My husband was also in complete disbelief at how bad this final movie was; he felt very sorry for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mangled masculinization of Anne","review":"I have LOVED Anne of Avonlea, and LMM's other works. They are set in a very idealistically peaceful and simple setting, with simple adventures. And the simpleness and peacefulness of the stories are one of the most aluring attributes to the story. But this movie was none of that. It completely mangled LMM's work into a masculinized, bloody, explosion filled adrenaline pumping, conspiracy theory guy's movie, completely destroying the sole of the characters and the real heart in the Anne stories. It doesn't fit with the rest of the series at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this movie and read \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\" instead","review":"\\"Rilla\\" is the 8th \\"Anne\\" book, and beautifully tells the story of Gilbert & Anne's family during World War I. It is extremely well written and covers this era of history in a compelling way. It may be the best book of the series, as it brings the beloved Anne into the \\"real world\\" yet remains true to her character. Again, skip the movie...but read this glorious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth missing","review":"Unfortunately I saw this movie on the shelf and just grabbed it up, thinking it would be just as heartwarming as the other two. WRONG! The acting is terrible and the story is depressing. Not recomended at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking.","review":"As a movie in and of itself, I thought this was passable, but I can't understand why it was made when it had absolutely nothing to do with the books. The first two movies at least stayed true to the feel of the books, even when because of time, and trying to condense things, many events were changed and condensed into one. I guess I just dont' see the sense in making a movie with these characters just for the heck of it. Even the timeline was WAY off. Anne and Gilbert's children were grown during WW1, they were involved, not the parents. If they wanted a war movie, they should have used the delightful characters of Anne's children. This also would have been more concinvcing, with Megan Follows as a fourty something mother, than a twenty something girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story","review":"For those who fell in love with the first two installments of \\"Anne of Green Gables,\\" you need not waste your time on the final. Although it was good to see the main characters, Anne and Gilbert, marry, the Continuing Story is so far removed from the previous stories that viewers will find it difficult to connect them. The richness and wonder found in the first two films are totally absent in the final. After watching Continuing Story, I immediately threw it in the trash, then watched the first two again, and \\"pretended\\" the third didn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I grew up reading all 8 books in the Anne series so I was hopeful that this one would follow the books kinda like the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea did. First of all they fast fore-ward the time like 20 years and then the charachters don't stay true to who they are in the books. Anne seem to consider infidelity!!! This movie is a major let-down. In the books Anne has 7 kids with Gilbert (only 6 live) and her life continues as she sends her sons off to war-she is too old to go herself!!! Anyhow, I wish they would have followed the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be OK if it wasn't called Anne of Green Gables","review":"This is the kind of adaptation that I really can't stand - Kevin Sullivan simply borrowed beloved, developed characters and then wrote his own story about them. I can only assume he knew calling her Anne Shirley would help this slanted, outlandish story sell. None of the characters in this movie share anything with Montgomery's characters except for their names.Montgomery left a legacy for Anne, not to mention a mountain of other works, so to create an Anne like this is not only a complete departure from the character her creator wanted her to be, it is a departure from any political or cultural view Montgomery had.Sullivan might be a good story teller, but in order to find out, he needs to create his own characters and not steal ones created by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT watch this movie","review":"I'm an avid fan of the Anne of Green Gables. I love the books, and I loved the first two movies.This just happened to be on PBS one night, and I proceeded to watch it, and become so disgusted that I had to re-read all of the Anne series (starting with Rilla of Ingleside), to wash away the memory.While this movie contains characters named Anne and Gilbert (and even Diana) - it has NOTHING to do with the Anne of Green Gables series. It doesn't follow any of the stories from the series, and the characters don't even act like themselves.Not only was this disappointing and upsetting, but that the director who did such a good job on the first two movies could make the mess that this movie is, is quite bewildering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected (or hoped for)","review":"If you have not yet seen this movie, I would recommend that you rent or borrow it before you decide to purchase it. Hoping this new sequel would pick up where the movie \\"Anne of Avolea\\" left off, I was disappointed to watch and discover that the movie doesn't even show Anne and Gilbert together that often. The wedding that \\"Anne\\" fans have been waiting for was brief and rushed, lasting about two minutes of this three hour movie. After the wedding, the next scene the viewer sees is Gilbert going off to war. Honestly, I think my husband would like this movie more than I do given all of the war scenes. Though I enjoyed seeing the old cast reunited, I didn't feel that this movie was very true to the characters from the previous movies, and certainly not from the books. I plan to sit down and watch \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and \\"Anne of Avonlea\\" all over again so that I may recapture the sweet romantic sentiment that this movie lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left Unseen","review":"This is the only movie in a trilogy that I have ever seen and then wished I had not. As a great fan of the Anne of Green Gables movies, and of Anne & Gilbert in particular, I was expecting more of the same heartwarming and genuine storytelling that I had come to love in the first 2 Sullivan films. However, dredging through 3 hours of this movie was more of a laborious affair than anything even close to enjoyable. Pity that Anne fans should be left with this sorry installment of a movie. To those of you who have not seen the movie yet - if you don't want to end your memories of the Anne series on a disappointed, heartbroken note, I would like to recommend not bothering to invest the time and toil that this movie entails. Incidentally, the warm cover on the videos/DVD is a gross misrepresentation of the actual tone of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP! . . . You really need to read my review . . .","review":"I am like you at this very moment, you don't want to believe the reviews you are reading. . .but they are TRUE!I read all the reviews here before I purchased \\"Anne of Green Gables-The Continuing Story\\". I didn't want to believe what I read, because this is Anne of Green Gables, the last two videos were GREAT, why wouldn't this one be too? IT IS NOT WORTH IT!, please trust me on this.The beginning part of the movie is really nice to watch. . .then the war begins, Gilbert leaves and Anne leaves to go find Gilbert. And I am waiting and waiting for Anne to come back to Avonlea, but that never happens. The rest of movie is nothing but WAR WAR WAR. My wish finally comes true, Anne and Gilbert both comes back to Avonlea, but it is the last 10 minutes of the movie. THE END.Please, please do not waste your money. Just watch Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea over and over because those are the only two classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible","review":"Not even Megan Followes could carry this off. It totally departs from the story and the heart of the originals. I couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. There was still plenty of material the writers could have drawn from, so I have no idea why they just made stuff up rather than draw from L. M. Montgomery's work. It was banal, boring, and for someone who really loves Anne, a travesty.Only get this movie if you know nothing about Anne of Green Gables or L. M. Montgomery. Other than the fact that the characters are named Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley and that they occasionally and briefly visit a place called Avonlea, you would never recognize this movie as having anything to do with the originals. That is because it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment . . .","review":"I eagerly looked forward to viewing \\"The Continuing Story,\\" but ended up hugely disappointed. Kevin Sullivan did not follow the continuing story of Anne and Gilbert as written by L.M. Montgomery. Instead he came from left field with a thin plot he devised and actually thought we would fall for it. Skip this film and read the books instead. You will find them far more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunker!","review":"I have been reading the reviews and I am glad to know that I am not the only Anne fan who didn't like The Continuing Story! The books are magnificent and the Canadian mini-series Anne of Green Gables and Anne Of Green Gables The Sequel (Anne of Avonlea) were really good and Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie were great as Anne and Gilbert but when I sat down to watch The Continuing Story I was very, very, very disappointed with this boring clunker of a movie! I really agree with the reviewer who said she felt like the director threw out the books and came up with some action and adventure war movie! Gone is the charm, the wit and sophistication of the books and the previous entries in this movie trilogy and I can't recommend this disappointing movie to anyone! Also what was with them trying to make that this movie only took place a short time after Anne of Avonlea when it's so obvious that the actors have aged a lot since that time, especially Megan Follows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"Wow. This movie was awful. I didn't read the books, but on its own, the movie is still incredibly sad. The dialogue is weak, the plot completely ridiculous, and even the acting was pretty atrocious (apparently all Megan Follows can do is hold people's faces in her hands in every scene.) Plus, Anne and Gilbert look to be about 35. Avoid seeing this movie - it is a waste of three hours of your life, and it doesn't actually in any way continue the story of Anne or Gilbert or anyone else. It is a shoddy attempt at making some kind of dramatic war movie, which Kevin Sullivan clearly isn't cut out to do. I enjoyed immensely his first two Anne films as well as his Avonlea series - he should stick to what he does well, because this is just plain embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!","review":"A crime against the \\"Anne' series and an insult to the talent of Lucy Maude Montgomery!This movie has nothing to do with the Anne stories! Waste of time, film & talent :( SO SAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but still up there","review":"This movie is the 3rd of the films where Anne is all grown up. Her imagination and talkative self have settled down but the temper is still there and the adventures are also. The War was very historic and made the movie a challenge but not quite what I was expecting. The first two are the best and the third...well it is the third. So please enjoy the movie and you will see a bit of the young Anne in a few scenes which makes it seem like the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious!!!!","review":"Besides the obvious disgrace of the plot and character assassination, I was surprised that not many people mentioned the actual jump in time. The first novel is placed in 1878. How could Anne and Gilbert be in their 20s by 1914? That would be 36 years after Anne came to Green Gables, which would make her in her late 40s by the time the war begins. Does that mean they had a 20 year engagement? How does that make any sense? I think they could have done so many wonderful things with this story and they wasted the opportunity. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just all messed up.","review":"I liked having some of the old characters come back. But this is a complete departure from the books. If someone is going to take the trouble of making a book based movie, they ought to take the trouble to make it at least SIMILAR to the books! I suppose war and blood sell over at home adventures. There are so many wonderful things in the other books they could have chosen from to make another movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not true to the book","review":"I don't know if anyone making this film cared to actually read the books before making this movie. In the books it's Anne and Gilbert's three sons that go to war, does anybody care that the movies just skipped about thirty years? And what was up with that Jack guy? He wasn't in the books and he ruins the innocent \\" Anne\\" feel of the movie, not that there was much of one to begin with. But I have to admit that the movie itself was OK, if you think about it as just a war movie and not an Anne movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but so far off","review":"the movie was good but it was so far from the book it wasnt funny. anne and gilbert get married just before gilbert goes off to WWI. when he goes missing anne joins the red cross to find him. in the book it is anne's sons that go to war not them. the movie also portrayed anne's best friend, diana, marriage to be on the rocks. in the books diana and fred's marriage was perfectly happy. i also thought that the actors were too old for the ages they were supposed to be. this movie should have been filmed right after the last movie. it would have been better, esp. if they would have stuck to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't they get it right?","review":"Ok, so we want to be able to see what happens to Anne at the end of the sequel, instead of just reading about her. But why on earth couldn't the makers of this film get it closer to the books?The things that Anne and Gilbert end up doing in this film are what their children are supposed to do!So it might cost more money to introduce new characters, but as in the books, you don't actually see or hear about most of the older characters anyway, so new characters have to be developed.They wouldn't have had to cover the whole time of the children growing up, but at least put the story and original characters (Anne and Gilbert) in the correct historical setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Bad and I Have Heard That Even Megan Follows Thinks It's Bad!","review":"First off I want to say that I loved the books and I loved the movie Anne Of Green Gables and Anne of Green Gables the Sequel but I absloutely hated Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story. It was very unfaithful to the books and those two glorious movies and was a a major let down and a major yawner! This seems more like a gritty war movie that men would like instead of a romance movie that us girls would like. And by the way I have heard and also read that even Megan Follows who played Anne has admitted she disliked this movie and was very disappointed with it so when a star of a bad movie admits that it's bad then you know that it must be true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the books, or the previous movies.","review":"Why this movie was made I will never know. While somewhat entertaining, this movie had nothing to do with the books and didn't even feel like the two previous movies. While the first Anne movie follows the book very well, and Anne of Avenlea is enough like the books to keep you from being angry, at least it has the \\"Anne feel\\". THIS movie, doesn't. Unless you are just a huge fan of the cast, or like to fantasize about what might have happened had books 3-8 not been written, then maybe you will be a little entertained. Otherwise, watch the other two movies again and save yourself the dissapointment this movie will bring. For those of you who have never read the books: Gilbert never goes to war, the war isn't even mentioned in the books, Diana and Fred don't have trouble in their marriage, and Anne never gets her manuscript stolen OR dresses up as a nun to save some child the director invented."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking??","review":"I am also a guy who loved the first two movies. It was a real treat watching these masterpieces with my wife and children. And then this hideous third go round comes along and I have to agree with everyone else. What was Kevin Sullivan thinking? When David O. Selznick produced Gone With the Wind and Rebecca, he made the BOOKS! Why? Because people loved them and wanted to see these stories on film. Both went on to win best picture of the year. So Mr. Sullivan takes Anne out of Avonlea in this third installment and makes her a spy in Europe????? The endearing Anne in the first two movies is nowhere to be found in this embarrassing mess. She is so serious and not very likeable and the story????????????? So what if Selznick had taken Scarlett O'Hara and made her a mud wrestler? Or had the second wife in Rebecca become an opera star? Ridiculous? You bet. I rest my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!","review":"this movie is TOTALLY OFF! and it skips a huge amount of time. the great world war (WWI) doesn't take place until Anne's kids are old enough to fight in tha war and get married. not when she and Gilbert are. so this story has nothing to do with that of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. if you've never read teh books, it's a pretty good story. b ut if you have, don't bother. i wont even let anyone in my family buy it for me even though they know it will complete my set. don't bother with it if you are a true L.M. Montgomery fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed, BUT...","review":"It's true that this film has nothing on the first two Anne movies. Not worth purchasing by any means. However, I did borrow a copy of it on DVD from my library and there is a 12-minute clip as a Special Feature of Marilla's death and various other occurences; the twins Davy and Dora, Rachel Linde, selling Green Gables. These are from the series 'Road to Avonlea' entitled \\"Old Friends, Old Wounds\\". I have not seen it myeslf, but it seems that this series is more like the first two movies, and truer to the books than this third one...something I will probably look into to help get over my disappointment in this film!Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Established Characters.","review":"The first two \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" movies were terrific. Interesting characters carried you to a nicer place. This movie has more turmoil and disputes, rather than charming predicaments. Did not continue the characters of Green Gables for me.This movie should have been made with new actors, rather than the Green Gables cast, so that fans would not expect the charm of Avonlea to continue; which it does not here. However, if you have not seen the first two Anne movies, this film may be fine for you, and better than other things on TV today. I do recommend \\"Road to Avonlea\\", seasons 1-6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I adore the first two movies. I began watching this movie and was so totally bored and disappointed...I never finished it. To make this short and sweet...I do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think Lucy Maude would like this \\"adaptation\\"","review":"I was a true \\"Anne\\" fan growing up and loved the first 2 movies, so I was excited to see this one come out. It was nice to see the old characters, and even Mrs. Lynde makes a welcome appearance, but overall I was disappointed with how much liberty was taken with the story. I much prefer it all as LM Montgomery wrote in the books and maybe being so familiar with the books was what spoiled the movie for me. I would have to say that the movie did not have a cohesive storyline, provided too many unanswered questions and unbelievable coincidences, and the character of Anne had sadly lost her magic and her spunk. Megan Follows and the rest of the cast tried, but they just had nothing to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"if only I could give it a lower rating","review":"I waited almost a year from the first preview of this movie to when it was actually shown on CBC. I was SO excited at first but then as it seemed to be delayed for so long I became concerned that it was not going to live up to my expectations. It turned out to be even worse than I could possibly have imagined. I can't begin to say enough bad things about it; Anne drinking? Anne swearing? Anne flirting with adultery? Any one even remotely involved in the making of this travesty should be ashamed of themselves. As the credits rolled when it finally ended I only wished that I could wake up and find that it had all been some horrible dream and I still had a chance to make it the way it should have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Suited for the Landfill","review":"This movie was so disappointing I threw it in the trash. It is not even worthy of passing on to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did they come up with the plot?","review":"Well, I finally watched this and I just can't figure out how the writers went so far away from the plot of the books. I would have much preferred for them to have continued the story the way it was meant to be instead of making up something completely new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible...but not great, either","review":"I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies, and was thrilled to hear about a third being made. I missed its airing on TV, but found it here on Amazon. I'm not sorry I bought it, but let's just say it's...well...pretty sub-par. The whole thing has a very slapped-together feel, and even though the film is 3 hrs., the pacing is WAY too fast considering that they're throwing you into the events of WWI. I had no idea where anything was, who anybody was or why they were doing what they were doing...and what's worse is that I didn't care. It's a shame because the premise is a good one...and they have the strength of the returning actors. I still recommend this to anyone who's a big fan of the films...just seeing Anne and Gilbert together was worth the money for me. But it doesn't hold a candle to the other two movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moved to tears","review":"I can not think of a worse idea than to ask an actess to come back and play an old character when she is quite clearly 20 years too old to pull it off!! I was so upset at how much this movie had lost the charm that is Anne of Green Gables I will never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I would rather watch a documentary about the rate that toenails grow in a day observing them for a whole day. It Is Horrible! Do Not Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"First of all this movie in no way goes by the other books of Anne Shirley. I read every book and the movie goes no where near it! Second, there really isn't any comforting aspect of this movie except in the end.Thirdly if you're going to make another movie of Anne please go by the books. Gilbert in no way goes into WWI, it was their son and it was disappointing to see none of their children they were to have in the movie. She has about 6 children. Come on. What happened. I'm a big Anne Shirley fan but I just couldn't take the way they took liberties with the story. Lucy Maud Montgomery would roll in her grave watching this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good movie","review":"I have never read the books but I have seen all of the movies. And I gotta say that anne 3 definately tops all of them. I'll admit the war story is a bit odd, but the romance is enough. The love Anne and Gilbert share in this movie is very special and it makes you wanna go out and find your Gilbert Blythe. There are a lot of kissing scenes but its so cute. The best parts are when Anne find Gil after singing their wedding song and when Anne wakes from a bad dream and then tells Gil about it and then Gil promises her that he will find Dominic and then Gil wraps his arm around Anne. But where was the wedding? I mean we have been waiting for this moment for a long time. And instead we get a lousy 15 minutes. Hmmm. >:[ But all in all this is an awesome movie and you should buy it! Its so touching and heart-warming and romantic.<3"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Series","review":"Most viewers tune into this video to see more of the wide-eyed optimistic Anne Shirley. Anne is all grown up in this series and is facing marital separation, World War, adversity and lost love and friendship. All realities of living during the First World War. This is not sugar-coated, which may be a disappointment to many viewers. I feel that the circumstances of Anne's youth helped her to be the mature, strong adult that you see in this part of the story. I just loved seeing her develop into this kind of woman. This is a mature story with mature storylines. I'm so glad we got to see Anne as an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"My husband, our 18-year old granddaughter, and myself just love Ann of Green Gables. We've seen them all, and never grow tried of watching them. If you're interested in G-rated movies, then this is a wonderful choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited to receive great product!","review":"I received my DVD very quickly, in great condition, and in good packaging. I thoroughly enjoyed watching my purchase and thank Amazon for being so prompt and professional in handling my transaction. I'm very satisfied and will use Amazon again for future purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Anne of Green gables and Anne of Avonlea that I personally bought new VHS tapes for my friends to watch. I was overjoyed to see that a sequel had been made to Anne of Avonlea. I was however, terribly disappointed at how P.E.I. was no longer the main setting in the third movie. How could they have thoughtr of digressing from Montgomery's story? I think it was such an injustice!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped after the 2nd","review":"Very disapointing sequel not up to the same quality as the first two. Tried to turn it into an action adventure. Anne is no longer cute, charming, and talkative but haggard, dull and quiet. The entire movie was depressing and unrealistic. I wish I never saw it; it spoiled my memory of the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATROCIOUS!! ..IF you are a true Anne fan..don't bother","review":"I stayed up until 1:15 am last night to watch this! WHAT a disappointment! The persnickety, feisty, silver-tongued Anne Shirley somehow morphed into a dull,drab \\"superwoman\\" wannabe in this movie. Anne goes looking for Gilbert overseas during WW1 dodging Germans, bombs,imprisonment and the like. It sounds exciting but frankly it is preposterous, drawn out and lacking the character development that we all know and love about Anne of Green Gables. If I wanted action and adventure I would watch Stallone or Schwarzenagger. VERY far removed from Green Gables. If you love Anne of Green Gables and it's innocence , romance, and larger than life characters...YOU WILL HATE THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Anne and I love the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies, but this lacks the spark of the prior movies and the director's insistence on ridiculous coincidences is just beyond realism and ruins the story. I know Anne has to grow up, but this doesn't match the true character of who I believe most of us feel she is and I am sadly disappointed. I wish I would not have purchased it first and I will forever end my memory with such a bittersweet way. I give it two stars only because I enjoy seeing the original actors in the movie, but I regret my purchase and would have just stuck with the original movies and never watched this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Think L.M. Montgomery Would have Liked This Movie!","review":"Anyone who has read the graet book series by Lucy Maude Montgomery and seen the original two movies that starred Megan Follows as Anne will totally hate this wretched movie for the way it abandoned the books and those movies and made something that is intirely a different story and a boring pretentious artzy fartzy movie that should cure your insomnia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible ending!!!","review":"I would give this NO stars if I could! What a disappointing ending! I loved & followed every episode on TV & then bought the DVDs. I threw this one away after watching it. I figure I could be like Anne & DREAM of the way it SHOULD have ended! If you love the first two DVDs DO NOT SPOIL THE OTHERS BY BUYING this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has nothing to do with the L.M. Montgomery Series -- and bad screenwriting to boot","review":"First, as others have pointed out, the story isn't a continuation of the Anne novels by L.M. Montgomery. It simply has nothing at all to do with it, although the characters have the same names.Second, the screen-writing is terrible. (And the plot is weak.) That's what comes of trying to imagine completely new contexts for old characters, and trying to tie them together using phrases/expressions from the older films. So even if one tries to forget the books, it's still a disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not read beyond the first 3 \\"Anne\\" books...","review":"but I did not like this movie. The time sequencing was completely out-of-whack. \\"Anne\\" and \\"Gilbert\\" were too mature to be believable as mid-20-year-olds. It is obvious that much of the success of the first two films came from the tried and true words of L.M. Montgomery. In fact, Kevin Sullivan deserves a great deal of credit for introducing \\"Anne\\" to millions unfamiliar with the novels; the accolades he received were well-deserved. Perhaps he felt the need to top himself, who knows? Unfortunately, this film is an embarrassment. The plot is completely unbelievable, just like _Scarlett_ (the sequel to _Gone With the Wind_)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark to be part of the series","review":"I have to agree with the general dislike of this movie. I just think it's too much of a departure from the antics of younger Anne to be considered part of the series. It's completely different and there's nothing enjoyable about it. The entire movie is dark and gloomy, with nothing funny about it. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't make sense","review":"An interesting observation I made, being a big fan of the \\"Avonlea\\" series, was that Kevin Sullivan addressed Anne and Gilbert's relationship when the Gilbert character appeared on the episode to attend Marilla Cuthberts funeral. There was mention that Anne was unable to attend because she and some of their brood was ill. So why would Kevin Sullivan write a totally different and unbelievable story in this third installment, in which the characters don't even fit into the time period? I'm sure he must asked himself that question as well. The fact he flunked on \\"Anne of Green Gables, The Continuing Story\\" production doesn't take away from the fact he produced two wonderful Anne of Green Gables productions and a great family friendly TV series based on Avonlea. \\"Wind at my Back\\" based on the Depression is also a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not based on the books!","review":"I was a little too excited when I heard they were making another Anne movie.

I recently saw the first and second movie, own the second movie, and wanted to purchase the whole set;but then I just saw the third one -- Its a good thing I viewed this movie again to remind me of how bad it is, stopping me from owning the third one. I was so disgusted with how Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story lacked so many elements that made the first two so wonderful. This movie came out 13 years after the second movie and the characters not only have aged but have changed so much. It is not at all interesting for the audiences dedicated to the first two. However, on the other hand, if I were to view this one with no connection to the first two it would be okay. I was just not interested enough to watch the third one again or own it because it is so different with dramatic changes and the characters or scenes do not grab your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy sequel","review":"This movie is so crappy, I don't even know where to begin. While Kevin Sullivan's first two movies did deviate somewhat from the books, the spirit and charm were maintained. None of that was there. In this movie, Anne is turned into a whiny alcoholic who seems to have no control of her own life. She certainly isn't LM Montgomery's Anne. And why do they have Marilla die of some stupid disease?! In the books, Marilla lived into her 80s and got to spoil her adopted grandchildren. Honestly, if Sullivan wasn't going to follow the books, he shouldn't have made this atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Disappointment","review":"I LOVE the Anne of Green Gables series, I own Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea on DVD and I cherish them both. I watched The Continuing Story when it first aired on television and I was heart-broken. It strays from the books, and it felt like such a departure from the other two stories. Even the actors reprising their roles didn't quite fit. I was so sad! I wanted to love it as completely as the first two stories, but I kept getting distracted by Anne's now raspy voice, as if she has smoked quite a few more cigarettes than she should, and by Gil's sickly appearance. I really worry for his health and lifestyle! I recommend buying the first two movies in the series without hesitation, but skip The Continuing Story for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"Like many other Anne fans, I was excited to hear that a third Anne movie was in the works, and I watched it on PBS when it first aired. Even my attachment to the characters and interest in the first world war could not make this tripe enjoyable. As many others have already mentioned, there were four more books from which Kevin Sullivan could have drawn, but instead he made this awful mess. If you are a fan of the books, save your money. There is nothing of LMM in this film and not even the charming Follows and Crombie can save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth my time","review":"I have watched the first two movies in this series more than once and enjoyed them.

I know that most movies based on books don't follow the book exactly. Even the first two in Sullivan's \\"Anne\\" triliogy didn't follow L.M. Montgomery exactly and I didn't mind too much because the spirit was still true...this doesn't have ANYTHING L.M.M. in it AT ALL!!! K.Sullivan should have just written new character names as well and given it a different name, but to pass this off as the work of L.M.M. is ludicris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give this zero stars if possible!","review":"After cherishing \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and the sequel for many years, I couldn't believe there would finally be a third!

When the Sullivan website confirmed the rumor and said it was coming soon, I couldn't believe my good fortune. I had yearned for more so intensely, it felt like I wished it into reality! I could not have been more dissapointed. Please don't buy this if you love the \\"Anne\\" movies! Borrow it from the library if you must. Seeing the old characters is all the pleasure you'll get from this. It's a complete failure that should go the way of \\"New Coke\\"!

After all of these years I have waited for the grand finale to the Anne of Green Gables I and II saga, I saw you tear apart L.M.'s precious, imaginative Anne-world. The adulterous tones you suggest are maddening. Anne would never do that, never in a million years. Thank you for catering to the part of the population that enjoys adultery, nudity and violence. You tarnished the innocence of what you had originally created in I and II. Thank you for not following anything L.M. wrote for you to follow. All you had to do was follow the book, not rewrite it.

I own all her books, though many are out of print and have been for years (such a shame!). I LOVED the first two movies, though they are not entirely faithful to the books, they maintain the beautiful vision of dear Lucy. This new 'sequel' is appalling. Where on EARTH they came up with this horror, I'll never know. They kill off Marilla, leave Green Gables in ruin, and attempt to get Anne to cheat on Gilbert. Add some bloody horrors of wartime, and you'll be ready to hunt down the miserable cretins who have disgraced the name of one of the most beloved authors of all time. Megan Follows and the cast should be ashamed as well for giving such a despicable story life.

I was bitterly disappointed and wanted to kick myself for spending the money to buy it when I should have just rented it. So, that is my advice, before you make the mistake of buying this movie, RENT IT FIRST!!! That way you can decide whether it is worth your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"The characterization and plot of this story are so different from the first two miniseries that it can hardly be called a sequal! I'm not a purist, but I think that a screenplay should at least be faithful to the spirit and vision of a novel/series, and this one fails miserably. The characters have the same faces, but their personalities have changed. They have been time warped from the late 1800's to 1914, and their behavior is unfaithful to their former portrayals.

I'd started watching it about a week ago, and didnt finish it until last night--that's how uninterested I was by it.

This continuing story, sequel or whatever you want to call it should never have been made. Megan Follows' performance as Anne Shirley is horrible. This is not the Anne I remember from \\"Anne of the Green Gables\\" I am sorry to say. Her face and voice have changed radically. Megan Follows really did not age well. Her voice sounds like she's a \\"two-pack-a-day\\" smoker. It really is sad. As for the actual story I can only say that it borders on the ridiculous and ludicrous and reeks with mediocrity. The World War I sequences are foolish and laughable. The several coincidences that occur throughout this story are beyond all credibility. Sequels like this often destroy the original. I hope this does not affect \\"Anne of the Green Gables.\\" \\"Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story\\" will be an eternal disappointment for many of us who loved Megan Follows in the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the books","review":"The Continuing Story WAS butchered.

Both movies are romantic and show the beauty of a simpler life. In the Continuing Story, Anne is not the young, attractive lady she once was and Gilbert has lost much of his handsomeness. Anne has a romantic intanglement with a Jack Garrison and it seems as though she is shown more with Fred Wright than with her beloved Gilbert. This moving is not heartwarming and sweet like its predecessors, but haphazard in plot.

The line was pushed with the Anne of Avonlea film by mixing the stories up so terribley, and straying so from the true plot, but this.. this is heart wrenching. I pity anyone who wastes they're time with this film, you're in for nothing more than disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Well, I haven't seen it, but my beloved wife has got me hooked on the whole Avonlea etc and after buying the first two, I was ready to buy the third and last installment for her(me) for Valentines' Day.However, after reading all the reviews, I have NEVER seen such a broad consensus of the quality of a movie as 'The Continuing Story'. Perhaps that's because the first two are so moving, funny, and charming. As many reviewers have mentioned, they've been poisoned by a regrettably poor final installment to the series and would have rather ended it at Sequel 2. And that is how I plan to live the rest of my life.
