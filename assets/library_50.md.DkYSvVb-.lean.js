It's true, A Match & Some Gasoline should've been used to destroy this album and the master tapes. I've been a Suicide Machines fan since day one and this new release is beyond terrible. Sure, the lyrics are great as usual, but that's not enough. The music has no hooks and nothing to pump your fists to. I was so bored listening to this cd. 45 minutes of my life I'll never get back--BOO-YA!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!!!","review":"This album blows my mind everytime I listen to it. The Suicide Machines have finally made an album comparing to \\"Destruction By Definition\\". It's incredible.

The idea is fill the bottom half one-third full of water and the top part with butter and place the top upside down in the water.

It looks like the butterfat is seeping into the cracks. The glaze is not thick enough.I think the butter keeper made of glass should eliminate that problem. I found one on amazon (Glass Gadgets 1096 The Only Glass Butter Keeper), but it's not available at the time of this review.The Norpro Butter Keeper holds 1 stick of butter, which is just the right amount for me. As soon as the butter is finished, the butter keeper is washed and filled up with the new stick. I think the reason why some reviewers have a problem with mold is because they keep the butter in the dish for too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Keeper","review":"Folks, this is a neat little keeper. We always seemed to have an open stick of butter on the counter sitting open to the air. It was just convenient. Margarine is DEATH so we exclusively use real butter for all that we do; cooking, toast, whatever. This little keeper looks great and has the capability to hold one full stick of butter. The bottom accepts a half a cup of cold water, the top with the butter cup gets filled manually with butter and then sits upside down in the shallow water which makes it airtight and will keep just like that on the counter for a month! We really like it! We are gadget folks. The four stars is just to indicate how marvelous items are in relation to others. Not the most remarkable item in the universe, but very cool.

I even bought my brother one for his kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I am dissapointed with the Norpro.

I have no idea why but the butter continuously slipped out of the bell into the water...it never kept the butter in the bell no matter what the temperature in the room was.

My Sister turned me on to the butter bell keeper and I love it!

I was used to leaving my butter out on the counter on a plate, but found that the butter went sour after about a week in this high heat/high humidity environment. I'm a big fan of baking my own bread, making my own breakfast sandwiches and schmearing my sandwich bread with butter before adding the mayo and mustard. This butter bell keeps my butter fresh and tasty, while allowing me to spread it with ease. This is a fantastic product that keeps butter schmearable and allows the butter to stay relatively fresh for more than a week. Buy this. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's perfect","review":"I've never had a butter crock in my life, and I don't understand why these went out of \\"style\\".

My husband is usually not so easily convinced that what I think would be fantastic will actually be anything more than \\"just another gadget.\\" He has said at least 5 times in the last two weeks we've had this that it is, hands down, his favorite gadget in the kitchen. Our butter stays fresh and it's always spreadable. It could be more simple-looking for our taste, but I've never actually been too concerned with putting a stick of butter onto a plate, so this works just fine for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counter Butter Dish","review":"Yes, it does work.

One word of caution: be SURE to change the water as directed (at the most, every three days) If you don't, you'll get mold on the butter.

I am going to see if they manage to get hers to her without it being in shards before I order replacements for myself. If they don't change the way they package them they certainly would be broken again. Unfortunately, I also ordered one as a gift which was sent directly to my friend's house.

But a small price to pay for the convenience it offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold in the Clay","review":"I've had no problem keeping butter in this crock in both hot and cold weather. Unfortunately, butter was once left too long and got moldy, since then it is impossible to keep it without it quickly growing mold (tried using salted water but that didn't help much). At this point it seems that mold has infiltrated the tiny cracks in the glaze and can not be eradicated.

I'm not sure what the differences between \\"stoneware\\", \\"ceramic\\" and \\"porcelain\\" are as to butter bells (or even if the manufacturers are applying the labels correctly). All have failed after a number of months.In reading reviews on Amazon, it seems that butter bells often have quite finite service lives. My experience was similar. Apparently, (i) the glaze on the ceramic often develops small cracks, and once it does, (ii) butter gets under the cracks, and (iii), once that happens, butter placed in the bell will quickly go moldy even if the bell has been washed in the dishwasher.Ironically, I don't have any problem if I just leave the butter out on the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spread the joy","review":"I love spreadable butter.

I remember my Mom having one years ago, but I never thought about buying one since I would just soften what I wanted to use in the microwave. Now softened butter is readily available. The butter cup holds 1/2 cup of softened butter. I usually put in about a 1/4 cup which works well for the two of us since we don't eat a lot of butter. I fill it all the way when I know I will need softened butter to make a compound butter such as garlic basil butter (great on grilled corn on the cob). Then I take half of it out and put it into another bowl to mix with the other ingredients.This is a plain but nice glazed stoneware set that looks good on the counter or the table.

So instead of giving off French Country, it was throwing shades of American Gothic, if that makes sense.

I leave it near my sink area so I don't forget to refill it with cold water. I've use it almost daily and I've had zero problems with it.Edited to change rating and add:After a while of using this butter dish it's very inconvenient if you don't use butter frequently. Keeping the water fresh is key but it will only keep it fresh for so long (a few days) - then the butter becomes too soft and when you open the butter dish it will fall out back into the water dish. After a lot of consideration I just bought a tub of butter spread that keeps in the fridge, and I can use when/as I need (which is not often)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for research","review":"I purchased this for the purpose of a research paper in my graduate music history course. This was a piece i was focusing on, and was excited to learn of its existance. The electronic tape recordings were all remastered, and all of the original harpsichord parts were individually recorded. and it all sounds crystal clear. the 2 tracks at the end with the parts separated is a nice addition.It also comes with a poster that you have to tape together, and has many interesting entries from those who are still alive and were present at the event. Obviously this recording is only meant to document the event and give you an idea of it, not let you really experience it like it was meant to, and with that in mind, it gets 5 stars from me.now to go finish my 12 page paper...."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual but entertaing stories","review":"3 short and amusing stories about love and the curious things it does to us.very quick to read the stories are quirky and fun to read.although the theme is about how heartbreaking love can be, i felt a lot more deeper issues were the main focal point.recommended for those seeking to understand love a bit better only to realize how impossible love is to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgently slow and vastly boring","review":"If this is an epic, it only qualifies in terms of the challenge that a reader faces in finishing it.

I cannot understand all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Ending Ruins this Book","review":"I loved this book until the very end. Then, boom, the narrative unraveled completely. The revelations of the last few pages of this book are forced, do not flow from what went before and turn the heroine from a strong, intelligent woman into a self-deceiving victim.One wants to ask the author what happened? It's as if one person wrote 99 percent of the book and somebody else took over and finished it up (with no concern for continuity of character or events)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all what I thought it would be","review":"I thought this book would be a good read -- an interesting look at turn-of-the-century American politics -- some kind of insight into industry or the struggles of women/working class. Instead it's a cheesey romance, with a narrator who is melodramatic and silly.. The plot is romantic drivel -- men doing evil, women suffering, then dying. It may succeed as genre fiction, but the hpye and publicity lead you to believe it to be another kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite as dull as a history lesson told by a computer","review":"I rushed out to buy this book. I dove into it that night. I cringed when I read it.The book is long, drawn out, and boring. There are no secrets which are not overly predictable, there is no action that isn't broken by paragraphs of background. She seems to have created three characters, and then gave them new faces and names whenever she needed a new one. And her years of research? Other than reading biographies of the 'real' main characters, I couldn't see any. There are several factual errors a brief glance of a tour guide of Buffalo would have fixed.I have no clue what the hype is all about. City of Light was as enteraining as a plate of sawdust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance Novel diguised as Literature","review":"This was probably one of the most disappointing books I have ever read all the way through to the end. It was my book group's selection, so I was determined to finish it, no matter how awful it continued to be. And that it did. The entire novel strained credulity - how is it Louisa got to be 30+ years old, and never had so much as a kiss exchanged with a man? Then suddenly, two marriage proposals in the course of a summer! And the references to a \\"Boston marriage\\" - is the reader to believe that Victorians were so open about homosexuality? And that a woman like Louisa, so intent on propriety, would encourage such an assumption? We are hardly that tolerant now. All in all, a waste of time and money. Get it at the library, if you have a few days to squander."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had difficulty staying with the drama. Too slow.","review":"Having lived briefly in Buffalo, I looked forward to revisiting the city and getting to know her better through this book from a native. The plot is as thick as soup and I can't get it stirred enough to see what is in it. Honestly, I just don't like the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a superb book.","review":"The setting is Buffalo at the turn of the Century, Niagra Falls, and the development of hydroelectric power. The story is compelling and suspenseful, the characters are extremely well developed, and the descriptions are vivid. I feel as though I were there. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended, with reservations","review":"\\"City of Light\\" is a wonderful, richly detailed evocation of a fascinating time and place; what it isn't is a great mystery. I'm a huge fan of the mystery genre, and would have preferred either more surprises, or revelations that were...well, surprising. That said, Belfer knows how to write, which is in itself a blessing these days. Worth the time, but don't expect plot twists and shocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes You Back","review":"Wow! What a time-travel trip! Now I feel like I spent a few days in the early 20th Century. This is a well-written historical novel, with characters real and imagined. It's very thought-provolking when you really stop and think about the lives of women in this era....we have come a long way...and it has not been easy. The only disappointment was toward to end, but when it was over, I wanted more! Maybe this author is working on something similar. A fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A beautifully written, fascinating novel about the meaning of electricity to society in 1901. A book worthy of the highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"first-rate historical fiction","review":"My idea of a first-rate historical novel is one which educates the reader with facts while entertaining the reader with a good story - learning while being entertained. Very true in the case of this novel. Buffalo - the city we use as a synonym for horrid winters - is depicted in a different light, and the author writes vividly of what must have been a most beautiful city. She has made the topic of electricity one of interest even to those of us non-scientific types - and instilled a desire to visit Niagra Falls! Very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather easy to skewer the dead","review":"I wish I could rate this book with no stars! It lifts present day views and sensibilities and places them a hundred years earlier. I would be mortified if any of my relatives were portrayed in this book. Many liberties with real people have been made. Was Grover Cleveland a rapist? Does he deserve to be portrayed in this manner. Many others fare much the same. In the end, I was frustrated with the silliness. I must say I would never suggest this book to anyone, although Elbert Hubbard does get a nice, if somewhat flat, portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, engrossing and entertaining","review":"This is a really enjoyable page-turning summer read. The author's sense of place makes the reader feel they are really in Buffalo at the turn of the century. My only complaint ws that I felt the \\"mystery\\" behind Grace was a little far-fetched, but that is minor compared to the general enjoyment of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific tale of intrigue and murder!","review":"This fascinating novel provides a wonderful mix of period authenticity, richly limned characters, and an original story laced with intrigue, passion and murder. Belfer's novel brings to mind, by its various strengths, the work of Henry James, Jane Austen and E.L. Doctorow. Altogether, this is a terrific read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Mystery and Drama","review":"This is quite well-written for a first novel. The mixing of history, women's issues, drama and mystery go well together.The story takes place in Buffalo, New York at the time when electricity is beginning to be harnessed from Niagara Falls. There are some murders in Buffalo and the headmistress of a girls' school attempts to get to the bottom of things. There is a lot of personal and political intrigue. Real historical figures merge with fictional ones.This book is a gem and I look forward to future novels by Ms. Belfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Novel!","review":"Having grown up in Buffalo (and still a die hard Bills fan!) I appreciated the historical turn of the century authenticity and detail. At the same time it's a great novel and a fun read in its own right. Congratulations to Lauren Belfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo at it's best!","review":"Anyone who has spent any time in the Buffalo area should read this book! It ties fact w/ fiction in Buffalo in 1901, when this city was truly a force to be reckoned with. The author does an excellent job making the reader feel as though they are actually strolling through Delaware Park or exploring the Falls. I was disappointed with the ending, as I feel the heroine could have made better choices and changed her fate. All, in all I rate it 4 stars for this first-time novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete fabrication","review":"This book is about my family, and it really hurt us to both read this book, and to have our whole home town suddenly believe that our great grandfather was some sort of pedophile. Please read the giant disclaimer in this book. She made the whole thing up because she thought it would make a good story (which it didn't btw, and that's from a literary standpoint.) She didn't do her research, and upon meeting her and her mother at the Garret Club in Buffalo she was rightly embarrassed because she hadn't even bothered to find out if there were living descendants effected by her book. Poor literary skills, poor research skills, and poor ethics. Two thumbs way down.PS Amazon made me give at least one star. I wanted to leave it blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped in Buffalo","review":"I've started this book several times, and put it back on the shelf.Finally I decided to stick with it, and I'm halfway through the novel.I don't understand why this rated rave reviews (they're all over the cover of the paperback edition). As a mystery, the story is not particularly compelling; I find myself not caring whodunnit or why.Some of the details concerning how electricity was considered controversial was interesting. I enjoyed reading about the PanAm exhibition. But I'm struggling to finish this overly long and belabored story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,boring, boring","review":"I gave up on this book after sloggingthrough the first two hundred pages.I simply couldn't bring myself to careabout the self-righteous heroine and her problems. The pacing was glacial,even the details about the developmentof electricity at Niagara Falls weredull, and I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dry as sawdust is too kind","review":"I must confess that I lived in Buffalo for many years. But that has nothing to do with my view that this book is so pedantic and slow. Idid not live there at the turn of the century but I hoped she would bring it alive. As Stephen Crane once wrote, most people write about history as if they are coroners embalming a corpse. That's what we have here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"I couldn't have been more disappointed. I ordered what was advertised as a brand new hard cover copy. Which I intended as a Christmas gift. The book I received is old, rounded corners, and packaged very haphazadly. There is no paperwork what-so-ever in the envelope to assist in returning. I will attempt to contact the shipper. I hope I didn't throw away good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffalo, NY is the real protagonist","review":"Although the writing was technically perfect, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading an almanac or tourist guide of Buffalo, New York made into a novel. Add to that the first person narration by a character I found to be unsympathetic and unrealistic... let's just say that I was not enthusiastic about finishing.The very detailed rape scene at the hands of a former president (confirming the painfully predictable plot) was the final straw... I could not make myself finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for me.","review":"I found the subject matter of Buffalo and Victorian era very interesting, but the book really didn't grab my attention until I was three quarters of the way through it. Way too much \\"cloak and dagger\\" stuff taking place for my taste. Every look, Every Move, Every Action seemed to have some mysterious dark overtone to it which made it very distracting to read. The plot does not merit such a long and cumbersome book. This could have been wrapped up in much fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"An editor neglected to do his/her job!","review":"City of Light was very poorly written. Endless descriptions (throughout the entire novel) did nothing to add to the author's long drawn out plot. Although premise, characters and settings might have had potential, Lauren Belfer needs to learn to write from her heart. She also needs to learn what it takes to engross a reader. I reluctantly read every page...only because it was a book club assignment. I don't recommend you do the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction at its best!","review":"Gave a great picture and feeling of life at the time of the building of power plants at Niagra Falls.

Background information about Buffalo during the late 1800's is very interesting for someone being from the area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started out strong, and really grabbed my interest and held me. But the last fourth of the novel was hugely disappointing. I loved the development of the interesting characters, and the descriptions of NY during the dawn of electrical power. But the fascinating murder mystery was tied up in a way I found hasty and unbelievable. And the story's ending was depressing and anti-climactic. Why introduce two romances and spend pages developing them only to have both of them go nowhere? Why get us to invest our sympathy in the life of a charming and courageous heroine only to have her make mundane choices that result in such a dull and sad ending?Though I enjoyed most of it, I would not recommend spending your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"City of Light","review":"Probably the best book I've ever read!! The history of Buffalo, as related in this book, has been the topic of many onversations with friends, as well as elderly relatives,who remember many of the original locations and events. The plots and sub-plots both fascinated and amazed me as I tried to pin a description to this book : romance? mystery? history? straight fiction? None of the above fit. This is a story that describes money and power so well....and how closely does it fit the behind-the-scenes events still going on today in any city....and country? I will read this book again after a tour of the City of Light to marvel at what Buffalo once was!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're going to Buffalo","review":"If you're planning a visit to Buffalo -- a visit that I would recommend to anyone who's interested in late 19th and early 20th century architecture -- you'll find that this book provides a great deal of local historical color. Otherwise, however, it's basically a primer on how NOT to write a historical novel. Here's what you don't want to do: First, create a preposterous, sprawling plot that serves mostly to introduce a dizzying array of actual historical figures, albeit obscure ones to anyone outside of Buffalo. Then include a lot of wooden dialogue spoken by two-dimensional characters, and be sure to sprinkle your text with anachronisms (who had \\"brunch\\" in 1901?). And make sure your narrator spends a lot of time on historical exposition that makes no sense, given that she's supposedly addressing a more or less contemporary audience. I could go on, but you get the idea. It's a shame -- there's some interesting raw material here, and it could have been a good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book of historical fiction","review":"Just finished City of Light and thought it was fascinating. What a great way to learn about historical figures, electricity,Niagra Falls, Buffalo New York and the list goes on. The vocabulary was stimulating and the writing was excellent.I loved the main character and of course the setting.I also read her second book A Fierce Rafiance and loved it as well but in my opinion this one is far superior.Both are great to keep you googling about historical facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much doesn't lead you anywhere","review":"I got this book mostly because it was labeled as the New York Times notable book, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Though everything started out lively, with a fun mix of fiction and historical setting, it didn't last long. About 1/3 of the way I started skipping paragraphs and even pages. The author tends to give a lot of unnecessary details about things and people completely irrelevant to the plot, and it gives the book a monotonous, boring feel. The plot was a see-through, and most of the times you could guess the next \\"culmination\\" before it even happened. To finish it all of, the book gives no real closure to the whole story line, instead going into pseudo philosophical conclusion. All in all, a huge letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"city of light","review":"The product, city of light, came in excellent condition. The book was most interesting as I was raised in Niagara Falls and so much of the story line was familiar to me. The book was historical, adventurous and mysterious. It came very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but still worth reading","review":"I found this book to be a real page-turner (I read it in one sitting), but it could have been more than that if the author had concentrated on her theme of power and possession instead of the mystery story. I don't know about the rest of you who've read it, but I could spot every plot development well before it happened - not much of a mystery. Anyhow, the rest of the book was great, especially the section called \\"Possession\\" which had fascinating ideas on how people can be possessed by ideas, by other people, by their circumstances in life; and about who \\"possesses\\" nature. The character of the narrator, Louisa, was very well-drawn, substantial, recognizable, and interesting. Overall, I'd say read this novel for its interesting ideas and main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was silly, but I read the whole thing","review":"I wish I'd seen the customer reviews before I bought it, all the reviews I read led me to expect more than this silly little historical romance. The imposition of today's more liberal views on the society of 100 years ago has been done before and done more skillfully. Character development was uneven and the plot was obvious. Nevertheless, I read the whole book. It was uneven and disappointing, but I enjoyed parts of it (Grover Cleveland was hysterical) and I hope for more from the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"just stick to your historical romances...............","review":"Triteness is the adjective that would best describe this turkey. Initially, I was drawn to its cover. Believing that perhaps it would provide me with an interesting mystery of the Victorian period, I soon realized that it was actually a historical romance with people in it who were basically uninteresting. I found the writer's detailed descriptions of the electrical plant and all the references to the falls boring, very boring, and along with her tendency to tell her readers more than they probably want to know, she managed to alienate me also with her insufferable stuffiness regarding her 'salon' or is 'saloon'? Wasn't she the gift of all of Buffalo because she was the mistress of the girls's school???? I kept reading in the hope that it would perhaps improve, but like all historical romances it never went anywhere......the only difference was not everyone lived happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Light from Buffalo","review":"CITY OF LIGHT is like Buffalo itself. A dreary, tired recasting of events and perspectives in the lives of tedious people. It's not worth the time or the energy to read. Western New York at the turn of the century may have excited Belfer but her excitement is like Western New York today--not contagious and on the skids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emphasis on historical \\"FICTION\\"","review":"This poorly - researched piece of drivel was a disappointment on several scores.

It was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destination Paradise","review":"This CD is beautiful Hawaiian music in which some songs are sung in Hawaiian and some in English. All are exceptional. The music brings back memories of when I first traveled to Hawaii in 1977 and first heard the music of the Brothers Cazimero. I bought an album at that time and I am now trying to obtain more of their music because it brings back to me the essence and carefree feeling of an Island Paradise which is the mood I was in during my trip to Hawaii.

Furthermore, it is laid out in such a way that I can easily locate sections pertinent to my interests (faculty, curriculum, etc.) and learn how these aspects of the system have evolved over the years.

Good overview of the history of higher ed from multiple societal contexts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This book is not good. It is just a listing of events and people in higher education, but in paragraph form instead of bullet lists. Instead of telling the story of higher education, it merely catalogs it.Other respectable histories of higher education is written by Lucas. (I would add Brubacher & Rudy, Rudolph's and Thelin's, but their focus is for the most part focused exclusively on the most selective and wealthy institutions).

After \\"Stop Your Motor,\\" The Association had only one more album left to do (1972's \\"Waterbeds In Trinidad\\"), but musically, they were still racin'. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The album that wasn't necessary","review":"This album, the last of the group for Warner Bros., was an effort that lacked the voice of Russ Giguere, who had left the group in 1970. The album featured Richard Thompson as Giguere's replacement, and the entire project suffered from spotty song writing and musical arrangements that lacked focus and direction. The best songs on this album are Ted Bluechel's \\"Bring Yourself Home\\" and a song penned by Jimmy Webb entitled \\"P.F. Sloane\\" that enjoyed some air play on local radio markets in the Midwest.

Takes over a minute just to connect, several minutes to download one page, if they load at all, numerous disconnects, never a speed higher than 30 Kbps (when the old modem was getting between 40 and 44), and more often in the low 20s. After two weeks I stopped using this modem and am back to the damaged modem which still works better than the Best Data modem. Probably the worst computer-related purchase I've made in my life.

Multiple retrys and frequent disconnects are the norm.

I wash my diapers every other day, and just toss these in my diaper bin with the diapers and wash them all together. I definitely could have only purchased one set; although it is nice to be able to always have several stashed in the diaper bag. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because after the first wash, some of the colored thread around the edges came unraveled. I now wash and dry everything on the delicate cycle and haven't had any further problems. The wipes are so soft and my little girls bum couldn't be happier.

I use them as baby wipes as my son is allergic to any other prepackaged baby wipes with the exception of the Earth's Best. Those are expensive so, I only use them when out of the house and I use wash cloths at home. At first glance, I LOVED these wipes as they SEEM super soft. After wetting them, they change IMMENSELY. They get even worse after being washed. I had to stop using them every day as they were rubbing my son's little bottom raw. In addition to all of that, after only 4 washes about half of them are falling apart.

So good that halfway through listening to the audiotape , I went out an bought the book so I could savor the language and story. This story reels through your mind like a whirlwind. Point of view changes keep you constantly up to date with the killer, with PI Elvis Cole and bring you up to speed with a journey into the past of mystery man Joe Pike.Shock follows upon shock as all of the series main characters go through severe life changes in the aftermath of the initial murder. Crais shakes up the genre and throws monkey wrenches into the works left and right. Both Crais and fellow PI writer Dennis Lehaye are poised to become the \\"Next Big Thing\\" in the mystery genre. A word to the wise-start reading them now if you haven't, so you can say you were on board before they hit the bigtime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No reader can ask for anything more.","review":"Oh, man, man, MAN.... what a book! I have just now read the final words. I closed the book slowly, running my hands all over it, before I held it tightly to my heart for a few moments. I do that after great reads. Robert Crais has given me (and the world) a truly great one.As I read LA Requiem, I laughed, I cried, I was fearful, I was shaken, I was envious, I cared, I loathed, I loved. Robert Crais has a gift for saying exactly the right words and phrases that evoke such emotions in his reader. I've read all of Crais' books with that knowledge. But, this one.... this one did it even more powerfully. By telling Joe's story, Crais has plumbed the depths of both Joe and Elvis... and also mine. No reader can ask for anything more. Now, I'm going to pick the book up again and read it once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST Elvis/Joe Pike book yet!","review":"Reading a Crais novel is like coming home to L.A. This is without a doubt the best novel Crais has written so far. If this book doesn't win the Edgar, there's no justice. Finally, the back story on Pike! I've waited years for this book and am re-reading it already (read it last night/this morning in one sitting). Thank you, Mr. Crais."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.A. Requiem: A Dark Story","review":"Wow! At last the back story on Joe Pike, Elvis Cole's strong, silent and very dangerous partner. This book is much darker and more serious than Crais' other Cole mysteries, which tend to be a little flip and wise cracking. I like this style better. Cole and Pike are asked by the elderly, infirm Frank Garcia to look into the disappearance of his daughter, Karen. Joe Pike and Karen were romantically involved years ago, so of course they accept the assignment. What seemed to be a straightforward missing persons investigation quickly morphs into a serial killer hunt, possible police corruption, and further complications to Cole's love life. This book introduces John Chen, the young criminalist who reappears in DEMOLITION ANGEL. It also flashes back to Joe Pike's early years and shows us how he evolved into the mysterious man he has become. Cole is as successful in his portrayal of modern L.A. as James Ellroy has been in evoking the L.A. of the 40's and 50's. A definite winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD WHO DONE IT?","review":"This is a fast paced work that keeps everyone guessing until the very end. I enjoyed the writing, wish i could have gotten to know the characters better and there were many. Well written, sinister, sad, all the elements that make up a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais is a master!","review":"Great background on one of the great fictional characters of all time - Joe Pike. If you like good guys, you will love Pike and his friend Elvis Cole. Highly recommend ALL of Robert Crais' work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, great character","review":"I found this book hard to put down. Joe Pike's fascinating background gave him depth and character and really brought him to life. Good plot, good writing. I hope to see a lot more of Joe Pike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book","review":"Of all the 'Elvis Cole' novels, this one, actually featuring Joe Pike before he got his own lead, is the best. Crais really knows how to keep a reader interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THE EARLIER BOOKS FIRST!!!","review":"LA Requiem is the culmination of Crais' writing. You must read the earlier books to fully appreciate 'Requiem.' You have to know Joe Pike to appreciate him in this book. I loved it. Read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is Joe Pike?","review":"A friend's daughter is missing and Joe Pike asks his friend Elvis Cole to help him find her. Along the way we discover that the missing girl and Joe Pike had once been an item and that is just the beginning of what author Robert Crais reveals about the enigmatic, silent partner to his gregarious wise-ass hero, Elvis Cole.It was time in the series to do something more than another fast-paced, wise-crack laden, plot-driven Cole/Pike adventure. Not that the novel is slow and humorless, but here Crais has decided to round out Joe Pike, giving him more background and history to explain some of his mystery. It's a cracking good story at that.Adding depth to his characters will only add to the future novels, and he does the same for Elvis Cole in The Last Detective. Plus here we get the horny SID criminologist, John Chen, thrown in, and a complex and nasty mystery behind it all.Well worthwhile for fans of the series. 5 stars for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading experience,","review":"It's easy to understand why it has an Edgar nomination. This is a most suspensful novel with strong characters. Easily the longest and deepest Elvis Cole novel to date. This time it's Elvis who is the archangel, as he looks to clear his partner Joe Pike. We also get the backstory on Pike, a welcome treat. This is one great series and Mr. Crais has truly made Elvis Cole and Joe Pike richer characters as the series extends."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA Requiem","review":"LA Requiem is a gem.

I'm anxious for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macho, macho man","review":"I gave this book a fair try and after about 167 pages just gave up. I really didn't like any of these cardboard characters. I couldn't stand Joe Pike's strong silent type personia, the ex-Marine with a mean dad. And Elivs Cole, yeah, all the women are hot for him. This writer can't compare with Chandler and Elwood. It's an ok book but it's insulting to women and I thought it stunk. I knew right away who the culprit was, right away! I can't be fooled by this pulp. Hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Book For Me Ever","review":"I have bought many $3.99 or less Kindle books. By far this is this the worst ever. I read 10 pages and gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"L. A. Requiem","review":"I love this guy! I just picked him out by chance from this years Edgar nominees, and in the last couple of months I read every book he's written. Fast and funny reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rare, Bleak Misstep for Robert Crais & Elvis Cole","review":"This is easily the bleakest Elvis Cole mystery to date. For some reason, Crais decided to substitute darkness for his usual levity, and subject the most likeable characters to various sorts of misery and suffering. Perhaps this is what someone might like to read if they want to feel depressed (or if they hate Elvis, Pike, and Lucy). But this is not what one reads Crais for! His other books are witty and fun, and do not beat up too much on the good guys.LA REQUIEM has plenty of pedophilia, child abuse, and many other bad things happening to good people. What it does not have is entertainment value, any sense of hope, or the humor we've come to expect from Crais. Pass this up, and try an earlier Crais."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except for the ending","review":"The story was one of those rare ones that pulls you in and makes you hate to stop reading for meals, sleep, etc. But something happened at the end, like it was thrown together at the last minute. A very unsatisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read for all mystery fans","review":"What a great read, This is his best work to date. You get a real look at Joe Pike, who has always been something of a shadow to the wise cracking \\"worlds greatest\\", Elvis Cole.If you like mysteries, this is right up your alley, if you've wanted to try one, this is the one to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead, dead, dead...","review":"This book is cheap, slow and boring...Like a bad hollywood movie, it's filled with flat characters and has no real style at all.Nothing creative, new, surprising or engaging...For amazing popular literature, there's the one and onlyELMORE LEONARD...the great LEE CHILDand others like STEPHEN KING (not my favorite, but a great writer nonetheless)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"I experienced this book via audio tape. John Bedford LLoyd did an excellent job,conveying each character and nuance of the story. This is my first introduction to this author, and I am very pleased. The suspense and the mystery of the killer was thrilling. Judging by the previous reviewers I'd better catch up and read the other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.A. Requiem","review":"Robert Crais has an uncanny way of making you feel as if you were experiencing what Elvis is doing. His style of writing makes every book he writes a page turner. I LOVE them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading","review":"I've just discovered this author and look forward to reading more of his books. This one was a first class example of its genre, with great characters and an interesting plot. There may be an excess of testosterone-laden content and Joe may seem too much like a super hero but I was okay with that for the sake of the story. Crais is a great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth taunt thriller","review":"Crais does his homework. You can just imagine the charecters on a TV movie set in LA. Good cast of antagonists especially \\"Pants Krantz\\". Samantha Dolan's flawed charecter is very enticing and sympathetic, you almost want her to steal the hero (Elvis) from his girlfriend who is too squeaky clean and boring. Joe Pike(Hero #2) flashbacks are compelling and entertaining. Essentially you dont feel your reading a book, more like a great television movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais refuses to become stale","review":"Reading a new book from a successful series is like comfort food. You know what you are going to get and that knowledge brings its own sort of pleasure. Robert Crais stretches his creative muscles and gives his readers an unfamiliar book set in the familiar world of Elvis Cole. I was worried what Crais would do with Elvis and his romance with Lucy. I was worried he'd have her get shot or killed. Too many writers don't want to limit themselves by showing a happy couple. Robert Crais instead takes us along a realistic path of the next stage in Elvis and Lucy's romance. This is a great book and I'm only sorry that the next Elvis Cole book isn't already on the way to my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Michael Connelly, but pretty good overall","review":"Reminds me of Los Angeles and Harry Bosch as written by Connelly but not as similar as I hoped for. Still not a bad read and wouldn't mind reading another of the Elvis Cole/ Joe Pike books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"I have read other books in the Elvis Cole series, but this one left the biggest impression. Definitely went to darker places than previous books. Well-written and dramatic without being melodramatic. Robert Crais is a tremendous writer and I would recommend him to anyone who likes the suspense or mystery genres. Although the bad guy is revealed before the book ends, the rest of the story was captivating. I liked all of the characters, except John Chen, the crime scene investigator. He was annoying and shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Crais L.A.Requim","review":"We have several persons who read Robert Crais and are very happy with this book.This book has already been checked out several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Now a Confirmed Fan of Robert Crais","review":"Since there are 100 reviews preceding mine, I will keep this one brief.Robert Crais sure can write. This is a wonderful book in the hard-boiled detective genre. His writing reminds me of the great mystery writer, Ross McDonald.The book is very hard-boiled, skirting the edge, with characters straight out of the psychiatric Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (eg, lots of pathologies and real screwed up). After reading this book, I have become a confirmed fan of Robert Crais.I recommend this book for all mystery lovers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Crais, please read this!","review":"Great read, but please bone up on basic california crimimal procedure!Defendants are not \\"bound over\\" from the municipal arraignment to superior court arraignment.

This has got to be one of my top ten books of all time! The plot is fast and interesting and the characters superb! There was nothing about this book that I didn't like.

Well done Mr. Crais!Ree-views"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Crais!","review":"I tried--I really did--to make this last, knowing it's so long between books, but once I hit the last 100 pages, that was all he wrote.

I can hardly wait to see what happens with him and Lucy!! Please dont wait so long between books - I miss reading about Elvis!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Robert Crais is my favorite mystery writer and he didn't let me down with this book. I began reading it the day I got it and did not stop until I finished it. Can't wait for his next book! I hope Pike continues to have a more meatier part - I enjoy his interactions with Elvis and Lucy. He is a great balance to Elvis' 'flip' personality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss his earlier novels","review":"I am a long time fan of police books. Perhaps over 20 years with the DA's office has something to do with it, or is it two sons who are officers with major police agencies. To the best of my knowledge this is the first Robert Crais novel that I have read; how could I have missed the earlier ones? Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch are probably my favorite combination but Robert Crais and the pair of Pike and Cole will have a place in my collection. Mr. Crais plot is well developed, it moves rapidly and comes to a fitting conclusion. I look forward to reading his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I am beginning to think only those who love a book write a review. Others immediately dismiss it and go on to better reading. L.A. Requiem is my second attempt at Robert Crais. The first was Forgotten Man. This book was flat, characters were jumbled but I made my way through it. This highly touted L.A. Requiem just had to be better, but it isn't. The writing is poor. Elmore Leonard says to writers; don't write what they don't read. In Crais books I was skimming and scanning more than ever. At the rate I was skipping I could have finished it in nothing flat. Joe Pike, okay so he had a poor upbringing, he is just a rude man. Elvis Cole, oh who cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Read In Years!","review":"The characters are paper thin. The relationships, immature -- if not laughable. The plotting leaves the reader in the world of \\"oh wells,\\" or even worse, \\"so whats.\\" The tough detective has a habit of saying \\"Gee.\\" Worse still, Robert Crais's command of the genre is so weak, he housed his detective in the same dwelling as the greatest detective in fiction right now: Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. This is the kind of book that makes a reader angry. I noticed on the book's jacket that Crais wrote for TV. This book reads like TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais's Absolute Best","review":"I have all of Crais's books except the newest one, The Forgotten Man.And this is the best of a very good lot.The Elvis Cole books are better than the non-Cole books (Demolition Angel and Hostage--now a major crummy motion picture).And one reason is Joe Pike.Pike is a mythic creation: sort of like the Eastwoodian Strong Silent Type on steroids.This book tells how Pike got that way.It also has a very nice turn with Who Dun It.Read all the Elvis Cole books, but if you can only read one, read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, with action and mystery","review":"A murder occurred against a young college student, and a father wishes for her former fianc��, Joe Pike, to help solve this murder. The only problem is that the fianc�� is a mysterious person with a secret past, who was labeled as a cop killer. The mystery of this murder grows, while the life of Joe Pike unfolds.This book is a great novel. A light, fun read with the action and plot of a movie. From crime scene investigations, to thrilling prisoner escapes, this book has it all. A real, true page turner.Nothing heavy or fancy, and nothing intellectually challenging, but I recommend this nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting book.","review":"A different kind of detective.

Although the amazon.com reviews were favorable I feared somewhat that this would be one of the many vaguely competent yet forgettable popular crime novels. So how did the book measure up? Thankfully, rather well.The story is about serial killings in LA-LA land, with a pair of private investigators out to solve these murders. Things get very sticky when one of these investigators, a former cop, is implicated. Crais does a fine job in delivering a fast pace, complete with rather unpredictable story. It is certainly a page-turner.However the story has a somewhat familiar feel, resembling more a movie script than literature. The characterizations are a bit two-dimensional, the prose is marginally adequate. While L.A. Requiem is certainly not a classic it certainly rises above the \\"forgettable\\" status.Bottom line: an enjoyable crime novel. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre, you get what you pay for","review":"fortunately i didnt pay much for this.it steals the altec lansing look, but definitely not the sound.Bass - severely lacking.treble - too tinnyat the loudest volume, with ipod turned all the way up, it still is pretty weak. it'll be useful for some music when i'm out doing some yard work but otherwise it's not very attractive for true listening purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"The sound was pretty bad, but I was willing to overlook that for convenince's sake.

Some sections seem to wander off into a virtual argument with animal rights activists and some of his claims seem unsupportable, particularly that people who are (for instance) avid backpackers do not experience nature as fully as hunters. It seems unnecessary to prioritize one type of experience over the other.Some sections are a transcript of a video. Some of these are hard to follow, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this book.","review":"I am fascinated by anything dealing with psychology, philosophy, logic, and reason.

I just bought the \\"smoking\\" book and am looking forward to laughing out loud again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly biting satire","review":"I am far from an expert on political satire, but I found Little Green Men tepid at best in its attempt to poke fun at the D.C. establishment.The opportunity to mock the self-important detail that Tom Clancy provides in his books is lost here.As far as political satire goes I will stick with my good friend, Al Franken."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOUGHT TO GET THROUGH IT","review":"I read Christopher Buckley's \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" and loved it! Brilliant. So I ordered \\"Little Green Men\\" thinking it would be equal. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea. I had to keep talking myself into going back and reading it, thinking at some point, it would kick in. It never did for me. Nonetheless, I am going to try \\"Florence of Arabia.\\" I think that might be more in line with my tastes. I love good satire and Chris is generally considered the best. I just finished reading a great book of satire about the celebrity news media, \\"The Wizards of Spin,\\" and loved it. I hope the author John Ruane continues to write books of satire. It was wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This is one of the most uninteresting novels I have ever read. There was nothing in the whole book that was worth reading.

Please don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful premise...but it never gets off the ground","review":"Little Green Men has a great premise and a wonderful line or two -- \\"Eich bin ein kook!\\" is unforgettable -- but the plot loses its charm in meandering incoherence and the characters, except for the George Will knock-off, never come alive. The big build-up and the ending, especially, are about as funny as the Carter administration. Ugh. A crash landing for Buckley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Airport Fluff","review":"Really just an extended National Lampoon piece that doubtless never would have been published but for the Beltway solid pedigree, the womb-lucky Mr. Buckley has written the perfect book for those extended airport delays plaguing those of us who don't fly private jet. The book is funny, yes, but while it purports to skew the D.C. crowd, it really just congratulates the reader for identifying who each character is pretending to ridcule. In short, the perfect roman a clef for the in-crowd. How many characters can you guess? How connected are you? So Banion is George Will, the hostess is Pamela Harriman/Katherine Graham, Kissinger is there...doubtless others that this poor fly-over country boy can't spot.Also, some of the humor is simply ham-handed. The Senate Hindsight Committee? Oh, please. Exhausted women demand the removal of Viagra from the market? Oh, Mr. Buckley, that's naughty don't you know!So, it's a quick engaging read, but not much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off like the X Files; ends up like a sleeping pill.","review":"This book began so well. I had just relocated to Washington DC (where the author lives and subsequently where the novel takes place most of the time) and some of the inside jokes are hilarious. I am an X Files fan and there is a similarity. Humor, a good plot line, a conspiracy and alien abduction. The problem is, it moves so slowly and then it gets corny. Not enough is left to the imagination. Too bad really, because I was enjoying it through the first 100 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Fun Weekend read!","review":"There were points in the book where I was laughing so hard I had to put it down.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in Almost Every Way","review":"It is difficult to decide which is better - the great plot, witty dialogue or believable characters. The plot is a great one with lots of turns and twist and the characters are very compelling - including the \\"real life\\" ones. But the dialogue and sidebar comments (including footnotes) really make the book. If you want a good yarn about government conspiracies, UFOs, DC Beltway politics and gossip - read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the funniest novel I've ever read!","review":"As someone with a long personal involvement in the UFO field, I am familiar with many of the individuals Buckley used for his characters, and I can attest to the fact that he has \\"nailed\\" them perfectly! There is much that is worthy of parody in the world of UFOs, the media and the federal government, and Buckley has managed to prove that fiction is stranger than truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still among the best of the breed.","review":"\\"Smoking\\" was, without a doubt, a much funnier book than \\"Little Green Men.\\" But with so much garbage passed off as literature these days (witness Oprah's recommendations), it should be an occasion for parades when books such as \\"Little Green Men\\" appear. Our culture takes itself far too seriously these days. Practically gone is the laugh-for-the-laugh's-sake type writing. Buckley, T.C. Boyle (my choice for vital literature), Martin Amis, sometimes Chabon try to keep the comic heart beating, but it is faint.On a sidenote: Did anyone happen to count the typos in \\"Little Green Men?\\" There must have been dozens, in many cases whole words left out. I edit for a living. I learned long ago that spellcheck is no substitute for eyeballs. No fault of Buckley's, obviously, but he might check into what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Buckley's previous book, Thank You for Smoking, and eagerly anticipated the release of Little Green Men. I was disappointed. Gone are the cutting insights and absolutely hysterical humor. It seems as though, after making a name for himself with Smoking, Buckley has decided he no longer needs to work at his craft to win readers. That's a shame. I laughed out loud many times during Smoking, not once during this book. In fact, a barely managed a grin now and then. Buckley can be a simply terrific, engaging, and hilarious writer when he wants to be -- but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Couldn't wait to read this book by Christopher Buckley because I thought Thank You for Smoking was laugh-out-loud funny. What a disappointment. This book is moderately amusing at best. It just tries a little too hard and misses. My recommendation: save your money and if you must read it, check it out at library. Buy another book from amazon w/your $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever plot does not make up for undeveloped characters","review":"Mr. Buckley delivers a clever story, but fails to fully develop potentially entertaining secondary characters the way Carl Hiaasen does. Additionally, Mr. Buckley's use of \\"SAT\\" words does not add to the plot, rather, it is distracting in the way an over-eager student in class might be. One can't help but think that Mr. Buckley is trying to live up to his father's famous vocabulary. However, his transparent inclusion of famous Washington icons adds a tantalizing bit of masked non-fiction to this political comedy (is Strom Thurmond really a perv?), and the protagonist of this tale, John Banion, is an interesting if not sympathetic composite of our favorite Sunday talk show hosts. Overall, Mr. Buckley deserves an \\"E\\" for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book.","review":"If you have never heard of Jacuqes Ellul, you are really missing out on a very important voice on society, culture, and the Kingdom of God. \\"Reason for Being\\" is a great journey and exploration through Ecclesiastes and ultimately the meaning of life.

Real-life anecdotes are compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite recordings of all time","review":"It is impossible to convey the wonder of this performance. The music on this CD is some of the most wrenchingly exquisite I know of, and is sung with the highest degree of warmth and understanding. One usually associates Renaissance choral polyphony with reserve and repose, not warmth. But Josquin's odes to the Virgin possess striking emotion and tenderness. This is music that was written for and demands the male choral forces deployed here to make sense of its subject: the offering of thanks to maternal being, to the forces of material creation. But you don't need any theology to feel what this music is about. Were I marooned on the proverbial desert island or asked to represent humanity to space aliens, I would offer this music as sung here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and rollicking traditional Regency romance","review":"A charming story, exceedingly well-told, with memorable and funny characters, set in Regency London. Harry Hawthorne, the feckless hero, has much to learn about women, and learn he does, albeit most reluctantly, with the rakish Lord Mannerly as teacher. Mannerly, bearing a huge (and ultimately trivial, even silly)grudge against Harry, decides he will despoil Harry's fiancee, Olivia Darby. Miss Darby, feeling neglected by Harry (and not realizing at first that Harry is masquerading as his own grandmother in order to keep an eye on and to chaperone Olivia!), is about to fall prey to the rake's intentions, but the day is saved just in the nick of time, before reputations and lives are foolishly destroyed. A lovely story, with a true Regency feel and flavor, harkening back to the popular Georgette Heyer novels that were once the standard for the genre.

I found this book to be a very appealing light romantic comedy of manners. It requires a little suspension of disbelief, but what farce does not? The characters are engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent in their company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost too silly for words","review":"When the nasty OTT villain is the most interesting character in a Regency romance, you know the book is in trouble. The hero can think of nothing but himself and his masculine pastimes, nevertheless the heroine has loved him since childhood. They decide to marry, but first she wants a 'Season' in London. Then the ridiculous begins, with the hero dressing up as his own grandmother in order to provide the heroine and his own sister with a chaperone. Oh, groan upon groan. Well, perhaps I'm not being entirely fair, for there are some funny moments, but the plot is so shot through with holes that it's infuriating. The ending is even more preposterous than anything that went before, and that's saying something. I'm afraid that even though the villain is fairly interesting, his motives and machinations are thoroughly distasteful, and leave a very queasy feeling. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"The High Voltage Series continues with this new entry, \\"Crash of the Dairy\\". The three episodes featured are \\"A Goldenrod Opportunity\\", where Ash faces Whitney, the Goldenrod Gym Leader in a tough match, \\"A Dairy Tale Ending\\" where after his defeat, Ash challenges Whitney to a rematch, and \\"Beauty and the Breeder\\", with Brock reuniting with Susie, the trainer who gave him Vulpix.While these are good episodes and all, I have to ask... WHY? These episodes have already been released on DVD (See Road to the Johto League Champion and Journey to the Johto League Champion DVDs) so it just seems like a huge waste to release these three episodes on DVD, when you can get the same on the other two DVDs, plus 11 more.This is the first Pokemon DVD that is not distributed by Pioneer, so it remains to be seen how the quality will hold up against previous releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Room for your Blessings!!!","review":"How can we see and acknowledge our blessings, if our lives are so cluttered that we fail to recognize our deepest dreams and most gracious gifts???!Read this book and follow Talane's tips toward liberation from clutter, ruts, fog, and confusion.

This album most definitely belongs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, Serene Acoustic Guitar","review":"This is my first album by Alex De Grassi and I am impressed with his skill and style. Pure acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by bass or percussion, but no vocals. This album of versions of old time folk music is both respectful of the music and yet playful and frisky. Great version of Saint James Infirmary (see my list of the many many versions of this amazing old song)."},{"rating":"2","title":"PanHeads Unite!","review":"Skillet has been changing their sound with each successive album. Collide is a culmination of their sound to this point. It blends thier first album's heavy guitar and edgy vocals with their last few albums techno/idustrial drum loops. I fell in love with Savior when i first heard it. The rest of the cd is great as well. If you love Skillet, get this cd! If you like heavy music, get this cd! If you can hear music, get this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the review","review":"Other than a few very minor flaws this album was very well produced. I only have two complaints. One is that the strings are low quality strings. We all know the strings are from Korey's keyboards but cmon, make em sound real. My second complaint is that the couple solos that the few guitar solos they did have were not loud enough. They are too vague and leave alot to be desired. Other than these two flaws this is an awesome album. John's voice is very raspy which normally would sound like crap, but he makes it sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one will be big","review":"skillet does it again...this is the hardest skillet cd yet and thats not a bad thing,skillet does it best with thier follow up to alien youth another awsome cd.while im not sure which one i like better,this cd has better lryics and an overall better sound,buy it today and believe me you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet Rulz","review":"This Skillet cd reminds me of their first.

Its clearly explicit in the lyrics, especially in \\"My Obsession\\" I have emailed the band many times, and have asked them if they were still christian even though they moved to a secular recording company. Their reply was yes, we are still christian, and continue to be. However, I do agree in the fact that they are definitely not blatant in their message, but I do believe they are christian. Just listen. You'll find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet rocks hard!","review":"This is Skillet's heaviest album. In my opinion, it marks their rise into popularity. Although I don't consider it to be their best album, I do enjoy the CD.

My favorite song on the album is \\"Savior\\". Skillet fans, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet is true talent!","review":"It's Skillet and this album was the start of their harder edge.

The composition and arrangement of the music is always first rate, and this continues on this album. The sound quality, energy and excitement in their albums is always high, and this continues on this album. Their lyrics are always uncompromising, unashamedly Christian, and not shy about using the name of Jesus, and this is absolutely missing on this album. Lyrically what you get is Christianity lite, and Christianity in disguise. Oh don't get me wrong there is Christianity on this album, you'll just have to look for it, where in their other albums it was in the open for all to see. Skillet used to be my favorite lyrical band, and they also stood out as Christian leaders. Now they wear \\"The Exploited\\" t-shirts, and hide their faith. Where is the lyrical courage and genius of \\"I Can?\\" Seems to me like they're taking over the world by assimilating to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"I don't know how much I like this album. It's not the music that I don't like, but the questionable content of the cd. Some of the lyrics are downright depressing with few hints of light. Maybe this is just their style, I am not entirely familiar with all of Skillet's releases. It could be, on the other hand, that the prospects of money, via a new label, has geared them in a new direction. On their official website \\"biography\\" there is not even mention of their faith in Christ, although \\"...driven by their faith in music...\\" they have accomplished much. Also, the album cover combined with the title \\"Collide\\" is fairly disturbing. If anything, I'd say this album is suited for those who are seeking God out and have not already found the Truth, due to the fact that this is not a very uplifting album. Pillar's \\"Fireproof\\" is nearly as heavy as \\"Collide\\", but accompanied with powerful, well-conceived lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chistian Music from Skillet? Dont think so...","review":"This CD has been labeled \\"Christian Music\\" so when I got it, I was extremely disappointed that very few of the songs have any Christian theme at all and alot of them are just plain angry. I do really like the CD with alot of strong songs on it (Savior, Foresaken, Open Wounds, Imperfection...) but dont like something labled \\"Christian\\" when it really isnt. If you are looking for uplifting lyrics, Christian themed music, with a very hard edge, go out and get Kutless instead. Kutless brings Christ in on every song and they rock hard. They walk the walk and talk the talk while Skillet just dangles on the edge...dont get me wrong, great CD with alot of good rocking songs but not alot of \\"Christ\\" in their music even though they give shout outs to the lord on their liner notes. Hypocritical?Christian buyer beware...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillet throw the pan out","review":"I have liked this band for a while and this new cd sucks.

The unique blue-ness of the Adriatic never comes through; a shame since that is one of the chief draws to the area. Perhaps, Rick Steves will one day decide simply to do one (or better yet, a series) vidoe on just the Croatian Adriatic. I'm sure his level of professional skill and attitude would do it justice.

A new book! A new author. And a historical at that. (I have a soft spot for a good historical.)Well, I wasn't disappointed. Linda Windsor transported me to medieval Ireland with ease, burrowing her way into my favorite author's closet as well. Fiery Riona, the main character has the heart of a nun and temper of warrior. When Kieran, her handsome, but unbelieving foster brother arrives home with news of their brother's death and his deathbed wish for them to marry, well, Riona has all the men running for cover.Before she can fully vent her anger though, there's a murder in the abbey and Kieran is the main suspect.

The book was bogged down (no pun intended) by an overabundance of long, descriptive, expository passages. There wasn't enough dialogue or anything really happening for me to even remember what was supposed to be happening. I felt like I was reading more of a dissertation on ancient Irish culture than an actual story. Perhaps it is because I just finished an excellent series of fast-paced, action-driven books. Or perhaps it is just that I am extra tired this evening. Whatever the case, Riona utterly failed to hook me enough to make me want to read past the first 30 pages. Given that I wasn't impressed with this author's previous book, I figured this one wouldn't get any better and so would be a waste of my time for me to read further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library Style 24 Drawers Multmedia Cabinet - Cherry Finish","review":"Just received my cabinets today.

The entire back panel of the unit is a thin sheet of wood board and had come undone.The drawers are difficult to pull out due to poor construction. Yesterday, I pulled out one of the top drawers too far and it dropped to the floor, where a chocolate-bar sized section of the front panel broke off!To make things worse, the varnish sticks to certain objects placed on it!

It's overly produced sound reminds me of the worst kind of pop and country ever made. The vocals lack the soul and vulnerability heard on the previous releases as well.

However, it is almost as funny as 'Neither Here nor There' and 'The Lost Continent'. Bryson can be a little obvious when he uses classic stereotypes as he does in not very original takes on how dull the Swiss are or how rude the French are in 'Neither Here nor There', but as long as you're not American you'll probably find this new book quite amusing. If you are American, you may find it rather irritating ."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a funny guy!","review":"I needed few good laughs, and I got plenty from this book. As a \\"foreigner\\" living in the United States I thought Bryson hit the nail on the head as far as living in this country goes. I'm surprised more Americans aren't bad-mouthing this book! :-)I loved the newspaper column medium as well. I can excuse the journalistic formula, as all newspaper writing follows it, yes? Also it was in a form that I could put the book down for a few days and not lose my \\"place\\" in a story. Bryson's other books were hilarious, but I would tire of his humour after a few chapters. The jokes would then be lost on me. I took my time with this one and got as many laughs from the last few chapters as I did with the first.Would love some less America oriented books by Bryson in the future. I still prefer \\"Notes From a Small Island\\" and \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" over all of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, Insightful, and Funny","review":"Bill Bryson's writing is great to read because he can make you think as well as it can make you laugh. He takes topics as simple as going to the grocery store or dining out and makes them engaging and entertaining (generally speaking, Bryson and food seem to have an interesting relationship). He also tackles tougher subjects in U.S. culture, such as our nearly pathological need to drive cars, with wit and insight. A perfect read for a summer trip or a day in the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title and book description","review":"I read this book hoping for some interesting insights on what it must be like to live in England for 20 years and then return to the US. I was looking for indications on the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between these two countries (\\"Separated by a common language,\\" as Winston Churchill used to say).Instead, for the majority of the book, I got a mixed bag of musings on inconsequential topics in the style of Andy Rooney, along the lines of \\"Have you ever noticed how the cutting thing on the floss container always seems to. ...\\"This book has pot-boiler written all over it; and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip-Off Disappointment","review":"I have been a Bill Bryson fan for many years, but this book comes off as a commercial rip-off, taking a collection of his newspaper columns, throwing them together, and saying, \\"Here is my latest book.\\" Sorry, but that will not fly. It was funny in places, sure, because Bryson has the gift of turning a phrase, but much of it just plods along on topics of little or no consequence. I think I've had enough of Bill Bryson by now, though I'll revisit some of his earlier efforts with great pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed hysterically","review":"Bill Bryson cracks me up. A friend sent me this book and I have never laughed out loud so hard. A funny, funny writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like non-stop complaining!!!!","review":"I enjoyed \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" on tape, so I bought the tape of \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\". While there's some amusing anecdotes and insights, this book is something best taken in very, very small doses. Especially on tape, Mr. Bryson is a world-class whiner. He complains, kvetches, and moans about every small annoyance that confronts people in everyday life. If life is really this bad for him, I'm surprised he ever leaves the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hostile","review":"After reading \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything,\\" I became a fast fan of Mr. Brysons writing style. I felt that he inserted humor and wit with accurate fact.However, this book takes on a very hostile, almost scathing review of the USA. I pity the foreign reader on what seems to be a very downtrodden review of the United States as a whole.Granted after not living in his country of birth for over twenty years, it is not nearly as terrible as Mr. Bryson makes it out to be.The book starts out with humor and wit, and turns sharply to a very disappointed view of what the USA has become in his absence. The book is riddled with what seems to be one constant complaint about everything and anything. I am sorely unsatisfied with the contents, and would not recommend this piece due to it's brief chapters and sore dissatisfaction with living in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious reading","review":"This was required summer reading for my son's AP \\"English\\" class. He is an avid reader but is trudging through this book. At first it seems quirky and interesting but is repetitive and meandering. He said it is like reading an entire book of editorial magazine columns without the benefit of reading what the editorial is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpatriotic","review":"A book that I thought was supposed to be about re-experiencing the U.S. from a foreigner's standpoint turned out to make a mockery of Americanism. Don't get me wrong, I agreed with some of the issues he discussed, but I felt it was a political, whiny, irrelevant and diluted book that was masquerading as a comic novel. A shame, because I liked Bryson's other books, and I read it on my honeymoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best book....","review":"Bryson is an author with tremendous flair and expertise... I tried to remind myself that this was written by the man that brought us \\"Notes from a Lost Continent\\"...Sorry, \\"Stranger\\" is...not his best book, and I can only hope his book on Australia is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More complaining than humor","review":"Parts of the book were funny. The book was portrayed as very funny and at first I would have agreed but then the author ventures into many more subjects that obviously upset him quite a bit about America. Bill Bryson can find a tremendous amount wrong with America and that seems to be his desire in this FREE Country but don't claim that the book is \\"on an affectionate, hysterically funny tour\\". I was looking for humor when I purchased the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the funniest","review":"One of the funniest books I've read, maybe because I feel like the author being realforeigner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Dump On Me","review":"Though I liked the book overall, and I really did, I found that after a while it was a bit trying how much Bryson seems to put down the very country he has chosen to live in. From complaining about the amount of choices in the supermarket, to our over reliance on fossil fuels and cars, it gets a bit trying. What I really found ironic was that even though Bryson puts down Wal-Mart and big discount chains I bought is book at Costco! At a deep discount no-less!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A duplication but with a different cover!","review":"Seems a rehash of his \\"Notes from a Big Country\\" book which came out the same year. The main difference appears to be the cover! I would rate that one 4 stars. I am giving this one just one star and that is for the new cover. If you have read Big Country, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryson Light, I found this collection disappointing","review":"Yes there are many humorous observations and bits of irony, however, I found this to have a little too much \\"David Barry\\" type writing in it. I very much enjoyed his last four travel books. His clever and insightful observations (along with the wonderful dialogues he becomes engaged in) do not work as well in this \\"collection of newspaper essays\\" format. While reading his other works, I was always sad when they were finished. I was fairly happy when this one ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so. He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it. He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics. I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world. All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later. Still lots of people think he is great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill should get off his arse","review":"Introduced to Bryson with \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" and \\"Made in America,\\" I used to be his no. 1 fan. His wit became a bit lacking with his stamina in \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" and he's just godawful with his latest effort. Granted, his audience with these missives are some of the palest creatures ever created, those Brits who make their minds up about America in an off-season weeklong trip to Miami Beach. Bill used to be wonderful; to get him back to his old self, his publisher should drop him in the middle of nowhere and let him write his way out. Enough about junk mail and American supermarkets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Based on the title, I expected the book was going to be about how the country had changed since he'd been gone but it isn't. It's many diverse ramblings that have nothing to do with the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, sneering, and worst of all, unfunny","review":"I've never found Bryson as funny as my British friends do, but this book is his worst yet. The \\"humor\\" felt contrived and his experiences were obviously exaggerated, if not made up from whole cloth. I heard Bryson on PBS awhile back, with his phoney accent and fawning manner in full flow. Bryson is that most loathesome of creatures: the sycophantic, Anglophilic American. I think Mr.\\"I've always wanted to be a European\\" Bryson should pack it back to Yorkshire, where his Uncle Tom act is undoubtedly more appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reissue of Byson's older essays on America","review":"I would have given this collection of short essays more stars, but I can't. The publisher is retreading Bryson's earlier work and calling it new and original. It isn't. It appeared years ago.The purpose, of course, is to keep the author in the public eye until he can float his new book on Australia.I recommend all of his earlier books. I especially loved his reading of A Walk in the Woods on audio-tape. The man is perceptive and very funny and sounds exactly like the kind of companion you'd want to spend an evening with in a pub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and thoughtful about the US and Britain.","review":"This book has a charming premise. Bryson is an American writer who lived in Britain for over twenty years, marrying an Englishwoman and raising two children. He moved back to the States with his family, where he wrote a series of essays about America for a British audience.Bryson is a keen and witty observer of life. How many of us could write an entire essay prompted by the existence of a 24-hour help line on a dental floss dispenser? The essays are uniformly amusing, sometimes side-splitting.Thought not as consistently funny as Dave Barry, Bryson goes further by adding a healthy dose of thoughtfulness to it all. Throughout the book he ponders what it means to be American, comparing and contrasting it with what it means to British. Every so often the question of Canadianness pops in as well. As countries divided by a common language, they provide a nice playground for Bryson, and he has a good time with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, pleasant read. So true...","review":"Bill Bryson makes excellent observations about the American culture and lifestyle. As a foreigner who studied and worked in the USA for a few years I can pretty much share the author's views on life in this country. A must-read for a person coming to live in America for an extended period of time. The book is also very witty and hilarious at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never laughed so hard!","review":"I can not in my entire 30 years ever remember laughing so hard. My wife thought she might need to call an ambulance. I was literally rolling on the floor with teary-eyed laughter. (The tax-form explanation was worth the price alone.) The book was \\"dry\\" in a few places but overall the book was hysterical! (I wish I could give it 4.5 stars; the only reason I did not give 5 stars are for the few \\"dry\\" spots which I have already mentioned.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desk Fever","review":"With far too much time on my hands I have elsewhere offered my comments on Bryson's other books and awarded five stars to each. This book is awful. It came out in the UK under the title 'Notes From A Big Country' and is effectively a series of journalistic pieces cobbled together to make a buck. One senses that Bryson has gotten lazy. As a writer, his talents are best served by subjecting himself to inconvenience and peril to entertain us all, (I, for example, was hoping that Bill would be attacked by a bear in A WALK IN THE WOODS and possibly eaten) but this business of sitting by a snug fire in Hanover, New Hampshire and writing about cupholders is a disappointment. Bryson's formula works best when he is the participant rather than a social observer. We have enough journalists making whimsical observations about minutae. We need to get Bill back to somewhere dangerous; Mt Everest would be good. Or somewhere with crocodiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor work of collected news columns","review":"Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" or \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...really","review":"I was taken by all the great reviews, but its really not that good. It is disjointed and has way too much statistical information - which worked well for the newspaper articles - but not for a book... Bryson is a good author though, Sunburned country is his best and well worth the read... This book however should be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I am a big fan of Bill Bryson, and this book did not disappoint. It's full of his trademark witty observations and often outrageous, pee-your-pants funny humor.The book is a collection of essays Bryson wrote for a newspaper after he had returned to the US after 20 years of living abroad. Each essay (2 to 4 pages) tackles a different topic of modern American life: the post office, television, holidays, airplane travel, to name just a few. He has such a unique view of things and events that we take for granted or consider mundane, especially when he compares life in the US to life in England. His style of writing is informal and conversational, which makes you feel like you're talking to an old friend.A wonderful, sharp, insightful, and hilarious book, sure to keep you reading, laughing, and thinking for hours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One funny little story after another","review":"In this book, Bill Bryson presents a compilation of weekly columns he had published upon his return from England to the States, after being away for 20 years. And boy did he had a cultural shock! He presents in a VERY funny way the things that we take for granted every day and, one by one, dissects the very elements that make up the American way of life in an insightful way.The book is assembled in a chapter fashion with a certain structure that connects them whenever applicable. The chapters are short and self-contained enough to turn the book into an endless feed of amazing 5-minute fun reads before bedtime or while you are sitting in a waiting room."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"this book is a collection of articles B.B. plublished in a british newspaper.Most are amazingly funny - in the laugh-out-loud kind of way, and very few are slightly boring (but as they are all just a few pages long you can go through them realy fast or just skip them). I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"It is hard to know who this book will appeal to more, Americans willing to laugh at themselves or non-Americans wanting to laugh (jealously?) at our friendly neighbours. Actually, i think it will just appeal to people who want to be entertained. A very light-hearted book, with some genuinly hilarious moments. What a change to read an author who doesn't take himself too seriously. Maybe a bit of a con for those Brits who, like myself, religiously read the stories in Night and Day magazine a couple of years ago but still entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Humorous Tales","review":"This is a book that is a collection of weekly news articles. Bryson wrote a weekly article for an English paper, that wanted to hear his tales of America.I really enjoyed them. They are from a different POV of a man who is reconnecting with America after being away for so long. Its an easy read. You can read any chapter. They're all separate from each other.It is written with a quick and dry sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine, whine!","review":"This is a collection of short articles in which the author whines about anything and everything. We all know one of those people. They can complain about anything - too hot, too cold, too rainy, too sunny. At one point, he even complained about other people driving with their windows up! How can that bother someone? Several times, I found myself almost in disbelief that he could complain (or even care) about these things.I would have probably given this book 1 star for the negativity, but he is funny at times, and he had the mercy of making each chapter only a few pages, so the reader only needs to take it in small doses.Ok: I'm done whining about his whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful - new title for an \\"old\\" book","review":"If you have read \\"Notes from a big country\\", this is the same book with a different title (American version, while Notes is the British version), so be careful. I fell for it. But otherwise, Bill Bryson is as hilarious as ever, and the book is great fun and highly entertaining. The insights into daily US life are very telling and also social history. Some things make you think, but they all make you laugh, too. Nobody need be offended, but everybody should be delighted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining, An Easy Read for Frequent Interruptions","review":"Bill Bryson's sense of humor makes you laugh out loud, so if you'll be embarassed when other airline passengers wonder what you're laughing at, you probably shouldn't read this book. Since it's a compilation of newspaper columns, the chapters are very short. I liked this since I read a lot in airports and other places where I only have short stints to read. Long involved novels are too difficult to get \\"back into\\". I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards","review":"I guess because it is a collection of observations and not as focussed as his other books I lost interest in this one. Without a central theme other than \\"How strange America is now\\" Bryson's generally on target wit and observations tend to meander from point to point. Viewing America from the perspective of an American who had been away for years is definitely aimed at a British audience who I hope enjoyed it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have been OK in weekly installments...","review":"Someone in my book club selected this book for the group to read. It is a compilation of articles written for a weekly newspaper. While I'm sure the articles worked as a weekly supplement, the compilation is... boring. While certainly a talented writer, article after article seemed the same style - flat - and eventually boring. Perhaps more selectivity should have been exercised in picking those articles to be used, rather than just slapping them together into a book. Also - the author's wife is correct - he complains alot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Perspective","review":"Every time I read (or listen to) a Bill Bryson book, I start laughing on page one and don't stop until I put it down. What sets this one apart is the format - it's a collection of columns instead of his usual full-length book, but he embraces the format, using it to talk about many facets of life in Britain and America. It's so interesting to hear about our daily American lives from the perspective of a prodigal son, since he both feels familiar and at odds with the culture at the same time. He misses things we've forgotten existed, and finds things we take for granted new and worth commenting on. I've never found another book written by someone in similar circumstances. If you like audio books at all, I highly recommend any Bill Bryson on audio. He reads everything himself, and it adds many layers of enjoyment. Not to mention that Iowan-British accent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"painfully funny","review":"So I was reading this book late at night and wound up doubled over with my face in a pillow so I wouldn't wake up the person across the hall with my laughing.This book is insightful (I'm sure I learned things about being American, despite being American), funny, and well-written. The one minus, for me, is that the way he talks about his wife eventually got on my nerves. She comes off as a bit of a 50s-tv-show mom, by turns irrational in her femininity and annoyingly wise. That he refers to her as \\"Mrs. Bryson\\" doesn't help matters. But that's minor, and maybe if you didn't read it all in one night as I did, it would be less evident. Mostly, this is just a wicked funny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as his others","review":"The short-essay format does not suit Bill Bryson's talents. Just as each chapter gets going, it's time to end, and most chapters end in a formulistic way, referring back to a comment near the beginning. Some chapters still had me laughing out loud, especially in the back half of the book. I've given his other travel books 5 stars, but can give this one \\"only\\" 4. Wait for the paperback (sorry, Bill)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better works","review":"This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers. It's as if he published this because he needed money. There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really humor, more like arrogrant grousing.","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, as I had read some of his previous work and thought them entertaining and even witty. For whatever the reason, this book never rises to that level. He takes a more aloof tone and is relentless in making fun of everything and everyone he encounters. I have to be completely honest, that I did not actually finish the book. I grew weary of his insults and negative humor. I took offense at his continual belittle of small towns and the people that live there.Hopefully he is now past that period of his life and is back to lighter and less mean spirited observations of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"I own a community tank with top, middle & bottom feeders. My pleco & the catfish love this wafer. I break into couple of pieces and place it in different spots, it dissolves slowly and attracts the fish. No wafer was left uneaten. Some of the other fish also eat this wafer. Its worth buying especially if you have bottom feeders like the cories or pleco.

The explanations are just better than elsewhere, and its easier to follow the mathematical derivations. There are no unfair remarks like 'it is easy to see that..', etc. Now I can understand quantum mechanics much better. The movies are just great. The CD-ROM alone is worth the price (unfortunately it works only for Windows and Macintosh, not for Linux). In particular, I liked the section about one-dimensional scattering theory. Here the movies and the text fit together in an optimal way. If you can only afford one book about quantum mechanics, buy this one. Unfortunately, this book is only the first part of the story.

The selling point for me was that I no longer had to have my chicken scratch handwriting on the tabs of my business's binder tabs.Also, I felt that the labels were not easy to apply at all! It was time consuming and frustrating, especially if I didn't place them down perfectly straight on my first attempt to stick the labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to make, use & read","review":"These dividers were just what the teacher ordered for organizing my high school student's binder.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again, another time drain. In my case, the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder, making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs, which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great divider set with labels","review":"The binder is a nice quality easy-touch 3-ring.

According to the literature, Valentino's character was given a Latin name to fit his look. Yes, Valentino was Latin, his mother being French and his father, Italian. I just don't think his look was heavily Latin to the extent that it required a name change for his character. I think Ronald Colman and John Gilbert looked much more Latin when playing such roles in films. It's just my view on the matter. It was interesting to see George O'Brien and William Boyd in small supporting roles. I think Moran is one of the best of the seafaring silents I have seen, and I would highly recommend this set especially if you are not a Valentino fan but like high sea adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six sigma or Six histories ?","review":"It seemed interesting in the beginning, but my interest was not to read a pile of ideas that they have gained (the companies like Ge, etc), but like really implementing it and really disillusioned me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many, how many and who.","review":"I FELT YOUR BOOK WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY INTERESTING AND REALLY MOTIVATED ME TO START A BUSINESS USING THIS MGT STYLE.BUT, YOU DID NOT ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS I NEED TO KNOW 1.

I believe that Six Sigma truly is a powerful industrial/business tool. Unfortunately this book reads like it was designed as a brochure for managers considering implementation of quality control programs for their companies. There are some basic Six Sigma tenets outlined, but in disappointingly little depth. It was especially frustrating to wade through all of the RAH-RAH name-dropping of corporations and CEOs to get to any real information. I did not expect to be a 'black belt' when I finished this book, but all I really came away with was a cursory introduction to the Six Sigma approach and the sense that I had just been delivered a thinly veiled sales pitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to call 6 sigma academy and ask for their brochure","review":"I bought this book considering the hype around this subject.

For people who go to sleep at night with phrases like \\"market share\\" and \\"profit margin\\" dancing about in their heads, this book may seem helpful. One cannot help but wonder, however, what would happen to quality and productivity if the time, money, effort, and energy devoted to ingesting this sort of thing were instead pumped into attending to the job at hand.

However, this book is a total dissapointemet, as it is more of advertisement than knowlege. The author could have written ten pages to describe what was said on 281 pages! All that was written were Black Belts, how vital were they to the process. No emphasis on the Six Segma process, no description of the mechanism from an engineering prespective. It is more of 'Six Segma is the best and we can deliver the impossible' approach! For me this could be a good Novel to read, not for serious Managers."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be expected","review":"Not surprised, but disappointed. This book is what is to be expected from a group of people who have a good understanding of concepts but no understanding of application.

They outline the general six sigma steps and the roles of the green belt, black belts and other players in the six sigma methodology.However, upon close reading, the book is poorly written and has apparent self contraditions. There is not much meat in the book. For what they covered, the book could have condensed to 30-50 pages.They leave many questions unaswered -- you may have to hire them to help you implement six sigma.In summary, it is worth a quick glance but do not read closely. It is a book on six sigma written at the minus 1.7 sigma level, in my opinion anyway.P.S. I am not panning six sigma; it is a fairly good system and i like how it is tied to the customer and financials of a company -- something other approaches have assumed, but did not stress.You can reach the reviewer at doestat@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIE Review","review":"Great stuff, just like I remembered from the old days.

All of the band members are in terrific form throughout and contrary to popular consensus, the production is not muddy or impenetrable, but very bass heavy and expansive.

There are a couple of gems (\\"Flying\\" strikes me as one of the best songs of recent memory), but there was little grab upon first listen and even less after my 40th. I don't have a problem with the covers as some do (I love their rips in years past through \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\\", \\"Sailin' On\\", and \\"The Ocean\\", amongst others), but even the covers seem forced. I know these four can do better work. Even \\"Sacred Ground\\", a needless repeat from the greatest hits CD of 7 or so years ago, sounded better the first time around.

Now I have to say it is no STAIN but very good non the less. Their sound is different. A great experiment by Vernon and the rest of the guys. I cant argue with it. They wanted a unique sound that set them apart from the sound we are hearing today and it works. (Ala Smashing Pumkins with their sound on Siamese Dream) Song wise, LC retain the dark edge from STAIN and pull a few musical inventions along the way.

There is the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but, in the case of Living Colour right now, the whole is much much less. Vernon is the greatest living guitarist, period. Corey is tremendous singer, avoid buying this album or sell it and buy his solo album Hymns instead. Doug Wimbish is an amazing musician, and Will is a damn fine drummer, which makes it all the more confounding that they produced this dog after such a long layoff. The lyrics are terrible, and the music is worse. The only thing worth listening to are the two covers, and that is sad.

Why the cover songs? Cuz, there tain't nothin worth playing on the radio. So they turned to covers songs to try and reach the masses. And what is with all the electronic noises and crazy rythyms.

Because every album before was so amazing and different.Well I ordered this CD from Amazon UK because I wanted to hear it ASAP. I went home and like I did for Time's up and Stain, I sat alone in front of my stereo to experience the new LC CD. How do I describe this record? BORING and CONTRIVED.

But the sound production is atrocious. Its like they purposely went for an early 80's garage band sound, which is fine if you're The White Stripes. But Living Colour should have a big, loud crystal clear sound, so that Vernon's notes sear through your head like a red hot blade. Speaking of Vernon, where are the guitar solos? Has he been hanging out with the members of Metallica, who convinced him that guitar solos are just \\"so passe'?\\" And the lyrics? Fuggetaboutit!! As trite, whiney and cliche' a list of leftwing whinings that I've ever purchased. I can dig the message, but do they have to beat us over the head with it every freakin song?

The (Back in Black) cover was pretty good. And (Flying) is pure inspirational genious. Just Beautiful. But the rest of the album made me want to use the disc as a coaster for my drink. I was especially dissapointed with the Beatles cover..(Tomorrow Never Knows). Now, if a quartet of brotha's can't get that song to come out soundin'as funky as the Beatles did, well....Nuff said.

Less techno experiments and more Bad Brains influence.When the band first came out they were touted as having the \\"Best Rhythm Section\\" in rock.

Dennis Miller is a man who is very familiar with each subject matter he decides to take on, and many of these rants will become fan favorites for years to come.

It was clear from the first few chapters who the villain would be; the secondary characters, while trying to be amusing, were merely annoying.While not as laughably, depressingly god-awful as With This Ring, I Thee Wed does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as with Quick's past works, like Mistress, Rendezvous, Scandal, etc. It's a trend with Quick that she uses formulic characters (i.e., the dark, tortured hero, the virginal, sweetly valient heroine) but somehow, starting with Affair, the formula has become noticeably unbalanced. I don't hold much hope for Wicked Widow, and frankly, I am not sure I want to read any more Quick after my these last two cringe-worthy, money-wasting efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I am a fan of Quick/Krentz and I love her historical romances. I had been already a bit disappointed with \\"With this ring\\" so I thought this one was hopefully going to be better. I was wrong, \\"I Thee Wed\\" is much worse. I don't know where is the romance here. It seems like A. Quick is much more interested in the plot she painfully sets up than in her characters. It's a pity since the quality and characteristic of her previous books lied in her ability to describe the relationaship between complex and strong-minded characters.

The assorted people he runs into once he has been extracted from his isolated car, of course, offer him Things to Consider and A Reason to Live.4. End of story.The doctor part is necessary because that enables him to do noble, helpful things for his Fellow Man (or Woman), including delivering a baby.

The loneliness of his main character trying to meet the goal of his death is a long and thought out process. Problem is the thoughts are slow and plodding.

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz....","review":"After 'Snow Falling in Cedars', I was ready for a new book by Guterson. By page 67, I knew I was in trouble because I had managed to find time to read two other novels while getting to page 67. I guess I persevered through the whole book because I kept thinking, 'something has to change, it has to get better - thats what the blurb on the back of the book promises'. But alas, no. The book rambles on and as you get closer and closer to the end (with many a hopeful flick to the last page - \\"only 30 more pages to go!\\"), the plot disintegrates and the storyline really does become a aimless, directioneless romp through east Washington State.I wonder if this book would have been published if it had been his first? The only thing it has going for it is very nice language decribing Washington, but with no storyline, I wouldn't never have bothered to read another book by him. Ah well, I await the film for Snow Falling on Cedars instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go along with Ben on his trip","review":"Another great by Guterson (also good is Snow Falling on Cedars and his shorty story collection), this story follows a widower retired Seattle heart surgeon who has learned he has terminal cancer and decides to end it his way. He plans a last hike/hunt through the Cascades with his faithful dogs, and in the end plans to shoot himself. As his journey progresses, we learn about his life. His journey doesn't exactly go as he planned, and we soon see he's not just some staid doctor figure. I wasn't sure how his journey would end, but I when I finished this book I was even more impressed with Guterson as a writer, I would even compare him to Steinbeck. Unfortunately, his last two (in particular The Other) weren't quite at this level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The narrative is good, the ending OK. But the dialogue is wooden, there are wrong usages of words (adverse-averse; \\"may\\" instead of \\"might\\"), which were written in error and not edited out. The book looks as if it had been rushed out to capitalize on Snow Falling.I tell myself to stop reading as soon as I know a book's a dud; I wish I'd followed my own advice here. At least \\"East of\\" is short. If you want good writing, try: Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes, Mordecai Richler's Barney's Version, Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park, John Irving's Widow for One Year, and anything by Richard Russo. But don't waste your time on Guterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guterson ran out of gas","review":"Half way through this book, I couldn't put it down, then all of a sudden it ends rather uneventfully.

The story line could not overcome my distaste enough for me to get through to the end. I am not in the habit of reviewing books but this was such a disappointment.

Irish Wolfhounds are the most docile of dog breeds. They are lazy, if anything. They are very independent-minded and I doubt if any \\"pack mentality\\" in the way Guterson suggests would occur.The author plainly used wolfhounds because of their size. Equally as plain: he never met one.Otherwise the book was good writing about implausible events."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"If you loved 'Snow Falling on Cedar's' (as I did), and buy this book as the next great novel by Guterson -- you are likely to be disappointed. For me, the great plot and vivid writing were missing. This was a bland and slow-moving story. If you must read it -- wait for the paperback. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and just plain awful...a waste of time","review":"I loved his first book, and living in Seattle, I eagerly anticipated this book. That Ben is a doctor who saves lives and heals, and then finds joy in the senseless killing and destruction of nature's creatures did not mesh well with me. Add that to the fact the story was lifeless, characters wooden and interchangeable...I didn't finish the book because quite frankly, I couldn't care less whether he lived or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing...","review":"As a cancer survivor, a health care professional who devotes full time to death and dying issues and as a fan of \\"Snow....\\", I had looked forward to savoring this book in an Adirondack cabin on vacation. Unfortunately, I did not find the character compelling nor the mission believable and I was enough disturbed by the hunting scenario described on page 57, I immediately closed the book,FOR GOOD ! I beleive any reader who is repulsed by hunting/killing for enjoyment will be totally repulsed by the book. Can NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bestseller????? Beyond me....","review":"I was only able to read the first few chapters of the book before closing it up. I just couldn't get into it. The authur seemed so amateur in his writing; unwitty dialogue, repetitive descriptions, unentertaining writing. You just can't really get into this, see what the author is trying to say, or feel for the main character, Ben, or any of the other characters he meets. This book has been a bestseller I've noticed. I could not believe it! It just doesn't have the talent, the excitement needed to be anything special. The author had a previous book a lot of us liked. To this book, major thumbs down; unrecommended; disappointing work from an up and coming gifted young writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Snow Falling on Cedars","review":"I'm quite suprised by the reviews that rate this book a poor follow up to Snow Falling on Cedars. They are very different books, and East of the Mountains is intentionally more focused on an internal journey of an individual man. If you understand that going in, the book completely lives up to what we expect from Guterson's writing.It does lack the intricate weaving of multiple characters and storylines of Snow Falling on Cedars, but I really enjoyed the attention Guterson gives to Ben's character development. And no one has ever captured the essence of Eastern Washington like this author has--having lived there for 5 years (now in Seattle, much like the lead character), his visual portaits of the land are both accurate and stunning.If you appreciate understanding what motivates characters, and enjoy rich, descriptive detail of landscapes, you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted narration makes this a real snoozer","review":"I, who grew up in the very towns Guterson described, looked forward to reading this book with great anticipation. What a disappointment!The narrative was stiflingly slow. Guterson seemed intent on poetically describing, in minute detail, every windswept road, tumbleweed and piece of sagebrush from Vantage to Wenatchee. The book literally reeked with graphic descriptions of wounds to dogs, birds and humans. The purpose of these descriptions seemed intended solely to shock the reader.The ponderous descriptions drew the focus so far from the main character that he seemed like an afterthought. The main character's flashbacks to his youth -- which could have brought him to life -- fell flat, simply overshadowed by Guterson's obsession with creating a backdrop for this character.Hunters, veterans or doctors MAY manage to find some redeeming value in this book, but it's doubtful. Don't waste your time on this one, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human life and loss","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed Snow Falling On Cedars with my book group, I looked forward to Guterson's second book. He handles human tragedy with grace and dignity in both books, though East of the Mountains was even more intense as the reader examines Ben's pending mortality prior to the autopsy table.East of the Mountians is about loss: Ben's loss of his own life, loss of the love of his life, loss of his youth, loss of hope and the world's loss of Ben, of Rachel, of their love for each other. Snow Falling on Cedars looked at past loss and moves on; East of the Mountains looks at future loss and lost of the past too. The omnipresent feeling of loss as life comes to its end was overpowering to me, so much so, I had to put the book down often to let the vicarious despair pass.I enjoyed the book, but closed it with a feeling of overwhelming sadness; knowledge that my own life will contain the same sorts of loss as Ben's and the same, sad evenual outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment after the wonderful Snow Falling on ...","review":"Boring, depressing, full of vivid descriptions of the bowel problems of a man with terminal colon cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"His first book, Snow Falling on Cedars, was terrific and one of my all time favorites. This one falls flat and disappointing -- and would be so even without comparison to his first book. Save your money. A major weakness is the Army/combat stuff, which was also the major weakness of his first book. Like a lot of Boomers he has no experience of war, and the scenes ring hollow -- at least to one who has had that experience. Hope his third book will be back up to standard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought David Guterson had so much talent in \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\", which is what drew me to purchase his new book. I was wrong! This story was SO BORING, with no reason for me to continue after page 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; rushed; loose prose","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this second novel by the author of the delicately crafted Snow Falling on Cedars.But this novel proved a disappointment. I can't help but feel that he has been such a sensation that his publisher pressured him to crank one out quickly - and it failed.The dialogue seems stiff and forced; the characters encountered by the elderly doctor seem artificial and one-dimensional. His decision to smoke pot comes too quickly and with no explanation, on the heels of an adamant refusal to smoke that stuff. His memories of childhood, the war and meeting his wife seemed an author's trick of filling uncomfortable gaps in the action.I ended up merely skimming too many pages. This is a shame. I believe David Guterson is a magical writer. And this story could have been so good. I hope he takes more time on his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, theme, characterization, but excessive descrip","review":"The writing is smooth, relaxing Guterson, but the story falls far short of \\"Snow Falling..\\" Way too much description of the country and landscape around Wenatchee. In a story of peregrinations, the author can confuse the reader by so many places where things take place. The theme, a man intending suicide, has his mind changed by events, a good one, and effective here. But I thought the book tended to be too padded with travelogue, names of rivers, highways, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but no cigar.","review":"After reading the great new novel, The Triumph and the Glory, I was looking forward to another memorable experience with East of the Mountains because I'd loved Snow Falling on Cedars so much. But this new one from Guterson just fell flat for me. I just couldn't accept the main character's motivations as believeable, and that will pretty much destroy a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"I'd read Guterson's first novel (and recommended it to several friends), his book of short stories, and his book on homeschooling (which I endorsed to my unschooling group), and I really looked forward to reading this new novel. But even three pages into it, I was sooooo disappointed. I did read the whole thing, just to be fair, but the prose is bloated and awkward, some of the characters are not consistently drawn, and the novel as written is just not good. The story itself has promise, but the manner of its telling kills it. It's coldly drawn, amateurishly written. Ironic, since at a recent reading on the tour for this book, Guterson spoke dismissively of his previous work, speaking instead of how his work in this new book demonstrated his growth as a writer. Hmmm. Since I so admired his earlier work, I should've taken that as fair warning. But I'd already advance-ordered the book through Amazon. Buyer beware! Wait til the October book sales at your local libraries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a man looking for one last hunt and facing his own death.","review":"i liked this story.Givens plans to go on one last hunt with his two dogs. facing the inevitable painful death of colon cancer, he plans to make his suicide look like a hunting accident so his daughter can get his life insurance money.things go awry right from the beginning leading to an end he hadn't anticipated. reminds me a little of the main character in ed abbey's THE FOOLS PROGRESS if he'd lived to be an old man. but that's just the way i saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guterson attempts Cormac McCarthy","review":"If you like the beautiful work of Cormac McCarthy's trilogy(All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, Cities of the Plain), do not read Guterson's new book. Here, you'll find a writer obviously attempting to write in the style of McCarthy, and failing. I seriously struggled to get through the first 64 pages of this book, but ploughed onward, with the knowledge that the book will be featured everywhere, from Barnes & Noble displays to dozens of reviews in magazines and journals. The book loses its ponderous McCarthyisms in the second half, which is better. My favorite parts include the relationship betweeen Givens and his dogs, and the sexual attractions he has with the younger female characters. I never read Guterson's Snow Falling on Cedars, so I can not compare it to that. I would advise readers to skip this one, and pick up McCarthy's Cities of the Plain for first-rate writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first paragraph sets the tone","review":"In the first paragraph we learn the character's sleep is visited - not interrupted, mind you, but visited - by phantoms: images of everything from family members to fruit trees. In the same breath we are told he didn't dream - that these images guarded the portal to dreams. Hmm. Sounds nice and literary, but if your sleep is visited by phantoms and images isn't that dreaming? Then we learn that he is insomniac and didn't sleep at all. Okay... But the pain he feels \\"throughout all his waking hours\\" only hits him when his feet hit the floor. Huh? Three self-contradictions on the first page. If good writing is long, rhythmic streams of words, and that seems to be the definition of the other reviewers here, then DG is a genius. By any other definition this is verbiose, pretentious drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A meditation on life and death","review":"I read this book in two long sittings. I was captivated by the writing--wandering, wondering descriptions of the geography of my home state. They were accurate enough to evoke memories of my own trips through the passes and the areas east of the mountains, but this was no travelogue--there was a certain dreamscape quality to the descriptions, also.I thought Ben's ruminations on his life, his impending death, and his attempts to control the timing of his death were compelling and kept me glued to the page.If you're looking for a book with a ton of action, best to look elsewhere. But if you don't mind going for a long drive through some pretty lonely country, where the questions are big and the answers are incomplete, then this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many feel they have so little to offer","review":"This book was my introduction to the author. It had contrived situations but the message regards how we encapsulate our lives and then regret the emptiness of our existence. This novel takes a suicidal individual out of his everyday life and thrusts him into situations where he faces life's complexities, it's frustrations and joys. In other words, he began to live again.I read his first book after reading this, and though it was good I prefer East of the Mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journeys","review":"Guterson uses the beautiful form of the journey -- the bildungsroman, the journey at the beginning of life, the foundation journey, is seen in retrospect-- while Dr. Givens is taking a journey at the end of life. As is seen in his own flashbacks to childhood, war years, marriage and family, Givens is confronted by the unexpected. It is said that late in life one gets a respect for those events in life that one couldn't control and the effects they had on what one could. I am among the few reviewers who respected this book more than Snow Falling on Cedars, but perhaps that is because I worked on a cattle ranch in eastern Oregon where the rancher was dying of cancer, my grandmother had an apple orchard, and my whole professional career has been about family adjustment to illness. Guterson talks movingly about where we live -- in landscapes, inside of larger historical events, and among surprising and varied fellow travellers with biographies as complex as our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disjointed tale containing two fine set pieces","review":"East of the Mountains was a very disappointing follow up to Snow Falling on Cedars. Snow was a suspenseful murder story, combining a compelling criminal trial, a disturbing return to the internment of Japanes during WWII, a fine description of landscapes and a touching love story.East of the Mountains is a disjointed tale with little of interest. A man ill with an incurable cancer has a car accident and then is sucked into a succession of improbable events that is broken up only by two longish and compelling set pieces.The first is a reminiscence of youth in this region of orchards as the protagonist met and fell in love with his eventual wife.The second is a brutal depiction of a battle during the Italian Campaign in WWII.At the end of the book, the protagonist returns where he started, symbolizing neatly a book that achieves very little, as even the central story of how to deal with death gets nowhere.All in all disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guterson has lost his way.","review":"When compared to Snow Falling on Cedars, Guterson's East of the Mountains, has disappointed this reader. It's as if he had to publish another book quickly to recapture his audience. I fault his publisher. He would have better spent more time and write about a more interesting subject. He even could have used this theme if he had found some way to develop his characters in more depth. They are all very shallow and superficial. Hopping from character to character did nothing for me. Guterson should reread his \\"Snow Falling...\\" to find a book worth writing. I know he has the talent. Please try again, Mr. Guterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Reading this book is mental torture. The plot, if there is one, moves at a snail's pace. The characters are wooden and forgettable. A major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Way too much hunting. Some lovely descriptions but writing generally wooden. Unconvincing ending. Last but not least -- painful to read for anyone who loves dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful words, contrived plot","review":"Yes, I loved Snow Falling on Cedars and was anxiously awaiting his new novel. Although Guterson very ably shows his love of the land, I thought he fell disappointingly short in his depiction of Ben Givens and the adventures he encounters along his trek to end his life. Some were OK, others were downright hokey. The flashback scenes were the best part of the book. Still, it wasn't enough to save this story whose denouement, I'm sorry to say, seemed so contrived and unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story made long.","review":"This novel on it's own merit, not it's predecessors, is very hopeful that you will take it into your heart, for that is it's only hope, Obe Wan Kenobe. I was irritated by it's banality, it's innacuractcy. 'he just kept on smokin', he smoked the whole joint every time! At least he seemed an iota more mature than he did with his first romance in, Snow. I was really hopeful that this would be one of those books, like, Stones From the River, or The Shipping News, or even, The Bean Trees, but alas it was only a mediocre time consumer. The reminiscence of WWII seemed like filler and only prolonged the ennnnnnnnnding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\"","review":"Guterson is a WONDERFUL writer. His use of words is absolutely beautiful. So ... after \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" which I adored, I really looked forward to this one. Alas and alack, I was disappointed. I was, let us say, a captive audience in the car while the tapes played, and after a short while I was beginning to get antsy for the book to have a storyline. The detailed descriptions of the gore (my friend said he'd never heard the word \\"viscera\\" used so much before) made me queasy. And it's so depressing! Eventually, I was sorely tempted to grab the steering wheel and ram the car into a tree to stop the horror, and by the end I was ready to rip my ears off to escape. My boss loved it -- recommends it to everyone he sees. I didn't love it -- and I'm not alone. Like I said, the writing is beautiful -- almost poetic. The plot leaves a whole lot to be desired. So give it a try. Just please be warned that it's definitely not like \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid story","review":"I was attracted to this novel because it takes place in the state I live in, Washington. I was immediately pleased because the story was intriging, a retired surgeon finds out he has cancer and decides to set out on a hunting trip in which he plans to commit suicide, and the story of his life in the present and then his flashbacks to his younger days were well detailed, I felt I was really getting to know the character and I enjoyed rich history of Washington orchards brought out as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe he has only one novel in him","review":"I was disappointed in this second novel. After having read 'Snow Falling on Cedars' (recommended) I was looking forward to this book. 'East of the Mountains' lacks the ring of truth and as I made my way through this irritatingly soppy story; I suspected Guterson of writing, rather than a novel, a potential screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment at best.","review":"I'm disappointed. It took me months to buy this book, because I thought Snow Falling on Cedars was a little too soft for me, but then I saw this over and over on the bestseller list, and decided it must be good. Wrong! What IS the author's point? I couldn't feel sorry for Ben, I think I would have respected and liked him more if he had gone on with his plan. Ben is not even developed to the point where one could identify with him, instead he is written about as though he was never really supposed to exist anyway. The beginning of the story holds a little, but begins to fade in the middle, when Ben's exploits and adventures (if you can call them that) are being described, and the ending is really stupid. I'm horrified that the hardcover edition of this book costs $17.50! It isn't worth $2.00 at a bargain basement. Still, I gave it two stars instead of zero because it filled a few hours of my time, and anyone interested in a mindless trek into nothing might just enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and plodding introspective look at a dying man's mind","review":"I was disappointed in Guterson's book set in the part of Washington where I was raised. His plot was almost non-existent and even the descriptions of the beauty of the place didn't ring true. It was not a memorable book, but worth reading if you are Veteran who enjoys hunting and thinking about death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasent Read","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this is not \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" but where the book lacks the depth of Guterson's previous work, it makes up for it in charm and eloquence. I enjoyed this book and found it not only entertaining, but thought provoking. It may not have the intense, \\"heady\\" quality of \\"Snow,\\" but it's the kind of book I like to read during the warmer months: a lighter, relaxed piece that's perfect on a sunny afternoon with a glass of iced tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Givens Up","review":"David Guterson can write well; that much is evident in \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" But this book fails as a follow-up to that novel. In fact, about one hundred pages to the end, I've just given up. I find little to recommend in this novel. Most of the characters are cliched, two-dimensional creations, and the plot (what little there is of it) just plods along; about all that can be praised in the novel is Guterson's way with a descriptive phrase. I found Ben's wartime experiences jolting interruptions to the flow of the novel. The whole thing sort of seems just thrown together. I happened to read the last page, and am glad I didn't waste my time with the preceding hundred or so pages. Maybe Guterson will fare better with his third novel. Let's hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Snow","review":"The Kirkus reviewer was wrong; many people have been disappointed by this novel, and I'm one of them.Snow Falling on Cedars had a lot to it--a love story, a mystery story, a war story, and a story of the shabby treatment of the Japanese during WWII. I'm usually not much interested in descriptions of scenery, but in SFOC, I found them enjoyable and integral to the plot. Here, the descriptions just sat there, doing nothing.Here is a man who is planning to kill himself but gets quite bent out of shape when he cuts his head in an auto accident (wasn't he wearing a seat belt?). I laughed out loud.He seems quite concerned about his injured dog but seems to have no feeling for the birds he wantonly shoots.The story went nowhere, and the few possibly interesting characters Ben meets along the way are not developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - constant and constistant violence","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this authors second book - I loved the sensitivity and gentleness of understanding demonstrated in Snow on Cedars - East is the first book I have started and not completed in 20 years. I was unable to understand the proponderance of violence and gore directed at animals - it did not seem to deepen my understanding of the character, the land or a culture - it seemed purposeless.

This book is over rated, marginally written, and very boring. After being encouraged to read this book by all the great reviews it has gotten, along with the awards won by the author, I thought I was in for something grand. It turns out that the author is about as descriptive and detail oriented as a sleepy three year old. If you enjoy somber prose and reading grocery lists, then this book is for you. If not, keep in mind some other books. If you like serious writing, with wonderful prose and imagery, try \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad. Or, if your into detail and descriptive writing, take a look at \\"Moby Dick\\" by Herman Melville. My copy of \\"East of the Mountains\\" is collecting dust on a shelf in the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I don't understand how Mr. Guterson has become the darling of literary critics.

I would not recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tour de waste of time.","review":"A second book that is second rate, so disappointing after his great debut.It would have been so much better if Ben had taken the opportunity to have had a fatal car crash in the first 50 pages and saved me the time of reading the other 200."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY...NOT THAT INTERESTING","review":"I started the book with anticipation and enjoyed the first few chapters. However, the story started going downhill when Ben meets character after character with not much happening. Ben doesn't seem to come to any conclusions through the course of his physcial journey and and I didn't see any emtional journey taking place either. Also, the writer mentions geographic areas endlessly and unless you're familiar with the area of eatern Washington, it was bit boring to hear of all the landmarks and town names. Not a very stimulating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Literary Talent is Obvious But No Story Here","review":"The author of this book has wonderful literary talent. But unfortunately I found the work to be,if not downright pretentious, highly presumptuous. There was no story. The events were episodic, predictable and boring; points to be made by the author masquerading as plot. One cliche after another. Snow Falling on Cedars was much better but even those characters never really breathed life either. All the characters this author creates seem to have life happen in their close vicinity rather than that they lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I am surprised some people did not like this book. I could hardly put it down. I don't usually stand for much description, but in this book it just flowed naturally as part of the action.

The plot device of an elderly man coming to grips whith his own mortality - seemed to be ripe with possibilities.

In a day of sensational exposes and relentless action novels, a man going forth to die does not sound particularly mind-grabbing. However, I was underestimating Guterson. Here is a writer who can truly write. The best thing about it is that he does not seem to be straining to write well, as some authors do. One is not aware of the author, only of the narrative moving inexorably forward with language that can only be described as graceful and seamlessly descriptive.This novel will make you think about things that matter. It may even motivate you to reassess your life and make a few adjustments. If you are so stuck in the mundane boredom of your life that you refuse to reflect, then you perhaps can pass this book by. Otherwise, pick up a copy and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"All I can say is insufferable details that go on and on, are boring or make you sick, I believe I skipped over more than I read.

I hope the author comes up with a better plot for his next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grave dissapointment.","review":"East of the mountains has retained the sophmore curse - the second of anything is never as good as the first. This book leads off with an interesting premise, but doesn't go anywhere with it. The author just moves the main character around, leaving him with nothing to do. He wants to commit suicide, he's in a car accident, his dogs are attacked, he meets a few new people on his way to the vet, and he helps with the delivery of a baby. There is the whole story in a nutshell. I hope his next book is a vast improvement over this one, and I also hope that he can learn from his mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"prime example of the tyranny of creative writing classes","review":"Amazing how much wordiness we've learned to put up with - no, we even demand it, as proof of good writing.

The writer includes it for the usual creative writing class reason: because he can."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible according to the opinion of Sister Mary Theola","review":"I did not read all of this book because Sister Mary gives her opinion on Angels, how Adam and Eve were created, and whether Adam and Eve really lived in the garden of Eden.

A n umber of scenes used over and over and over as if there was a paucity of decent film clips. No mention that Walter Cronkite got the significance of Tet '68 totally wrong. It skips lightly over Kennedy's motivations for sending troops in the early 60's, McNamara's duplicity over the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and Johnson's incompetence as commander-in-chief / target analyst for the USAF. At the end of it, I was disappointed. Recommend a good book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat lector","review":"For a knowledgeable review of this book's content, see Stephen Meyers' detailed examination of the carelessly sensational content, faulty documentation, and plainly inaccurate assertions.

I find some of the ideas interesting but I found mistakes concerning scienctific theories and major flaws in the research. For example when the author is discussing the birth of Christ he mentions that all the genetic information needed for the blood of the baby comes from the father. This is incorrect. These types of errors probably stem from the fact that many scientific articles listed in the bibliography are substancially out of date.

For example, the developers note book covers TK#, this book covers TK# and #WT.This book is much more architectural in design than the Developers Notebook. So if code is your thing then you may want to evaluate both. I personally prefer architectural perspective because in this case it's more about choosing a direction of development as opposed to learning the structure of the TK# library, which is interesting, but can be gleaned from the online documentation.This is a must have book for anyone who wants to take their .NET code beyond the confines of the Windows operating system. It's well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"screw all u haters","review":"matisyahu is the man. It is very hard for a jew to come new into the music world and be very popular. His music is an inspiration and brings a great sound to your ears. This guy is the coolest and you need to get this album and not listen to any haters. yeah keep doing your thing and represent for the jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"overproduced garbage.","review":"First album - WonderfulLive at Stubbs - Excellent! One of my favorite albums of '05.This album. . . junk! Super overproduced, terribly boring songs and I'll be damned if I was waiting for a guest appearance by Jessica Simpson to come along somewhere. Seriously, this was probably the biggest disappointment I've had in some time seeing as I despise most new music. I was hoping Matisyahu could come along and change that opinion for me. . .instead, he just added himself to the top of an already overflowing pile of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're settling people...","review":"It''s amazing to me what we as music fans are willing to settle for. Does anyone remember Peter Tosh? Isn't it enought already with the white boy singing reggae thing? While I'm not against anyone of any color making good music, I am not into bad music. This whole craze on this guy seems to be more about the outfit he's wearing than on the music. The band is okay, but Matisyahu is amateur at best. Take the uniform off and all you've got is a bad imitation of a guy playing at a college bar. Sorry, but we shouldn't ever settle for mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever...stick to beat box","review":"Okay, the nice stuff first...this guy can definitely beat box. No question there. So why is it he trys to sing? No clue. Matisyahu is not a good singer. It'sd that simple. He wouldn't even make it through to Hollywood on American Idol. I mean, this guy is out of tune and way in front of the beat. So why doesn't he just make a beat box album? That would be great. He is actually talented at that. This album, though, is a good lesson in learning to do what you're good at, not what you'd like to be good at.I saw him live and the same thing. Everyone stands around tapping there feet until the beat box song and then they all go crazy. Hey, Matis! Take that as a sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this guy so popular? Are people really that gulliable for a gimmick?","review":"This album has zero going for it. It's schlocky reggae/rap with nothing new to say except for the lyrics. If you got this guy out of his religious garb and gave him a shave he'd be just another white guy trying to sound \\"down with those crazy urban youth kids.\\" He is 100% packaging. Maybe he does that so that 30-something white execs like me won't feel stupid browsing in the rap section of Virgin Records or something, but really, folks, don't believe the hype. There's much better reggaeton, rap, and reggae rap out there; all this guy is offering is some color-coding as it were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond flavor of the month","review":"This is nothing more than Flavor-of-the-month push from a major record company. Obviously talented, but less than those who have made the top 12 of this year's American idol.Good mostly positive messages, but you can get that by listening or reading to original artists/authors.\\"Shalom/Saalam\\" is close to having hint of originality, but that is it.Might as well buy the newest Backstreet Boys CD. At least that is well polished, flavor-of-the-month."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST IMITATION OF REGGAE I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!","review":"This guy can't sing to save his soul and while the lyrics may be religious, it is hard to listen to his off beat, off tune offerings.He can't beat box, rap, or sing. If you need a coaster or paper weight, buy this cd cause this is no reggae sensation. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!P.S.If I could've rated it below one star, I surely would have. A rating of minus 5 stars would be a complaint for this crap! Anybody who gave this 5 stars is smoking some serious weed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't even like reggae...","review":"...but I really like this cd. It's reggae, but it definitely has rock and hip hop influences. King Without a Crown is just a great song. It's also nice to listen to music every so often with positive and uplifting lyrics! (As opposed to most of the other stuff I listen to where I just tolerate the lyrics because the music is good.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"i was expecting some experimentation and something UNexpected, really and got none of that. almost all the songs have the same basic beat with different overlying beats and that can get annoying after a while. his song 'King Without A Crown' is by far his best, and all the rest just don't have that spunk and originality. i also have his 'Live at the Stubbs', and if u like Matisyahu, get that album and leave this one alone. its so much like the last album, just the bad version. his songs 'King without a Crown' is also better live on the LATS album. save this money and just add him to your myspace. he's so friggin cool, he just needs to get a little more experimental with his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music and lyrics!!!","review":"The music is great and powerful, brings a lot of energy.The lyrics are very deep and thoughtful. These songs reaches deep inside and very universal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"judging for matisyahus first album i expected this album to be similar. I wanted an album that you could listen to from start to finish without pushing the button for the next song. Youth brings a different side to matisyahu with much more vocals and less cantering and slightly less reggae feel. Ill admit that i am somewhat dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with every listen","review":"Unbelievably refreshing an unique. Whoever said it was more hip hop doesn't know reggae or hip hop because it's nothing of the sort. If anything it has more of a rock flair than his earlier material. Very uplifting and inspirational and well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feelin it.","review":"The songs in this album are only decent, I'm reviewing a second time because I figured as time went on this cd would grow on me. Well, I still have Shake off the Dust on replay because Youth doesn't cut it. Sad that his best album is out of print. Of course Matisyahu isn't going to do true reggae again like his previous albums, main reason is nobody really wants to hear the same slow reggae. But in my opinion that's what Matis is best at; a unique style of reggae with the deep bass and jamaican accent. Trying to create another unique style that isn't reggae, resulted in Youth. Matisyahu is still an amazing artist and I'm curious to hear his next album to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reggae star lost the reggae","review":"What a monumental blunder. Unlike their promising debut, Shake off the Dust Arise, you'd be hard pushed to find any reggae at all here. I cannot describe the disappointment his fanbase feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album, talent and message!!!","review":"I am personally glad that he went alittle more main stream or I would of never discovered this album. It's a work of art and very uplifting. We need more artists out there like him. I'm a new fan in a big way. I think there should be more indie sounding tracks. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I hoped for","review":"I loved...LOVED shake off the dust and live @ stubbs. I saw matis twice live and he was more incredible than words can explain. Of course I respect his right as an artist to grow, evolve, and expand. But for me, this album seemed to get away from what made Matty matter to me. i'll keep listening but, have been playing the old album since. It seems he went for a poppier sound, trying to cross over genres and reach more people. his original sound put him in the spolight and now he's gonna switch it up... fine. it's just not there for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I really love matisyahu live at stubb's. I was highly antisipating that this album would be great and it was. i cant wait to see matis live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matisyahu - Youth","review":"I was pleasantly surprised after my first listen to Matisyahu's \\"Youth\\" album. It is a significant step-up from his previous \\"Live at Stubbs\\" album, which was really repetitive and hard to make it through.\\"Youth\\" however, has a good mixture of songs. There are enough faster/upbeat songs to offset the slower/chill songs. Also, Matisyahu doesn't stick to the same dancehall singing/ rapping/ talking throughout the entire album. There's a little bit of real singing in there and it's a nice change!The album really is helped out by producer Bill Laswell, who has worked with a very diverse group of musicians. The backing music on the album is much richer and broader than the live album.\\"Youth\\" is a really good album. By know, everyone is a fan of \\"King Without a Crown\\" but there are definitely a lot of other good songs on there. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just flavour-of-the-month!","review":"While many other reviewers are calling this flavour of the month (largely because I think of Matisyahu's incredible amount of TV and radio airtime), there is quite a bit of complexity in every song he creates, including everything from this latest release.Although this CD serves as a huge jump in the genre, mixing some rock (a transfer from the Live at Stubb's album) and even a little bit of other styles, it's still Matisyahu. His lyrics are powerful and piercing. These songs are about something that he cares deeply for -- and it shows.His title song is different, I agree. But is it any less appealing than King Without a Crown? I don't think so. It's just not what everyone was expecting.Despite a few imperfections, this is a solid ablum with a mix of genres that should appeal to everyone who is a fan of the original. It's different, but I think it's a fresh sort of difference that only adds to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the bandwagon","review":"Admittedly, when everyone starts salivating over a particular musical act, I listen with a skeptical ear. So, I checked out his first two CDs and they are markedly better than this one.When my brother was about 8-years-old, he would lock himself in his room with his karaoke machine, Casio keyboard, and Jaminator and record his sessions for posterity. I found one of these tapes a few years ago and had a good laugh at his now 25-year-old expense. Now I'm wondering if I shouldn't send it in to a record company.This CD isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to listen to it ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak shtick","review":"If Matisyahu were a black guy, this would be a mediocre pop reggae album circa 1988, and you probably wouldn't even consider buying it. But he is a hasid and capitalizes on this shtick, and somehow we are supposed to think this makes the music sound better. Sure the word \\"zion\\" is peppered throughout his lyrics, and there's some psuedo spiritual angle here that offers some redemption, but overall it's pretty weak. His fake jamaican accent, overly produced electronic sound remind me of some bad reggae from way back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"I saw great promise in this album because I enjoyed some of his \\"older\\" stuff. Although some of that older stuff was often rather bland, the foundation was there for something great in the future. Unfortunately, this album didn't impress me in the least. The music is more progressive, but I find myself annoyed more than entertained. The most annoying thing about Matisyahu is his penchant for singing \\"Oy yoy yoy oy\\" in nearly every song. Even when he's not singing that phrase, he seems to makes every word some derivative of those nonsensical words. It just should have been so much better than this. \\"Time of Your Song,\\" \\"Indestructible\\" (very dancehall feel to it), and \\"King Without a Crown\\" (although the version on this album feels rushed) are some tracks I found more interesting than annoying after the first few listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"matisyahu - talented & 'out of the box'","review":"i'll make it short and quick, since detailed reviews are already here; 'Youth' has some blazing tracks on it. i highly recommend this album to any reggae fan, and those who want to hear something slightly different. matisyahu beatboxes, chants and sings in varied melodies, along with catchy and innovative reggae beats. if you're not sure, check out 'King Without A Crown' - beautiful lyrics and a catchy vibe :]My favorite tracks include:IndestructibleFire Of Heaven/Altar Of EarthTime Of Your SongUnique Is My DoveKing Without A Crown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell the truth","review":"To everyone who is saying that he is surprisingly or unbelievingly good, why is that? I've heard artists simialar to him, and even though he is very good I can understand why people are surprised. THE MAN IS A HASIDIC JEW! I am Jewish, and I'll tell you the truth, I laughed when I heard of a Hasidic Jew rapping, and then I listened to him and was also, like many other people, pleasantly surprised. Jewish people CAN rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matisyahu is the best","review":"You cant go wrong with Matisyahu. My husband and I blast his music in the car and at the beach. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly dissapointed","review":"The only way I can describe this album is \\"underwhelming.\\" I kept waiting for a good beat or a guitar solo to catch me... but they never came... not once. I remember hearing the single \\"Youth\\" on the radio for the first time and hoping that it wasn't the best track on the album, and unfortunately it was. His live album was excelent, and I still recomend that disc to anyone interested in his music, but he needs some more work in the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Matisyahu.

Some of the suggestions are likely to get an inexperienced person hurt and will certainly cause problems for horses.

There is no reason to see this cliched \\"scheming wife killing her husband to run away with another lover only to discover that her husband was buried with a winning lottery ticket\\" piece of garbage! Only for the \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" completists. This video features Mary Crosby of \\"Dallas\\" and David Lander of \\"Laverne and Shirley\\" as the couple.

I didn't read the product description, only the product features. I spoke with Wayfair (the distributor) and was told I could order another one at a 10% discount. With shipping it would be another $21 for what I thought I was getting in the first place when I paid $23! GRRR... A set means 2 not 1 and they refused to honor the item's title description.

He does a lot of excellent stuff, but once you've heard Redneck Mother live 500 times, and four times in one week in Belize it becomes clear that sometimes the artist ain't always about the art. I'm as big a JJ fan as anybody, but this one just ain't very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jerry Jeffs best work!!!","review":"Defiantly not Jerry Jeff's best work would be an under statement!

Singing isn't really Jerry Jeff's forte, which makes it hard to get excited about hearing him sing Jazz covers badly that aren't all that good in the first place. But- Jerry Jeff audiences aren't hard to please. If he can make millions singing Redneck Mother enough times to engrain the noise patterns in the Austin Texas dirt he should be able to sell plenty of copies of this.

I was disappointed indeed. The story is unrealistic and the plot is a muddle. It moves from one superficial character to another and from one incident to another without too much depth. Characters are under developed and weave in and out of the story without a connecting thread. Incidents and conversations happen without reason or explanation and kept me wandering what the logic was. Altogether, the story is wrapped in ambiguity. I kept on hoping it would get better further on, but reached the end without ever really enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarassing","review":"This book is a loser on some many fronts that it is difficult to enumerate them all. Plot: stupid and unbelievable, Characters: cardboard cut-outs, Dialogue: juvenile, Description: Inane and used primarily for filler and to up the word count, I could go on but it would be too much like reading the book. Stay Away. This one is just for Baldacci's bank account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camel Club dissapoints","review":"As I read this book I was rollng my eyes and thinking that it had to get better.

I have lived in the Wash DC area for forty-one years and worked for the federal government as an attorney for a little over thirty of those years. What he says ain't so!The bureaucracy's prime area of expertise lies in the expenditure of vast amounts of money and not being held accountable for it. And the Homeland Security department is one of the prime examples.Baldacci does, however, know the geography and landmarks of the DC area quite well and this adds somewhat to the book's appeal for those who live in the metro area where the action takes place. (maybe this is what they called damning something with faint praise)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, action-packed adventure","review":"I wanted to start at the beginning of the Camel Club to make sure I didn't miss anything. I really enjoyed this book. \\"Oliver Stone\\" and the rest of the Camel Club are great characters, and I enjoyed learning about them in this book.

Some of the most predictable conclusions I have EVER read.The ending of the book read likes the most naff American movie drivle, it's as if he was deliberately writing if with the screenplay in mind and a half-hearted dramatic ending.Without wanting to spoil it for anyone, the line around \\"bad atmospheric conditions in the atlantic\\" made may laugh out loud as one of the most pathetic efforts at building suspense I have ever read, it was just SO predictable.

Sadly, I still don't know why that is. This novel, while interesting in its many sides of American/Muslim relations has so many impossible to believe moments and coincidental happenings that belief is totally suspended. The climatic ending actual reads like '80s GI Joe cartoon. That's probably too harsh but that's the first thing I thought. Another problem was the title/series itself is the \\"Camel Club\\" although the members save one are almost purposeless.

He has had me caring for his characters and eagerly anticipating each time I pick up the book to continue reading it.That was, until I read The Camel Club. I found it so out of keeping with Baldacci's style and talent, that it was almost as if someone else wrote the book and put his name on it.I didn't care about one character of the myriad of players in the book; and there were a myriad of them. You needed to keep a cast of characters list at hand to constantly check who you were reading about at any point in the book.The plot had so many twists that it seemed to have been planned by a MapQuest representative on coke.The plot was unbelievable and \\"unfollowable\\".I have never written anything like this before, but when I finished the book this morning I felt a need to share my thoughts with other devoted Baldacci fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't pick it up!","review":"I read this book to the bitter, ridiculous end, but it was an excersise in discipline, patience and self-flagellation. I wanted to like it, but it was so un-engaging that I couldn't force myself to read more than about 25 pages at a time. Consequently, it took me about two weeks to make my way through this quagmire. That said, Bush-hating, blame-America-first Kosputin liberals will love it. One man's terrorist is another man's noble freedom fighter, you know.This was my first and last Baldacci book. I just can't believe that the author of this tripe could write anything worth my time. Try Vince Flynn, Joel Rosenberg or Oliver North."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard stuff maybe a little better","review":"The first half of the book seems kind of flat and he appears to telegraph the plot line, i.e. typical terrorist take over. However some of the characters do come thru with interesting hidden backgrounds, that prove vital to their survival.

I have read hundreds of novels and never before read a more hate filled book towards the United States. This book makes Michael Moore and Ted Kennedy sound conservative. If you are one who believes that George Bush went to war in Iraq to boost the stock price of Halliburton this book is for you.

The message is government is not to be trusted, there really aren't any good guys left and US policy has been wrong since WWI when America dropped the bombs on Japan without thought for the millions who would suffer from fallout. It gets even worse, Jimmy Carter is the best US president ever and our National Security along with CIA and FBI are running rough shod over all those nice, peaceful, Muslims.

I heard some vague rumors about the Camel Club being a timely story (it was an interview, I think), and the conspiracy afficionado that I am I picked it up. And then... I put it down after forcing myself to read through about 1/3 of the story. Now, I fullheartedly agree with those who describe America as the ultimate rogue who replaced the soviet as the number 1 evil and would've loved to read an intelligent, if fictional story about it. Unfortunatelly Camel Club read like something the author had tossed off over the weekend, with predictable and shallow characters and such poor writing it was hard to believe it came from somoeone who sold \\"millions\\" of books.This was my first and last Baldacci story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci Blunders","review":"While the first 75% of the book kept the reader hooked, the last 25% was just bad writing from an author who should know better. The ending was pure fantasyland with Middle East \\"terrorists\\" only killing themselves, not the good guys(Americans). Come on David, most readers ain't that stupid too buy what you were trying to sell them.Great fiction must have characters and a plot that mirror real life stuff. Terrorists that dont't kill their enemy ain't believable, unless a reader's IQ level is 85 or that of a 2nd grade elementary school student."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the DB we all love to read?","review":"This was painful to get through - something I have never said about any other DB books. Have loved everything he's written til now - hated this book! I read to escape the depressing world we are forced to live with as part of the post 9-11 world and to have to read about it by an author who I normally expect a good legal thriller from was a shock and disappointment. Found myself skimming a lot of pages b/c just wanted to be done with the book and get it back to the library - so glad I didn't spend money on this one. Not only did I have to slog through endless mideast this and islam that there were almost too many characters in this one and no development of them.If you've never read DB do NOT start with this book or you will never pick up another of his and you would miss out on so many good books - start with any of his besides this one and don't bother w/Camel - its not worth your time/money. Wish I could've given no stars here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read all the Balducci books and this book was \\"excruciating\\" to read.I read 2/3 of the book and finally had to quit.Way too many unrelated characters and plots that never seem to mesh.How could the editors have ever allowed this talented writer to produce this poor piece of mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK. Not as good as his early Work","review":"I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it. Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy. They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash \\"Author's Message\\" in neon lights. First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message. I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I admit that I am only reviewing the first 110 pages of this book. I was reading it and thought, \\"Boy, I hope this picks up soon\\". Then I noticed the page number. If I am that bored 110 pages into a book, it is not worth finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I loved the book even if it is not Bladacci's best book. This book is different somehow....in a good way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balldacci obviously of the blame America crowd.","review":"I bought this book on my kindle thinking I was getting a political thriller,but a short way into the book I realized it was just a vehicle for his hate America , blame America views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"It is now a week and a half after the estimated delivery date and I have not received my book nor have I heard from the seller. Apparently I am not alone in getting this lousy service from this seller. I should have listened to the other reviews before placing my order. Shame on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Don't waste your time with this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have been an avid David Baldacci reader these past years. His plots are unique and his characters have grit. His stories are thrillers and suspenseful.However, Camel Club appears to have been written by a political hack, in particular a left wing hack. The book is riddled with propaganda and leftist cliches that I almost threw the book in the trash.\\"Oliver Stone\\" is the main character in the book, and it appears that Oliver Stone may have helped write the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More on the theme","review":"Baldacci joins a large rank of current authors who use their prose to spout the liberal view (over & over in Baldacci's case). While it is hard to tell where he stands in the book, I did skip the parts that went on & on about the poor muslim terrorists & what they have suffered. The story itself is plausible...a club that centers on conspiracy theories, an almost retired secret service agent, who is likeable...and several fanatics. I hope there is no truth in this story.Basically it doesn't make a lot of sense in the end...just goes on & on with the violence & subplots. Baldacci can do a lot better than this one. From now on I'll read books written before 2000...just enough already of the liberal ideology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, satisfying ending","review":"Thought it was a great read. The characters were compelling and the story, although, it started off slow, had a very satisfying ending.-WG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"When the author when into a two+ page tangent on the Library of Congress he lost me. The first 100 pages don't move. I quit at p. 107. Several of his earlier works were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd Plot","review":"It has been mentioned by MANY others already, but I had to voice my displeasure of the book.The plot has so many forced twists and suprises it takes away from some pretty intersting parts of the books. 1/2 of them are pointless to the story, it seems like Baldacci just couldn't help himself from adding 1 more twist. Then he could help himself again. 7 twists later the book ends.Also, some things are just not plausible even for this type of book genre. I can't give it away but for those who read it - it could never happen.This is my first Baldacci book. Others have said his earlier works are good, but it will be a while before I go back to him, if ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Writing","review":"The first 300 pages of this book aren't too bad, although the author's opinions about how to fight Islamic terrorism are all too evident. But, the last 100 pages seem like they were written by an absolute amateur: plot twists that are just too convenient to allow credibility.Not a total waste of time, but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, don't waste your money","review":"I was surprised to see so many people claim Baldacci has \\"leftist\\" views. To me it sounded like a rehashing of right wing demagoguery but whatever.The story was just boring. And really, the author, like so many others, needs to stop relying on tv and film for his depictions of police procedurals. The straw that, if you will, broke the camel's back for me was when the nanny (who is ONLY wanted for tying up her employer and taking the kids) is shot and killed because she's driving directly at a roadblock with THREE FLAT TIRES and won't slow down.Give me a break. That's just one example of many. I am SO disappointed because I have read several of Baldacci's books in the past and really enjoyed them. This one is a stinker. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you agree with every liberal talking point, if not stay away","review":"This book would have been enjoyable had it not been filled with every liberal/blame-America/anti-US military talking point from the last 40 years. If you hate America, this is the book for you. Otherwise, stay away (like I wish I had done)."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring formula book","review":"Being a fan of Baldacci, I looked forward to reading his latest. Unfortunately, if this is your first novel of his, please do not put him on the shelf. Baldacci seems to be writing under pressure or guidance here. His spirited expression seems muted, the characters unbelievable and not worthy of our sympathy. The plot is comic and there is a detectable, yet subtle hint of whitewashing patriotism over substance.I was bored with the book. The last few chapters pick-up, but by then, you just want it to end. The Muslim vs. Americanism subplot is a bit hackneyed already, so an extraordinary effort would have been needed to lift this subject to new heights (imho).Leave this one, but do not turn away. Baldacci is a good writer and hope his next one is back to business. Try \\"The Winner\\" or \\"Total Control\\" which are gems of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This was THE BEST Baldacci book I have ever read. It is thought-provoking, timely and scary. Finally, an author who takes a clear look at what is happening in the world and how the policies of our government are having an impact on everyone on a world wide scale. The characters are very realistic and we see examples of them all around us. I am tired of reading and seeing stereotypical stories about Muslims who are out to destroy the United States. This book explores the geopolitical events that have shaped our world as it is today and it does so in a fast-paced, suck-you-in-to-the-last-page manner. I highly recommend it to everyone. To those of you who think it is America-bashing it is time you pulled your head out of the sand and learned the true history of this country. The events in this book are not so far-fetched and we all better wake up and realize how precious this world us before we allow our leaders to destroy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards","review":"Unlike his previous books this one was tough to believe. While some of the material in the past books stretched the possibility, this one was over the top. It took me 3 months of trying to get through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"David Baldacci is going to be rich, once he sues the 12-year-old who wrote this book using his name. That's the only plausible explanation I can come up with as to how Baldacci could possibly have written such an awful novel.You think my explanation is silly? You won't like this book then, because every single idea in it is worse than silly. The plot is a mess, the dialogue is attrocious, the characters are tired and cliche, and the worst part is that the author is capable of so much more.Don't waste your time on this one - you'll never get those hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible read","review":"I was unable to get more then three quarters of a way through the book. I liked the other book that I read which was written by him, but this one has turned me off on him for the rest of my life. Straight up liberal propaganda. The United States created terrorists. America bad, terrorists misunderstood. No thanks ever again Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camel Club","review":"I always find Baldacci a bit over the top when it comes to writing plot and structure - his books are a lot like throwing noodles at a refrigerator and they all stick. But I liked this book - unbelievable as much of it was - I liked the characters, I liked their fallibility in the face of very big villains. It moved and I didn't get impatient with it as I often do. I thought the bit at the end with Oliver Stone's daughter really weak and stupid. But then I usually fault Baldacci for some unbelievable plotting.This was a page turner. If he'd ever figure out that he could still tell a good story with half the number of characters and a more straight lined plot he would be a great writer. I think he's a great seller but I don't think he's a great writer.However this book is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was new as listed but....","review":"Book was new as listed but I still say hardback books need to stop being delivered in soft packages. We are being charged the same amount as we always have been only getting cheaper in delivery methods. Hardbacks come with banged up corners and other damage when shipped in soft packages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and entertaining","review":"This was a fast paced, entertaining book. It was hard at the beginning to keep all the characters straight, I found myself referring back to previous chapters. However, the characters are developed at a good pace, just enough to keep wanting for more at the end of each chapter. The lead characters are interesting and intriguing in revealing their back stories. All in all a good read, definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get Started","review":"I'd read all of David Baldacci's novels and anticipated settling down for a good long read, however, that wasn't the case. This is my second time starting this book and I just can't get past the first few chapters. It just doesn't hold my attention like his previous titles. For those of you reading Baldacci for the first time please don't let this novel turn you off to his other titles. I started reading his books after seeing the movie Absolute Power with Clint Eastwood. Absolute Power was his first novel and after reading that I was hooked. Several of his novels have reached number 1 on the NY Times bestseller list. I'm hoping that his next book will restore my faith in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting Story","review":"I truely enjoyed this story about conspiracy and murder. I originally bought this book because I love the author's writing, but was not too sure I would enjoy the subject. This story is based on terrorists and the Secret Service. I have a relative that works for the Secret Service and was not sure I would enjoy reading about possible terrorist attacks. The story is wonderful. It is also nice to realize that the author felt free enough to write about terrorists, especially after 9/11. I would recommend this book if you enjoy reading about conspiracies within the government and/or about murders. If you want to read this book, I recommend you set aside some time to read because I found I could not put the book down once I began it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood bound for sure!","review":"This book is the most anti-American book I have ever read. I'm sure the \\"New York Times\\" will love it. Not only is it poorly written, it fails to ever get off the ground as a \\"thriller.\\" Thriling it is not. The characters are flat and their dialog so stilted to the left that they all sound like Cindy Sheehan. This anti-American tripe is so far out that it will no doubt be scooped up by Hollywood as it continues to advance the political agenda of the far left. My copy is going straight into the trash; I would hate to have a part in the distribution of this worthless rubbish. What happened to the David Baldacci I used to read and love? I guess Hollywood got to you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"blame everthing on the society","review":"tried hard to finish it and still not really understand what the author stand point. He blames everything on American culture. I think he borrows the concept of Hollywood movies, blames everything on government, big corporate,..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci can do better....I hope.","review":"I picked this book up to see why people recommended David Baldacci. After reading this book, I'm now even more curious why anyone reads his works. Hopefully, other books by this same author are better than this book which focuses on a group (The Camel Club) that figures out a conspiracy. Yes, the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies are all ignorant, but luckily we've got homeless people and \\"former\\" intelligence officers that solve big problems and reveal devious plots. One silly part is the use of tranquilizer darts instead of bullets when the terrorists attack the President. Yeah, right. Okay. Sure.The dialogue is sloppy, the various characters are either stereotypical or unbelievable and the book was about 100 pages too long. I struggled to finish the book and when I finished the book I regretted ever starting it in the first place.Skip this book. Maybe he's written better books, but I doubt I'll ever risk finding out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, top-shelf Baldacci","review":"This is the first in a series of good story telling. The camel club is a group of seemingly discordant individuals, all of whom have backgrounds that appear to comprise an eclectic that somehow completes the puzzle well. Be Forewarned, however, that once you begin the series, you will be reading all of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 stars","review":"If you haven't read David Baldacci's The Camel Club and the books that followed it I envy you for the treat you have in store. They are among the few books I've re-read and that is simply the highest praise I can offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good but mostly BORING","review":"Too LONG. The plot was slow and confusing . One of the most boring Baldacci books I have read. Extremely disappointed.....a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many twists","review":"Interesting reading, informative and very different from the normal spy books.I enjoyed his writing style, hard to put down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little More than a thick politcal tract","review":"If you view the U.S.and the War on Terror through Michael Moore style coke-bottle glasses, you might like this book. I don't and didn't. Even sophomoric politics aside, the book lacked the novelization and plot skills of a Lescroart, Connolloy, W.E.B. Griffin, Grisham (most of the time) etc.I gave up reading it halfway through. Just seemed a little too contrived and I was put off my his anti-American bent. In this, it seems little different than other of Baldacci's book which I seem to toss before getting to the middle of the book. And that's where this book's heading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's all bash America?","review":"It's too bad this very clever writer had to spoil the story by saturating it with his anti-America viewpoint, especially on pgs.308 thru 311. Having read every one of his books, I expected to enjoy The Camel Club as much as the others but instead it made me angry and very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"The Winner and Absolute truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world."},{"rating":"1","title":"STABBED IN THE BACK","review":"This book ended in the trashbin. We feel betrayed, stabbed in the back by another of our favorite authors. After spending good money to buy his book, based on our enjoyment of earlier books, we are subjected to a political diatribe. Maybe these aging authors realize they are not going to be here forever and feel the need to inflict their personal agendas on their trusting fans while they can. It would be more honest to write non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-inflated","review":"It's too bad Baldacci wasted his considerable talent on this book. All I have to add to the negative reviews is that I found my puppy chewing on this novel after I reached the half-way point. While I view the destruction of a written work as a sin, I wish I'd gotten the hint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. How do people read this kind of crap? Dialogue that just sounds like political propaganda. No character development. Chock full of cliches and sexism. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camel Club","review":"The book never arrived so I really can't review it. When I contacted the seller, they were really good about it and credited back my purchase. However, now I still do not have a copy of the book... bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Most government spy thrillers are boring to me, but by using the odd characters who somehow got together and formed \\"The Camel Club\\" it had a more interesting feel to it. The ending was a little far-fetched, but the author made you care very much for the characters and what would happen to them. For that and the fact that the last 1/3 of the book was a page-turner, I gave the book an above-average 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camel Club","review":"Mr. Baldacci is the kind of writer you want to read all his books as soon as they come out. Hate to put the book down, keeps you guessing, peeks your interest, and you wonder where it's his imagination or ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a novel","review":"I've read about half this diatribe and given up on the inane propaganda and political pontificating. This is no a political thriller, it's a political rant, with a contrived story to provide Baldacci a vehicle. Skip it and save your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a diatribe!","review":"I did think something was going to happen to overturn the pro-terrorist leanings of the book. But it never happened, and I'm more than 1/2 way thru. I'm done. I will never finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"member of the club?!","review":"Wish I would have read this one earlier so that some of the later books involving the \\"Camel Club\\" would have made better sense. I'm glad I read it now. Baldacci is excellent as always. It's fun to try and figure out the real evil doer before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, unfortunately","review":"Well - i kept seeing these Baldacci books, and figured i'd give them a try. I started with the one, forget the title, where Stone teams up with the female who reunites with her father, who is being hunted by the casino boss guy...well, that was a solid book, so i thought i'd backtrack and read some earlier ones by Baldacci. The Simple Truth was also a worthy effort. But then, i read Camel Club - i was curious as to the origins of Oliver Stone and his little band of friends. This book was average. I'd give it 2.5 stars. The character Hemingway was interesting, but Stone/Carr was pretty dull. There are flashes of intrigue and great reading, but they are few and far between. I was also reading another book called Term Limits by Vince Flynn, and it's far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books stinks","review":"The author can tell a pretty good story, but the plot here is on the far side of improbable. The problem is that he can't write worth a damn. The dialog is really bad - *nobody* actually talks the way his characters do. And the characters themselves are thinner than cardboard. Baldacci seems to favor the George Bush view of life - totally black or white, you're either with us or against us. Not to mention a few technical howlers. Baldacci mentions, over and over again, the devastating effect of \\"supersonic\\" rifle rounds. As far as I know, just about every rifle bullet (in fact probably bullets from most any gun) go supersonic. This book is lousy, and I'll never waste my time with Baldacci again. At least this one was loaned to me, so I didn't waste my own money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I had to stop reading this book at page 118, as there are just too many ridiculous, unrealistic, and unecessary conversations between far too many ill-conceived and unlikely characters. I bought this at random at an airport out of sheer boredom, but I would rather do just about anything else rather than read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn'tunderstand narrative","review":"This may be the worst book I have ever read, with the possible exception of crap porn when I was a kid. At least then there were no pretensions. I was expecting a New York Times best-selling author to deliver at least a story expressed in coherent English. I was so amazed by the awful writing that I would read a passage to my 15 year old and ask his opinion. He just laughed. The characters are comic-book idiots. I can only assume he's coasting. Mr Baldacci, learn how to use a descriptive adverb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced","review":"The Camel Club centers around a rag-tag group of conspiracy theorists who find themselves witnessing a murder that leads them directly into the type of things they hypothesize about. The plot moves along at a swift pace with seemingly unrelated characters coming together throughout. There were some areas in the book where it seemed Baldacci was either trying to get us into the mindset of the terrorists or trying to make a political statement to show where the US is or has been wrong, in his mind. But that aside, I did enjoy this book as I have all of the Baldacci books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci's Masterpiece","review":"Marvelous Book--Possibly David Baldacci's best ever and he's a superb master of the art of mystery writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, not great","review":"I had a tough time keeping all of the characters straight when I first started to read the book. Thought that some of the story lines were a little far fetched and somewhat boring. I kept wondering when the book would come together, there seemed to be 3 different plots going on. It's an okay book, not great, I almost gave up on reading it, only reason I kept on going was because I wanted to get my money's worth and atleast finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a glorious ride!!","review":"You can read the reviews of others who write much better than I to get ideas about the plot and so forth. I just wanted to get in here and comment that this book is well written and kept me caught up in the story all the way to the end. It is escape in it's purest form. Don't look for reality here but get caught up in what COULD happen! Lot's of intensity at the end and entertainment all the way. Getting ready to start reading the sequel 'The Collector's' right now. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Folks Rock!!","review":"I don't care if some think the plot did not hang together. I was gripped tight all the way through. And how nice to have some unstereotypical heroes! Couldn't wait to read another of their adventures! Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting reading","review":"A most interesting piece of work. The author has created a real page turner that will keep you spellbound right to the very last page. The story is well laid out and gives the reader the opportunity to pick a personal hero as the story unfolds. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a well written creative fictional work that has a splash of mystery woven into it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun characters","review":"David Baldacci's Camel Club introduces us to the quirky fun characters that give the book its title. The fact that the \\"club\\" lives on through 3 subsequent books illustrates that this is a winning formula. The Camel Club is a group of eccentric middle aged men who enjoy meeting and investigating conspiracy theories. They happen upon a murder and are quickly thrown into the middle of the biggest conspiracy theory of them all.The author introduces a lot of characters to the mix, but he does a good job of bringing everyone together for the finale. My only complaint about the book is that much of the dialogue between the club members sounds like something out of Scooby-Doo. At the end, I was expecting someone like Velma to pull off the bad guy's mask. However, don't let that discourage you from reading this fine novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better than average thriller","review":"\\"Camel Club\\" is an interesting thriller that moves along quite well. There is a host of characters so you may be flipping back to make sure of who's doing what. Years back the plot might have seemed a little far fetched but in today's world almost anything is possible. The main character seems a little more human than usual. He is not the toughest and does make mistakes and gets hurt. I recommend this book to anyone who likes conspiracy thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this up...","review":"This was my first Baldacci audiobook. It seems I picked poorly. I agree with the other reviews that bring up the unbeliveability of the plot, but that was not the worst thing about this book. There were way too many conversations had by characters that were incongruous. When you find yourself saying, \\"why are these guys talking about this, it makes no sense\\", then there is trouble. Most of these conversations were to bring background (and i guess Baldacci was going for depth in his characters) but were just boring. Why would the director of a national spy agency and his right hand man have a conversation about \\"hey, remember when we had all this trouble getting all the spy databases together?\\" It's like they are reminiscing about old times in a part of the story when they should be talking seriously. blah blah blah. One could be overlooked, but there are many conversations in this story that could be left out and the book would be better. Maybe the abridged version is better :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intricacies within Intricacies","review":"This one tended to be dizzying, with its involuted, convoluted, prevoluted, and retrovoluted wad of plot lines. My limitted unravelling skills were overwhelmed by the tangle. Hard to keep track of who's who in the zoo, and, of why one should care. Weirdly, there seemed to be magical cross-linkages, and major difficulties impossibly easy to overcome in the midst of simple but immovable obstacles. Love sprang suddenly and unquestioningly to life across the crowded bar, just in time to thicken the mix. I wouldn't go to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camel Club gets 4 Humps!","review":"Great story. Baldacci uses a great sense of world affairs and superbly wrought characters to keep the pages turning in this espionage, political, action story. The only thing I would critique would be the passages where Mr. Baldacci attempts to educate his readers on the finer details of Islam. At times the story got a bit textbookish in that regard. Also, some of the foreshadowing ended up tipping the writers hand so that I was able to predict the events before I read them. Notwithstanding, the stiil was well conceived and was a real page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Propaganda Disguised as Fiction","review":"I have never read a Baldacci book before but this was the selection chosen by the Book Club that I am a member of. It became quickly obvious what Baldacci thought of this country and our war in Iraq. If you hold to the notion that this country is evil and that the terrorists are just poor misguided souls that have been pushed to the extreme by this country, then you might enjoy reading this book. I, personally, found it distasteful and offensive. I do not appreciate a writer who foists his political viewpoints off on a purchasing public in the guise of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"thriller by numbers","review":"This book has all the requisite thriller ingredients but the result somehow came across as a rote exercise, lacking in inspiration.The political viewpoints of the author came through too loadly and overwhelmed the plot, which had too many logical flaws to be very believable. The constant shifts between people and locations made it hard to relate to any of the thinly developed characters and bogged down the story instead of making it more suspenseful. Finally, the Camel Club itself turned out to be rather incidental to the resolution of the conflict, a let down from the huge buildup it received in early chapters.Baldacci is too talented of a storyteller to settle for such a mediocre product. I'd like to see him put more care into his future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good club - slow building","review":"Baldacci and I have not mixed well. There are so many authors who just spark from the start of the novel. That is not Baldacci's strong point. The Camel Club is representative of that. The members of the club and the Agent Ford, and his lady Kate are wonderful characters. The bad guys are interesting. BUT the action is SOOOOOOOOSLOOOOW it takes over 300 pages to see what ties everything together and this event is kind of not quite as believable as hoped. Once it happens, however, it reads much faster. But there are few pages after that. If you want to hang in and go through the book, get this one. If you are a Baldacci fan, get this. If you compare this to a Preston/Child, Greg Iles, John Case, you get the picture, Baldacci doesn't zip like others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read by the River","review":"I have enjoyed all of Baldacci's previous books, but I simply could not get through this one. It is marred by the rapid introduction of many similar characters and frequent pauses to blame Americans for vitually everything that is a problem on this planet. All of the American characters are, at best, vacuous and self-absorbed, or are members of U.S. intelligence agencies who routinely commit assassination and other mayhem to further American interests. All of the Muslim characters are pure and devout but forced into extremism by American misdeeds. A sophomoric and annoying book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a different book!","review":"Wanting something imaginative, exciting, and diverting I picked up \\"The Camel Club\\" at my local bookstore and decided to give it and David Baldacci a try. A situation of a group of fairly old guys, each with unique talents and life experiences, banding together to protect the nation seemed appealing with many possibilities. I agree with many reviewers that the plot is impossibly far-fetched with a political agenda (as is the case with most books of this genre). However, there is no reason why these aspects should get in the way of an enjoyable and mind-bending story. Unfortunately, what I got was a disjointed, confusing, and often boring plot line with undeveloped characters and relationships. Many times, because of boredom, I considered not finishing \\"The Camel Club,\\" but I did push on and made it to the end. I need not have bothered. The only recommendation I can make is to pick a different book from the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Views of the author?","review":"Camel Club isn't one of Baldacci's best BY FAR. The story is more of a comic book creation of hi-level government spooks and how they can do anything, merely by saying it's available via the computer databases.Also, Baldacci devotes an inordinate amount of space to muslim criticism of the many faults of the USA, thus justifying their crimes. Maybe Baldacci is grooming himself for employment by the New york Times?But if you like fiction with heroes who are never seriously harmed, though taking on insurmountable odds, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read! I enjoyed the series.","review":"Great read! I enjoyed the series. Development of characters there interplay and relationships was excellent; as was the description of their environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reading from start to finish.","review":"I had read other Baldacci novels tha made reference to the Camel Club. When I came across the Camel Club, I decided to buy it. It was good in and of itself, but it gave a background of the early days of the club. However, I believe the characters have matured in subsequent novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"dig in & enjoy","review":"enjoyed it , a great read, i would recommend you be sure to read the collectors before reading the camel club, for continuity baldacci tells a terrific story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy","review":"This book was hard to follow initially. Picked up almost half way through and enjoyed the ending. Hope to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Baldacci has a great plot but the follow through is boring and not worth the effort: there is poor character development and too many strange and quirky characters. With a lot of editing and streamling it might make a good two hour movie for TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Chore","review":"Having read two other books by Baldacci, I thought I'd give this one a try after a recommendation by a friend. Dialogue was sloppy, story was kind of hard to follow. I also felt like Baldacci was taking a rather anti-American approach to this story. There are too many good books out there to waste time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"I have read several of Baldacci's work and looked forward to the Camel Club. What a disappointment. The storyline was contrived, artificial, lacked credibility. More importantly, the political statements by the author made me want to burn the book. Anyone supporting terrorist activities and portraying terrorists as victims and Americans as perps will never get another penny of my book purchase money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore Effort","review":"This is the first book I've read by Baldacci and it will probably be the last. While the book overall may be good enough to pass the time on a rainy day, the plot and characters are constructed in such a sloppy manner it comes off as very amateurish. The terrorist plot in this work requires so many things to happen just right that it simply blows any \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" out of the water. The entire effort seems to be nothing more than a mechanism to serve up the author's political views in a convenient manner, even down to the fact that Baldacci's terrorists use only sedative-laced darts instead of bullets so as not to actually harm anyone. (What exactly do Al Quaeda, Huzballah and other terrorist organizations have to do to convince the left that maybe, just maybe, they are dangerous?) Anyway, there are an infinite number of better reads than this on the bookshelves; pass this one by unless you just love Baldacci."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great then crashes and burns!","review":"Baldacci has written some of the best thrillers of the past decade, almost all rating 5 stars. But \\"The Camel Club\\" has hit the wall. The first 250 pages are traditionally pure Baldacci, and promise a great read. But it ends there, it is almost as though he has written himself into a corner and suspended all rational, logical plotting thoughts and threw in a ludicrous set of plot points that just didn't quite seem possible. The idea of the Camel Club I felt, right from the get go was a terrific means of getting into a high tension thriller, much like \\"Absolute Power\\", but then, it fizzled to a point where I almost could be pursuaded to believe someone who had never written a work of fiction had been handed the task of completing the book in record time and simply lost interest in the project."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly populated conspiracy","review":"Four D.C. area wacky people, starring the brilliant, brave, misunderstood Oliver Stone, uncover an amazingly complex, cast hundreds of Muslims, who plan to kidnap the president on the occasion of his birthplace changing the town's name to his name.

What a hack job, cheap shot, bill board for the liberal perspective this \\"novel\\" was.Besides, for Baldacci, it wasn't well writtn, or well plotted, nor were the characters developed.It's a cheap novel, written for quick, cheap thrills, with no substance, and a complete lack of believability.It reads like it was thrown together over a long week end.This is the kind of book that tempts one to skip the entire middle section, just to see how the writer get's the heroes out of the final jam. The middle 250 pages of this book are boring, and seem to have been written just to get us to the inevitable, predictable, end.It insulted my average intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly reasearched and written","review":"First let me say that I have liked \\"Last man standing\\" and \\"Split Second\\" by Baldacci. Camel Club is a hack effort. Having terrorist that don't kill? Nuclear warfare that looses communication and has no redundancy? A bad guy (Carter Grey) who pays for- killing the lead characters family (Oliver Stone), ruining countless lives, and wants to kill the president- his major act of redemption is resignation??? Aldelphia is never really explained and developed as a charachter. why is she so anti-abortion? I was very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Unappealing","review":"Having taken a few days to let the disappointment pass, I will concede that the story and characters are interesting, but it is all a bit scattered. The politics contained in this novel are completely one-sided which I believe makes it less interesting.It never lives up to its potential and interesting characters are wasted with story telling that focuses more on the politics of the author than the drama of the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to hop in a \\"tiger\\" and blow up stuff!!!","review":"This book offers great details and info on the battles of the ss in the east.

It was hard to maintain a good temperature (today was about 70 degrees and sunny, almost no wind) and working on the coals through the small door is hard at best.So I don't recommend this model. If your interested in a smoker, I'd recommend moving up a level to a model that gives better access to the charcoal pan. I'd return this model if I could but I don't think they'll take it back now that I've used it - so I guess I'm stuck with it. There is a video on \\"youtube\\" that shows a guy modify this to make it work for him, maybe I'll try that.I also don't like that the temperature gauge in it doesn't give you the temperature. Instead it has 3 zones on it - warm, ideal and hot. Not very useful - so now I have to buy another gauge to tell me what the temperature is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this smoker!","review":"There are no vents to adjust airflow, or to allow smolder out rather than ruin your meat.If you're trying a long smoke, you have to disassemble the entire thing to add coal, again ruining the temp of your smoker and the quality of your cook.If you're trying a slow smoke, you have to stick your arms and face down inside the unit to pull out the coal and wood when the cook is over.

The audio tape set is too confusing without any illustrations included in the box. In my opinion this is a huge marketing mistake. It made me give up and return the tape to Amazon. I had more emotional healing needs after trying to follow the tapes!!! At one point the authors even refer to the illustrations which had me turning the box upside down thinking I must have missed it.

It relies more on controlling your breathing, which works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Take it So Seriously","review":"To try and compare David Leitz with Burke or even Chandler would be a mistake. I think his writing is just plain fun. One of the joys of fly fishing is the atmosphere of mountain streams within walking distance of a cabin tucked into the forest waiting with a crackling fire and a dog curled up on a blanket. Then let's add a little thrill to the scene with an unsolved murder. If you read it for a quick, enjoyable thrill and to keep the fishing fires burning when you can't get to that cabin, then so be it. If you read it with the critical mind of an English professor, I'd say lighten up a bit. For the cost of a paperback, I think this is a very enjoyable read. Do yourself a favor and try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many uses besides dog kennel","review":"We bought and used this as a dog kennel for a time and it served that purpose well. It is pretty sturdy when assembled, but make sure you use a lock, caribiner, or pin on the gate latch. However, it is easy for a dog to dig out under the sides if you place this kennel on dirt, and I would recommend the shade cover for the top if your dog is an escape artist. Now that we don't need this for a dog, our plans are to use it as a garden fence since it is small enough that the deer won't jump into it. Because of the digging from jackrabbits, we may try raising it on a couple of rows of keystone blocks. 4 stars because it's sturdily built, but you may have to make modifications for your dog. Another big plus is that it is easily moved to another location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please--no more Eve Duncan books!","review":"This will be the last Iris Johansen book I'll ever read. The author undoubtably has some serious issues with male-female relationships. Eve Duncan is what my late husband called a p---- teaser. At least Johansen is good at character development. She makes Eve so stubborn, willful and downright obnoxious I just want to throttle her. The constant petty bickering between her and both John Logan and Joe Quinn is so annoying I wanted to scream! How can anyone enjoy a book when the main character, the heroine, is so despicable? All the arguing, etc., completely destroyed any enjoyment of the story for me. Do us a favor, Ms. Johansen, don't bring Eve Duncan back for another encore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Game is a real killer!","review":"I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and have enjoyed every one of them. In THE KILLING GAME, she has surpassed all the others. The reader's attention is caught in the first few pages and gripped tightly throughout the remainder of the book. I resented any interruption while \\"buried\\" in this book. Johansen allows the reader wider access to Eve Duncan's thought processes and \\"roller-coaster\\" emotions as she continues her search for the remains of her daughter, Bonnie, with the assistance and support of her loyal friends, John Logan and Joe Quinn. Quinn's relationship with Duncan is heated up a notch, which makes the characters even more realistic. The addition to the cast of characters of street-wise, tenacious little Jane MacGuire, crusty, reclusive Sarah Parker, and lovable Monty is icing on the cake. This is a MUST READ for Johansen fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"This is my first book by the author, and it will be my last. I found Joe's 'protectivness' to be rather creepy. Eve, who is made out to be a strong and together woman, is easily influenced and breaks down often. The killer is obvious upon your first meeting of him. All in all, a very hard book to stay focused on, due to the irritating and shallow dialouge. Not a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"Killing Game has everything mystery, suspense, romance. After reading Face of Deception I couldn't get enough of Eve and Joe. I love their individual personalities, they're so human instead of being the picture of perfection like in most books. As for the hero...I fell in love with Joe he was a man anyone would wish for. I can't wait for The Search to come out I hope Eve finally finds Bonnie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST EVER! Eve and Joe must be continued!","review":"FACE OF DECEPTION was the first of Iris Johansen's books I've read. I love her strength. She is truly a remarkable woman. I couldn't wait for THE KILLING GAME!!! What a wonderful continuation. I am hooked! I can't wait to see what is up next for Eve and Joe!!! It was truly a great read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. THIS CHARACTER MUST BE CONTINUED.","review":"I absolutely love this character and have been hooked since the first book introducing her. I love the two male leads and the background of each character. I just started reading this novel and am almost half way through it already. I have brought it to work and am reading it at every spare opportunity. I don't want to put pressure on Ms. Johansen, but when's the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing a thrilling story","review":"Once again I was not disappointed! I.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and now have become a big fan of the author. It definitely is a hard book to put down and one not to miss. The Next Book I'm Reading -- Long After Midnight by the one and only Iris Johansen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Addictive!","review":"This book caught my attention from the first page and I could barely eat or sleep until I finished it! I must have lost a couple of pounds reading it, which in itself is miraculous. My only regret is that I did not read THE FACE OF DECEPTION first, which introduces the main characters. However, I read it next and then, of course, ran out and bought THE SEARCH. I hope Ms. Johansen will use these characters again--the mesh, their backgrounds were extremely interesting. I haven't had this much fun reading in quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual style","review":"This author displays such a varied range. The reader is quickly drawn into the story. Caught up in a web of intrigue and consumed with a conflicting desire. As with any truly good book, the reader wants to end the torment and have all questions answered; on the other hand, the realization that the reader is right smack in the middle of a well crafted story lends one to procrastinate the consumation. Don't take my word for it. Experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding and gripping from the begining","review":"I Picked this book up knowing nothing of Iris Johansen, I was in no way disappointed. This book is great with the twisting and turning plot that will keep you guessing clean up to the end.

The killer has Eve going on wild goose chases. With his eyes set on Jane a young girl whom he calls Bonnie, Eve will do everything to protect this child from a mad man, Even give her own life.this is a great book. I would recommend this thriller to anyone. I could not stop reading this book, it is supensful and thrilling from the very first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is definitely Not the Iris I know!","review":"I hate to say this, but I really HATE her recent novels! So long, draggy, impersonal and VERY,VERY BORING! I'm sure a new direction is good, but I think she should concentrate on what she is good at. When I got my hands on this book, I was anticipating a good book, like the many good books precedenting this one. However this was a BORE! I gave up in frustration halfway through the book. People, spare your time ,and don't read this.It's so agonizing that a trip to the dentist seems like a better idea!Iris was and still is one of my favourite writers, I just wish she'd write something befitting of her talent again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the dog saved this book.","review":"Like other reviewers, I too am tired of whiney Eve. She and Joe have the same argument over and over and over and over. Blah, blah, blah. The only thing that saved it and the reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was the appearance of Sarah Patrick and her wonder dog, Monty. I'll read the reviews for the next one in the series and if it seems to be the same old story, I'll skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KILLING GAME IS THE BOOK YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN! EXCELENT!","review":"This book is a page-turning, horror book. If you read 1 book this year make this the one. I'm 13 years old and I read this book in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. The surprising events Johansen writes are excelent. I've read many books but this is my favorite. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Face of Deception.\\" Sorry to say that I can't endorse this sequel as heartily (at all, for that matter). The main female character (Eve) doesn't seem to have emotionally changed one iota in the year since we left her in the first book. She also seems to have become whiny and a user of men to boot.I felt that little time and/or effort was put into character development or even scenic description, and the book was sloppily plotted from a technology standpoint...caller ID or *69, anyone! In the real world, the authorities would've scooped Dom up like a roach ten minutes after he made his second phone call to Eve.This book read like it was written in a rush - the curse of authors who, once they attain a certain level of market success, must produce new 'product' quickly to keep their readers happy. I'm glad I borrowed this product from the library so I can return it.Take your time, Iris.

For the first time, I didn't finish her book and just skipped through it. I found this book very boring and the heroine's character and behavior are capricious, and is very mean and unfair to John Logan. As one reader said, I am glad that I haven't bought this book and just borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIVABLE","review":"The Killing Game was a book I just could not put down. I'm in High School and supposed to be studing for my final exams, but I couldn't put this book down for more then 5 minutes. I don't read often, but when I do, I like to read something up tempo that will keep me hooked. This book is amazing. I kept reading to find out what happened with Eve and Bonnie. I really began to feel for Eve by the 5th chapter at least, when the killer messed with her more and more. It definetly makes me want to go out and buy more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, The Face of Deception was much better","review":"Joe is portrayed as an unbelievable chauvanist, who says words like \\"adjust\\", and finishes Eve's sentences for her. Eve is portrayed as a real dummy who puts up with him. Both of them were portrayed as too gooey - Oh Joe, Oh Eve - enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure cheese","review":"I found the story contrived, the characters unbelievable and the entire book a waste of time.

I won't be going back to Eve Duncan and crew for a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good (not great) mystery ruined by a love story","review":"This book was probably one of the most annoying books I have read in a long time. Although the plot was OK, I quickly tired of the fast paced dialogue between the heroine and the hero(s). It kept my attention, but barely. Every single detail fell conveniently into place and it seemed like all the problems of the characters' world were solved by an instant phone call. Very unbelieveable. It was a quick read, but that's because it was written like a play....all frivolous \\"Hallmark\\" dialogue, very little narration. The most annoying part of this book was that they kept referring to their cell phone as \\"the digital\\". Very annoying. Waste of 5 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"All angst, all the time","review":"It's time for Eve to move on. Bonnie has been dead for 13 years - get over it! The fawning attention she receives at the hands of the male characters Quinn and Logan borders on nausea. Their concern for her health, eating habits, sleep quota, etc. consumes far too much of this \\"been there, done that\\" plot. There is nothing fresh or new and the main character Eve seems to be caught in an endless cycle of sameness. If you have read one of Johansen's books, it appears you have read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made the trip to LA worthwhile","review":"I read this book on my plane trip to LA and was disapointed when the plane landed because I had only four pages left to read. When I did get to them I was pleasantly surprised. Ms. Johansen mixes the romance with the mystery well, not an easy task to do. I was expecting the romance part to ruin the mystery, but instead it actually contributes to the suspense. I loved it, just as I have all the ones before. Although, I wish we got a small taste of the next book as we did with this one at the end of Face of Deception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: If you have a faint heart do not read this book","review":"This book puts you in a rocket and just keeps accelerating. The actions slams you in the face and it does not stop till the last page. Eve Duncan is a complicated character that is energized in this book. This is by far the best novel I have read in a long time. The Killing Game is intense, no holds barred and rock-solid thriller. Even for experienced readers this book is among the best. It is better than Cornwall at her best even better than Richard North Patterson. I will read this book again when I can recover from the the first read. The book grips you by the throat until you are ready to give up. If you read a book, this has to be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rid of this depressing, self-pitying character!","review":"What I can't figure out, is why any one man would want Eve, let alone two! Morbid, miserable, self-centered, and not even any physical appeal. Or at least that's the way Eve is portrayed. I guess the story will continue into another sequel--but, not for me. The dangling endings to these 2 Eve books only left me angry! Goodbye, Ms. Johansen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be named \\"Killing Time\\"","review":"The story isn't so bad, but it's just another \\"whodunnit\\". I would have been more satisfied if it was a little more believable. The author using phrases like: \\"turned on her heel\\", \\"digital phone\\", and various other phrases continiously. It got annoying. The child's ghost was a little believable. If you have time to waste, nothing better to do, and can get this book for free...I suggest you read it. Otherwise, stick to Dean Koontz. His books are \\"out there\\", but at least he is an outstanding writer and really gets you involved in the story. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak beginning, weak plot","review":"After reading Face of Deception I was really disappointed in The Killing Game. The plot was very weak. The fact that Joe came to get Eve to sculpt the childs skull was not good. Duh, Eve has a lab on the Island, bring her the skull. The romance part of this book was lacking also. I was very disappointed that the romance with Logan did not continue they had a good chemistry. Overall after reading the first book about Eve so much more could have been done with this one. It was very disappointing to say the least. In Face of Deception Eve was a strong women, in this she becomes weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just average...","review":"The book kept me somewhat entertained through to the end, however I could care less about the attempt at a love story within between Eve and Joe.

Into the Forest is horror at a different level, the terror of being left isolated with no way of knowing if the rest of the country is rebuilding or if your friends and family are still alive.Granted, we survived the so-called Y2K hysteria, and thankfully this is a work of fiction. Jean Hegland paints a near-apocalyptic picture of depravity, and how two sisters manage to stay together in spite of not being able to flip on a lightswitch or microwave a burrito as they could in the past, when they could still be children with dreams instead of being thrust into a nightmare where Nell (the narrator) must decide how long to keep a used tea bag before throwing it away. A gripping story."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the most boring books I've ever read","review":"As a voracious reader, I am not afraid to toss a book if it gets too dull to finish. After forcing myself to read half of this book, I began skimming it to find out when and why they finally go into the forest. I gave it one star because some of the writing was poetic, and because I like the idea of 'Nell' finally getting intelligent enough to look outside of herself for answers - finally! But I really couldn't like either girl enough to care what happened to them, and that's what makes a good story.

Two orphaned teenage sisters living on their own in the forest far from town after the collapse of society. The character development was up to par and the story was flowing smoothly, until the gratuitous incestuous sex scence between the two sisters. Ick. I put the book down in disgust. I returned to finish the book only to be disappointed with the conclusion, in which the girls burn down their house and go off to live in the forest like primitive peoples. I guess they still have each other...if the mood strikes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I realize that this book meant to envoke thought and perhaps discussion of how much our society relies on material things, but I think it could have done so with better character development and without ruining the ideas the book presents by adding an unnecessary incest scene. I skimmed the book after that.What was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unecessary scenes","review":"I enjoyed the prose and the flow of the book, but then well into the book, there is an entirely gratuitous lesbian sex scene between 2 sisters. It is so far into the book that it diminishes the whole of the work, and is pointless for the story line.Reviewers who say just ignore it just CHOOSE to ignore what they secretly dont mind reading. If it were racism or homophobia, they would not ignore the point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some amazing parallels","review":"A short way into this engrossing novel, I was struck by the parallels with our lives today, even though this book was written in the mid 1990s. There's a faraway war \\"to protect our freedoms\\" that does not affect most aspects of everyday life but may be behind much of the collapse. There's a terrorist bombing, problems in currency markets, natural disasters including unimaginable floods of the Mississippi, huge government debt, and increasingly common shootings in US cities and towns.My spouse and I used to kid each other about what we'd need \\"when the collapse comes.\\" This book tells more about it. A good read, though I agree that one scene could have been cut and the end is a bit extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit home! Nice book...","review":"I have two daughters and the two sisters in this book really had my heart. I love apocalypse themes and this brought that theme together with a calmer, more personal story. I read it quickly and that is not typcial for me - very good. I guess I would have liked to know a bit more about what happened in the world around them but I also accepted that the story was more about them than an apocalypse - nice book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb account of the human spirit","review":"Due to an unexplained apocalyptic event, two young sisters must survive in a woodland cottage.

True, the ending is a little weak but it didn't stop me from reading the book in one evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book didn't do much for me; it was our book club selection recommended by a friend. The consensus of my group was that if you are a sister or have daughters you can relate to the story which in hindsight I agree. The story was flat and didn't answer many questions for me. It is an easy read but not a gripping one & to be honest, I found it kind of boring and really odd in some places. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis smiles on this one..","review":"Having just put the book down, I must admit to still being in its spell. It was truly masterfully woven, capturing that spark of wildness lingering in us all.At first, I must admit to much impatience with the sisters. As a child reared on Foxfire books and Tennessee traditions, I wondered aloud how even \\"citified\\" girls could let a garden collapse from neglect when their survival was at stake, or ignore the woodashes in their stove as they ration soap, or wait until the unthinkable happens before picking up a rifle. In retrospect though, their early ignorance and reticence make their journey into womanhood and into the wild all the more engaging.As to bumbling men, I must disagree. Their father was the only one who met their situation with skill, courage, and a survivor's spirit from the start. Were it not for his efforts, neither girl would have survived their first winter.All in all -- a wonderful book for any budding daughter of Artemis..."},{"rating":"2","title":"all time favorite","review":"This book goes on my list of all time favorites.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Journey","review":"I loved this book. A story of two young women who find themselves alone and unprepared for a life without power, food, or other people. I was expecting a good adventure story but instead found a beautifully written journey about life, sacrifice, and personal growth. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it","review":"...The prospect that the novel sets up is fascinating. The world as we know it has been destroyed-largely because of over consumption, and ecological and political problems. Nell and Eva must learn how to face this new world without all of the luxuries that we are used to and with many new dangers. However, too much of the story involves reminiscing about the past, rather than showing the reader this new world-the here and now. Also, while I don't mind an author having an agenda, the message in this novel was painfully overdone. ... It illustrated the point the author wanted to make...The characters were never really fleshed out to begin with (Eva in particular), and that was a problem in itself. ... The message of the novel is valid. We are a materialistic culture. ...I can only see a connection to the stereotypes of women as earth mothers, creators and nurturers. But these are simply stereotypes. In reality, women are as materialistic as men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I read this story after taking a class in people and the environment and having one of the presenter's suggest that we read it. I saw that it could be prophetic of the way we will end our time on this planet. Like Dr. Blackwood said, \\"We will go out with a whimper and not a bang.\\" The references to the epidemics are frightning but possible with today's mutating bacteria and viruses. The loss of control is predictable with our increasing addiction to petro based fuels. People need to read this and think about what they would do if faced with theses situations. The incest also wasn't really needed but thoughtfully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesbian incest as ritual suicide ... \\"but well-crafted!\\"","review":"The novel is finely crafted, slashingly lacerating, endlessly delusional, and compellingly suicidal. Once they overcome the unbelievably bad education they got from their parents, the girls quickly teach each other to fear all contact with other humanity. Through a rather complicated substitution of lesbian incest for rape, they create an aura of procreation and survival without having to actually survive. In the end, they pull their hole in upon themselves, mouthing reassuring ignorances about primativist survival, and crawl off to feed themselves to the boars, the bears, and the bananna slugs.Spectacular skills turned to dismal projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"A terrific premise, but very badly written. The author seems to have too little insight into her characters to give them distinctive voice beyond the broadest of cliches. Note in particular the narrator and the father as examples of the worst sort of TV-drama dialogue.The awkward, obvious social criticism is simplistic and cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful language but otherwise a PC fairy tale","review":"Jean Hegland writes beautifully, which is all that kept me reading. Unfortunately, there is not much else to this book, a politically correct, thinly-veiled tribute to the \\"noble savage\\" and diatribe against the modern world. The story is farfetched: -All the calamities we worry about seem to happen at the same time: earthquakes, wars, nuclear power plant meltdowns, (was there a volcanic eruption somewhere too?). -Incest between the sisters -Burning down their home and fleeing into the forest for good. Not believable even as a post-apocalyptic tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful dreck","review":"I previously wrote a review for this book about a year ago, which for some reason was removed. Anyway, this book is just so ham handed with its stereotypes and its \\"message\\". Men bad, women good, earth good, natural herbs good, got it. I am fairly liberal politically, quite liberal on environmental issues, so the theme of the book sounded appealing, but the author has no sense of character development, or making charaters complex, real people; the male characters especially are so one-dimensional. And \\"that scene\\" with the sisters is repugnant, not to mention completely superfluous. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad book","review":"This story has, by far, been one of the worst I've read in the past 2 years. Good plot, bad everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS SICK!","review":"The argument Hegland makes in this book is that all religion is bull and the only true religion is to get away from all of technology and become one with the earth. The book is tramatizing. When one of the sisters is raped, the other heals her by making love with her. There's another part where one of the sisters has sex with her crush on their first date. My teacher had us read this when I was a freshman in high school, so I may have been too young to understand, but to all you young readers out there, read something else and save yourself from months of terror. This book made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well that was ... something.","review":"Ok so this book was interesting because it really got me musing about what life would be like if there was a major disaster that took away all the things we rely on for modern life. How long would most people be able to survive without supermarkets and gasoline? I still think about it a lot (mostly when the pantry is empty).There is a scene toward the end of this book that is totally like \\"whoa!\\" I won't spoil it for you but if you read it you'll be like \\"whoa!\\" too and then when we talk about it we can both be like \\"I know right?\\"Unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Forest","review":"This was a great book.

Hence, the strength of this book lies in its focus on city planning in the 20th century.The first 100 pages are devoted to the period from 1630-1900, but anybody with a special interest in that period is better off with Walter Muir Whitehill's \\"Boston - A Topographical History\\".Kennedy's writing about the 20th century also is more animated. Chapers follow administration (Fitzgerald, Curley, Collins, White & Flynn) and Kennedy gives a very readable account of the development of urban city planning in Boston and how it has been helped (and hindered) by politics. As is to be expected, the City Planning Board's and BRA's history and involvement in planning are treated in some detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oral History","review":"What a bizaare story! The concept is wonderful with a student researching an unexplored family history of rural mountain folks. What is revealed probably would best be left untold.

It's obvious that this book was not planned, i.e. that Marrow was to be a stand alone novel. Normally when an author decides to expand a story from one book to three, the writing seems weak, almost forced. The same cannot be said about this book. It's very entertaining with enough action to keep the reader interested from beginning to end. I've read almost all of Mr. Reed's books and consider myself a huge fan. What amazes me most is that he is able to describe scientfic terms/concepts almost as if it were poetry. The write is clean, crisp and flows.

It's still a really good listen and gives you insight into how their sound has progressed. The only reason this album sounds a little tired and dated compared to their other ones is because this album really is from another era anyway, and it's not their fault we're only now getting to hear it. Love the My Bloody Valentine-esque backwards guitar loops on the opening track. The title track just plain kicks even if it does sound less than totally fresh at this point.

Perhaps a gourmet vegan might, so take this into account. I was excited to buy this book until I went through and marked the recipes I might cook. There were only 3 that sounded even remotely tasty and/or used basic ingredients. And these 3 recipes are very similar to what you can find in any other basic vegan cookbook. It's very frustrating to see a recipe and realize you would have to purchase nearly all of the supplies for that particular recipe.

As thorough as the series was, there are reams or reels or whatever of footage that never made it onto TV, so this book provides more information about Edwardian life, the participants and events of the series. It's an oversize book which unfortunately makes for awkward reading -- and it does have a lot of text that you'll want to read. However, the size makes for good display of photos, including many taken in Edwardian times and even at Manderstone, the house where the series was shot. So you see that they really did dress up in a thousand items of clothing just to watch cricket on the lawn or stroll around the grounds. A fascinating addition to a well-made series. I loved the series and could have watched ten times what they showed on TV and therefore really appreciate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, and wrong","review":"One of the worst books about gambling that I ever read (and I read many of them).First of all, it is too old: written in April 2001, that's more than two years ago, and that's not good for a world (the internet) that's changing daily.Even not considering this, it doesn't give any particular advice or original consideration. Every chapter is filled out with questions that are, in the end, not answered efficacely. And if you ever played at least one online casino, you'll know more that he does.But the worst part is that he gives wrong indications about Blackjack, Roulette, and Craps strategy.

A few suggestions would be Helprin's book (mentioned by other reviewers), All Quiet on the Western Front, or Sebastian Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" (even in translation it's much more eloquent).

The \\"hero\\" is Patrick Delaney, a man dying from cancer- but I think it was more painful for me than it was for him. This is vague, unemotional, and the characters are paper thin. You don't care about anybody in the story, you can form no emotional attachment or care whether he loses or finds Julia. The war scenes were graphic and admittedly well written but there was no good story around it so what is the point? Hull should just write non fiction history books.

Hull reveals an astute understanding of love and death - two favorite subjects in all of literature - but doesn't trivialize either. Patrick is such a beautifully drawn character that I was willing to make this difficult journey with him, and glad in the end that I did; from his harrowing experiences in the trenches of WWI France, to his equally painful reckoning of his life at its dusk. And throughout, there is Julia. The woman who enters his young life almost as an apparition, and then becomes in many ways the sole reason for his existence.

The juxtaposition of a youth in World War I and the life of an elderly man sorting through his memories in a nursing home will touch every reader's heart and deepest emotions. It is a story of courage and honor. I am still thinking about the passage that described Michaelangelo when asked why he had a chisel.

I'd put this book on my top ten recommended list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read.","review":"Hull's \\"Losing Julia\\" is a powerful story of the life of a survivor of World War I (the war to end all wars). I have never read such devestating discriptions of war, love or old age. Yet it is first and foremost a beautifully written bittersweet romance. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"diamond in the rough","review":"I think probably most people approach this book, as I did, as just another mindless Harlequin style romance novel.Nothing could be further from the truth. Hull has constructed an insightful story, and it is one which most will find, contains a great many shared experiences. I can safely compare it to All Quiet On The Western Front, not only in its WWI setting, but in its exploration of character interaction.I would hope that Hull will submit a screen play to the film industry for translation to the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story overall, but...","review":"I found myself not really liking the character of Julia very much and hence found the love affair aspect a bit overdone. It took me some time to get into this book - I've been picking it up and putting it down since March and only just ended up finishing it last week. It didn't really grab me as I thought it might based on reviews. However, I found the writing strong and will definately seek out other work of the same author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Negative Voice in a Sea of Adoration","review":"It's a strange experience to read this book and then read the reviews to date on Amazon.com. Strange because I find myself agreeing with most of the comments written by others. There is no question in my mind that Hull is a fine novelist with a strong command of character and plot development. I was also strongly affected by the story. But did I like the book? No. It is unrelenting in its agonizing. It is painfully devastating and disturbing, page after page. The author is merciless in pushing the reader into the twin horrors of WWI trenches and modern-day nursing homes. This was clearly the author's intent and he does it very, very well. And that's obviously a measure of his success, as the other reviewers note. But it's as if Hull was afraid that taking a break to explore something positive in Patrick's life would somehow delute his message. Just a note to prospective readers...be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tawdry","review":"This one started out okay, despite stilted dialogue and unoriginal, idealized, and bland characters, but then it committed what, in my mind, is the ultimate sin: it reminded me of \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" which was one of the worst books I've ever suffered through. If Jonathan Hull wants to write, he should find something worth writing about first. This wasn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY!!","review":"This book was so amazing. I was totally swept up in it. If you like war stories and love stories then this is the perfect book for you. I don't want to say too much - I don't want to give it away if you're going to buy the book. Just be prepared to not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil Changer Disaster","review":"The very first oil change attempt was a disaster. At first the changer did not have enough vacuum to pump the oil up from the crankcase, so by mouth I manually drew the oil up to the pump thinking maybe it needed to be primed. When I turned it on it then began drawing the oil very slowly. Oil began spewing from the underside of the pumppouring oil all over the radiator and front of the engine and then onto the driveway.....what a mess! It took me more than an hour to clean the engine and driveway. The problem with the pump was super obvious and I truly believe the seller had to know about it's defective state. Totally dissatisfied. Do not recommend this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Labels","review":"If you have used these labels before - then you know they are a time-saver. Know your Avery product codes and you can find great deals - like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labels Don't Fit","review":"If you have ever used the \\"Easy Apply\\" labels in the past, you'll be surprised to learn that Avery redesigned the \\"Easy Apply\\" label strips. I'm not sure why they did this, but the new format doesn't fit the actual tabs on the dividers, so you're left with approximately 2 millimeters of excess clear label hanging off the end of the divider. Okay, so you figure you can just stick them on manually, right? Well, that is much more difficult than the old format where you applied each label individually because of the \\"Easy Strip,\\" which is designed to stick to the \\"Easy Apply\\" strip. Overall, I would STRONGLY advise any consumer AGAINST purchasing this product until Avery's product development team redesigns the \\"Easy Apply\\" format, and who knows when that will be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing to order","review":"The picture is wrong, and it doesn't say anywhere except in the obscure, shorthand SKU code, but this item is Avery Index Maker, Laser, 3-Hole Punched, 8 Tab, White, 25-Set, with EZ Apply label sheets. I think.I'm a technical writer in a deadline-driven engineering environment, and I can't take the chance that it's something else, so I'm ordering from a company that states clearly exactly what I'm buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"I think \\"Peaches\\" was a very interesting book. I enjoyed the characters. I thought it flowed quite nicely...It kept me wondering what was coming next...I am looking forward to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peaches","review":"The book had know feeling, you did not know what any one looked like, they were characters with out faces. Now lets take Peaches, boyfriend to me he was just a person with a name who was flying from one state the another, did not say if was tall or short, light or dark, long or short hair. Was he bulit? The love sence's there were now. The only character you knew about, was the dead friend. There wasn't enough imformation or background to know who they were, or where they came from. The female P.I's, is a good idear, but not well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Not Divine Offices!","review":"I pray the prime, sext and compline almost every day.So in great expectation I played the CD and immediately I got all confused.Then it just got worse and worse.This is not a recording of the Vesper and Compline of the Divine Office.This is a recording of the Post-Conciliar Liturgy of the Hours.The monks of Solesmes do chant beautifully, but the material is flawed.The Latin of the Liturgy of the Hours is awful.It's like chanting the Tax Code.Secondly, the sound quality of the recording is substandard.It sounds as if they recorded it in a fishbowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone before his time","review":"I have kept Bill Hicks in the back of my mind for about a decade now. I was leaving college when Bill's career was getting big. Then, he passed away. Anyway, this DVD is a bargain. It has three long sets Bill did in '93. Some jokes are repeated, but I still found myself laughing due to Bill's delivery. I think his best set is the one in England. It ends with a homage to Bill. Bottom line is that even if you never heard of Bill Hicks, you will find his comedy insightful, funny and down right unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Hicks Long Live His Spirit","review":"Without question, the most progressive comedic social commentator to have ever graced our presence. If you are not familiar with his work, you should definitely give him a listen. Why do the great minds always die so young?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $17.99!","review":"Bill Hick's talent as comic is not in question. I find his material very funny as well as insightful. My problem is with the producers of this DVD. It contains material from three of his performances (Chicago, Montreal, London) -- unfortunately he delivers much of the same material at each venue. Instead of a 3.5 hour DVD this easily could have been kept to 90 minutes with just a bit of creative editing -- perhaps they should have interspersed scenes from the included documentary in between his live performance pieces to eliminate the redundancy? As it stands it's as if he did three shows in your town on consecutive nights and you went to see all three of them -- you would catch a new joke or two at each show but you'd also end up hearing the same ones three times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic genius!","review":"Bill Hicks was the greatest comedian to ever live. These performances solidify that statement. As every great artist that is way ahead of their time, he died way too young. Not much else needs to be said, this is a great buy if you want to laugh your @$$ off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny - but repititious","review":"While DVD is lengthy, the material from show to show is the same. Of the 3 hours, only about and hour of it is different material, but atleast that hour is pretty funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"When I was an angry 19 year-old, I thought Bill Hicks was a god. Now, being 24 I realized that I was just the same type of sheep that Bill hicks said was destroying the country, IE a person who listened to every opinion except his own. Bill Hicks is a pretentious d-bag. All his \\"political\\" rants amounts to nothing more than idealistic tripe, \\"capitalism=bad\\" is all the depth you get from a bill hicks \\"skit\\". He's not a prophet, he's just some asshat with no credibility or following who moved back into his parents house right before he died. I wouldn't criticize, if Hicks wouldn't have spent 90% of his adult life denouncing/rebelling against said parents. His legacy is over inflated because he died young. He's the Kurd(t) Cobain of stand up comics. Talent that was never realized, but is constantly speculated/exaggerated upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hicks Without Hype","review":"Years ago I watched a young comedian I hadn't viewed before on a TV special from the Montreal Comedy Festival.He was a wow, with a devastatingly and savagely funny piece on the Gulf War which had just ended.Sadly having switched on part way through the piece I never found out who the comic was.I ached to be able to get hold of the piece on video and searched in vain for years looking for it.The comic was Bill Hicks and now,as then, his take on America and its place in the world has never been more relevant.This DVD contains some of that early footage,along with a great deal of his subsequent material.You don't always have to be totally in sympathy with views (his stance as a militant smoker for example) to find him seeringly funny.A man who makes you laugh whilst challenging a great many widely held assumptions.Watch Bill and you realise how trivial a great deal of contemporary comedy has become.We need more comics like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"It is amazing how a bloke this mediocre can attract so many followers. Is this a case of the emperor's clothing?Let's examine his comedy (for want of a better description of what he actually does). Firstly,he tended to repeat the same jokes in different shows. Did he lack the innovation and creativity to come up with new material?Secondly, and more importantly, his jokes aren't funny at all. He liked to be shockingly crude for the sake of it. Cussing can add poignancy to jokes when used cleverly, especially in scolding skits, but this bloke was totally incapable of being profane and funny at the same time.Hicks had revelatory insight into American politics. His take on religion was interesting even though I did not always agree with it. his ideas were inspirational, thought-provoking and deep, but never amusing.Don't waste your money on the Hicks lectures- cos that is what this dvd is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Bill Hicks on DVD","review":"My husband introduced me to Bill Hicks back in 1997 and I can't get enough. When I saw this DVD was being released, I was ecstatic and it did not disappoint at all. Even if you've heard all the jokes on the CD's, it's seeing his delivery that makes this a must buy for any Hicks fan. I strongly recommend this and love to see that his comedic legacy is living on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto: Repetitive","review":"1. Watered down Sane Man 2. Shorter, alternate take on #1 in Chicago. 3. Relentless: New Material in England; all you'll be buying the dvd for.If you want Bill, get Sane man, especially if this is your first Bill experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"The death of Bill Hicks was a profound loss to comedy.

And when it's described by such compelling writing, an irresistible book results. Kelly charts the migration of the stuff across the globe over centuries. His explanation of its chemistry is fascinating and clear, his description of its devastating effects in war horrifyingly real. The wealth of peculiar details the author weaves into his narrative will entice even those who may think initially that they have little interest in the subject. This book shows what a talented writer can do when he is deeply interested in his subject.A really great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done.","review":"I liked the authors' treatment of the subject, and his plausible explaination for how Gunpowder evolved as a resource, as well as the impetus for modern warfare. He brings up quite a few points which make for intersting reading. Definitely one of the better books I read in 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for high school and technical college students","review":"This book is excellent for high school students and technical college physics students that are just getting their feet wet in physics mainly via applications and labs. It has more low-level details and tutorial than you would normally expect, and spends some time in elementary math. This is ABSOLUTELY NOT a book for college students taking the two semester sequence in engineering physics usually taken at the college freshman level. Those students need to buy the Schaum's Outline of College Physics, now in its 10th edition, ISBN 0071448144. I would normally give this outline five stars, but I feel that the front cover may be somewhat misleading and cause engineering students to believe that this book will help them through freshman college physics. For that reason only do I subtract a single star from its rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schaum's Outline for Applied Physics","review":"This book did not help me out. I am in general physics 1.

It's not really very good for squats, but I can do those with free weights easily, so that's not a problem.The ONLY problem I had was trying to figure-out how the upper pulleys worked in conjunction with the side-pulley setup, which is NOT demonstrated in their manuals. It turns out (thanks to calling customer service) that the upper fixed pulleys have tops that twist open, so that you can put the ropes into them.Customer service is excellent, which really surprised me.I'm completely satisfied with the product and service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of value packed into a small footprint","review":"I was looking for an exercise station that wouldn't take up much space in my crowded, low ceilinged basement and after about a month of use I'm satisfied I found it in the Bayou Total Trainer.

Some love it, some hate it. Only too late did I find out those who love itJust didn't know any better. Mostly recipes that call for items sold by the author from her website.

I agree with the previous reviewers- she comes off as better than thou, arrogant and a hypocrite. She writes about how her life is so amazing and charmed following her surgery, seriously, anyone with THAT kind of money would have such a \\"charmed\\" life. She talks about all these things she does and all the things she buys, while just appearing shallow. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time, and please don't pad her pocket with another dime, cause I don't want to read about it in her next book.

The plot took a couple unneccesary twists. \\"Whodunit\\" was the obvious character."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's been better.","review":"Well it wasn't awful but Robert Parker has surely lost the need to write tight, well-crafted, believable novels. My thought on reading this was that he wanted to write off the expense of a trip to Georgia and so dashed off a book in that locale one lazy weekend. For readers new to the Parker mysteries, go back to the early Spenser books; they are far superior in terms of story, pace, and relationships. The newer books are witten in black and white; there are no grays or shadows in the characters or story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiarity breeds contempt","review":"For some readers apparently. While this is far from Spenser at his best, it is still a workable formula. For me, believable dialog is what helps to hold my interest and Parker has it down pat. Compare the character word play in any Spenser book to say Tom Clancy's wooden characters and it is a jarring contrast. It is interesting to read the great variance in the other reviews, new readers loved it [wait until they read the early stuff!] and old time fans disliked it. Hawke went to France, Boo-hoo- he's a support character [a damn good one] but it is realistic to suspect he might just have a life that doesn't include Spenser. I agree that some of the Susan relationship is getting tired, but it is interesting to watch Spenser's fidelity tested from time to time. Overall I have read far, far worse and will keep reading and buying until I am sorely disappointed. A little more action will keep me happy next time out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser is great even away from Boston","review":"I have read all the Spenser novels by Robert B. Parker, and I feel this is one of his best efforts. Even though Susan appears only briefly and Hawk is in France, a strong plot and believable characters make this an excellent addition to an excellent series. Someone is shooting horses at the Three Fillies Stables in Lamarr, Georgia. Walter Clive and his daughter Penny hire Spenser to find out who is shooting the horses. They are concerned about their prized 2-year-old, Hugger Mugger who has a chance to become a Triple Crown Horse. Spenser encounters some strange characters who aren't what they appear on the surface. When Walter Clive is murdered, Spenser is fired by Clive's daughter, Penny. Later a new client hires Spenser to find out who killed Walter Clive. There are many twists, and the reader doesn't know the whole story until the last page. A real winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Again","review":"Another Robert B. Parker novel. Gee, what could it be about?How 'bout this?:Spenser (time-tested & true, sensitive, but macho hero) + Susan (randy talk & sound advice) + dysfunctional family (garden variety) + manly sidekick (oh heavens, a gay guy, this time!) + \\"snappy\\" dialogue (eat your hearts out, Nora & Nick) + less-than-obscure mastermind criminal (another woman!) + a dash of shotgun justice (always cathartic) = by gosh, another Spenser novel.Missing in action: Hawk (out to lunch in Europe, or someplace, with a presumably sexy Harvard professor. Yeah, right!). Less than usual: cooking (that's a relief) & dog antics (that's also a relief).Sum total: same-old same-old. \\"Old\\" being the key word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and entertaining","review":"My first intro to the Spencer character in this book came via the television series, Spencer for Hire. What fun it was to get a more in depth picture of Spencer. In the book he is both more complex and more sexual than portrayed on tv. Plus, his sense of humor comes across better and the quips between he and Susan are great.This story of Spencer's investigation of horse shootings was formulaic in the sense that there were no extraordinary feats of daring, no complicated codes to decipher or international trails to follow. Just a straight-forward, whodunit, with a little humanitarian subplot. It was perfectly entertaining and lasted as long as a made for tv movie...but with no commercial interruption.I will definitely read more of Parker's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue is \\"off\\"","review":"I'm a Spenser fan, but this is the worst I remember reading. Parker's dialogue is \\"off\\" or forced. Most of it isn't funny but is trite. There's not much to the book, and I haven't been entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but more solid than some stuff","review":"The strength of these books (I think) in the beginning was the ability of the author to combine the style of a Raymond Chandler book with the attitude of thinking and caring atttached to the particular character of Spenser. Some of the books are better at it than others. When the Chandler style takes over, you end up with conversations that are little more than a series of one-liners--this book tends in that direction, although the repeated telephone psychology conversations (which don't fit the Chandler model) do help to keep real conversation going. I thought the plot was interesting although you could see the ending coming for quite awhile and the end of the book was abrupt. I felt a little as if he were recycling elements of other successful books here; the strong gay character, or the hostage holding (from Looking for Rachel Wallace). I, too, missed Hawk. But I liked the more conversational, vocal style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clunker","review":"It finally happened...Parker has writen a stinker. I have read (and loved) all of his books...well maybe not \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" but the rest. What happened to him in this one ? The sheriff is the only interesting one in the whole book and the ending reads as if Parker lost interest in this mess and just gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser, we hardly knew ya ...","review":"RBP's best works (with Spenser of course) take the world as it exists, poke fun at the pretension found there, and provide surprising Spenserian solutions to crimes, situations, etc. that are based on a view of justice that is wise, pragmatic and morally pure. In HM however (and some of Parker's other more recent efforts) the emphasis is on sexual situations, PC, and recycled 'cute' repartee. Spenser himself is more pretentious than real and the reader hopes that his main squeeze (Susan Silverman, a PhD Harvard shrink who is vanity personified) will float down the drain as she sits in the sink putting on her makeup.What's wrong here? The plot is ludicrous, Spenser is sleep-walking, Hawk is in Paris, Tedy (who appears as a Spenser sidekick in at least one other RBP effort) is a PC cardboard character, and Susan is too much with us. There is little action and no suspense, and the conclusion is unsatisfying by almost any measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, boring, studid","review":"I hadn't read a Spenser novel since high school, but remember enjoying reading them when the series was on TV. What a disappointment! I felt like I was reading something that had been written in a two week burst of procrastination. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who enjoys more than cartoon sketches attempting to pass for characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy and light drama, not mystery","review":"I've now tried to read several of Parker's \\"Spenser\\" novels and have to admit they are lost on me. The mysteries are trivial, and the characters one-dimensional. Plot development is meagre and sadly predictable. What makes them go along so quickly is the finger-snapping, fast-quipping humor of Spenser, Hawk, Susan and others, which makes me think Parker is writing something more like the TV show \\"Friends\\" than a proper Hammet, Christie or Conan Doyle mystery. I probably would recommend this to anyone who likes light reading to pass the time, but not to a diehard reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugger Mugger was an overall disappointment","review":"I've read nearly all of Parker's work and the last few spenser novels have left me feeling cheated. The plot is weak, the entire book is predictable, and it seems to have no final ending. Spenser's investigation is nearing conclusion and then the book just runs out of pages. Parker has done so much better in the past. Readers new to Parker would do better to start out with the Godwulf Manuscript or The Judas Goat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again Without Reading the Review First!","review":"First of all I have read every Spenser book to date, I hung in there when they stunk, knowing Parker would eventually get his act together. He did, and I kept reading. Just finished Hugger Mugger it should be titled Mug a Reader! What a waste of time I almost didn't finish it! I read to the end with the hope it would get better. The only enjoyment I had was reading about Spenser's feelings for Susan, their relationship is one I envy.Total waste of paper and my money. I will never read another Spenser without checking the NY Times Book review first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser the way we like him","review":"Yes, some of the Spenser mysteries have sagged, but this isn't one of the weak entries. In fact, this adventure (largely) removes him from girlfriend Susan and excludes frequent partner Hawk altogether. Parker's dialogue and social observations are at their most clever and Spenser's derring-do is at top dead center. This is a best seller for good reason - a slick mystery/thriller. Don't miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falls way short","review":"This latest book along with Hush Money are far from Parker'S BEST. I have read all his Spenser novels and these last 2 are not close to the fun of his previous work. Spenser without Hawk is a waste of time. Next time leave Susan behind and find Hawk in a hurry so some real sleuthing and action can take place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad...","review":"Having read almost all in the Spenser series, this latest installment is, of course, a must read. Very interesting plot that falls a little short due to 1) Lack of Hawk, 2) No gourmet wizardry, 3) Too many references to Coca-Cola, 4) Minimal fisticuffs. It also seemed to me that the Susan/Spenser relationship was sweetened a bit much by the pair literally crying over the phone about how much they missed one another (Spenser's away on the case). C'mon guys, you've been separated plenty of times before - it's not the end of the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Parker disappoints in his latest book","review":"I've always made it a point to buy the latest Spenser novel when it comes out but I should have waited and gotten this one from the library (Sorry Amazon). Parker has run out of steam on the Spencer series and this book confirms this. Tired dialogue, miserable plot turn this book into something to be remaindered quickly. Instead of just moving the story south Parker needs to change his characters and let them grow. Afterall people change and grow as they get older. Spenser hasn't changed since 1985. If your looking for a good book by Robert Parker check out his series with Jesse Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"when you can't do it well, do it again","review":"Someone must say it. Spenser is cold toast. And it should not be a great surprise. It's nearly impossible (even Doyle's pen nodded) to sustain a series character beyond 10 -12 books, and Parker began to rehash plots that long ago. This book is notable only for the aspects recently become common: large type, small pages; interludes of romance with dear Susan; sub-plots with no relation to the main plot (here, the nanny and the wicked mother/lawyer); Spenser's smart-aleck dialogue, even with friends; and a thin, thin plot,whose resolution brings not a single surprise. Parker's other recent books without Spenser have had, despite the poverty of plot, at least the freshness of new character. Here, even Pearl the WonderDog gets scant attention--though maybe that's a good thing after all. The book is enough of a dog as it is"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker's Worst","review":"With a few notable exceptions--Small Vices & Trouble inParadise--come to mind, RBP in general and the Spenser series in particular have been in decline for many years. I have been a devoted fan of Parker's since 1985, but his recent works have resembled a puzzle. He has written some brilliant material in the past and now simply changes the names and rearranges the order of the puzzle pieces (chapters) to create a \\"new\\" book. Apparently, he feels that the reader is new to his work or too dull to notice that he has written nothing original since the 1980's. Hugger Mugger has nothing new or interesting. Even at his worst Parker usually comes up with an idea, scene or even just a quote that makes a book worthwhile. Not the case here. There is no Hawk or Belson, very little Susan, cameo appearences by Vinnie & Quirk, an allusion to Lee Farrell and villians so innocuous to be minor players in plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPENSER FANS DESERVE BETTER","review":"I've anticipated every Spenser novel for many years and am disappointed with the latest effort. The book ends abruptly and without the kind of result an early Spenser would have achieved. There are about 25 pages mid-book that are a completely different story than the main plot. On p. 273, Parker refers to \\"Walter Clive\\" as \\"Walter Klein\\" in an obvious editorial mistake/oversight. And in the age of jet travel, Spenser drives from Atlanta to Saratoga? The characters are getting to act and sound less and less realistic, a pity because Spenser is a great character. Maybe Parker is spending too much time dividing himself between Jesse Stone, Sunny Randall, and Spenser, all in a year's time. Spenser devotees will see this book as a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mugged, not Hugged","review":"One of the thinnest plots ever involving Spenser. So sparse that in the middle Spenser goes back to Boston (from the south) and gets involved in a few chapters of do-gooding that has no relation to the main plot. No Hawk. All the good guys are either black or gay. The bad guys are white and rich. No suspense. Wide margins, large type and double spacing make this a perfect airplane book if you aren't flying too far. If going from coast to coast, bring a back up, because you'll polish this turkey off by the time you hit the Mississippi River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order these they unstick very easily","review":"These tabs are extremely frustrating.

Every piece is a jewel, both musically and spiritually. It is full of reverence and joy, like a magnificent stained glass window. It is one of the best meditation CD's I have ever experienced, too, possibly partly because the chant is so much about breathing. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough. If I could keep only one CD in my entire collection, it would be a toss-up between this and Brandenburg Concertos."},{"rating":"2","title":"high school angst","review":"i listened to this cd constantly in high school. it's got the perfect mix of sadness, anger and dejection that any emotional teenager could want. five years later it still churns all my feelings up inside. it's really beautiful.764-HERO would later expound upon these emotions with much more variety. but they could never get back to the raw tenderness of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"this blender stinks","review":"I got the faberward blender and at first use I thought it was OK. Very soon it got louder and started to take longer each use to make a smoothie- yogurt and a frozen banana pre-chopped into little pieces. By two months it can no longer blend a fresh banana, is horribly loud, and is leaking liquid out of the center bottom around the bearings. Faberware would not refund my money, buat will only give me a re-built blender of the same model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud and unable to perform","review":"I purchased this product from some other local store but it did not perform as per the price. It looks good but the performance is nothing compared to its appearance. It makes a really really loud noise and I have to keep adding more water to make chutneys and salsa. Then it starts leaking at the base. Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dishwasher Safe!","review":"I recently received this blender as a gift. I stuck the top glass portion and lid in the dishwasher before using it, and the small center of the lid melted up in the dishwasher. So my blender \\"broke\\" before I even got to use it. Otherwise, it was very affordable and seems stylish.Motor seems to work well, but who knows how long it'll hold up once I start to use it. I suppose you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a while","review":"I bought this blender about a year ago because it was on sale, and it worked well up until recently the liquid started leaking into the base. The problem is the seals that are on the blade assembly go bad, so I contacted Faberware for a replacement blade set and they very politely replied \\"can't help you\\". Are you kidding me? The motor in the base still works fantastic and it could be fixed with a $5 part that the manufacturer doesn't sell for some reason. I'm avoiding faberware from now on, I don't want to support a company that contributes needless electronic waste to landfills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender and Farberware are both disasters","review":"Extraordinarily loud, and performance is unexceptional for the brief time it works, after which you can't replace the part that wears out (the blade/bearing assembly) or get any support from the corporate drones. My opinion is that buying from Farberware is like setting fire to money, and this blender is their way of saying consumers are just mud for us to slog through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it...","review":"From the beginning the blender made a very loud noise. Eight months later it started leaking and the blades were very loose. Now 2 years later while taking the base off to clean the blades etc. the ball bearings fell out. I rarely used this blender and only for smoothies. Farberware will not sell the base assembly so I have to replace it. I will not buy a Farberware blender again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So good, yet so bad","review":"I purchased this blender from a local store about a year ago. I use my blender daily. At first, it was great! Stylish, solid base, heavy glass jar. But like earlier reviews state, it has recently started to get so loud that my kids plug their ears and I have to leave the room to blend anything for more than a pulse. The base has started to unscrew on its own mid-blend, the burning metal smell is there, and as of yesterday a bunch of black junk scraped off and what appeared to be tiny metal balls were in the base when I took it off. Now the blade wont turn. I also noticed a high amount of liquid needs to be present to create the vortex. With as much noise as its making, this should be a heavy duty, solid product. Not so much. It was a nice year, but since I seem to not be the only one having these issues, I'll move onto something else for my daily blend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"I bought it because it was heavy (a good indicate of a strong motor) and the pulse/low/high knob was simple. Well, the motor is good and the setting are simple. Unfortunately everything else is wrong.The space around the blade is to small and it just doesn't blend well.Occasionally I smelled a burning oil smell.It's tricky getting the lid on tight. You have to put the lid on just so, which is a crime for a round lid (that was a fun mess to clean up the first time I didn't get the lid on right).Then I started having a hard time screwing the base/blade on to the blender.And finally the seal stopped sealing and a nice banana smoothie leaked down into the motor and shorted it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little good, a lot bad","review":"The good: powerful motor, glass jar, good liquid drain on base, simple design, pulse.The two big bad: 1) The spinning base under the blades is made of a material that heats up and burns some off each time you use the blender. It will leave black gunk on the counter and also when you clean the jar assembly. It's probably toxic too. 2) The worst part is that the blade column is made with some flexibility and it slightly hits against the inside of the glass jar. With less than 6 months after purchase, this is slowly cutting a hole through my glass jar. Yes, leaving microscopic pieces of glass in the drink. The spinning abrasions at the base, and also with the blades against the glass are some reasons for the loud noise. The blade abrasion will also sometimes cause the glass to unscrew from the base assembly while it is in operation, and leave you with a big mess of your contents leaked or thrown everywhere.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after sparatic use","review":"Don't buy this blender!

The three difficulty levels with different cheats available for completing levels within a certain time goal make sure the game has long playability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people worship this game?","review":"Well, to be frank, \\"GoldenEye 007\\" is decent. It is an average first-person shooter with some challenge. (You need to beat missions at a certain amount of time to unlock a secret, for example, which was a good idea.) However, there are more cons here than pros. The graphics are mediocre, not detailed enough. There's no replay value (for the one-player missions). The Multiplayer Mode is so boring and dull, there are not enough stages, or the stage just isn't large enough. The weapons are good, even if they're not real. Lastly, the lack of good enemy AI disappoints me. The only real fun in this game is purposely failing a mission. What also makes this game worth playing are the sounds of the bullets and ricochets as they hit a wall. The music rates 8.2. The short cutscenes when you start and end a mission are so pointless. The lack of enemy soldiers screaming in pain as they're shot also disappoints me. I'm sorry, but I think people looked at this game so blindly."},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent","review":"This is an excellent game. However, it is not quite as good as Mario Golf.

The guns are real but where did they get these names! KF7-Soviet, D5K deusch, PP7, DD44 Dostovie ? They really are supposed to be (in order) Ak-47 or AK-74, MP5 , PPK and I have no clue what the last one is.

I have three younger children, 11, 4, and 1. My 4 year old has been mimicking the gun play found in this game and even though I don't allow toy guns in my home, he uses his very active preschool imagination to turn his toys into weapons of mass destruction! My 13 year old literally sat in front of the screen for 4 hours straight on Christmas Day unable to hear or interact on any level with the rest of the family. He even lied about doing his assignments in order to have more play time. When I finally sat with him while he played, I was horrified at the level of violence.

Let's travel back to August of 1997. The N64 was just under a year old and many people wonder where the games were. By the time the N64 celebrated its first year on Earth, people were engrossed with the new, great game, Goldeneye 007.Goldeneye, in my mind, ranks as the best console FPS ever created. The cinematics, animations, gadgets, guns. and multiplayer all had people yearning for more and gobbling up N64's in the process. Goldeneye has also become the benchmark on which most FPS, let alone console ones, are based on, both by single and multi-player modes.The only crutch in Bonds' leg is the graphical representation and framerate. You cannot hold Goldeneye plainly accountable becuase very few N64 games ran smooth as silk. The game is not a classic yet, just a \\"modern\\" classic.

If you like FPSs then re-live goldeneye all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC THAT NEVER GOT PHASED OUT","review":"I got this game when it first came out, four or five years ago, and i have played it since. This game is like Guns n' Roses' debut album, \\"Appetite for distruction\\"; it was somthing new and different and nothin since has come close. No matter how many times you play this game you will not get tired of it. And after you play this one, never expect to get the same thing from another bond game cuz this is as good as it gets. The only game that comes close is perfect dark.So if you do not already own this game, (which seems very unlikely) wake up and smell the trigger, because you're missin out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this game!","review":"I like all the leveles that you can choose from.

B","review":"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game, Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said, I liked the characters, Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun.

I got this game for my birthday when it first came out and I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to keep it. I am certainly glad I kept it because it is extremely fun. I have owned the game for about 3 years now and I still haven't mastered the game. The game creators thought of every little detail when they developed the game. The missions are very hard, especially the Cradle and Aztec Complex on \\"Secret Agent\\" and \\"00 Agent\\". I am still not tired of this game. Everytime I put the game in the game deck, it presents me with a new challenge. The bad guys are sometimes very smart and even out-smart you, but other times they are just plainly stupid. This is a great game and I recommend it to anyone is looking for a challenge in a video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game that never stops being fun.","review":"I bought this game YEARS ago but I still play it a lot. There are three skill levels so even if you're not one of those people that can beat a game in thirty minutes, you'll still be able to beat at least somthing. And, if you are one of those that can beat a game in thirty minutes, you'll definately get a challenge. The multiplayer part of the game is great too. Most games become obsolete or forgotten after a year or so, but Goldeneye is a legend. However, a new game that some call \\"the sequel to Goldeneye\\" (called Perfect Dark) will be coming out this fall and is already expected to be a lot better. Goldeneye is still a great game. I wouldn't reccomend for younger kids, it gets kind of violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really cool game to play","review":"One of the best games for the Nintendo 64 game system, Goldeneye is a must get for all video gamers and Bond fans. Players take on the role of James Bond, 007, during the Goldeneye mission. This game, however isn't your everyday video game/ movie tie-in. This goes way beyond the plot of the movie. Also, there is a multiplayer option(my favorite) where up to four players can meet to see who deserves the liscense to kill the most. Even after you have beat the games, the reward of cheats, secret levels, and weapons will keep you coming back for more. PS This game isn't for you little siblings. It may cause violent behavior(hence my reason for the one star in educational value.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"00FUN!","review":"One of the best games of the decade!

Me and my dad and my cousin and my uncle(yes,the one that owns Sea World) we played it for 10 hours straight one day. The graphics are awesome. It was worth every penny.

If you read the PS2 H3O, N64 Rugrats Scavenger Hunt, N64 A Bug's Life, and N64 Mario Party game reviews, you'll see that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good time. Could be better.","review":"I've played Doom and Quake. These games get really boring after awhile. GoldenEye is a freast look at the Doom consept. One guy trying to save the world. Although GoldenEye has made some improvements on this idea it still lacks in the sence that your running around with a gun by yourself. It takes forever to kill the enemy and takes even longer to kill yourself at times. The game requires planning and a bit of stragity. You can't kill everyone either just almost everyone. The cheat mode and multiplayer opions are a fun way to look at the game as well. So to sum it up as good as the game is and sounds is just partily correct. In truth it really is just a game witch does has realizum in only some respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Eye 007 N-64","review":"It seems as though there is something loose inside the game - when gently shaken, something rattles.

This is an extreamly childish game. There are many courses, all based off of about four different track styles. The music, and especially the sounds, are very corny. I can definately relate this game to my little brother's Reader Rabit Preschool on the computer. The graphics are okay, but used in a cartoon manner to create a very colorful, but unrealistic world. The physics of the game were planned poorly. The characters look like those Pokimon things. I would only buy this game if it was to be used by those under ten. Otherwise, it is too easy to beat and way to childish. (I am 14 and I beat the thing in all of the different difficulties in two hours. It is not very interesting after completed. You are not rewarded in any way with new tracks, characters, codes, or special features.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like new","review":"amazon.com is the way to go to buy used media.If you like to save money and don't mind a Waiting for delivery, it's the way to go.I bought this game for my son and he loved the extra instructions and literature that came with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Addicting Fun!","review":"I bought this game on [...], and waited more than a week to get it.

One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times, I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64?

Each character has different driving capabilities (e.g. speed, stability). The game is fun as it lets multiple players (up to 4) compete against each other, but once you get the hang of how to control your vehicle, the variety of racetracks / characters, really does not add enough variety to make the game something the kids will be playing a month from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite","review":"Since my kids got an x-box they have stopped using the nintendo 64.

RACING MODE IS. MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE PLAYED THE ... OUT OF THIS GAME AND I SERIOUSLY THINK WE ARE SOME OF THE BEST MARIOKART RACERS EVER(NO LIE).

IT HAS THE BEST REPLAY VALUE WITH 16 TRACKS, ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD EXCEPT FOR TOAD'S TURNPIKE AND RAINBOW ROAD( WE CAN BARELY TOLERATE MOO MOO FARM), ALL THE OTHERS TRACKS ARE EXCELLENT!

The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes, I know that graphics... forget about the graphics, 'cuz first, it's the N64, and second, graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun.

It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode, which is not bad, but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although, that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games, too. I wouldn't mind playing this.

The races and tournaments themselves are challenging and extremely fun. The many characters that you can unlock all have their own abilities and everything else to set them aside.

The new version has been made overly complicated with new track layouts, and this has adversely affected the flow of the game. The karts also don't seem to move as well in the previous version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This game was kinda disapointing. I beat it the first day, and once you beat it, its no fun. The computer players cheat, too. If you hit one with any kind of shell, they quickly are right at your side again. Plus, computer players don't get shells. They only get the star and banana peals. When the computer players get struck by lightening, they go at the same speed as they did when they were big. Also, when they fall in the water or off a cliff (which hardly ever happens), they are quickly picked up, much quicker than the real players. I hope you find this review to be helpful.

In this day of multi-player combat games it is pleasant to have a game where you don't have to beat the snot out of someone to win, although it may help.

The case is ridiculously rugged and suggests a lifetime of use, but the axle to which the \\"all metal handle\\" is attached is plastic. The first time I dropped it nine feet onto the concrete floor of a garage, that fine plastic axle split completely apart, rendering it totally useless. It lasted me all of a couple weeks. Besides that, the hook has a large hole with very little point to its shape, so it has a hard time centering itself on a nail. There's nothing like driving a nail on your mark, stretching out the line, and then having to walk back to the nail to make sure your chalkline hook is centered on that nail.

You can also use it while studying, reading, or surfing the net.To enhance your mental capabilities, I would even recommend to play or use it with stereo headphones.For me, I find the selection of music pieces in 'Baroque Garden' very entertaining & relaxing at the same time.If this particular selection really fascinates you, I suggest you browse the amazon website &/or the Monroe Institute website for more Metamusic selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Women Meets Lord of the Flies","review":"Although I'd hesitate to recommend John Dollar to anyone I didn't know well, I found it a compelling, disturbing, and thought-provoking read. It's a bizarre combination of Lord of the Flies, Little Women, and Pink Flamingoes, and definitely not for the casual fiction reader. I was troubled by the novel's structure, which is almost two entirely different subplots pieced together on a thin thread. And many of the images are almost impossible to dismiss from memory, as much as I would like to. But if you're looking for challenging fiction, willing to completely ignore the annoying \\"Study Group Questions\\" provided by the publisher at the end, and up to the challenge of thinking hard about what an often-brilliant novel is pointing to, this book is something you'll want to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slog through to the end of this one, kids!","review":"Maybe *John Dollar* won't strike you at the very beginning. Or perhaps the middle parts will bore you. You'll put it aside for a few days or weeks.But keep going. It is absolutely worth it to reach the last third of this demented, beautiful, torturous novel. The intimate rituals of little English Christian girls discovering their natural paganism and their bizarre approaches to survival in an unfriendly environment create searing, crystal-clear mental images that I have not been able to shake since reading this book several years ago. Highly recommended, although you may not like having this stuff appear in your nightmares now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up","review":"No matter what the book jacket said or some glowing reviews on Goodreads, I won't be finishing this book. At first there was great promise, but it descended into something I didn't have patience to follow. I've been reading everything I could find on Burma (Myanmar) in preparation for a month there soon. There are soooo many excellent books. This one didn't fit my criteria right now. Maybe another time. There were some enticing reviews by other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"This book is set around 1919. Charlotte, a widow, takes on a job of tutoring the daughters of British families in Rangoon. Charlotte falls into a passionate affair with John Dollar, the captain of a small ship. A picnic leads to series of tragic events.Wiggins does a terrific job in developing Charlotte's character and the environment she lived. On the other hand, I found the story line bouncing around from character to character and scene to scene during the first 100 pages (of a 214 page novel). I found the story and the other lightly developed characters difficult to follow.I'm a huge fan of Marianne Wiggins later works - \\"Evidence of Things Unseen\\" and \\"The Shadow Catcher\\" so I decided to try this earlier work. Unfortunately, this novel was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little thing, but","review":"I love Marianne Wiggin's work in other books such as The Evidence of Things Unseen, but the cannibalism in this book really ruined it for me. It's just one of those things I CANNOT tolerate and I cringe whenever I think of John Dollar, instead of smiling fondly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This immobilizer is just OK. I ordered this for tendonitis I got from nursing my daughter, I wanted a second brace, so I could wash and alternate between the two. The support is not very giving to re-form. My doctor had to even work pretty hard at it, and he had stated when I told him that it wasn't very comfortable, that the support, or metal whatever, pushes right on the tendon, whereas my other one, supported above and below, making it much more comfortable. I ended up just buying another one, like my first, and hardly used this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Us Barabbas","review":"\\"The Ballad of Jody Frosty\\" is a haunting seven and a half minute masterpiece, one of the main reasons I bought the album.

I know I should be able to change that with my kindle but shouldn't the editor do that before selling it to me? I have to ask why this typeset was different than all other Kindle typesets? It looks like someone photocopied pages and then scanned them to the editor.This is the only time the overall review of a book was impacted by its presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent reading for Class","review":"It's intriguing book. I would recommend it to a professor or high school teacher for required readings. I've enjoyed this book as a student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuff: The Secret Lives of Everyday Things","review":"The title says it all. This book is a detailed account of how some vey ordinary stuff is created and ends up in the consumer's hand. It covers the raw materials needed and the energy used to create things like a pair of shoes, a newspaper and a fast food lunch. Some amazing statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading name","review":"This is mis-labeled. There is a link from the paperback book to this article. I mistook it as being an online copy of the book, which I need to read for a report for my Psychology class. It is not, and I accidentally wasted 6 bucks on this. It is not a paperback copy of the book; it is merely some random article by some random person. The confusion should probably be cleared up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, take up a new profession!","review":"I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with the majority of readers. I found \\"Stolen Moments\\" an absolute dud. While Harley Jane Miller is an interesting character, Duncan Lang is a whiny nobody who keeps making references to some comtess so and so. Jeez, who cares? More importantly, Michelle Martin cannot write! Her syntax is terrible. And for me to notice is a pretty big deal, since I'm usually easy to please. From the looks of it, nobody edited this book before it went to print. Furthermore, the premise of this story was so improbable it made me want to gag. About half-way through the book I put it down in favour of something else. That's how much it had me enthralled. If Michelle Martin insists on writing, she should stick to lesbian erotica...as for the mainstream, please spare us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This book is a disappointing compilation of cliches and absurd plot twists. If your taste runs toward stories that might conceivably happen and you like authors like Sandra Brown or Nora Roberts, you will be disappointed with the ridiculous tale of Duncan Lang and Harley Jane Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS INSANE","review":"i cannot believe that the lovely Jewel would ever sound like this, really this verges on the insane. you have got to hear this to believe it and even then you cannot think it is Jewel. it thuds so deep you will have to monitor your bass to save your speakers exploding. it is already massive in clubland, i've heard it all over the place but i don't think that the clubbers really know who it is and what she has done before, but they don't care, it has such a good beat. this is very very deep house and it works surprisingly well with Jewel's voice.also check out Jewel's album 0304 too. it isn't as heavy as this single but has some fab tracks on it and it is certainly her best album so far.give give Intuition a go, i bet you won't beleive it neither! you will be dancing your **** off in no time! never thought i would ever say that about Jewel!! it is FAB!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast refund when item lost in mail","review":"Unfortunately the book got lost in transit, however they were great to work with and issued a refund right away when I told them the item had not arrived.

I can usually put a book down for several days but not this one. I could not wait to get back to the book after work each evening. I read both books to my 11 year old son (with a little editing of a few expletives) and he really enjoyed it, as well. I highly recommend the books to both WWII and science fiction buffs, as well as those like me who read a wide variety of material.

It was so amazing, and it could only be two things: A movie or a game... Square had no experience with movies, and it wouldn't have been as popular a movie because it wouldn't be 60 hours long.The fighting was actually better than most Final Fantasies, if you ignore the slowness of a single battle, which I did somewhat. I liked the system where you could level up your materia.Pretty good, not worth the hype thoughm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Ever?

The only bit of help I got was in those few sections, where it's not exactly clear where you need to go next (i.e. City of the Ancients, Disc 2), and to help beginers with materia junctioning. And I am missing 2 and only 2 of the Enemy Skills, no thanks to the guide, which only gives you about 10. If you want secrets, hop online kiddiesm cuz this was just no good at all. I'm not even sure if it listed anything about thar damned, locked treasure in the man house in Kalm. Also, no 1/35 soldiers...I have 3! Where are the others?

I mean there are no puzzles or challenges whatsoever. I don't think I lost a single battle in the entire game. Don't be fooled by all the great reviews. They must have beeen written by pre-teens or very new RPG players. This game is not suiable for adults. It is very good for a console style RPG with many interesting places and effects.

The best part besides the awesome graphics and FMVs is the storyline. It is so good that about 10 minutes into the game you are deeply and personally involved and you will be happy, mad, sad or whatever when something happens in the game. The game's characters and storyline are SO detailed and awesome that I still can't believe I had played a game this good! It really grabs you. Man, you will be wanting sequels!!! This is the first real Final Fantasy game I played and it has addicted me to the series!!! PLEASE buy this game...you will understand once you start playing......Let the story begin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, not just hype","review":"I know this game sometimes has a bad rap due to being often lauded as the pinnacle of gaming,but don't let that turn you off. This hype is due to the innovations it brought in its time which are now common place mainly due to the influence of this game. The graphics are really bad, I usually like old graphics but these are just horribly blocky, I did not even like it back when it was new. This is not that important to me, but I figured I should let you know in case that is really a deal breaker which makes sense as aesthetics are part of the entire art form. Nevertheless, the music and gameplay are still superb (it is a turn based game, must let that be known if you are more into the newer FFVII games which are much more action based)."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird...","review":"This installment of the FF series was well... weird. I guess it is just me, because everyone else seems to love the game (why?). The games real time battle system was frustrating because well... I can't do everything or see everything at once! Also, the cartoonish style of the game (not to mention the cardboard figures and heartless charcters) really turned me off. In my opinon FFX is a much better game due to the obvious inhansment in graphices, cut scences, charcters, storyline, minigames, and entertainment. Maybe the game is better on the Playstation but if not buy FFX (possibly FF8 and FF9 but I haven't played them yet. Hopefully they will be better than FFVII)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, great services!","review":"This is a great game and though not in the original packaging, it was still in great condition.

You play in a world of nature vs. technology, complete with commercial corruption, the supernatural, and a world crisis thrown in. The game is so much fun, it takes hours and hours to finish, the graphics are stunning (especially the full motion movies), and you can explore a huge beautiful world. The music is beautiful too, some songs just set up the mood for the setting, especially towards the beginning in the urban slums. Others are beautiful and symphonic, like the character Aeris' theme. This game is the best! The only problems with the PC version is that the CD's always fall out of the case they come in, and you need a fast computer with 3-D capabilities to fully appreciate the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is love?","review":"I think it most fantastic game.

The graphics are phenominal and they cooncide with one of the greatest storylines I've ever seen in a movie or a video game. All in all, Final Fantasy VII is simply a must play game for any real gamers out there, capturing the minds and fascinating even those who are not big rpg fans. This is for certain, the best rpg I've played in a long time, and definitely the best graphics. If u have not played it, pick it up and give it a try.

I've owned both this version and the playstation version. I can say with conviction that if you purchase the game for the PC, then you will likely be setting yourself up for frustration.The first problem is that it will likely crash if you try to play this on a newer computer. You've also got to be aware that because this game was originally designed for the playstation, it generally won't run quite right on the computer. This means choppy or slow animation throughout the game (both cinematic and the gameplay portion).

Hey, they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a feel for the story.It's not as story-scripted as Half-Life (but then, it doesn't have the awful Xen world either), and many people prefer the realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal. i like the built-in bots in multiplayer (i think this was the first game to ship with them), but i'm told the net play is really slow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal keeping it real.","review":"Really enjoyed this classic FPS.

Just didn't have that addictiveness to it. From a gameplay standpoint though, the AI in the monsters is top notch (Try the Difficult setting). On a VOODOO board the graphics are just excellent.

Although many will argue that Half-Life may be a better game, I find it annoying. There is too much story and too many things to do. Unreal, meanwhile, is a simple \\"shoot now, never ask questions\\" kind of slaughter house. But it does have a collosal story line which is revealed as the game progresses. The AI will make you sweat as you try to outmaneuver and outshoot (not to mention outrun) a horde of enemies as you fight for your life. The weapons are unique, and somewhat strange, but they suit their purpose. The enemies are many and visious.

The tabs are easy to insert and change as needed and large enough to find the folder you need when you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What exactly is it that gay men do?","review":"Wolfe's the leading chronicler of the last 40 years of the 20th Century. If you've read Wolfe's every published word, like I have, you'll find fascinating this fragment that is all that has survived from an early, New York-based draft of A Man in Full.It's interesting to speculate on whether any major magazine would have published this ferocious satire on how the media pushes male homosexuality without ever having the guts to describe exactly what is it that gay men do. Obviously, the gay lobby is extremely strong today, and one of their chief goals is to minimize frank public discussion of what gays actually do. For example, all the enormous amount of verbiage spewed over the murder of poor Matthew Shepard avoided the obvious question of why did he agree to go off with those two thugs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is written on.","review":"With all the books I have ever read this one comes to mind as the only one that has ever turned my stomach. I am sure there are many other ways of treating a subject like homophobia without going this route. I gave it one star because there was no option lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack","review":"I'm not going to spend a lot of time telling you not to buy this book. Mr. Wolfe didn't spend much time writing it. Where is the story? I was left thinking HUH?, that's it? Where is the climax? Who was the other guy in the stall. Now if Wolf would have turned that missing witness into a General on the base, who was covering up for the rednecks. WOW. \\"Honey get the tape recorder, I'm going to write me a book\\"Don't let the \\"UNABRIDGED\\" fool you! This is a short story at best.Thanks Amazon, for letting me vent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great example to show the force of the mass media","review":"The tittle \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\", gives a previous hint of what the plot of the novel will be about. It creates a great conflict between two different points of view that share a friction trying to justify the illegal methods to disclose certain hidden facts that the audience should have knowledge of, but on the other hand, it shows the deonthological rules that journalists, as reporters of reality, have to follow to create an as-most-objective-as-possible (although objectiveness is impossible) representation of the happenings. I also see own interests that under my perception would NOT be justified, such as the want to increase audience percentages and things that turn into monetary profits.Jose Larrucea"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cliche' comes South","review":"No other author in the universe could have gotten this trite piece of fluff published.

People like the soldiers portrayed in this book exist in the South, but they are not the predominant type of personality one is likely to encounter. I suppose homosexuals sometimes engage in sexual acts as described, but so what? Having people shoot at you in a foreign country does not make killing people who are different than you okay. The press is often sleazy, but again, so what. What a terrible disappointment. I hope Tom Wolfe has not developed degenerative brain damage, because I would love to read another book as well written as \\"Vampire of the Vanities.\\" I never want to hear another seedy tape like \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be the \\"real\\" Tom Wolfe","review":"I actually came to Amazon.com to make sure that the \\"real\\" Tom Wolfe actually wrote this.

From the Himalayas to the delta this video covers the birds, fish, animals, plants and people who live in and around the Ganges.The video would have been better if the places covered were more clearly identified on a map. While a topographical map is shown throughout the video, cities and places are never identified on it. The narration is stunningly boring. The information given by the narrator is informative and of interest; however the voice is one unchanging monotone.Nevertheless this is an important video, presenting wildlife, settlements, people and of course the river, not frequently covered elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it twice and twice it did not work!!!!","review":"Received in the mail, son very excited to watch (loves these movies) put in the dvd, doesn't play! return it get another one in a few days, put it in, same thing, does not work!!!!

In the product description it even mentions the importance of using genuine Canon parts. NOWHERE in the description did it mention it was NOT a genuine Canon cartridge, so imagine my surprise when I received the cartridge and opened it, only to find it was an equivalent, but not a genuine Canon product. Because it was not as advertised, I will NOT be doing business with this company again. As far as I'm concerned, it was faslely advertised, which is a shady business practice. Will it last as long as it is supposed to? I'll have to wait and see, but I am beyond upset.

Almost forgot what decade I'm living in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furst time I reviewed him!","review":"Although I haven't completely given up on contemporary fiction in favor of Political and Science Books, it's been getting close. Sometimes when I read a novel, at some point I start asking, \\"What's the point? It's only a story. Give me something real!\\" Even reading great writers like Saramago can occassionally make me go in that direction.However, Alan Furst's 'Dark Star' evokes no such sentiments. Because of the ultra-realistic affect of his writing, one feels that this is as much an historical testament as anything in the non fiction section; perhaps even moreso. His attention to personal detail in his characters is incredible.Realize, this is not a pleasant breezy Danielle Steele/Sidney Sheldon book. This is serious writing that is excruciatingly heartbreaking. Europe went through a tremendous hell-ride last century, and Alan Furst is able to make you feel every horrible bump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"I just couldn't get into the story. It was confusing. Not as well written as his other books. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"Alan Furst's novel about a Soviet journalist just before WWII is one of his greatest books in the evocation of the fear, horror and human depravity of those times. Furst is also one of the few writers to describe conditions in the early years of the Soviet Union. The suspense in this book is heart stopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another atmospheric thriller from Alan Furst","review":"This work has a lot in common with \\"Night Soldiers\\", because it, once again, concerns itself with Russian espionage prior to World War II. Indeed, some of the minor characters from \\"Night Soldiers\\" show up in this work, moving the plot along. And there is a plot, unlike some of Mr. Furst's later works! Even so, the main thrust of the work seems to be the moral ambiguities involved in espionage work, and the long-term, and down the road, consequences of even the most trivial decision. The book gives an interesting theory about the early relationship between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, one I'd never come across before, and I found it fascinating. As always, the characters, even the mere walk-ons, are finely drawn and quite believeable. It's a moody book, but those were moody, if exciting, times. I look forward to many more works of this type from Mr. Furst."},{"rating":"2","title":"An espionage novel of the finest kind","review":"Second in Alan Furst's sequence of espionage novels set in late 1930's and early 1940's Europe, \\"Dark Star\\" focuses upon the experiences of Andre Szara, a Soviet journalist of Polish-Jewish origins and a reluctant spy for the NKVD. Szara's byzantine path takes him through the mutual horrors of Hitler's Germany and of the Stalinist underground. Furst's hero is certainly no ideologue, just a decent man caught up in forces stronger than he is, a man trying to find a way to survive and, when possible, to do a little good. The espionage tradecraft depicted is highly authentic, certainly fully as much as anything from John leCarre. \\"Dark Star\\" is a fully absorbing novel, painting a thoroughly convincing portrait of a past era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too ponderous for me","review":"I am a huge WWII history fan, but this novel is so enthralled with its own overwrought descriptions of minor details (eg, the wine offered to Szara by the rich French Jew) that the story is lost and I stopped caring about the (lack of) action. I gave up half way through. On to the new translation of War and Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable, unlikable, inscrutable","review":"Improbable events occur to an unlikable person, but luckily someone acting on inscrutable motives shows up at the last second to rescue him. Over and over, like the old Flash Gordon serials or the Batman TV show.A lot of people seem to love the doomy atmosphere of this John Le Carre imitation and the \\"what if\\" fantasies that form the plot, such as it is. The fact that all the twists are telegraphed pages in advance flatters the audience while contributing to the sense of fatalism. The writing is literate but pretentious (like le Carre's, only slightly worse).Drawing realistic humans is not Furst's strong point and the protagonist's recollections of his life clang embarrassingly. You can always tell when a flashback is coming, like movie musicals when everyone starts acting funny and you know a song is about to start. If you skip over those parts you'll enjoy the book more."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange book","review":"It is a strange novel. The chief protagonist is a despicable human being (a communist eagerly participated in the killing of millions who started to think about all things human only when his turn to be wasted did come close), there are noticeable stretches and then there is some apparent weakness in research.At the same time there is some depth in this story, which is not so easy to describe, e.g. somehow I was inspired to take out a Mosing-Nagant rifle I own and just hold it my hands thinking about peoples fate in WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heavy, ponderous work","review":"This story was ponderous and tedious. A complicated story line, which caused difficulty in understanding what was going on. If you don't already have a strong historical knowledge for this time period and place, you may have difficulty understanding the names, events, places, etc. I gave up on it after only going about 1/3 through it. Just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Hitler and Stalin were allies.","review":"An early novel in Alan Furst's series about spies in the pre World War II era. Fascinating spycraft. An insight into the history of an era that is usually overlooked. The later novels in Furst's series got long and tedious. Dark Star is a must-read, especially for John Le Carre fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I have Ever Read!","review":"I struggled to finish this book. I kept hoping it would pick up but it never did! Painful reading that just kept getting more painful. It was like literary masturbation - the writer wrote just to write and never developed a plot to even feign there was ever an intention of a plot. The book just went on and on and on with prose that seemed to be written for the author's satisfaction - certainly not the reader's. Here's a hint to Furst - consider the reader and write a story that has some sort of a plot. Just drivel in my opinion. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible, horrible book.

Not this one. I've only read one section for now (Chevrolet B body) but based on that, this manual is severley lacking. The other Chilton manuals gave a lot of engine data and detail. That is missing. What diagrams that are included are so small as to be useless. They resemble thumbnail photos, but since this is a printed book, there is no enlarging.Try the public library first.

This game is the only game i'd consider to be 100% perfect. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Racing Game Ever!","review":"As many have said, Gran Turismo is the single best racing game ever. Actually, I wouldn't even call it a game, it truly is much more of a simulator. The graphics, handling, speed, sounds and cars are all 100% realistic. It even gives the correct horsepower and weight of each car. It lets you choose from many different car companies, and in the Arcade mode, different classes of cars from A (best) to C (worst). The game is extremely fun and has an endless replay value. You can choose between Arcade Mode, where you can choose any car you want and race, or Simulation mode where you have to buy cars and earn money from races. The game truly is amazing. If you're thinking it sounds easy, you're wrong. Realstic handling and brakes make running the tracks a real strategy and getting licenses very challenging. There isn't much more you could possibly want out of a racing game. Plus, the documentation is pretty impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAN TURISMO (1)","review":"When i first got this game the B license test was pretty easy. the A license was extremely difficult because of the final test. i was stuck on that for about 3 weeks. i finally got it and started getting into some OK races. then i started trying to get the A1 license. that was impossible. all the tests on that one are full laps. i got the first one and i left it alone. i went to the races. then i got Gran Turismo 2. i did all the 5 license tests. i went back to the A1 License test in GT1 and they were all easy to beat. I think GT2 was more like the introductory game with WAY MORE CARS. in GT1 I was thrown to the lions. in GT2 they slowly put you in there and it prepares you. GT1 IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE THAN GT2 if you like a tougher challenge and dont mind having less cars to choose from i would recommend this game. if you just want a whole bunch of cars, get GT2. Forget it, JUST GO GET BOTH GAMES. THEY ARE BOTH TOP OF THE LINE AND THERE IS NOTHING CLOSE TO THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best racing game I have played !","review":"Super graphics, excellent price, Total realism.

Buy a book by Kaplan or Princeton Review; you will be happy for having done so. I find the number of errors (both grammatical and logical) in this book to be totally unacceptable. Being a scholastic editor and therefore a grammar fiend, I can only wince as this book not only gives incorrect answers to sentence correction questions, but also justifies them through the use of bad grammar.

Yes, those pictures show a very harsh reality among \\"mineros\\" in Potosi. However, the pictures do not show, in any form, the subtle aspects of their lives that make them really unique and respectable.

I kept it for so long because it is conservative and orderly. But it is completely lacking in certain subjects that are not uncommon. Also, because the authors are Brits, a lot of the vocabulary is very unfamiliar. It is also very dissappointing to look up a dream and be told all other factors in the dream must be looked up, but you get NO explanation at all of the subject of your dream.

If you have really complex dreams, you have to think of ONE word to describe it in order to look up some type of meaning. Half the time, the word doesn't even describe the situation I was looking for. The rest of the time, I can't even FIND the word I'm looking for! If you're really serious about dream interpretation, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money. Almost everything in the book means the same thing. Its a waste of money and a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"horoscopes","review":"If you are into horoscopes, then this book is for you. If you think dreams are more about psychological issues that manifest themselves in dreams and you would like to discover the underlying phenomena of these dreams, then you will find the book inadequate from this perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one","review":"This book is highly rated, so I checked it out myself at Barnes and Noble. It seems more commercial than anything. I highly recommend Mary Summer Rains' book. It seems so much more in tune with the symbolism and intricate detail of dreams... as opposed to just giving generic interpretations. Just one man's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but needs to be updated with items of the 90's..","review":"This was my first dream book that I have purchased. It is a great book but I guess that my dreams have more current objects in them that I need to figure out why they are there....It is a great start to find out what your dreams mean...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I was disappointed with The Dreamer's Dictionary. If you are looking for excellent dream interpretation books, I highly recommend I Had the Strangest Dream by Kelly Sullivan Walden and my favorite is In Your Dreams by Mary Summer Rain. These books give an amazing amount of information and I think they give accurate interpretations. Dream interpretation is very important and most people need help understanding their dreams so good books on dream interpretation are very valuable. I also like Watch Your Dreams by Ann Ree Colton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crock of sh*t .... ZERO stars!!!","review":"This book is such bull. They have taken certain symbols and labeled them as if everyones dreams mean the same thing. My biggest peeve about this book, would be that it labels the appearance of wolves as a bad thing. Excuse me, but not all people fear wolves and see them as signs of 'the devil' or some crap like that. They fail to take into account the fact that different symbols may mean different things for different people. Instead of this book, I recommend \\"The Complete Dreambook\\" by Gillian Holloway, Ph.D.Much better quality and diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Made-up Trash","review":"I can't believe anyone would flip through this book and actually want to buy it. Mine was given to me by a friend who didn't want it anymore.All it does is list things that you could dream about, and then try to predict the future from those dream symbols. Everyone's dream symbols are different in relating to different things in their lives. It's ridiculous to say (for an actual example from the book) that dreaming about a kangaroo means your going to take an exciting trip. I think the authors who wrote this were \\"on an exciting trip\\" to Never-Never Land when they wrote this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! A new Grisham has emerged.","review":"This book is incredibly well-written and grabs your interest from the first page. I am an avid fiction/mystery/thriller fan and this is one of the best to come along in forever. I will even excuse the fact that I (disappointedly) knew who did it before the half-way point - that's how good it is. It was still an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIKE DALEY FOR THE DEFENSE BOOK 1","review":"SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES is Sheldon Siegel's first book and the first in a string of books with attorney Mike Daley, and my first read of Siegel. I will return to this series quickly. A great first effort. This is a court room procedural in great detail. Mike Daley is a former priest, former husband, former public defender and at the start of the book a former member of San Francisco's largest law firms. Daley is going back, humbly, to criminal law in a one one office rented from ex-wife, former public defender, Rosie Fernandez. A double murder in the giant law firm's offices the night of Mike's departure give him his first case, a huge one! It is very good, a bit too long maybe on court but oh so interesting HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to mystery fans and court room drama followers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh!","review":"A wonderful work of art. It kept me reading where I couldn't put it down. The drama kept you on the edge of your seat. Its one of those books where you could honestly sigh at the end and hope there's another book like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommendable for lawyers engaged in litigation !!!!!","review":"Having read many legal thrillers of different authors I can affirm that this one surpassed my expectations and this is a lot for a first debut, making Mr Siegel a promising authorThis book has many qualities in display: the vigorous story related to the human and financial problems that partners and employees experience in the corporate world, the intense courtroom dialogues and procedures in direct and cross examination by the prosecution and the defense, the wonderful character drawn, all of them finally lead to the unavoidable comparison with Grisham who looks like an apprenticeBut the best feature of all is the unique subtle ending, totally unpredictable, unexpected and delivered the way only great writers with a lot of experience can doNo way to get dissapointed reading this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Twists & Turns Than a Roller Coaster","review":"A common problem to writing medical & legal thrillers is the amount of explanation that has to be provided to the lay reader. The first half of the book was a little choppy due to lots of narrative explanations. Once the trial got going, though, the plot was fast, slick, and as good as any roller coaster at keeping you disoriented. Much more credible than too many of Grisham's books, this novel also features excellent characterization that makes you want to know what's going to happen next to Mike & Rosie. I hope many other familiar faces turn up in future stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unrealistic to be worthwhile","review":"This book was so unrealistic with regard to how a courtroom trial would occur as to make the book maddening. The errors in the book go well beyond \\"poetic license\\" and into the real of unfathomable. To name but a few: 1. There is no way a District Attorney previously employed by a law firm would be involved in the prosecution of a member of his former firm accused of killing a former partner in that firm. Not possible. 2. There is no way a district attorney would ever have brought the case in the first place, based on the evidence presented in the book. 3. The relationship between the accused murderor and the deceased woman would never, ever be the basis for bringing a prosecution. And I've only named three of many unacceptable errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome newcomer to a crowded market","review":"Just when you thought that all lawyers must have written \\"their\\" courtroom drama by now, here's yet another one. So should you really read yet another first-time lawyer/author. The answer is, surprisingly, a resounding \\"yes!\\"This book makes no pretense at being anything but a fun read: no cause, no axe to grind, no reform plan--just a good page turner!The hero is witty and likable, the local color is enjoyable for all of us lucky enough to live in the San Francisco area (or those who would like to fantasize about it), the swipes at the legal profession are accurate without being mean-spirited or suggesting a grand cause, and the writing is consistently to the point, readable, entertaining and suspenseful, featuring some hairpin plot turns!Do yourself a favor: don't pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabbed Me But Didn't Hang On","review":"I was interested in this book from the first chapter, despite the many character descriptions that proved hard to keep straight. The story was well plotted and cleanly written, the people reasonably interesting, and the mystery plenty mysterious enough. But for some reason at about chapter twelve or so I started losing it. I had a good idea how it would all end and didn't feel like spending another three hours with this book getting there, so I flipped to the last chapter to test my theory. I was wrong on some counts, right on others. But I wasn't sad I'd missed the middle.I have a feeling legal thrillers just aren't my thing and I don't want to do the author an injustice by underrating Special Circumstances, since it is certainly well written, so I'm giving it four stars even if I couldn't finish it. But be warned -- if, like me, the legal doesn't grab you, Special Circumstances may not either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of four letter words","review":"Although the story line could be interesting, this tape is filled with constant profanity. I couldn't understand why the author felt this was necessary because the characters are interesting, the plot is a good one and all the sex and four letter words are totally unecessary. I would not recommend this tape if you are sensitive to bad language. If it's murder, intrique and courtroom drama you want, save your money on this one and go for an author who really knows how to write a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a contender","review":"This book started well and had a good sense of place (San Francisco).The plot had some interesting twists. However many of the book's events seemed contrived just to further the plot and didn't seem like normal occurrences within the book's fictional world.It's another one of those mysteries where the case is eventually resolved in spite of the lawyer/detective rather than because of him.The reader did a creditable job, though his voicings for some of the Latino and Asian characters were highly stereotyped.In short the book had some merits but by the end it made for frustrating listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out runs \\"The Brethren\\" by a mile!","review":"Being a Grisham fan, I picked up and read \\"The Brethren\\" the first week it was out. What a disappointment. Then I came across this book which Amazon.com had chosen to highlight. I had to get my legal \\"fix\\" and this book seemed to be a hopeful alternative to all the others. I was pleasantly surprised! It was fast paced, hard to put down, and packed with legal courtroom battles. The ending was unsatisfying, but since I do not want to give the book away I will not elaborate here. Lets just say that the ending caused the loss of one star. Do not let that deter you from reading this surprise legal thriller. I can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uses way too much passive tense--who did what to whom?","review":"Poor written. Flat. Uninteresting. Passive tense used throughout, leaving me wondering who's doing the acting. Author says things like \\"This action happened,' which left me asking \\"Who was it who did the acting?\\"This book did nothing to help me understand Mawdudi. I regret the purchase of this book (I wasted a lot of money). The book is too expensive considering how little it brings forward Mawdidi life. I'll have to look elsewhere to get to know Mawdudi. This book did not make it for me. Thumbs down. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well researched but not well argued or accurately presented.","review":"Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr makes an effort to present the life and idealogy of Sayyid Mawdudi but dissapoints by presenting a very unbalanced and bias views on him. He has misinterpreted and misrepresented a number of arguments on Sayyid Mawdudi. He has failed to acknowledge Sayyid Mawdudi's recognition, admiration and acceptance that he had received from the Muslim countries and communities at the time. A simple example would be that the awards, invitations and visits that Mawdudi received and made are not mentioned at all in this book. The book presents a some-what distorted and confused image of Sayyid Mawdudi, which any common reader will fail to rationalize,. Sayyid Mawdudi's contributions and effect in the muslim world are actually absent from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Flight Simulator","review":"Flight Simulator 98 is an awesome game. The airport/facility directory really helps. The chopper pads in New York really add to the Bell 206B, though it is sometimes difficult to control using buttons for a rudder. The scenery and planes are first class. Very Realistic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BEST BEST SIMULATOR GAME","review":"this is the best flight simulator of all. you can land and take off in many airports around the world. i'm from trinidad and tobago and our airport name is Piarco and they have it as one of the many airports that you can land and take off from. so for curiousity you can look for Piarco airport and take off and land the plane there so you can see what my country airport looks like. note* all the airports and cities look exacty exactly the same as they are in real. microsoft did a great job at that. you can practice flying lessons with this game. i love it very much a MUST MUST BUY! thank you have a nice day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy as a real simulator","review":"While the scenery, airport,& navaid database is much improved, the actual simulator is a step back from 5.1 .

Have tried on 3 different systems operating with the latest sound and video cards but results are disappointing. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This flight simulator leaves much to be desired. If you're thinking of getting this, get Flight Unlimited II instead.

The bits are a great value; made in the USA and the company stands behind their products 100%. Any problems and bits are replaced quickly without questions. As far as the price you won't find a better way to accumulate a fairly large bit profile collection and still have enough money to take your wife out to dinner. And yeah I've tried and have many Whiteside bits (recently highly rated in a Taunton's Fine Woodworking article) They are also great bits but much more pricey than Woodline's offering, my advice is to build a large collection with Woodline products and if you feel Whiteside is so much better (I don't) replace the Woodline's with the Whiteside bits as they wear out."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Cleaning product","review":"I have been using this stuff for 20 years...it's the ONLY thing that gets stains out of my carpets and that I feel safe using around my pets and grandson. Also, it has never affect the color of anything. I also dilute it and us it in my carpet steam cleaner machine, instead of all those commercial chemicals. I use a weak solution on my polyurathaned oak steps to wipe them down. It leaves them clean, non slippery, and there are no chemicals to break down the finish on them. Thank God for the internet because you used to only find this on TV!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent synthesis of Eastern philosophy and Western scien","review":"At last, an enlightened psychiatrist describes a way to distinguish mystical experience and creative inspiration from regressive psychosis. Nelson integrates Eastern Philosophy and Western neuroscience into a unique and practically helpful synthesis that appeals to educated people who see consciousness as more than brain chemistry, but who also discern the flaws in R.D. Laing's and Thomas Szasz's now outdated views on psychotic experience. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you can't always trust those pesky reviews....","review":"I agree with the last reviewer. Mario Watts friends and family must have left the previous reviews. I'll be 'scared our of my pants'? 'Scary and disturbing'? 'Riveting and dramatic'? I'm only 1/4 through reading this book and I'm wondering if they're talking about the same one. I'm wondering if I should even bother reading more. The bad grammer and worse dialogue are grating. This reads like a self published book that could have used a few more pre-readers to help polish it up. And if it really did have a paid editor, Mr. Watts should ask for his money back.I have nothing against Mr. Watts personally, but high school students (or even adults) don't talk the way the characters in his book do. Maybe he thinks people in California actually talk that way. But kids are kids no matter what state they live in and their grammer (perfect or not) is nothing like in this book.I'm disappointed enough that I won't be buying any more of Mr. Watts books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young Stephen King in the making!","review":"Really loved this book!

It was like I was in the game and controlled the outcomes of the investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever","review":"I love this game. It is almost impossable to find games that DON'T have CGI in them. I don't want to play pixelated characters from a computer screen. I want to see live action actors that you can manipulate and have talk to people. This game really is a great deal of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close yet so far","review":"I absolutely loved this game. It has everything I enjoy about computer games and more. I'm not an X-files fan but the characters and situations were still enjoyable to me. I like the interface and inventory and overall gameplay. The one disappointing thing about the game was the possibility of dying. I counter this by being careful to save before doing anything rash. However, when I was right at the end of the game, I killed someone who, apparently, was supposed to come and help me later on. The game should not allow me to get into this no-win situation! I had come so far and now I would have to start over in order to see the end of the game. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't pay too much for this...","review":"....The first (and biggest) disappointment is that you have to play a guy named Craig Willmore. I was hoping to play Scully or Mulder. But the video shots of them were very nice indeed, though you have to wait until the end to see them.Then, I think it is actually very weird to play at some points, because sometimes POV ends up in awkward angles. I can't explain it very well, but sometimes you are not behind your character. It seems as if the POV changes at some points. I didn't like that either.Even after that, It was too easy. I beat the entire game in one weekend. ...I recommend it ONLY for rabid X-Files fans. All other people will probably not be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this game would be great; I'm a big X-Files fan. But it was really boring. It was just a matter of finding the right place to be at the right time; no puzzles, no actions that would affect the flow of the game. You just wander from one place to the other. It was cool to be able to interact with Mulder and Scully, but other than that, this game was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is music you just can't stop listening to - amazing CD","review":"Shazz has got it right - - what can I say - - this is a classic which one will play for a long time.

The first single is a parody of a song most of us are too young to remember, and the other parodies sink to being nasty instead of funny. The jab at Helen Keller in \\"Pentiums\\" was WAY out of line, \\"Rabbi\\" makes fun of Jews, and the original songs also aren't as good as his previous efforts. \\"Albuquerque\\" has a meaningless lyric that drones on for more than 10 minutes. If you liked Weird Al classics like \\"Amish Paradise\\", \\"Like A Surgeon\\", or \\"One More Minute\\", you won't find any such classics here. And there's only ONE song about food on this album! The humor of this album is so watered-down, it's like somebody trying to imitate Weird Al. Too bad, I'd really been looking forward to this album.

He couldn't of picked a better song to do a Star Wars parody of, and while most people thought Albequerque was bad I liked it, nobody could have a worse life than that.

I, too found the NIN song a bit dated, and not very funny. However, he makes up for the lackluster songs with some true gems, like \\"It's All About the Pentiums\\" and \\"Grapefruit Diet\\". The polka is one of the best ever, covering a wide range of music styles, (from Madonna to Matchbox to Marilyn) seamlessly!I also must agree on the age issue with \\"The Saga Begins\\". He did this with \\"Jurassic Park\\" too. I'm 25, but too young to enjoy his \\"centerpeice\\" parodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"how does he keep thinking of this stuff?","review":"This a great cd.

Al stills has a good feel for popular culture and his choice of paradies is awesome! The Saga Begins fits the Phantom Menace perfectly. Pretty Fly for Rabbi, well, let's just say that I've heard the original song so much, I would've been disappointed if Al hadn't done a parady of it. Grapefruit Diet and Jerry Springer are also funny parodies. Of his original stuff, it's the last song that makes me laugh the most! What kind of a mind thinks up that kind of stuff! Pretty long, but I never stopped laughing through it. So, definitly recommended for Weird Al fans. And yes, the Polka is classic, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its been a long time but it was well worth thr wait.","review":"After listening to the CD,many times I'd have to say its his best yet.

It's all about the pentiums was hilarious! Pretty Fly For A Rabbi was great! The Saga Begins is the best Weird Al song ever, in my opinion. This CD is a must have for anyone sentient enough to click a mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al has done it again!","review":"Twenty years later and Weird Al is still putting out cutting edge music and parody.

Something does bug me though, and it's not this album. One reviewer made a correction that the song \\"germs\\" is not a parody of NIN's \\"Closer\\". This is correct, it is a parody of NIN's \\"Terrible Lie\\". He ALSO said \\"Terrible Lie\\" and \\"Closer\\" are on the same album. NO, they are not. OMG!!! Like. Correct Right. \\"Terrible Lie\\" appears on the 1989 NIN release entitled \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"Closer\\" appears on the 1994 NIN release \\"The Downward Spiral\\". Also, it should be known that although the song \\"Germs\\" sounds like \\"Terrible Lie\\", it is not credited in the booklet. Trent Reznor and Weird Al should hook up on a record.

WEIRD AL rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running with Scissors","review":"Running with scissors is a very funny CD. I like the way Weird Al makes his voice so high in some of the songs and so different in other songs. I never get bored of his songs, I listen to them all the time. I especially like the 2 songs, Jerry Springer, and Albequerque (or how ever you spell it). It's a very good album and I hope he comes out with a new one. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"Al's 10th studio album will make anyone (even the mean meanpeople who think Al is a loser) roll on the floor with laughter.Algives us some of his best parodies ever, including \\"Jerry Springer\\" which flows perfectly in sync with the original,\\"Pretty Fly For A Rabbi\\"(almost sounds like he brought the Offspring to play instead of Jim,Steve, and Bermuda)and, \\"It's All About The Pentiums\\", a laugh along \\"rap\\" about a dissin a computer geek. He also did some great originals such as \\"Your Horiscope For Today\\" and \\"Germs\\" that rank up very high with some of his best including \\"One More Minute\\" and \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\". How could you not love the polka that starts with the Spice Girls and ends with Semisonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This CD is great!

The Sage Begins, Pretty Fly for a Rhabbi and the polka medley are standout tracks. Overall, this album will date from like 2005 as daily horoscopes were no longer popular by 2006 and by 2007 we can see Al as an intelligent guy. I've been listening to Al since the 80s and he changed with the times, he didn't just keep on doing retreads he parodied last year's annoying hit songs. Yeah, if you were at a party, I don't think someone would say put on some Weird Al..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his strongest works","review":"... for one reason. Albuquerque. To me, that represents Weird Al in a nutshell.. it's funny, it's catchy, but most importantly, it tells a story - and a pretty neat one at that.There's a lot more going on there than is apparent at first listen - I view the rest of the album to be \\"more weird Al\\" (not a bad thing), but that one track really resonates and provokes thought, I think.Maybe, maybe not.That's all I'm really tryin' to say. And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up and find yourself in an existential quandry, full of loathing and self-doubt and wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence, at least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that somewhere out there in this crazy ol' mixed-up universe of ours, there's still a little place called Albuquerque!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DONT MISS THE SECRET!","review":"If you put this CD in the computer and open MY COMPUTER and open your CD drive.There should be a file in it that says SECRET FILE.Open it and there should be a movie file in it.

Especially impressive are his ska and zydeco pieces, \\"Your Horoscope For Today\\" and \\"My Baby's In Love With Eddie Vedder\\" (respectively). The crowning glory is \\"Albuquerque,\\" a rockin' and ramblin' monologue/song that takes the listener on a bizarre tour through Weird Al's twisted storytelling. Also impressive is the Nine Inch Nails-inspired \\"Germs,\\" which isn't so much funny as it is creepy but wonderful. The album title refers to the kind of stuff that network censors wouldn't let Al get away with on his children's show...and there are a few lyrics that echo the subtly rebellious sentiment. The funniest song is \\"All About the Pentiums,\\" a new anthem for extreme computer geeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yankovich Stuff ...Again!","review":"This album offers quality. The Pentium's song is perfect. I laughed my internal organs out with the Truck Driver song too. And, of course, the Star Wars stuff at the opening is just too much.

But, then again, I own, excluding GH2 and Ameoba, every recording he's done. I loved watching the 15-minute excerpt from \\"There's No Going Home\\" from the Disney channel on my computer. The only real downside, IMHO, is \\"The Truck Drivin' Song\\", which didn't really have a very funny premise anyway. Other than that, it's a pretty solid release, albeit a bit late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird AL, Yesterday, Today and Some time in the near Future.","review":"Well what can i say? Another master piece? Sure. Mostly what I enjoyed is the fact that after fifteen years Al parodies new songs in the same old \\"Al\\" way. Al got \\"FLY For A Rabbi\\" or any one for that matter. Weird Al is a Christian too! I had no idea til recently! Well God Bless You Weird Al Yankovic! I grew up with you since I was 10. Praise the Lord for creating such a splended talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet...","review":"i've loved weird al right from the first album, but his last few albums have kinda been stinkers....this one is absolutely incredible. the parodies are his best ever, especially the jerry springer/barenaked ladies song....and the originals for once stand up next to the remakes...just *wait* till you hear the big ol' truck song heh heh heh. my only reservation, and it has nothing to do with the music really, is that either the guy in the booklets is a clone, al's son, or the man had some serious plastic surgery...he looks about 25...kinda flipped me out a little bit. but the music is what matters, and this cd proves that weird al still has what it takes to make a great album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Al is back at the top of his game!","review":"After 1997's \\"Bad Hair Day\\" album, I was afraid that Al might be losing his touch. However, his latest, \\"Running With Scissors\\" proves that Al's wit and skill are still with him. Featuring the theme song from his short-lived TV show (a collector's must) and parodies of Barenaked Ladies' \\"One Week\\" making it a Jerry Springer-themed song, Cherry Poppin' Daddies' \\"Zoot Suit Riot\\" to \\"Grapefruit Diet\\", and a few others (including \\"Pretty Fly for A Rabbi\\"), I applaud Al once again, and realize why I'm such a huge fan. I can't wait to see him live in concert in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"A bit raunchier than some of Al's other albums (a few songs border on \\"too raunchy\\" for my taste), but this is one funny album. As others have noted, \\"Albuquerque\\" is the highlight, and, IMHO, is worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book made me laugh and was worth the read. Some of the confessions are funny and some of them a little heartbreaking. This is one that I would definitely read, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GroupHug Addict","review":"As I said, I am virtually addicted to the grouphug.us website, spending perhaps an average of 25 minutes a day there and having made perhaps a dozen confessions. I anxiously awaited the release of the book, and, while it was not a disappointment, it lacked some of the raw material and strange spelling and formatting that make the site so good. Also I had already seen many of the confessions in the book. The advantage of the book, especially to people unfamiliar with the website, is that it separates the chaff from the good, original confessions. I was also happy with the narrative that the author, Gabriel Jeffrey, proovided because it made the site more personal and I had long wondered about the identity of the creator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening.","review":"Very similar to PostSecret, although the confessions are written in an e-mail format as apposed to secrets written on the back of homemade postcards.

If you can you past the fact that it is quite dated, you will absolutely love everything about this title. The gameplay is rock-solid, and the game moves really fast.

So I went to rent it and it was not there. So I waited & waited finally it came in. And I have to say this was one of the better experiances I have had on the Playstation console. This game is huge and I love its freedom. Another good point is the controls that you can master in about an hour. The sound in this game is beautiful. We all know music adds to the climax of games but who could have thought it would have an impat like it has had in GTA. There is a bad point in the graphics, but other than that this is a great game that will have you playing it for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Just to sit and ponder the title \\"When Now Becomes Too Late\\" is a wake-up call in itself. In the \\"Twinkling of an Eye\\" everything will be different. I have never thought about the chaos that will happen on earth after the Rapture. There are no signs of the times leading up to the Rapture - it will just happen and soon. This book gives people a lot to think about - but the main idea is to decide \\"now\\" before it \\"becomes too late\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Now Becomes Too Late","review":"A refreshing look at the Rapture and what imminent means to each of us. This is a timely work given the events taking place now in the Middle East. As a believer in Messiah Y'shua, I gained a real sense of the urgency to share the Gospel with others while it is still called 'today'. This book is an eye opener to the reality that we cannot control time. A wake up call to believers to be about our Father's business and to skeptics to consider the claims of Jesus as the prophetic clock continues it's countdown. I recommend this book to everyone before it's too late!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Insanity","review":"The author should be in a rubber room.

It holds tons of toys and I believe it will hold up very well over the years. The canvas is thick and the toy box is very sturdy. My only complaint is that the lid does not attach and comes loose easily. The lid is pretty heavy and has created some panic situations by my kids. I have removed the lid for now and will probably put it back on when they are a little older. The price is very reasonable too. An all-around great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Peter Green Collection","review":"This is a great collection with many great Peter Green performances from his time with Fleetwood Mac and his second solo period with PVK (which is very underrated).

The bravery of the men who fought on Iwo Jima and the subsequent story of the men who raised the flag is one that must be told--unfortunately James Bradley is not the man to tell it. His writing detracts from the the tale and is so bad and so hackneyed that it is almost an insult to the men about whom he's writing. Bradley's choppy sentences are the stuff of teenagers or college freshmen, and I'm not surprised that this book was rejected by several publishers. Someone should have purchased the idea from Bradley and then hired a much, much better author to flesh it out. If there is a cliche that Bradley doesn't use in Flags of Our Fathers, it's merely because he hadn't heard it yet. I could not help but think, as I was reading it, that the author had movies in mind, not just movies he'd seen but a movie that might be made of the book he was writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand - interesting to read","review":"I highly recommend this book even for people that have no military background. It's written so that it is easy to understand. You feel like you know the characters as you read about them.

It is full of so much that we never knew. The horror of war and how it effected the lives of just six families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flags of our Fathers","review":"This book is very good, and highly readable to a general audience, which is just what Bradley wanted. I enjoyed the book, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the drawbacks to the book. The most important is that Bradley is not a historian...he is a proud son. Don't expect to find any real historical perspective here. Another is that he romanticizes the event to a small degree, so watch out for it. All in all, however, it's a good read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errors in the research","review":"I enjoyed the book but it could have used better editing. On page 63, the author states that Bataan fell on Good Friday, April 3, 1942. This is incorrect, the Japanese opened their final offensive on Good Friday, but the troops on Bataan held on until April 9. The book does an amazing job of describing the hell on earth that Iwo Jima was. I could not image any thing like that and I spent 27 years in the Army."},{"rating":"2","title":"most reflective book","review":"One of the great war story to come out of World War II, the tale of six men who rise the flag at Iwo Jima comes alive in this well told story. Unfortuately, its also a tale of saddness and disappointment as the toll of war made it mark on the survivors while it took the lives of others. I think one of the great tragedies of this book probably lies with the author's father, who strunk back when he should have spoken out during the long life that was blessed him. Men like him should be speaking since so many who were at Iwo Jima could not. But the book proves be reflective on the cost and toll of our soldiers in war, any war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good battle narrative- but slightly skewed","review":"The book itself was excellent. I especially liked the \\"stories\\" behind the real people, and the telling of the events during the battle. But, it did get tiresome to keep reading about how the Marines were the best thing since patent-leather shoes, and all of the other services were basically worthless. I am way too young to have been in WWII, but I'm pretty sure that the European Theatre was anything but \\"easy\\" or \\"civilized\\". The people interviewed (and the author) hint that D-Day on Normandy was easy, and that after 5 PM, everyone stopped fighting to drink tea, and get a full nights sleep! And, in case you weren't aware of it, and the author forgot to mention, that the Marines weren't the ONLY service in the Pacific. The Army landed in force WITH the Marines at Guadalcanal AND Tarawa! For another perspective, I recommend \\"Ghost Soldiers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"common man, uncommon valor","review":"with the exception of Joe Rosenthal's famous photo of Sgt. Mike Strank's Marines raising the second flag atop Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima was a forgotten pivotal battle in the island hopping campaign to Japan. this book is a grand reminder of the thankless sacrifices our Grandfathers, Fathers, Uncles, and Cousins made during the war. As a baby boomer, every father in my neighborhood served in WWII, and the Korean War. Yes, some were at Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir(Korea), Battle of the Bulge etc.. Like the author's father, they rarely spoke about it, and felt the real heroes never came back.

There is more history about the Corps in this book than most of the \\"war\\" books about the Marine Corps on the shelfs of your library. This book really explains the \\"simper fi\\" attitude that Marines carry through their life. If you are a Marine, you will experience the \\"why\\" you feel like you do about the Corps.

I read it cover to cover in about a day and half. The descpriptions of the War and the men who fought in the battle raged on Iwo Jima were brought alive in this story. It is incredible to think so many people were deceived by the efforts and the spin tallied by the United States during World War 2. Yes, the spin was in the name of a good cause, but it is unfortunate it took so long to tell the real truths about the men who lost their lives and the bloody sacrifices made in the name of freedom in this country.

I was extremely pleased with it, and just purchased my 2nd James Bradley book.If you have any interest in Iwo Jima, not necessarily just about the flag raising, this is really a great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener!","review":"This is a superb book. It is so well-written that it is hard to believe that it wasn't written by one who experienced this episode in time. The picture of the Iwo Jima flag raising draws tears to any American's eyes (look what it did when compared to the WTC 'flag raising'!!) To have the privilege of learning about these brave men and their extraordinary deeds is marvelous. I personally wish every young man between the ages of 14 and 25 would read this book. Now these are heros, unsung as they were, but heroes. I loved this book and can't imagine anyone not turning into a real patriot after reading it.

The book covers the lives (before, during and, for the lucky, after WWII) of the 6 flagraisers on Iwo Jima - so there are 6 very interesting people that you will get to know. The book is refreshingly inspirational - for those of us who don't want to read one more sad, self-pitying personal story from today's authors - this is an account of men enduring extraordinary hardship for a larger cause. Third, the book was written by the son of an Iwo Jima survivor who rarely disclosed any information about that part of his past - so there's a bit of mystery regarding his silence added to the other elements of the story.

It graphically tells about the battle for the Japanese Island, Iwo Jima, during World War II. Perhaps more importantly, it poignantly relates the lives of the young Marines and Sailors who became famous placing the Stars and Stripes on top of Mount Suribachi in Feburary, 1945. Over 25,000 young men died in that battle, among them three of the flag raisers.The book is not only a fine history lesson, but also says what can happen when men, who don't dream of nor want fame, become famous. It is written by the adult son of one of those young men.Read this.

When I finished reading \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" I called him and when we weren't crying, he emphasized the same sense of brotherhood he felt for his fellow Marines in Korea that \\"Doc\\" Bradley felt during World War II. It's hard to believe that a book could have such an impact on a father-daughter relationship, but \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" introduced me to a part of my dad's life that I might have never known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This is one of the best accounts of war that I have ever read.

Simply fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Bradley","review":"You do your father and the other Marines/Corpsmen who fought on Iwo great honor. Time, as we know, has a way of making us forget the sacrifices made by gallant Americans. Your book brings the past back and makes the reader aware that freedom is never free.Twenty five years ago, I remember a 14 foot orange run-about out on local waters. It was named Iwo-Jima. I remember the older gentleman waving. At the time, the boat's name had little significance. Now, I'm in aware of this man's sacrifice. Sacrifice for one another. What one learns from reading Flags is that men fight for the love of each other and not for something abstract.The book is a must read. It will cause intense respect and sadness for the \\"kids\\" whom laid down their lives for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut wrenching!","review":"What a great book! James Bradley's father would be extremely proud of his book. One can almost feel himself in the action. The mortars, grenades and flak flying all around. Truly a fabulous book dedicated to fabulous, wonderful men. It is the story of the most famous photograph ever taken, but no one ever asks what happened to the men in it. Very touching. Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue","review":"When I first saw this book I never imagined the depth behind it. Some of the things in this book are hard to believe that it actually happened.The flag that was raised on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima on top of Mt. Suribachi became to be known as a symbol that America was winning the war and that everything was going well over seas. That was almost the exact opposite of what was really happening.The Japanese had a belief that death comes before dishonor, meaning that they didn't care if they died as long as it was for Japan. They never surrendered because that was dishonorable. They also tormented captured marines it is a very graphic book.I recommend this book to anyone who like true war stories but can handle profanity and graphic violence content. The book is very serious and should not be taken lightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reading","review":"this is a story for everyone to read,no history book you had in school tells what really happens in war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is typical of men who lived and fought in the Second World War.

I enjoyed the story of the battle itself, but Bradley seems to digress and rehash the same points over and over toward the end. I often found Bradley repeating himself or re-wording previous opinions, which made the last 1/4 of the book a little dull, but the first 3/4 is excellent and I highly suggest it to anyone. My first impression of James Bradley is that he seems to be a poor man's Stephen Ambrose. Can't wait to read his other book \\"Flyboys.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flogging of Our Fathers","review":"Bradley's conclusions of the \\"boys\\" in that picture are maudlin and superficial. \\"I could tell his character just from the way his hands were positioned on the flagpole\\". \\"The Pima Indian is just out of reach but he wanted to help\\". These are two that stick out. I could reach the alternate conclusion that \\"in the rush of shells and bullets the sargeant grabbed any old place and hoisted\\" and \\"he carried the flagpole most of the way and then left it to the other guys to get it in place\\". I DO NOT want to minimize the importance and reverance of this heroic effort and Bradley's exhausting search for facts on the \\"boys\\" and historical detail of the events in the Pacific War is impressive. But the audiobook I listened to came across as sanctimonious and preachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that is written as if you were there in the war","review":"This book is the best world war 2 book i have ever read to date. This book takes you at an in depth look and the whole history behind the actual picture that was taken that will always be a piece of american history.

This book has everything, emotion, action, and a overall great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tragedy of war","review":"I felt like I was there. I could feel my eyes stinging and my heart pounding with every page describing the battles. These scenes were some of the best I've ever read. However, the book seemed to drag toward the end.

You learn how these men lived out the rest of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suitable for WWII history buffs","review":"Can't go to wrong if your historical interest is the U.S. Marines assault of Iwo Jima during WWII.

James Bradley manages in his excellent work to take us not only behind the scenes of one of the most famous photographs in history, but also behind the scenes of the workings of a father/son relationship. After having just recently lost my own father to cancer, it somehow in a reflective way brought me closer to him. A perfect gift, not only for Memorial Day, but also for Father's Day.Even if you are not a big reader of war literature, I cannot recommend \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story! Brings WWII to life!","review":"This telling of Iwo Jima kept me enthralled. It is the first book on actual events I have read about Iwo Jima. So much history I didn't know. I read many, many murder mystery books each year and none have produced nightmares - I had nightmares two nights in a row while reading this book. It's not for the faint of heart - but a touching, realistic story about brave men during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading - One for your children and grandchildren","review":"This book should be required reading for every high school student in firmly establishing what costs have been paid for freedom. Just as important is the poignant lesson of what young men are capable of accomplishing, given the circumstances. Bradley successfully portrays courage and leadership beyond our wildest imagination as we turn each page. You can't help to pause occasionally to mentally compare the young men to our own lives at that same age - and wonder. I was humbled and motivated. After finishing the book, I stopped three older men the same day and asked them if they were veterans. They were, and I thanked them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"Simply put, this is an outstanding book in which the author has clearly done extensive research in providing an accurate detail of Iwo Jima and the combatants. A must read for any person who enjoys American history, or just an overall great book with a moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I am a native Wisconsinite and was drawn to the book because John Bradley is from Antigo/Appleton, Wisconsin and my father was in WWII, Navy, 1945. There are many things in the book that I was not fully aware of as to what the Japanese were doing before the U.S. entered the war. It is a compelling account of 6 boys/young men whose lives were chanced for our continuous freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor Wanted!","review":"The book is filled with redundancy and would have benefited greatly from a good editor.

Nothing, however most grade school kids didn't know 50 yrs ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory seeker","review":"I would like to say this is a good book, but how can it be when you go against your father's wishes by writing about his experiences that he tried so hard to keep private while alive. It strikes me that his son jumped on the band wagon of WW2 money grabbers. Anything to make a buck.If his father wanted the book written he would have done it himself and better.WITH THE OLD BREED is a superior book written by a been there done that combat Marine who freely and honestly shared his experiences with the world.At the end of the day FOOF is just another reconstruction of what it must have been like by a civilian and morally bankrupt by violating the sanctity of the father-son relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"I tried to read this book and i couldnt do it. This book sucks balls!!!!! i am sorry but its just so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I had to read this book for an Honors English class, and it was horribly boring! Yes, the information provided is accurate, but Bradly wrote it in such a way that it was just a pain in the behind to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"and 1/2 stars The story behind the photograph","review":"James Bradley has written an excellent book about the lives of the six flagraisers in the most famous photograph of all time. I thought this was very well done, in most books you get a general overview of the story or the story as one person perceived it. In this book you find out the history of all six people from the day they were born until the present day. Some would be dead a day or two after the photo was taken.James Bradley's father was the figure in the center of the photograph - his father never wanted to talk about Iwo Jima & felt the real heroes were the ones who died on Iwo Jima. I learned a lot from reading this book. A movie based on the book & directed by Clint Eastwood is coming out later this summer. I think this story should transfer well to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME STORY","review":"boorish at times but great historical event and story about men who truly loved their country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant read","review":"Should be required riding to show younger generations what our service men/women went through to protect this country.

The marines are important to us, and we were fortunate to attend one of their birthday balls last week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent book about the flag raisers at Iwo Jima, written by the son of one of the soldiers.It tells a riveting story of six young men, and how they came to be at that black island of volcanic ash on that fateful day. Three didn't come back, and the three that did were haunted by their experiences for the rest of their lives.It's a book that you can't put down, and one that stays with you for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A full 5 stars !!","review":"It is kind of funny how I came up with this book. I was looking to buy some books on WWII and after deciding on 2 books, I was short 25 cents to recieve the free shipping. So, I looked for another book that was cheep in price and picked this one. Out of the three books I purchased, Flags Of Our Fathers was the first one I read thinking I will get through this before I get to the good ones. Boy was I wrong. This book was just so good! I could not put it down! I would find myself up and still reading at 1am in the morning. I would strongly reccomend this book to anyone! Now I am going to purchase the newest version (bigger with nice cover) to have as a keepsake. Take my word for it, buy the book and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flags Of Our Fathers","review":"A truly wonderful book. One of the best volumes on the 'Pacific Theatre' that I have ever read. James Bradley can be proud of what he has done to keep his father's memory alive and honour all those in the Marine Corps, who took part in America's War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"The book is very touching, you feel that you know these young men and their families. It helps us to see the price many paid so we can live the lives we do. It was trully a Great Generation, we may feel times or bad or that things are rough but most of us will not see in a life time the things these young men experienced in a few hours or days. How many of us would travel 2600 miles to set a story straight about a friend? Could we measure up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It fell apart","review":"Received this book quickly. It was new and appeared in perfect condition, but as soon as my son started reading it big sections of pages began falling out from the binding - almost like the glue was old. He was able to read it in sections and get through the required reading for school, but definitely not an ideal way to read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many flashbacks, disjointed","review":"The book is far better than this Eastwood CD. The book is more complete, and more comprehensive in the story of this vicious bloody battle and the men who fought and died there. The movie has far too many flashbacks(and sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks) and seems to focus more on the lives of the 3 surviving flag raisers than the battle itself and all the brave US Marines and sailors who died there. The movie is often hard to follow and I can only assume the viewer is supposed to know what the actor is thinking at times without the benefit of dialogue, but I couldn't and I read the book.I would not buy this CD knowing what I know now, but I highly recommend the book by James Bradley. His is the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"WW II book","review":"Did not think this book was on par with \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" about Iwo Jima. \\"Flyboys\\" seemed to drag on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am not sure if it is the fact that the Audiobook is an abridged version but I just didn't find the story that compelling. Somewhat repetitive and too concerned about details which I found boring and uninteresting.I was looking for a historical account (like the much better \\"1776\\" or \\"Team of Rivals\\") but this is more like an afterschool special."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bargin","review":"i bought this book for my mother who has macular degeneration and has trouble seeing.

What happened to us? Bought Blue Ray. It was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Moving Book","review":"Flags of Our Fathers is the most moving book I have ever read. The story of the six men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima by a son of one them is a great book about those guys who captured Iwo Jima after a 35-day battle which cost the lives of 6,800 Americans including three of the flag raisers. The story tells how The Photograph of the raising affected the lives of the three survivors. The author did not know his father had won the Navy Cross until after his death in 1994. These guys fought that battle and didn't say much about it afterwards. The battle scenes are graphic and make Spielberg's Private Ryan look like a cup of tea. How young guys did what they did in that battle is a mystery to me. It would be difficult to get our young to do the same thing today. I will never view the Marine Memorial in Arlington in quite the same way again. We owe a lot to those Marines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flag's","review":"After this book is read please donate it to your local high school library, this history must be remembered. Better yet, keep your edition and buy another for the school. Every school library in America should have this important volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flags of our Fathers","review":"I HAVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT WW11 AND KOREA.

The picture and subsequent statue of the men on Sirabachi was always an impressive image in my mind as a child. The book was well written and gripping as it follows the lives of these men who planted the US flag on Iwo Jima. It should be a textbook for any course on WW2. It contains history, patriotism, action, and drama. Perhaps it's most compelling attribute is that it brings to life the black and white pictures and grainy films from the WW2 archives. It humanizes the great sacrifice of these men for the USA. A tremendous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"With tribute to my father","review":"I was intrigued by a review in my local Sunday paper and so ordered this book online. My dad is a WWII vet who hasn't spoken much about his experiences. At the point in the book of the D-Day invasion of Iwo Jima, my reading brought back the visual reminiscences of Saving Private Ryan - the terrible reality of the violence of war. My dad and I were in his and my mom's garden where he was earnestly uprooting a tree stump when I told him about the book I was reading. \\"I was there\\", he said, very simply. I am 44 years old and one of 9 children of this vet who has been married for 50 years to the same woman and this was the first time that I'd ever ventured into this mysterious territory of my dad's war experiences. All I can say is that this book has been catalyst to my questions for my dad about a monumental period in his and this nation's life. I saw his tears in the garden that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Awesome Book!! One of The Best","review":"This book is one of the top 5 books I have ever read. I could not put it down. I read the book first and then watched the movie. The movie leaves out the critical details of the soldiers history, their home life, and their youth that makes them real and more than just a bronze statue. They had families, girlfriends, parents, and lives that some of them never had a chance to finish, like so many other young soldiers in WWII. This book is not about just the soldiers raising the Flag it is about all soldiers in WWII, and many of whom we have forgotten. James Bradley has done a magnificent job of remembering his father, the flag raisers, and the sacrifice so many Americans made during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Brillant, inspiring story by the son of a flag raiser. So many reviews do not give me room to add much. Therefore, let me just make this point. While being familiar with the book I did not choose to read it initially. I viewed the movie first and was very inspired to read the book for a more complete story. The movie is very true to the book but as always, with a good book there is depth you do not get in a the movie. For this, I am glad I read the book but for most people the movie may be enough.

This two-track CD, however, is a worthwhile addition to any fan's collection. The title track, \\"As\\", a duet with Mary J. Blige, is a soulful remake of the classic Stevie Wonder song, produced by Babyface. It's a shame that MCA records (Blige's label) wouldn't permit this track to appear on the U.S. version of George's \\"Best of\\" set.

Pitino is passionate about what he does and the people with whom he works. He writes of the maturation process he had to endure himself before arriving at a more holistic view of genuine leadership. Such a person views the success of others in their organization as a mark of personal leadership.This book is packed with \\"behind the scenes\\" insights on Patino paying his dues.

This man has had only one real success in his life (The Kentucky basketball team) beyond that what has he done? Nothing! He's taken jobs and made money off of some people's belief that because of his one success he could repeat that. He has yet to prove himself. His leadership qualities have not been proven either. He has not been able to lead any of the people charged to him to success, nor has he been able to change their bad attitudes or instill a work ethic in them.

One thing I noticed is that I actually have to wear or wind the watch evey two days or so to keep it working. The winder I bought doesn't seem to do the job for this watch.

The Kriyananda version is also much more complete with \\"Samadhi\\" included as well as a number of longer poems and chants.

The Doc Ock character lacks the pot-belly and man-boobs of his on-screen counterpart - the little character looks more like one of the children in \\"Village of the Damned\\" than Doc Ock, but I don't think kids are going to care. He has the flexi tenticles coming of his back - that's enough right here!Also included are a clock and a very futuristic looking taxi with taxi driver included.Because all LEGO sets are interchangable, your kids are not limited to the one rendition of the scene as it appears on the box.

Get enough points, and you'll advance to the next level and go on to other cities and bigger jobs. The more successful you are, the more difficult the jobs get. Some will be in multiple parts; others will have a time limit. And just because you work for the wrong side of the law doesn't mean you're safe from harm.

In short, if you can place and broom finish a slab, you already know 95% of what this video demonstrates.

When you open the top, you will notice a series of connectors in a plastic electronic strip at the bottom of the lid, below this the electronic strip is folded in an awkward way, which after several hundred openings, the slight tension causes the strip to naturally sever, hence the unit ceases to operate.

Believe me dont waste your money on this game. It is not up to par with Red Alert and not even on the same planet as Starcraft or Age of Empires II. Save your cash and get Starcraft or AOE II if you want a real time strategy game. It has deformable terrain which is an interesting idea, thus, the extra star.

It looks great but the I found the play to be lethargic..even at the high game speeds. I also found it more difficult to distinquish which units were which at times than in Red Alert. It also seems that many of the missions seem to be commando missions where you race your forces accross the map with periodic replacement troops instead of more build you base and then attack missions.

The two games have almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring helicopters and cheap \\"hover units\\".However this game is not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics, featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done better.Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go ahead and buy it. But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999, go and check out Homeworld it's a far better game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is going to BIG!","review":"If the other command and conquers are anything to go by and the work of Westwood, Tiberian Sun is going to be amazing!

I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.

I was disappointed.\\"Tides\\" follows \\"Gates\\" tactic of telling an epic Greek story from the perspective of a lumpenprole. In this case the story of the Athenian hero/scoundrel Alciabides' rise and flame-out. However, there is something missing here, that was in \\"Gates of Fire\\". Frankly I found this book boring in comparison. I put it down, uncompleted.If you are interested in historical fiction involving Alciabides, I recommend Rosemary Sutcliff's \\"Flowers for Adonis\\". I read that book twice.Is the Tide going out on Pressfield?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I forced myself to finish this book. I hate it when I read a book just to finish it, it's like I'm back in school. Well, that is just what I did with \\"Tides of War\\". Pressfield's stilted language is often times hard to understand. You really have to wade through the words to get to the point of what is going on. Which is disappointing because Alcibiades is one of the most fascinating characters in history.One bright spot of the whole book is the Sicilian expedition chapter. Here Pressfield's writing flows evenly and the story begins to take-off. Unfortunately only to have it crash land again with Pressfield's slow story line.After \\"Gates of Fire\\" this is a large disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ancient history","review":"Usually Pressfield's books are page turners.

I love historical fiction and have read much of Pressfield, but this book was a huge let down. I tried to force myself to enjoy it but that was too painfull after about 60 pages. What the hell was Pressfield thinking, this book was horribly written on a subject that should be reletevely easy for an author to make readable...expecially historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"When this book arrived, I eagerly dove into it, hoping that it was at least close to the gripping \\"Gates of Fire\\" I had read so many times. Sadly, I was much disappointed. This novel is more about political issues and a personal quest for glory than it is about men in combat. And while for certain people that may be interesting, for me the absence of the combat depictions and the seemingly endless political maneuvering made this book very tedious to read. Steven Pressfield is a very intelligent individual and a gifted writer, and my dislike for this book is more a testament to my inflexibility than it is to any fault in its creation. But I still didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mastery","review":"Steven Pressfiel is without equal!

One can get a better picture of Alcibiades reading a \\"traditional\\" history (Donald Kagan's \\"The Peloponnesian War\\" is highly recommended). Read \\"Gates of Fire\\" or \\"The Last Amazon\\" instead. You will be disappointed if you buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book!","review":"Mr Pressfield is at his best in this book. The story is compelling and absorbing. The action is non-stop and the description of the battle plans and battles puts goosebumps on your arms. I have read several novels of ancient warfare over the past two years, including Pressfields' Gates of Fire, and hands down this is the best. For sheer drama, action, characters, and just plain old adventure, this book is the best one out there.

Sadly, this book doesn't share the same qualities. While both are interesting due to the amount of historical detail about life in that era, the narrator here isn't very interesting and is not close enough to Alcibiades to make his actions come to life. His motives often remain obscure and we don't have enough insight into his genius, if he can be called that. The story jumps around a bit which often lets the steam out of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Up To It, This One Can Be Memorable","review":"Yes, yes, we know Pressfield's great at battle detail and historically accurate story lines. More important in this work is the brilliant choice of character (Alcibiades) and the narrative technique of using two narrators (Jason & Polemides). Then the plot thickens.....Socrates shares the jail with Polemides and enters the script as well......Jason & Polemides have their own tangled web to unweave......this is a great novel that rises far above the thunder of the battle to enter the realm of a psychological analysis of democracy, theocracy, and a slew of both the finest and basest of human motivations.This one wins on all levels.....Pressfield is cementing a beautiful reputation on these works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"One of the best books I have ever read, if not the best, was \\"Gates of Fire\\" by the same author. I was really excited about this book, but it was really disappointing, too many boring and useless details, a confusing and messy dialogue, extremely boring and tedious to go through.I also don't understand why the author had to use so much jargon, too much of for example, in describing naval battles a, why?I am sorry to say this book was a total waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"I'm a 45 year old reader with miliary service, a graduate degree and I love to read philosophy, history, everything I can get my hands on. In my opinion, this book is void of reward. Gates of Fire was saved because Pressfield can write about a battlefield (if little else). Tides of War de-emphasized the battles in favor of I don't know what. Skip it or check it out at the library if you must see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruthless personal ambition","review":"Where Pressfield's other Greek book, Gates of Fire, was about thoughtful devotion and total dedication, Tides of War is about boundless lust for power.Alcibiades, the novel's main object of study, never relents. He strives for more and more and takes it, until there's nothing left to take. Then his benefectors and followers realize something's wrong and Alcibiades must find another venue to plunder.He's very charming, but we the readers know better than the characters in the novel, and we never trust him or really like him.I couldn't figure out what Pressfield wanted to show with this novel. The message I got (ruthless ambition leading to disaster) seems trite. Alcibiades's continual rejoinder that he simply follows the goddess of Necessity, just doesn't jibe. Tides of War has none of the nobility that we find in Gates of FireStill, I give it one star for the writing, and one star for the period piece. Thucydides beckons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story telling at its worst...","review":"I started reading this immediately after the last REH compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. While REH was first and foremost a story teller, Pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous Alcibiades. This, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. But why do this? Why use such a crappy method of story telling? I guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. All in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story. So crappy that I felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews.I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detail is Signifigant","review":"In this attempt to describe the Greek way of living, fighting, scheming and dying, Mr. Pressfield has done an excellent job. He projects the advantages and disadvantages the majesty and the misery of the Greek society of then, now and probably tomorrow. Scheming, ambition, vanity and self-destruction have always been the key features of the Greek nation's leaders throughout history. Each of these great men that have stamped human history with their genius, warrior's spirit and -unfortunately- libido, have their own little tale that makes their successful efforts amazing.

No matter your answer, chances are you will find something resembling it at sometime in this CD. This is schizo rock at its finest.

When it first starts off, you may think you've put in your contemporary classical music CD. A couple minutes into however, acoustic guitars come about and you may think you are listening to something like Turin Brakes. Suddenly, blasting guitars and we in the midst of a full fledged heavy metal excursion. Then it slows down a bit to a good hard rock number. Suddenly, just out of the blue, he plays sort of a Spanish downtempo jazz number. Then...Are You Still Alive...it hits you harder than ever. Cool violins over scorching riffs. This is just one song.

I was also never able to get the o.e. strings to achieve proper intonation. After the string change, and a drastic bridge adjustment, intonation is dead on all the way up the neck!!! Most of the finger noise I had with the roundwounds is now gone, but they still retained the bright sound that I like from my bass.

I can hear his voice as I read the rants in his various books. I even occasionally laugh out loud reading him which is very rare for me.This particular volume of rants (his third) is classic Miller. If you like his style then you'll like this book. Its one weakness was the Clinton/Lewinsky joke came up way too many times. His ability to come up with a unique skew on things is too good to fall back on this chestnut as many times as he does.This is a small complait, though, about what is generally a very funny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as promised, but still worth the purchase price","review":"One of the chief joys of Dennis Miller's rants is listening to his deadpan delivery. I Rant, Therefore I Am is just as good as his previous audiobooks.To quote Miller, \\"now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but...\\", the quibble that I have is that they promised us three CDs of Dennis Miller; this package only has two. It's missing 23 of the 55 rants the hardcover has. That's why this review loses a star. I guess we'll see the release of another \\"Redux\\" volume within the next few years. \\"Redux\\" covered what was missing out of his first two audiobooks.So if you like Miller's off-brand sense of outrage, at least buy the book.

Some strength is required. Assembly complete. To make the product stand as in the image you hold the body cage and push down each leg until it wedges between vertical wires of the cage body. In my case the legs frequently pop out (each side). When the legs are raised for storage/transport, there is no latch to hold them up and the legs naturally fall into a horizontal position (I have taken to using a velcro strap between them to keep them up. Finally, when transporting or using the Risette to pick up balls, the handles (shown as the bars between the feet in the image) rotate around the body to meet flush together above the cage and it's fairly easy to pinch your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice smaller ballhopper.

Be careful about the errors and inconsistency in this book when you read this books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference!!","review":"\\"Using Active Server Pages\\" is hands-down the best reference on ASP on the market, IMHO. The section \\"Creating Your Own Active Server Components\\" saved my butt when a client \\"requested\\" that I learn to implement the MTS component model.Others complain that this book is too basic, but this is unquestionably the real beauty of it. I bought the book with some ASP experience already under my belt, but was quickly and happily able to fill a whole bunch of holes in my knowledge and approach. I now feel that I have a solid foundation in ASP from which to expand and develop my skills. This book will be a core reference for me for a long time to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book for beginner.","review":"I felt this book is easy to read. I can read it form page to page like a novel. Even I have never used and accessed to MTS, IIS and done any ASP at all. I did not try the examples, so I do not know the examples work or not. However, I did read the examples and they are simple but good enough for learning the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much more practical in much less words","review":"The author is spending a lot of words on the things that are not the subject of the book (like using Microsoft FrontPage).

The vbscript primer is good, but the book jumps around too much and doesn't seem to be well organized. I also think there should be more examples on using the lowest common denominator, eg., Forms, etc, instead of the Active X stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of error","review":"Just don't buy it. The worst ASP book I ever read! Very hard to read and there are lots of code error in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly written book. Do not buy","review":"I suppose that the first clue to the number of errors in the book is the fact that they were unable to get the author's first name spelled correctly.Be warned that the ASP examples in this book are riddled with errors. I've had to spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out the correct syntax of commands and make sense of the many inconsistencies in the book.It's also interesting that Que books is unable to spell even the easiest of terms correctly (e.g. \\"OLE\\" is spelled \\"OEL\\" in some places; \\"ASP\\" is spelled \\"APS\\" is some places, etc.)Save your money & your time; you'll find that the WROX books are edited and proofread much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Code!!","review":"I don't know why anyone would rate this book any higher than a one if they read the whole thing. Creating your own ActiveX Server Components is the single most important thing about using ASP technology for developers and yet the code offered by the book screws that up! Just look at Chapter 18, page 402, listing 18.12 SCCLASS.CLS. Anyone who understands anything about programming knows about keywords. Just try and use Visual Basic to create the code in the Public Sub OnStartPage method (Set as as mySc.Application <-- Double as vision there).In addition this same routine attemps to create an instance using the \\"as\\" keyword instead of \\"=\\". That won't happen. The author of this book must be laughing all the way to the bank. Amazon should hire some real programmers to review these types of books before they waste the readers time and money with this kind of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book if you're not creating ASP pages.","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this book. There are too many mistakes in this book, in the source code, the examples, and the diagrams. At times, the instructions given are not complete, and skips steps which I guess he assumes people should know. This makes it very frustrating to get anything done. In addition, the index is not very complete, so it's not easy to find the information you want.I am at the point where I'm going to dump the book and just get the book everyone else I know is getting: Professional Active Server Pages 2.0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource For Beginners","review":"This book provided us with the ability to learn and implement an entire Active Server Page website in about 4 weeks! Although we had no prior ASP knowledge, we were well versed in HTML, Visual Basic and SQL. Without question, this was and continues to be one of the single most important references we have at the office.The book clearly explained Active Server Page objects such as Response, Request, and Server and gave us sample code that we were able to quickly use for our own project. The chapters on ADO provided us the tools we needed to implement a mission critical real-time web-based DB application.We highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To many errors","review":"You would think that some computer experts, most likely PHDs could write a simple programming book without soure code errors!!!!

I recomend that parents keep their kids away from them getting use to killing people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but sweet","review":"OK, most people probably wont take me seriously, when I say: THIS GAME WAS TOO SHORT. Well trust me, when you get this game, you will see what I mean. Although the AI isn't the best, this game presents a great challenge. As you work your way through the missions, you will get caught up in the complex story line, full of twists. This game gets your adrenaline flowing. Choose your anti-terrorist team from a list of experts, your weapons, your gear, and make a plan. You can send one team of your strike force around the back of a building while you storm the front, or do any number of other plans. This game was EXCELLENT. While it is a great game though, I can't give it five stars, because the AI has room for improvement, and because it is too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Six/----->","review":"Rainbow Six really brought me into computer gaming. Before I never played games on computers. Now that I've played and owned this I play this and Rogue Spear, (the sequal), all the time. The game really brought a new setting to all gamers. Your free in the enviroment, the action is intense and challenging, the terrorists are out and dangerous. Everything is perfect. It's like your there. The game has great graphics and non-stop action. It's intense and you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time. The weapons in this game don't have the great collection like Rogue Spear does, but once your in the setting your weapons don't matter that much. If you like first person shooters or any swat team type of games than you'll like this. It's a classic. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Planning -- Not Enough Game Play","review":"This was more boring than fun. It took too much time to plan out the missions. And the actual game play with action did not last very long. I thought this game was pretty boring. If you like to plan out your missions it might be fun. But I prefer going straingt to the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Stopping Action","review":"If you are fan of nonstop action, a Tom Clancy Fan, or a Paranoid conspiracy freak this game is for you. I play it all the time and never get bored. If you combine the Rainbow Six, Eagle Watch, and the new Rogue Spear you'll get all the tango shooting action you have dreamed of. Around every corner you turn is a new challenge and a piece of action to keep you excited. This game has enough action to stay excited and also has several real life objectives to make the fun more realistic. Surprisingly enough, Rainbow Six the game follows very closely to Tom Clancy's best seller. Some of the mission and names may have been changed, but all in all the plot is very close that of the book. I loved this game for the action, the suspense, and also just because I'm a bonified Clancy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for \\"Rainbow Six\\"!!!","review":"One of my favorite games of all time! The other reviews said it all... The graphics and playability are first rate, and the emphasis on good planning, encourages brains more than brawn.One thing not stressed enough in my opinion though, is the great multiplay to this excellent game. The fact that players don't respawn when killed encourages players to play toughtfully and work as a team with other players.It's THE ONLY multiplayer game I have really ,really liked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY very cool\`","review":"This is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. It has graphics equal to N64, and somehow it combines planning and the actual execution of each mission so that it is like two games that work together. Working out the best plan and then going out there and doing it is amazing. The gameplay is so good that even when you know perfectly well that you won't die right where you are, there could be death lurking right around the corner, and your heart keeps beating fast. The only drawback is that fact that on my computer R6 crashes 3 times every level I play (but the fact that I go through this just to play it stands by my assertion that this is very cool) GET THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game is great. Challenging and fun.","review":"I knew I would like this game when I first started playing it. The detail is amazing and well thought out. Only thing is the enemies are kind of dumb. You can shoot one guy. and a guy standing right next to him will just stand there smoking his cigarette. (until he sees you) The missions are fun to plan out and picking your team and equipment gives you a lot of freedom and responsiblity. Training modes help out a little. Over all this game is one that I am happy to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I haven't used it yet, but during unpacking alone i was suprised. The quality of the device itself feels nice, and the design of the upper plastics too. For packing, one plastic container fits in the other, but for cooking, the smaller one goes on bottom making them stack. For single container use, either one fits snugly on the base.Overall this looks like a high quality plastic item, and i look forward to getting to use it.---Adding to this review i i have used this numerous times. I love it. I use it mostly for making rice and corn. It's a good quality steamer, and a nice timer. It keep the food warm when done with occasional steam. I'd recommend this to someone else looking for a good steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold","review":"This product would have been one step up from the previous generation of Oster steamers if it weren't for one very major flaw.Good Points:-it's inexpensive-the electronic timer works really well (this was the new upgrade from previous models)-it's versatile especially for Asian cooking-it works really fastBad Points:- MOLD the steamer's water inlet, that also serves to help you measure how much water is in the steamer, is a great way to collect mold. Currently it is nearly impossible to dry this inlet completely without pushing a qtip or tissue through, and no turning it upside down doesn't help since the inlet's curves are designed to keep water in - which is really stupid.Oster should spend more time testing their products. This should have been fixed before being released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im going to be using this a lot!","review":"First of all this is the 5715 model, the description didnt say so I wasnt sure until it arrived. The first thing I did was make hard boiled eggs to try it out. Im so impressed! In just 18 minutes I had perfect UNCRACKED eggs! This will be a huge help at Easter!! Usually when I boil them half of them crack, and I either overcook or undercook them, no more!The next test was rice, another food that doesnt always turn out good on the stovetop. It was perfect! Now I can use all of those recipes I was scared to try because of having to cook rice in a sticky pot. Im very happy and Id recommend this to anyone who has faced these same issues.Vegetables came out just as well, and I like that I can decrease the timer to make the veggies a little more on the crisp tender side, its how we like them. Then for the kids we can make them a bit mushier, all while retaining those nutrients lost while boiling. I cant wait to use it for fresh veggies from our garden this summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Design Flaw","review":"If you will notice on the bottom right side of the photo there is a see-through chamber to see how much water you've poured in. Great idea. Poor execution. After just one use of this steamer I washed it, dried it, and put it away. The next time I went to use it, I had a very thick layer of mold growing in the see-through chamber. If you live in a humid place, better take a pass on this steamer. There is no way to get inside the steamer and fully dry it out as it is a sealed compartment aside from a small hole that will let water in and out. This is a huge design flaw. So, after one use and a chamber full of mold that I was not able to remove, I ended up dumping this steamer in the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, Healthy Meal in 30 Mins!","review":"My boyfriend bought one of these last night, and we used it to cook salmon and fresh vegetables. All we had to do was prep the veggies, by washing and cutting them, and add some spices to the salmon; then we put it all in, and the whole meal was done in about 30 mins. (OK, HE prepped everything...gotta give him credit.) No need to check on it, no need to stir anything, no hassle at all! I am going to get one for myself, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift well received","review":"I gave this steamer as a gift to a friend. She just loves it and uses it 2-3 times a week to steam veggies for the family. She likes the healthy aspect as well as the convienence. So I find this purchase a sucess story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics failed","review":"We had our Oster 5715 steamer for 4 weeks. On its 5th use the unit failed to operate. I opened it up and could not see anything obvious so I suspect the electronics failed. The unit does have a 1yr warranty but you must have your receipt, which of course we don't have. It is inexpensive enough that the shipping charges are probably not worth it anyway.

There are a few useful tips, but they are wedged between dozens of pages of worthless information.

It simply ignores the mathematical facts. Besides, the approach has nothing scientific: just a personal system that will never work over the long run. Moreover, the author suggest that the house advantage will be waived (another proof of total lack of mathematical knowledge). For understanding how the roulette really works get a book on mathematics of roulette (I recommend Barboianu's book).

Soon I wanted to know more about her brother and also Natalie's flirtation with the police detective. The characters in this book felt so real.

As an introduction on SQL Server workings, it is very good. However, it is also very light on how to actually monitor and tune a real system. The tuning checklist is generic and many of the items are only applicable to designers, not someone who administers databases that may have been in existance for years. If you read the entire book, you can pick out handy items, but it does not give tuning examples, does not tell when to get concerned over particular parameters, nor go into which parameters (from the many supplied by the performance monitor) are really the important ones. As such, I did not find it much help in my daily activities as a DBA. I found \\"SQL Server 2000 for Experienced DBAs\\" by Brian Knight to be much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG This is CHEAP!","review":"This is beautiful looking product but when I took it out of the box and went to stick it in the ground (I'm in New England where every state has a town name Roxbury)I hit a small stone and with very light pressure the rod snapped.

The only complaint, it put a lot of pressure on my ears and it bothered me if I listened to music for longer than an hour. Then after having the headphones for a year, I had the same problem that I had with the first pair. I could only hear music out of one earphone. I take care of my headphones and don't see how this could happen again unless these are not made very well. These are expensive headphones, you expect them to last a long time, but they didn't.

The padding in the ears has flattened totally making them very uncomfortable. The headphone cord has become stiff so that I have to bend it away from my face. The biggest problem that has developed is creakyness. The headphones creak anytime you move. The creaking is loud and unpleasant and resonates inside the headphones.

Vehicle handeling and far from any other racing game, not in a good way. The destruction tactics aren't all that neat, and graphically is disappointing as a PS3 title. I suggest getting a PSONE and playing the original twisted metal before wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"the game never worked","review":"simply because i never got to play it when i got it piece of the drawing on the game was scratch off this game does not work. what would happen here would i get a new one or would i have to carry this further"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this game","review":"This is very boring.

It's like every car is a tank and not a car at all. Graphically, this game is definitely an early gen game. I've seen some people mention online as a redeeming feature, just do yourself a favor and buy Blur if you want a true online experience (no other racer on the market lets you race 20 to a room).If you want some blowing up/action with your racing games, then go with Split/Second (which just had DLC released) or Blur. Don't waste your $10 on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Combat with Style","review":"If you like car combat, this game will fill the bill. Along with multiplayer (online and split screen) the game offers a single player career mode. Racing and battle arena are included. This is a very polished game that has not been given its due. Apparently, the first Full Auto was unpolished with bad controls which has created some negativity with the second game. Though the controls in Full Auto 2 are certainly lose (and we are talking definite arcade here), you get use to them. The graphics are excellent. If you like car combat, you will want to give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was really needed.","review":"It is great to see that atlast there is a bok that can effectivelt the enormous Indian propaganda of defaming Jinnah. This book is realistic and makes the reader understand what Jinnah meant. The Indians will always try to define the creation of Pakistan asif the Muslims of the sub continent were mis-led on the name of religion but this book shows the real face of the Hindus. It shows that what caused Jinnah, a liberal Muslim and an ardent preacher of Hindu-Muslim unity to demand Pakistan. This book exposes the real ,evel face of the Hindus whose extremism and narrow mindedness forced the Muslims of the sub-continent to demand Pakistan.Being a Muslim from India , I am amongst the un-fortunate ones who are still trying to survive against these Hindu extremists who have made hell for all the minorities of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tries to justify without just sticking to facts","review":"Akbar Ahmad doesn't quite face up to the question of what constitutes Islamic identity. It is too much of a justification for Jinnah's politics.

Mr. Ahmed quotes mainly from limited and usually controversial sources. Many of these are more recent biographies and commentries rather than historical accounts from the period itself. When he does mention the exact nature of information, his interpretations strain credibility.So my advice is not to bother and read something different, like Wolpert's several books on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes on too many things at once and Jinnah gets lost.","review":"While the author tries to talk about Jinnah, he also tries to talk about South Asia in the same breath. In addition to that, he tries to portray typical stereotypes about how Muslims are \\"kicked around on the world stage\\" and how Pakistan must accept itself as a \\"lesser partner\\" in South Asia. He takes on too many things at once in no particular order, and then tries to propogate the innuendo that Jinnah fought against. Is that the way to write about the founder of a nation celebrating its fiftieth anniversary? Certainly not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A secular man","review":"Jinnah was a brilliant constitutional lawyer and a secular man. His favorite food was pork sausage and fried potatoes, according to his private secretary. He never once said his namaz or kept fast. His fore fathers were hindu jat, according to Jinnah himself.Mr Akbar's book distorts truth or does not mention inconvenient truth.So it is a very poor history. Also he appears to be bigotted.He draws a parallel between pathans and Mr. Jinnah. That is absurd.He extols the virtues of pathans and puts down other people.Pathans may be courageous but they are also known to be foolhardy. The entire subcontinent is full of pathan jokes that exceeds Polish jokes.Jinnah was a cleam shaven modern man, there is no parralel between him and a illterate, bearded,relogious fanatic, marauding pathan.In fact the only attempt on Jinnah's life was made by a pathan.Thia book is poor history, not worthy of a noble character like Jinnah."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very humane and honest view of a man who was a man...","review":"The book is clearly wonderful as noted through the interest of the other readers. However I would like to point somethings out. Jinnah a)Never wished bloodshed b)Wanted a secular state. Pakistan's history maybe chaotic and others may regret it's existence but I for one feel, as do many others(Ihope), that Pakistan is not a failed state...it is a new state; still emerging...and Jinnah, as Akbar Ahmed points out in his book...for all his eccentricities..was and still is the greatest player of the great game that British India ever produced. He was not a god, he was not a villain, he was not wrong. He was just a human being doing what he felt was right and who are we to judge him wrong on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical book for Practicing Engineers","review":"This book discusses most aspects of stormwater hydrology, provides theory of various competing methods, AND many worked examples.

The album is a great disappointment compared to Black Moon - which marked their return after an absence from the recording studio as a trio for more than a decade. It's unfortunate that this could very well be the last studio albums we see from one of the best progressive rock bands to come out of England."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"Whatever you do, do not pay money to hear this record by a once great band. Yes, there are a few decent songs on the record. With the opening song \\"Hand of truth\\" you are fooled into believing that you have a great record before you. The next song \\"Daddy\\", which is one of the most haunting descriptions of child abduction ever written (well, how many people write songs about that), is not bad. Besides that, every song stinks. When you hear the rest of the record you will never believe that this was once one of the most talented bands of their time. Besides \\"Hand of Truth\\" they do not even make an attempt to sound like virtuosos. The song writing is horrible with hardly a trace of melody. Borrow the record from a friend, copy \\"Hand of Truth\\", listen to the rest of the record, and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELP: Erroneous Last Product","review":"A very sad swan song for one of prog rock's greatest bands. Whereas ELP's best albums brought cool and intelligence to prog, this is just AOR drivel like Foreigner, Styx and Loverboy. Indeed ELP was forced by its record label Victory (teetering on bankruptcy) to create the most commercial album possible to save the label. Victory forbade any Emerson keyboard excursions, Lake solo acoustic pieces, or any long songs. The lead track Hand of Truth is fun prog pop, but the rest of the album is just terrible, simplistic AOR. The album stiffed, Victory went bankrupt, and ELP broke up. This album was an embarrassment that neither ELP nor its fans should have to suffer through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome back my friends to the shame that never ends","review":"30$ for that??!

His less-than perfect heroine is a true-to-life person. She will join the ranks of Harry Bosch as the recalcitrant hero trying to make the world a better place. Give the story a little time to build and you will love the roller-coaster ride to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge Crais by this effort","review":"Robert Crais has written several Elvis Cole novels, which I have read and immensely enjoyed. He has always mixed a good measure of humor with the serious elements of his plots and his characters and made it work. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are the best detective duo since Spenser and Hawk were created. Maybe better. This book is something else altogether. It has a dark plot and even darker characters. The bombers, bombing victims and bomb squad detectives that people this novel are collectively a sad bunch of misfits, cretins, liars and losers. They are all basically unlikable and the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred. I managed to struggle through Demolition Angel, but if this were the first novel by Robert Crais I doubt that I would ever read another. Fortunately, I know for a fact that Crais is one of the very top fiction writers out there, and I will no-less-eagerly await his next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"She lit a fresh cigarette","review":"You could play a drinking game with this book. Slam a shot of gin every time you come across the sentence, \\"She lit a fresh cigarette.\\" That's the one possible way to enjoy this dreary novel.The \\"heroine\\" is an unlikable lush who smokes like a chimney. Her love interest isn't who he claims to be, and by that I mean he's even duller than he appears at first. The bad guy isn't even interesting.The writing is flat and dull. The plot just plods. I listened to this as a book-on-CD and by the end was wishing someone would detonate a car bomb to put me out of my misery.If you have a few spare hours seriously, go stare at the wall before you pick up this dreadful book. Better yet, go light a fresh cigarette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woe was me...","review":"upon completing this book. Unidimensional characters abound in this highly disappointing novel. Had I not read Crais' work before - and enjoyed it greatly - I would have dropped this book mid-read and written it off as an amateurish attempt at a thriller. However, I did complete it and my advice is to save your $."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais has written a winner","review":"This was a very good read. The characters could have been a little more detailed (especially the supporting characters), but they were still very good. Starkey and Mr. Red were both great characters, and Crais does a good job of writing from each of their mindsets.There are plenty of twists to keep you guessing. The action is very good, although I thought there could be more of it. The book slowed slightly during Starkey's investigation, but there are enough surprises to keep you reading and entertained.Overall it's a very entertaining read, with a solid plot. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this a movie yet?","review":"The first book I read by Robert Crais was L.A. Requiem, which I thought was average, but good enough for me to track down other books. This was the first one I grabbed, and I'm glad I did. Demolition Angel grabbed me from the get-go, and I was engrossed all the way to the end. Even when I was able to predict what was going to happen next, further plot developments would turn everything around again. And the ending, although familiar, was wonderfully tense and clever. I'm not sure it deserves five stars, but I've read so many disappointments lately that it was just a nice change to read something pacy, punchy and smart. If this makes it to the big screen without too much tampering (which is probably too much to ask), I'll be the first in line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanding his reach","review":"While not up to the level of his last Elvis Cole- Joe Pike adventure, this new creation allows Crais to go where he has not gone before. The best reads seem to be those that teach the reader something new. Crais educates us about bomb makers, their sources and fetishes. A new female lead shows that Crais is not stuck with one character. His focus in the last two books hints that perhaps he is bored with Elvis, but he is never boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shattering Thriller","review":"If you haven't read Robert Crais you are in for a hair raising ride in the fast lane. Demolition Angel is a pedal-to-the-metal thriller that jolts you from the get-go and dosen't letup until its ahead-on finale. Carol Starkey, an ex-bomb tech, gets reassigned to LAPD's Criminal Conspiracy Section. While battling her inner fears, she embarks on an investigation involving the bomb death of a fellow officer. Caught on an emotional roller coaster, Carol must not only overcome adverse hostillities, but do battle with a demonic mind not seen since Franis Dolarhyde slithered off the pages of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon. Mr. Crais has woven a tale so shocking it will keep you turning pages well into the wee hours of the morning. An unforgettable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book from Robert Crais!","review":"Wow! I have to say that I was a little disappointed that this was not an Elvis Cole novel but all my reservations were cast aside when I read it. I read 176 pages the first night and I had to force myself to put it down. I just loved the story about the Bomb Squad, a mad bomber, a scarred female detective, and the LA backdrop. Buy this book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on You","review":"The heroine is sufficiently unique to grab you from the beginning. Character development takes a while, but once everyone is in place the interaction is very well done. I am looking foward to the movie that is scheduled to be made from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, poor vocabulary","review":"Demolition Angel has a good plot but the disgusting vocabulary detracts from the story. The frequent use of profanity makes the story unbelievable and gets in the way of the suspense at all turns. The author has put together a good plot with the potential for much suspense, and if he had a better vocabulary the book could be riveting. This book could rate 4 or 5 stars if the author knew the English language better and cleaned up the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Explosive Thriller!","review":"Demolition Angel is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of this dark thriller. As to the plot, Crais demonstrates his ability to introduce bombshell after bombshell that, at least figuratively, will \\"blow you away.\\" Crais also creates very strong, credible and interesting characters. Carol Starkey, the main character, while not always very likable, is one of the more powerful and multi-dimensional female protagonists I've come across in quite some time. In many ways she reminds me of Clarice Starling. Further, I guarantee you won't be able to forget \\"Mr. Red.\\" While I rated Demolition Angel 4 stars, I would have liked to be able to give it 4 1/2 stars. It just falls short of a 5-star rating, due to its dragging very slightly in some sections. Demolition Angel is one of the better thrillers I've read in at least the past six months, and is one I'd definitely recommend that you include near the top of your reading list. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking decline in the level of Crais' writing","review":"His last Elvis Cole novel was the best thing Crais has ever written. \\"Demolition Angel\\" is the worst thing he's ever written. All too obviously it's written in a way to try to sell it to the movies. The characters are very broadly drawn, when they're drawn at all (often supporting characters are the faintest of sketches), and the lead character is so brassy and angry that she's repellent. You WANT her to blow up.The situations are simplistic, the plotting pointlessly tricky, the villain utterly unbelievable. AND Crais thinks Tagamet is merely a powerful antacid. He uses lots of Los Angeles street names without capturing anything remotely like the flavor of the city.The book reads as though it was written in a way carefully calculated to make it a best-seller, and completely without the spirit and sense of involvement that he'd been slowly and competently developing in the Elvis Cole series. This is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tension Galore in this one. Moves right along.","review":"4.5 stars for this mover. Once you start, you sure don't want to stop.

But this one about the female dectective they work with, I just could not get into her character, and was ready to borrow a cigarrette just to burn the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read","review":"While I haven't read his other novels, \\"Demolition Angel\\" will have me looking for other Crais novels.I enjoyed the pace of the book, and the technical aspects of the police work were excellent. If you enjoy a faulty hero (or heroine as is the case here), this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Elvis, you will hate Demolition Angel","review":"What a dissappointment. Robert Crais has written a run of the mill suspense novel that could have been penned by any one of a dozen authors in the field. What truly sets him apart from the other \\"M.H. Clark et al\\" crowd is his sense of humor, lovable characters and unique style. This book, however, contains none of these things. None of the characters are even remotely likable, there is no sense of humor in the book, and the plot has the predictable mystery twists that his other thoroughly enjoyable books were fine without. This one was quite a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"I'm a fan of Robert Crais but this book sucks. It's very bad. It drags on and on with an incredibly dissapointing conclusion. Of yeah sure, it's kind of interesting about the bombs, but it was a bad book. This is probably the worst Robert Crais book there is. If you're interested in Robert Crais read the Two Minute Rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stand-alone","review":"this book is actually teetering on the halfway mark between four and five.This is a very good standalone novel from Crais. The plot is good, very original. the writing is as humane as ever, and the writing about the bomb-squad procedures is interesting and well researched.Carol Starkey is a very good character, well developed, and real. There are few male authors who can write accurately form a female perspective, but Robert Crais appears to be one of the exceptions. She is believeable and interesting. I would like to read more books about her. The way her relationship with Pell grows is also really well written and paced. Also, somewhat touching.The conclusion is thrilling and the solution satisfactory.Its good to know that his talents dont just lie with the Pike/Cole series, and that he can write different types of books. Shows range, which is always good.Well done RC, a compelling and well written thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good \\"listen....\\"","review":"I, too, \\"read\\" this book on a Recorded Books, Inc. version by the great Paul Hecht (he did \\"The Shipping News,\\" and made it come alive for me).\\"Angel\\" is a fun story, with oddball characters...Starkey is quite the hard-boiled heroine. I guess if you've been blown apart and come back to life you might just be a little more wary than the average person. The only thing I really objected to was that she was abusive - she socks her would-be lover three times and he (a former FBI agent) barely raises a whimper...call him \\"Whimpy.\\" That reduced his attraction for me. And - I don't believe anyone should ever hit another person, especially someone you think you love. Hello?Other than that, it's well-paced, well-written story and the excitment and intrigue build. Enjoyable. Could be a great action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have been better","review":"Unfortunately, Elvis Cole is not in this novel. Instead we get a new character-former demolition expect and cop, who was so traumatized by the explosion three years ago that she can't exist without booze and pills. Give me a break. He goes on about this woman like she is some tough chick. R. Crais must have led a pretty sheltered life. Story itself is not bad if you don't pay attention to the struggles of the main character and don't count the number of pills she is popping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"As usual, Robert Crais' books are wonderful reads, real interesting stories with twisting plat lines, and the characters and humor are engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"demolition angel","review":"Demolish it, for allI care.

Because this item is unavailable for purchase at this time then I have no way of knowing which version I have been listening to. This isn't very much a review of this album so much as it is just my praising of this song that i truly had the opportunity to judge on it's own merits and not just because of it's association with the Beatles. ...which i do love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Treasure!","review":"This is a great song performed by The Remo Four with George Harrison. George produced this song for the film Wonderwall and it was never released. The song could easily be considered a lost Beatles' track. George plays on it and sings on it . There is an internet rumor that says that possibly Paul is also on the song . I don't know, but it really sounds a lot like a Beatles' recording and a very good one at that! This could have easily been an out take from The Magical Mystery Tour album."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Completist","review":"A lot of money for two mixes of one song. All together, the two tracks have a total running time of 5:55. If it were cheaper, I'd give it one more star.

The song is pretty good. A Procul Harumesque song reminiscent of \\"Blue Jay Way.\\" It features heavily \\"phased\\" recording throughout. I am a big Beatles fan . . . but I cannot tell for sure whether George is singing background vocals. It might be him . . . but it might not.

I have read tarot cards since I was 13 and I have used several different books as references. While many of my tarot reference books stay on the shelf until I need them, I use this book everyday and keep it handy. The interpretations of the cards are insightful and divided by topic whether you are asking about money, career, love, health, or spirituality. When I do readings about relationships it is so wonderful to pick up this book and look at the interpretations for just that, not trying to finesse what the 4 of Pentacles could mean to a romantic question. This book also has over 100 kinds of readings available that are used for Yes/No, past/present/future, deeper readings about life purpose and fun readings about what your ex is thinking about you.

And there is a spread for almost every situation... Once you get the hang of a few of these spreads, you can use this as a guide to build your own spreads for those really specific situations. I would say this is fine as a first book also - the only issue not covered at all is reversed cards, but there are specialist books on this topic when you are ready.

The intensity continues right to the story's end. This is a genuine thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A page turner, but....","review":"A good read for the medical suspense genre, but I was somewhat dissapointed by the lack of credibility for the characters. The egomaniacal chief-of-staff; the evil in spades bad guys; the strong but too-sensitive female lead...extremely broad stokes, but, hey, this is not the place for Dickens or Shakespeare.. enjoy the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain-Dead Fiction","review":"Unless you really, REALLY get into brain surgery as a backdrop for cliched villians, inane dialogue, and the same kind of action done to death by countless other novels, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book!","review":"I usally don't read books such as this but thought to give it a try.

Another example of an author substituting technical knowledge in the medical field for good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid medical thriller","review":"I was new to Michael Palmer as an author when I picked this book up but he did not disappoint. The medical descriptions and dialog are real as they can get without bogging down to much in the details and the character development is excellent. The plot is a bit contrived but still believable. Having a notorious criminal getting an operation to change his appearance is one thing, but to have a known world terrorist operated on for a brain tumor and the lengths he goes to have the delicate surgery was a fresh take on the subject. I could easily see this being made into a movie as it moved along at a good clip, kept you guessing along the way and had a character you'd love to hate (the chief of surgery). The book has several subplots which kept your interest throughout and moved the story along. All in alll a very good read. I'll definitely be reading more of Michael Palmer's books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, But An Abrupt Ending","review":"The book was well-written, with good characters, plotting and dialgue (although I saw the real identity of the criminal well before it was revealed).

Perry's narrative was convincing and thoroughly researched. The book is an excellent read yet I, like the previous reviewer, am puzzled as to why the 'revelation' was not picked up by the press as would have been expected in such cases. I am now even more puzzled. Reading through Christopher Andrew's and Vasili Mitrokhin's book \\"THE MITROKHIN ARCHIVES\\" no mention is made of Rothschild as the Fifth Man.

This can be the only fair assessment as the author does not cite a single reference (although there are many authors in this field and the domain is not new), the methodologies are developed based on what I call \\"farmer math\\", and the supporting logic for the methodologies is fraught with logical errors, fallacies and oversimplifying assumptions. This book was written for clients as a marketing tool, was not peer reviewed by people knowledgeable in the field, and was printed by an unreputable publisher (visit their website at [...] and you'll find a website selling storage sheds!).There are many books out there that are clearly written and have methodologies that won't get you into trouble.

You will travel into a world within the moon's interior as you ride along with Benjamin St. John in an attempt to find his equivalent of a holy grail. Ben is helped and hindered along the way by a small number (not including mass quantities of mechanical bad guys) of human and not so human characters. This small cast allows the pace of the story to approach light speed. Thankfully the author forces you to breathe frequently with the use of a sarcastic wit that would make Twain proud. (Mark, not Shania.) If laughing out loud embarrasses you then reading \\"Descent\\" in a public place should be avoided. In all grail quests these questions exist. Is the hero (Ben) worthy enough to find what he is looking for and if so is he worthy enough to keep it? By the end of your adventure you may have an answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job, Peter","review":"You have captured the true world of descent. I am very pleased to have read your book.

The problem is they are much too messy. The pellet floats for 3 seconds and then sinks rapidly. It then expands within 10 seconds and begins to fall apart. And with shrimp pulling at it, and tetras ripping at it, it COMPLETELY falls apart into dust, which then gets kicked up into the water, falls through the gravel..... ewww.

In a matter of seconds in the tank they will begin to \\"puff up\\" and get soft, and start making a mess of your substrate. Even with the fish eating them, they can't keep it under control and just tend to create even more of a mess. These things will surely make a mess of your tank in no time if you don't clean up after your fish or if you don't under feed. If you are having any sort of health-oriented problem in your tank, from ammonia in the water to algae, one of the first things I'd do is stop feeding this stuff and start feeding a quality, clean food like any number of other pellets available by other companies.These are best avoided, only use them if you are in a pinch or to offer something different on a rare occasion for your fish. I'll never buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingredient list is incorrect.","review":"The first ingredient in these pellets is wheat!!! I'm looking at the package right now. WHEAT????

I enjoy mystery, suspense, and intertwined romance like everyone else but this was lame, lame, lame. The characters were beyond superficial. If you hadn't read the previous books by this author which featured some of these characters, you were totally clueless about Eve, her adopted daughter Jane, what happened to Bonnie, etc. So you felt like you were truly in the dark. And the dog/wolf romance - come on! The romance didn't sizzle, and the story line was preposterous. I don't think the attention this author is getting from the public is warranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must love dogs and cheesy romance","review":"Do you like romance novels? Do you call your dogs your babies? This is the book for you. The thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge.

Two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanatastic Suspense Novel","review":"This is a gripping suspense novel.

Maggie said, \\"The guy that took her, I think he wants to deal with the police for money.\\" The guy said, \\"I want to make a trade for one million dollars tomorrow at six o'clock at her school.\\" I really don't like the book because it's really boring and I'm not interested in it.

I read the back of The Search and it seemed like a quick and easy read. I was right! This is a great, quick jaunt into suspense. The plot is a fast-paced thrill ride from beginning to end. I enjoyed the story and I will give Johansen a try again someday. This is a great book for a plane ride or beach trip or anyplace you just need to escape and discover a thriller that won't let you down. I have to admit there were scenes that made me tense up like a good suspense plot should. This is a great weekend excursion if you need time away from the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never come across anything as bad as this","review":"Read the reviews before you buy any of the Eve Duncan books - borrow one from the library if you must - it doesn't matter which one - they're all equally bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get enough of Sara and Monty","review":"This was my first Iris Johansen Book.

For one thing it covered a subject that I love and have an affinity for - search and rescue dogs. But instead I found the book stiff and not believable. There seemed too many loose ends, and some things in the book didn't make any sense. I also found the writing simplistic and the suspense was not developed - it never seemed to keep my interest anyway. Maybe it's the genre - I'm not a fan of romantic suspense, and that should have kept me away from this book. But read it I did, and I did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. I was expecting a murder mystery thriller.

I love Iris Johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one, almost as if she were forced to do so. It contained none of her usual style.

I'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical IJ style."},{"rating":"1","title":"authors should either know their topic or research carefully","review":"Its obvious that the author knows very little about Columbian forests or gunfights or poker or dogs. This book might charm readers who enjoy romances and who have never been in a jungle, never played poker, never gave thought to the way battles are actually fought and have no experience working with dogs. I normally enjoy books about dogs, but I made the mistake of reading The Search immediately after reading one of Susan Conant's mysteries. Susan Conant's dogs have personality and seem real.

It just doesn't grab you. The story-the heroine being forced into a search mission by the hero-an unscrupulous businessman-uninteresting, and not inducable to wanting to continue the story.The hero is your typical hero for some romances-tough, self made millionaire-but this guy is a user, and will use any means necessary to get what he wants-not a high recomendation for a romantic hero.the heroine is bland and one dimensionable-and that's saying something for a modern heroine that is a search dog rescuer for the ATF! Her \\"psychic\\" connection is a bit far fetched the way it's written.The biggest miss was the dialog-flat and dull. The interplay is very repetitive and simplistic.1 star and hopefully another Johanson will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Search","review":"Having previous read and enjoyed Iris Johansen's books with the Eve Duncan character, I was very disappointed with this offering. In her previous books when she introduced the John Logan character, I had mixed feeling about him. I felt like he was supposed to be a likeable good-guy character and he just doesn't come off that way to me. I just don't like the guy or care about him. The Monty (dog) and Maggie (wolf) romance was so completely stupid and unbelievable,that I almost shut the book right then and there. This book was BORING, BORING, BORING. Never did figure out what \\"search\\" the title was even talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very thrilling . . . .","review":"This was my first Iris Johanson book (actually I listened to the audio tape). I did not find this to be much of a thriller -- in fact it is nothing more than a mediocre romance. The plot was contrived, unbelievable and the story just did not sustain my interest. I didn't care for Cynthia Nixon's narration -- she portrayed Sarah as a whiny woman with a huge chip on her shoulder, and Logan as a macho idiot. The best and most likeable character was Monty, the dog (although the dog/wolf story was totally ridiculous!) My advice is not to bother with this one. Since I only listened to this while exercising, it wasn't too much of a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This was a great book.

The suspense and romance marry together quiet well in this book its worth looking out for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. I loved how Monty and Sarah were able to communicate. I think all dog lovers wish they could have a bond like that.

I look forward to other books with Sarah and Monty."},{"rating":"1","title":"feminist propaganda","review":"Give me a break. I can't believe this book has gotten such positive reviews--well its a free country! From the beginning, the book seems to be uninspired. A woman and her dog (a very smart and sensitive dog) are forced into a search--in the Colombian jungles-- for the kidnapped employee of a billionaire buisnessman. Now, just think with me for a moment. If I were a billionaire would I be so all fired ready to force a woman and her dog to find my kidnapped employee? I don't think so. I think if I were a billionaire who wanted to find someone in the jungles of Colombia, I would hire an ex-navy seal or army ranger to do the job. But of course, in our times, feminism finds many outlets in fantasy and illusion (such as THE SEARCH) because in the real world, women are not sent into jungles with a dog to find a kidnapped employee. Instead, good old fashioned rugged men are sent into that kind of situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Search - Found It's Mark","review":"Iris Johansen's \\"The Search\\" is fabulous. The intertwining of several story lines keeps the listener riveted. Unlike many other mystery books, this one has realistic plots and happenings and constantly keeps the listener on edge. I love the fact that it was challenging to anticipate what would happen next. An A++++ book that I highly recommend. I can't wait to listen to all of Johansen's others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I finished this book in about 5 hours primarily because as another reviewer noted, the book had to be stretched to make 384 pages. While I have enjoyed Johansen's books in the past, this latest one (as well as the one introducing Sarah Parker) was extremely disappointing. I'm sorry I paid to get a hardcover. While the plot had potential, the relationship between Parker and Logan was superficial at best. Without a lot of character development, it stretched credibility to believe that Logan would fall in love with Parker in the span of a week or so. I really like both of these characters and would look forward to a good book about them. The cover jacket states that Johansen is working on another book. I'll be more cautious next time and wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little to do with Eve","review":"This is one of those rare books that is very hard to put down because it is very good with many twist and turns. You just have to find out what happens next. It makes you want to decide which one you want to start next because you want it to be as good as the one you just finished. It makes dialysis go by very fast. I'm very thankful for that. It does give me time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for Suspense/Thriller fans","review":"I would recommend you read the previous books by Ms. Johansen (involving John Logan and Eve Duncan) before reading The Search. I liked this book thought the plot was great. However, I thought alot of detail was left out. I would have liked more information on why certain things happened near the end.

I had only uncomfortable experience from half life.This game is a typical example of technically biased game but totally lack of sense of beauty. The reputation seems to come from game industry that wants to simply sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Half Life is the best computer game","review":"I think that Half Life is the best computer game thats ever been made. If you likeed Goldeneye for Nintendo 64 you will like Half Life much better. It has meany diffrent levels and has meany diffrent weapons, it also has multiplayer over the internet. If you don't like the graphics on Half Life you should get a 3DFX Card (witch Amazon.com has in the electronics section). You don't half to take my word for it, but if you do you will be vary pleased (note : this game contanes violance such as blood and guts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, but after giving Half-Life a try (thanks to all of the glimmering reviews), I am absolutely hooked. From the opening tram sequence, you're mesmerized by Gordon Freeman's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him. It's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of sunlight (apologies to my wife!). After dishing out punishment to those Marines, be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes. The fun gets even better, and the taste of death is even sweeter when you blow apart that guy with 196 kills. Half-Life is truly a work of art. Opposing Forces, here I come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh. My. God.","review":"Revolutionary. This is one of the best games I ever played. The skeletal movement system and A.I. make for a very awesome time. It's long and kind of boring in some parts, but its really fun. I recomend Blue Shift and Opposing Force, as they add to the fun and tie together nicely with the story. The High-Def models that come with BS are ok, but I found out that the ones at http://ambientimpact.hl-improvement.com/index.htm were better because they have moving eyes, 5 fingers, and a much higher poly count.

It has raised the bar in every category save graphics, and the only titles currently in release that can top it in that category are those based on the Unreal Engine (the release of Quake III is liable to change that). No longer are FPS's mindless \\"Kill everything that moves\\" frag-fests. Half-Life is completely immersive, totally creepy, and brilliantly designed. As close to perfect as an action title will most likely ever be. This game more than deserves the rating given to it by PC Gamer magazine: Greatest Game Ever Made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick, twisted...I love it!","review":"This game is definitely a hundred steps past Quake and others of its type. The AI is great. The evolving story is great. The fight against the Special Forces team is nerve wrackingly great. However, all this greatness became stale, I never bothered to finish the game.

Every page of Fierce crackles, every paragraph sizzles, and every sentence strikes out. If you're never read Robbins, be prepared for original characters, an unusal gift for language and metaphor, and plot that...doesn't begin to describe the STORY. If you have read Robbins before, the same wit and storytelling ability shines through like a flashlight in our midnight. He points a finger at our culture's hypocritical taboos and beliefs but with a soft touch shows our best sides. Switters, the main character, is unparalled in depth and contradiction, the man who holds innocence aloft while wanting to take his young step-sister's virginity, who hates violence but carries a Berretta, and who believes in justice yet works for the CIA. Gel your hair down and be prepared to be carried around the world in Robbins latest novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book to buy","review":"I feel I must say that I have purchased ALL this author's other works. However...The main character in this book possesses un-redeemable virtue when we learn, in the first 50 pages, that he lusted after his step-sister when she was 12 years old and he was 31. He keeps her training bra...she is now 16. He engages in sexual acts with her, including an under the table fondling at a family gathering. This is repulsive and inappropriate, and is not a passing fancy for the character, but is returned to again and again.If you want to read about child sexual-abuse, which this is, then try it. I'm just glad I borrowed my copy, and didn't pay for it.As a trained counsellor, I have told others to avoid and not purchase this book. I predict a short life on the lists, especially with women readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention English Teachers","review":"Save yourself time and money. Read the summary above for the so-called story. Switters is an uninteresting, alcoholic pedophile with a fascination for run-on sentences and strings of useless adverbs and adjectives. A high school English teacher will recognize the style, (or lack of it). Imagine a 5,000 word essay assignment. The child is stuck at 4,000. He then uses the built in Thesaurus on his word processor, and strings as many adverbs and adjectives together to get to 5,000.

I usually feel a dutiful responsibility to finish every book I start, let alone one I've invested myself into for several hundred pages.

Then came Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, which, although it felt a bit like Mr. Robbins felt that he had to write SOMETHING, still had that old magic about it. Now comes Fierce Invalids. The characters are not only two dimensional and anoying, but one (Masked Beauty) is straight out of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. The plot is ridiculous, but not quite ridiculous enough, and then the ending is--of all things-- astoundingly safe. Now, the man can write, and that talent has not waned a bit since Another Roadside Attraction, but he seems to be only writing because it's his job. This is too bad, because his talent remains remarkable and unmatched. Would that the muse of inspiration would once again fall upon him. I have confidence that she will, but until then, we have to deal with the likes of Switters and Suzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Life Properly; Lightness-Darkness; God vs The Church","review":"This, for me, is Robbin's finest hour. He takes the reader on a trip to explore the nature of God, the separate reality and function of The Catholic Church, CIA angels and cowboys, and then into what Einstein and Ying and Yang are about such that we can actually understand them. For desert, he gives us a way to live life unlike most every other path that folks take, such that no matter what, one cannot help but enjoy their ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"the last great Tom Robbins novel","review":"Gratitude is all I can express for this book, TR's 7th and ultimately the last of his truly great works.

I kept waiting for the novel to jell. It never did. I would have enjoyed another 100 pages to bring things back together.

Where are characters that I can care about like Bonanza Jellybean or the Chink?I'm a hundred pages into it, and have yet to read anything that gives me hope.

It can't be good that I was seriously wishing the protagonist would just get killed, in a painful way if possible.

It seemed Tom was trying to normalize his main character's serious sickness by repeatedly (and I do mean repeatedly since he has to say everything 4 or 5 times in this book) explaining that it's all society's fault that 36 year olds aren't supposed to sleep with 15 year olds. So that's gross.

Such a person winds up coming off as not knowing much.Tom Robbins knows much, but feels the need to type every nano-thought he has. If anyone has a moustache, you can be sure that an essay on lip hair isn't far off. If he stares out a window, a meditation on windows is just around the corner.If comedy is all about timing, Robbins is the comedian who barrages his audience, assaulting them. It's like a heavy metal guitar solo. Lots of notes, played fast, but hardly musical.I dug \\"Roadside,\\" \\"Jitterbug,\\" \\"Woodpecker,\\" et all... years ago. Now, Robbins' writing reads like the novel Frasier Crane would write.It's too bad, because I really had good memories of those earlier books.I won't revisit them, however, for I suspect that the style I enjoyed then might prove irritating now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queer, odd... fantastic","review":"Fierce Invalids is the pot of gold under the rainbow.

I really loved it, almost as much as \\"Jitterbug perfume\\". Nevertheless, I have a small suggestion to make. The preposition \\"pro\\" in ancient greek - as in modern for that matter - means \\"before\\" and not \\"on behalf of someone\\", which would be the latin meaning of the said preposition.

The quality of this book could easily be compared to Cowgirls, as well as Jitterbug Perfume, and Still Life with the WoodPerk.

Gene Stone's book is not just a collection of Bush-isms and insult gags, however. It has an ultimately serious side--a Bush second term IS guaranteed to be disastrous for our country, after all. Stone offers some words of comfort and seems to truly believe that there are still many reasons for the American populace to feel a level of optimism about the country's future. Although an upbeat outlook on life at this moment in time might seem a tad naive, it is a refreshing view nonetheless in the midst of all the current wailing and whining from the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS FOR PURPOSE, TWO FOR EXECUTION","review":"I voted for Kerry and support everything that exposes the most regressive and destructive administration in U.S. history. This book, however, was a disappointment.

Even though the book is a more than a bit extreme, I can see the book being useful some weeks and even months after the election, after that i find it useless. Personally the author seems like a an overly bitter democrat who's letting out some aggression that exploded after the 2004 election. I myself sympathize with the author and share some sentiments but some of the stereotypes were just too much and over the top to appreciate.

As soon as I popped it into my player I was greeted to one of the most uplifting songs I've heard, Mystery Land, and I tell you the fun never stops and the mix never lets up. It always keeps you on your toes and never goes tooo overboard. Oakie gives about 5-6 minutes for each song and I have to say that there is positivly no bad songs on Resident. Every single one is great to dance to. The crowd noises in the background are a nice touch and to me add alot to the mix. It makes it seem like it is live (but it's not). I have to agree with the last reviewer that Shine has to be one of the most beautiful songs. So if you like vocal trance then you are sure to enjoy this CD. It might seem alittle pricey but I'm telling you I would honestly pay twice the price for this true gem. If you like Oakie you have to like Resident (it's a rule)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful set from Oakenfold","review":"I own 2 or 3 copies of this and just bought the import.

It has everything necessary to be a wonderful game.

The Credits appear long before the game is over and the Witch at the conclusion seems to last forever.I can't complain about anything in this game. There is a training programme at the start which continues into the game and makes sure you know how everything works. The rhyming is very funny and every inch of the game is explorable. Nothing then to complain about the game, unfortunately though it was marketed as a furry teddy bear game and it's much more than this.

This is the coolest game I've ever seen. When I was younger, I used to play Commander Keen, but this beats it hands down. The plot promotes good family values (Banjo is saving his sister, Tooty, from a witch), and there aren't any gory graphics, like blood or guns. Banjo uses eggs as ammunition, so the violence isn't so bad. It really tests your wits and intelligence in games. If you don't have it already, what are you waiting for?

Banjo-Kazooie is good for the Adventure/Puzzle lovers. The only thing that get's disturbing though, is that you cannot leave with musical notes. (-1 Star)Kids and Adults alike will LOVE this game, the game itself startsout slow with the opening cutscene, but as soon as you controll Banjo, the game's excitment starts. Banjo and Kazooie's adventures into Gruntilda's Castle and Worlds make you never want to end the game. The game's Climatic end battle include children comedy with Gruntilda's rymes, and her comedic broom. Look out for Gruntilda's sister, BRENTILDA, she'll give you hints for before the final battle.

This was my second Panasonic Shaver, both of them lasted just a little longer than a year, before they became virtually unusable.

Partly because of the cover, partly because the bookseller had turned it out on the shelf. Partly because I had watched up close the terrible events of that terrible day. But I was not disappointed by this taut and at times poetic tale of the condo dwellers, each with their peculiar fates. The novel is not about 9/11, and it is not mawkish or sentimental. Nor is there anything exploitive about the treatment of the World Trade Center tragedy. Instead, I found it very life affirming. The characters were vivid and powerful and easily formed themselves in my imagination. The writing is elegant and simple, and reading the book took no effort at all. I wondered where Rinaldi had come up with the names of some (all?) of the characters, which sounded improbable to me and a little distracting. But that's just me. All in all, I would highly recommend this as a rewarding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished it but.......","review":"This is my first ever review, and it's because I feel quite strongly about this book.

Readers should note that less than half the novel is set aboard the ship...the rest in London and rural England. But I don't want to sound too harsh.

The story is compelling, the dialogue is prefect and, days later, you'll find yourself wondering what became of Prudence after the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"I was very disappointed. I thought this was supposed to be a romantic comedy. I had to stop a few times wishing it will get better but it didn't. I like the premise of the plot but as I continue to read, I started to hate the main character. The story continued without any substance and the ending was abrupt, almost an afterthought as if the author have to write a \\"hopeful\\" ending just to please those of us who want the HEA. I regretted having wasted my time and I wished I listened to the advice of the other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"the wife of reilly","review":"This book was very funny and extremely unlikely. She pulled it off tho. I did not like the character but she actually had you rooting for her to succeed and be happy even tho she was very shallow and vain, borderline narcissistic! It was nice that she brought the new york culture into the book, a bit sex in the city. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wife Of Reilly","review":"Very entertaining and quite well written. It is also a good look into what could be used as a life lesson. My only criticism is that things are a bit too decided for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book...","review":"I wanted to like this book, but it was ...just truly awful. This sounded like a great premise - wife has found someone else and wants to find a replacement wife for her husband.Based on the reviews I thought it would be sort of madcap crazy, but funny. What a disappointment!! It was just clunky, with dumb people and totally implausible situations. The heroine, Prudence was unlikeable. I deleted it from my Kindle, but regret the time I spent reading and hoping for it to get better and start making sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I'd call \\"Chick Lit\\"","review":"I read this book, because it was in my \\"funny chick lit\\" list. There are reviews in Amazon and on the cover by other \\"funny chick lit\\" writers, Marian Keyes and Jane Green, who's books are funny & romantic. This wasn't.The main character is a shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant (rich, but that's cool) figure. She schemes to divorce a nice guy she's been married to for 11 years to get engaged to a creep she dated in college. She matures at the end. Goodness!Who would read this book? It's not a self-help for shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant women who wouldn't waste their time on this type of book anyway, and wouldn't see themselves in it even if they did read the book. It doesn't add anything delightful, entertaining or even enlightening. Not worth its \\"chick lit\\" tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"With Friends Like This...","review":"The prose is well written, but the protagonist is absolutely unlikable. The problem is not that she's flawed. The problem is that she is incredibly self-involved and self-serving. Her behaviors are cruel to others.This isn't a horrible book, but I was left wondering why anyone would choose to be friends with this woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I don't understand all the glowing, positive reviews. Well, yes, the book was well written and the characters developed somewhat well. But he main character, Prudence, what a despicable human being. I couldn't even connect with her on any level. none whatsoever. She is totally self absorbed, only barely finds herself by the end of the book, and is the most selfish person ever depicted. Thank God I got this as a free book, I would have been sorely disappointed otherwise. I skipped through many paragraphs of uninteresting and unnecessary dialogue about the characters inane lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many great things about the author. However, I was sorely disappointed. The protagonist, Prudence, was COMPLETELY unsympathetic and selfish. The plot was asinine to the point of being entirely unbelievable. I only finished it because I was so desperately hoping for it to get better, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this one.................","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews on here, and was highly disappointed. The main character was very shallow and one-dimensional. It was a struggle for me to get through the book, and after I had, I wished I wouldn't have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Embedded Flashbacks","review":"I rarely give up on books, but this one had me beat after only 7% in. It wasn't only that I didn't like the main character. In fact, I kind of liked that I hated the woman because I wanted to see what the author would do to redeem such a horrible person. No, what turned me off were the flashbacks embedded in flashbacks and the complete improbability of the story (the woman returns to U of M football game twelve years after she graduated and, out of a crowd of tens of thousands of people, just happens to be sitting two rows over from the man she once dated in college?) The anti-parenting diatribe at the beginning pushed me over the edge.I wanted to like this book because I thought the premise and cover was cute. Also, I love reading books about my home state. Unfortunately, I just couldn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I couldn't even finish this book it was so boring. To many details about nothing. Sure it was free, now I know why. I really tried to finish this book but onlu reach the 5 chapter and I couldn't go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was Worth The Wait","review":"I have been waiting for this book for months. I heard about it ages ago - even received emails from the author about it. I have been patiently waiting for it and I wasn't disappointed. I completely and totally LOVED \\"The Wife of Reilly\\" by Jennifer Coburn. This new addition to the long line of chick lit books hits the mark in so many ways. I loved the crazy and different story line - the amazing character development - the wonderful tone/vocabulary/and humor. Ms. Coburn has a wonderful talent for storytelling and I can't wait for more romantic comedy's from her and the chick lit genre is right up her talented alley.Great book to start off the New Year - it's quick and hilarious. What more could you want? Highly Recommended.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"Flawed, always in a frenzy, fabulous character in Prudence, the heroine. The book is actually part 1 and part 2. I liked part 2 a lot when she starts to realize who she is and what she had done to end up where she is. Her friends are really great, anyone would be lucky to have a bunch like that. Maybe some spin off books about them would be really fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to give this any stars at all?","review":"God, this sucked. Sucked so bad - I got 2 chapters into and had to stop reading. I have never stopped reading a book. Kept thinking - maybe it turns into a good story. Nope - dumb idea, stupid characters - I should write a book - because - it looks like there are handing out book contracts at the 7-11.Handed it off to a friend - she reads anything - and she put it down after 3 chapters....Don't bother with this dribble."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN UNDENIABLE CLASSIC","review":"As my first foray into chick-lit, I wondered (fearfully) what to expect -- and got a heck of a lot more than I bargained for! Weeks later, I still laugh out loud at the images the author conjured up. With her effortless writing style, she managed to have me simultaneously laughing out loud and thinking \\"Oh, this is so true.\\"This book was much more than a non-stop laugh-riot (which it is!) -- it's a story that every person can identify with on many levels. I will read \\"The Wife of Reilly\\" again and again, and certainly find something new, funny, and insightful with each reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"~ A Fun Read ~","review":"I got an e-mail from Jennifer Coburn letting me know about her book, I am so glad that she told me about it I loved reading it Prudence had me laughing so much, I had went with my husband to go play cards and of course I took this book to read, I could not help to laugh out loud and everyone kept looking at me, I didn't care because I was having so much fun with this book. I loved Prudence she is a breath of fresh air I also loved her friend Chad, I wish I had a friend like him. Thanks for Jennifer for a great read.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"There was absolutely nothing to like about this character - a selfish, self-absorbed woman with major Daddy issues. This book cost me nothing and was worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"What I enjoy about Jennifer Coburn's writing is that her story lines have a \\"fresh\\" twist to them. They are funny, romantic, intriguing, everything that I'm typically looking for in a book, but her story isn't the same old story! It has something new and fresh to it, which is amazing! Please keep writing Miss Coburn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!! AWESOME!!","review":"I have purchased this book a while ago on my Kindle and finally decided to read it. I could not but this book down! I could not stop laughing at some parts, like when Reilly came home to a gallery of women for him or when she is talking to Matt's best friend. I have not had a laugh out laugh book in a long time, but now Jennifer Coburn is one of my favorite authors. It is a perfect mix of comedy, romance, and drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not stop reading...","review":"Thought this was going to be a silly, predictable quick light read at first. After the first few chapters I was hooked. Funny, sad and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so disappointed in this book","review":"Reading the book description and reviews I had high hopes for this book. I was expecting a funny entertaining read, unfortunately it was anything but that. Another reviewer said the \\"the main character in the book is self-centered, immature and just plain awful\\" and I have to agree wholeheartedly. She realy is an idiot. There is NO ONE on earth that could possibly be diluted enough to have the same ideas, thoughts and plans as this woman. I thought that maybe once she finally told her husband she wanted a divorce, everything would get better.... but it didn't.I'm the kind of person that finishes every book I start, even if I don't particularly like it. This book is so awful, boring and honestly just stupid, I can't even finish it. I bought the book in March and have been trying to read it every since. I read 80% and I just can't go on, it's too bad. There really aren't enough negative things I could possibly say. If I could give the book 0 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure","review":"I have not finished this book yet but I would have to just say that I am reading just to see what happens. I can't start a book and not finish it. It is not one of my favorites and it is not a bad book but for me it doesn't flow and pull me in like other books have. Read at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book!","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but the more I read the more I hated it. I'm still trying to figure out what the story line was. Maybe that her dad leaving her mom for his pregnant mistress really screwed her up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different read from most","review":"The premise is not the 'same old, same old' for romance stories. It hit you on all emotions. I did not think it was hilarous by any means, but after about 3/4 the way through, I could not put it down. The moral of the story is the grass is not always greener....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This women is a disgrace","review":"Women like this deserve nothing in the end. But being a story she made out ok. The only part I laughed at was her car ride with her fiance best friend on their trip to the ski resort. Don't read this story unless you can relate to cheating on your loved ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the last page!","review":"I very much enjoyed this novel! Jennifer Coburn takes an unrealistic event and makes it totally plausible. The characters were well developed and real. The dialogue was realistic and very funny. I loved the writer's still of including the actual thoughts of the main character vs. what she actually said. This book was good to the last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed! My bad!","review":"modern fable about a very superficial girl who learns to be her own best friend. tragicomedy--you will laugh but feel sheepish about it. this is a book you know your sister will love, but you wouldn't think of giving it to your mother--she would be shocked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting funny","review":"I kept hoping this book would get better better but it did not.The plot line sounded good but it feel flat one it's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type","review":"Did not like it at all.

I really did. I just couldn't bring myself to get more than a third through the book. I just couldn't find anything to like about the main character.

Maybe the story is funnier later, but it's not so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Really, Really Bad","review":"What an absolute piece of garbage.

I read the entire book in awe of how awful someone could be! Kind of like a train wreck! The heroine was self absorbed,beyond reasoning!

If I could rate a minus star- it would be minus 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this, but...","review":"the main character was SO self-absorbed, and didn't exhibit any growth. It's not really a romance -- more women's fiction or chick lit. Prudence is really shrewish and her friends are so cardboardy that I finally forced myself through the end and was left with a sense of \\"meh.\\" I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, though I might try another of Coburn's books, just to see if this was a one-off and her others are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, delightful, easy read","review":"I LOVED the Wife of Reilly, and am going to recommend it for my book club. After some pretty heavy-duty books, this is just what we need to restore our humour and levity.The whole \\"dating\\" sequence -- from dinners with losers and drinks with neurotics, to the delightful Yasmine, to huge parties with life size cutouts -- had me in stiches and endeared me to Prudence (the main character)even more.

Wow, I didn't know what I was missing, Loved it!","review":"The Wife of Reilly made for some great entertainment!!! This book just seemed to flow. It was an easy read that held my attention from the start to finish. The characters were colorful, exciting and fun. The main character Prudence, was very likable, and had me pulling for her to find happiness with her re-kindled new love.I loved reading about the adventures of Prudence going on dates with all of the potential new wives for her soon to be ex-husband Reilly.I normally don't read \\"chick lit\\", but this was well worth it.Coburn has a great style for writing, and I would definitely read other books by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY WORKS !!!!","review":"This really works and it is heavy duty compared to most of the ones i have seen.....and not as easy to shock yourself....just the bugs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very powerful but dangerous","review":"This swatter can kill very large bugs because it holds a larger voltage difference than other electric swatters (I know because there are 3 different brands at my work).However, the other two swatters have the protective screen.

The couple in the documentary lived in my community. My mom sold Avon to Mary Jane Jordan, the woman in the documentary; she was one of the sweetest ladies I've ever known. Two of her daughters have been my teachers, and one of her granddaughters was a close friend. I wrote this review so that you would not only know that the film is fabulous and truly heartfelt but that the people are REAL. They are real people with real emotions, and this documentary captures all their very real feelings and reactions in the toughest of times. I highly recommend it to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating for some...","review":"This is a sensitively made story of the 'retirement' of a midwestern farm. It is personal, told by a filmmaker who is part of the family.... but there is a lot here that is true of many family farms. One can get a feeling for how many problems there are for modern farmers to face, and also family issues that arise when there is a major change for elderly parents. There is a lot to enjoy here, it's beautifully shot... this was right up my alley. But maybe not for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect.","review":"It is in reallity a 5 star issue, for it gives you both the ways: from simplified to traditional and vice-versa.

I found the book to be very inspiring and several of Mrs. Garcia-Prats' suggestions have stayed with me. This book reinforces the belief that expecting your children to help with siblings or around the house and be responsible for their own behaviour does not make you a bad parent. In fact, it makes you a good one. If the Garci-Prats can do it with 10 kids, I think my husband and I can handle our 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete, inspiring and well written!! I loved it!","review":"The Garcia-Prats have written a complete guide to the secrets of raising and being a terrific family.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is committed to raising responsible, caring children in today's crazy world."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but too preachy","review":"I was hoping to find more practical, hands-on suggestions, but there were too many references to prayer, trust in God, etc. That's fine and I'm glad it works for them, but I want more problem-solving solutions, in the vein of case studies and postulates, rather than anecdotes and answered prayers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Like Fun DVD Review","review":"My son was screened and found to have a delay in his L and R sounds. THe delay was not significant enough to qualify for services, so I was interested when I saw this DVD. The Demonstration section describes where the lips and tongue need to be (I never thought about the tongue being used to make sounds other then a TH sound). The Fund Activities section tells a number of things my son can do to exercise and strengthen his tongue. He is sounding better. I know he can make the sound when we concentrate on a word by itself. I like the DVD format of this - we can go right to the part we want without fast forwarding or rewinding a video tape. I recommend this DVD to parents of primary school-age kids but also infants and toddlers (there are some great suggestions to help kids develop sounds). I wish I had this four years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer","review":"David Trotter is one of the most intellectually adventurous literary historians going.

Hopefully returning to it to remind them how life has its bright spots that we need to hold on to, just like I have for all these years. This is some of the greatest music I have heard in my life.

I highly recommend the \\"Letting Go Meditation\\" on Disc 1 and the \\"Relaxation Exercise Designed to Help Insomnia\\" on Disc 2 (especially if, like me, you have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping through the night).

What is more essential than keeping your health?

He treats it all with a delicate but firm touch - the relationship of a father and betrayed son, betrayed country (by politicians and spies), the corruption of power; this book covers a multitude of sins, including some great sex scenes - Kanon really does those well. Alan Furst's books are getting more and more soft and fuzzy; Kanon keeps the hard edge of reality. And in the end, a satisfying, somewhat redemptive ending - just as you might get in real life. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Spy Story","review":"This is by now the fourth Kanon novel I've read. I've liked them all. He builds his story slowly, carefully, and generously, so that the characters are well fleshed out and the situations comprehensible and interesting. This tale contains no incredible heroics, or just barely, but picks up momentum so that the second half is a real page turner.A feature of all Kanon's novels is that the setting is thoroughly researched and vivid. You can follow the action on a map if you have one, and, in the case of the only one I can personally validate, Los Alamos, you will find all the details to be accurate. For The Prodigal Spy the principal settings are London, Prague and Washington DC, 1950 and 1969."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Engaging","review":"This was one of the most intelligent and engaging espionage novels I have read. I rate this as highly as I would Ludlum's Bourne Identity. If the McCarthy era intrigues you, I think you will enjoy this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable outcome with lost potential","review":"I feel a need to warn those readers who don't read past the first few reviews to take your time before ordering this book. While Kanon's first book, Los Alamos, may not have won prizes for literary writing, it was intelligent, creative and instructive. The Prodigal Spy had so much potential. The story could have happened, the characters could have been real. But the final result: hackneyed dialogue, unbelievable characters, and an ending I guessed after the first chapter. The best parts: the lasting pain of the McCarthy hearings, a reminder of FBI abuses, and the excellent descriptions of eastern Europe. Keep trying, Mr. Kanon.

You're a bandicoot and jump on / spin baddies you encounter. This game is kind of like old Mario games, but has awesome graphics. They've added a type of box to the prequel and give one move, such as bazooka or tornado death spin, for each boss. The game is easy to beat, but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly. It's extremely difficult to collect all of them.

I love the grilled taste and how it cuts the fat, so I figured I'd try this model since it doesn't have the bun warmer and it's the bestseller, and wha la this model is perfect, they're are others with removable grills for washing but this is great for the price, it comes with two soft sponges for cleaning and a plastic spatula, the only bad thing is it isn't that big you can barely fit two hamburgers on it, it cooks real fast though, also I wouldn't recommend cooking steaks on it, it can get really messy, it's perfect for hamburgers and hot dogs though, George Foreman is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill Size & Floating Hinge are NOT TRUE","review":"This is my second George Foreman grill.

The book is a pastiche of regurgitated generic aliens, a feline race ala Niven, the generice Bug race ala Aliens and Heinlein. It tries to pass itself off as a hard sci-fi book but comes across as a novel written purely to satisfy an Editorial obgligation. I understand that there is a large market for trashy underwritten operatic sci-fi. That's why Star Trek and Star Wars novels sell so well.

The beginning of the exploration of the Orion culture was a nice touch. It is the ultimate Space Opera. What I do wonder though is what Steve White contributed to this series. Weber's fingerprints are all over this--it seems just like part of the Honor Harrington world, with similar descriptions of space battles, many similar terms (superdreadnaughts, for instance). This series seems to be an excuse for Weber to do something without Harrington and in a different political circumstance--but the military action is very familiar, and well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I loved this book!

In Death Ground tells the story of the horrific nature of one such race, the arachnids, who, for the sake of our own survival, must be exterminated. The story is told extremely well, with the feel of actually being present to witness the desperate struggle between man and bug.

The attempt to replicate the southern dialect was boring and tedious to read. Atlanta is a very cross cultural town and very few individuals carry on as Wolfe implies.With books like this written about the South, no wonder everyone else in the world thinks of us as uneducated wilting magnolias with nothing on our minds but what we are going to wear to the next ball! This ain't Tara, Scarlett. Wolfe needs to return to his roots and ingest what the South is in 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Historic","review":"Moments ago, I finished Wolfe's latest work of fiction, a book filled with great characters, wonderful narrative, and many--many--pages.After reading the last three chapters just this hour, appears that the author decided to write \\"only\\" a great book.

There were some kernels of interest but I was insulted by his assumption that I need help understanding his prose. Add to that the never ending descriptions that seem to be there so the costume designer of a forthcoming movie will know exactly how to dress his cardboard characters, and you have a disaster that doesn't even have the good grace to have a reasonable ending.I love long books and I treasure description but this book is a joke!

That's why you should pay close attention to the simple wisdom of Charles B. Carlson's book, which analyzes the investment habits of 170 members of the seven-figure club. The results: Millionaire investors buy fundamentally strong stocks, pay little attention to market timing, never trade on news and maintain a dedicated buy-and-hold philosophy. Carlson straightforwardly presents these financial principles for a financially unsophisticated audience, complete with lists of organizations and companies to contact for further investment information. Profiles and examples of successful investors like Warren Buffett will keep you hooked, even if you tend to nod off at the first mention of a PE ratio.

Buy and Hold does not work -- unless maybe you're buying an index fund or good mutual fund. There is no such thing as a safe blue chip. Just look at the stocks in the Dow or the S&P 500.

It gives beginners a guided path through their first savings and investments. There may not be much here for experts, but for those of us just starting out in the world (I'm 24), this book is a great springboard.

Ramses is now a fully developed individual in his own right, as is Nefret. The triumvirate formed by Ramses, Nefret and David is formidable indeed! The inclusion of the H manuscript not only provides valuable insight into the trios thoughts, but also leaves the reader in doubt as to which is the true author. The admission that Sethos is not dead tantalizes us with the hope of future meetings between Peabody and her nefarious admirer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah and bah","review":"This series has lost its spunk and spice. The adventures of Amelia, Emerson and Ramses were a favorite, and I looked forward to seeing how Ramses developed as he aged. I usually don't like series that add a kid for who knows what reason, but, brat that he was, Ramses sseemed to fit. I envisioned many more great reads. Unfortunately, Peters ran out of steam with the stupidity of the mythical land that Nefret came from. Please! Nefret has been a major drag. She is nothing more than an eraser smudging and draining the life from the Emersons. \\"Cat\\" is a hodgepodge of unreasoned stew. I will give the series another opportunity, but, probably, not more than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a bore","review":"The mystery was boring, the characters tedious, and continually having events re-examined from someone else's point of view was a yawn. Why has a mummy in silk underwear been brought to the Emerson family's attention? What is the connection with the mysterious American millionaire and his man-eating daughter? By the end, I didn't much care.The Peabody novels have been going downhill as the series progresses, and I think the essential reason is that the author loves her main characters, the Emerson family, too much. They are perfect by default, no matter how reprehensible or stupid their behaviour, because they are the main characters and her beloved creations - it is only others who can be at fault. Rarely does anything truly bad ever happen to them, and if it does it is because of their \\"virtue\\" and \\"nobility\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Fun","review":"After reading some of the reviews for this book I am inclined to ask if they got it. This series has never been about hardcore mystery so much as mystery-lite with tons of characterization. I highly recommend that you not start out with this book. Go to \\"Crocodile on the Sandbank.\\"That being said, I adored this book! It was so sun to see Ramses taking matters into his own hands. As usual, there was much to learn about Egyptology, and the speech Ramses gives to David describing Emerson's feelings for Amelia (and his for Nefret) were worth the price of admission!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series is one of the best series of books I have ever read.

Would use this service again as they were so speedy.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amelia Peabody - Mystery solver???","review":"This was my first and probably last Amelia Peabody mystery I shall read. Peabody is a nosy, verbose, upper class English Egyptologist famous for solving mysteries. I found the writing to be somewhat tedious and long winded. You'll have to suffer until page 125 for any sort of action to begin. I think only the true history lover can appreciate this novel, for most of the characters are either named after Egyptian gods or pharaohs. If this is the best novel Peters has to offer I dread to think of what her others may be like. This is a fairly quick read, really only a skim if there is absolutely nothing else at home on offer. I would reccomend other authors such as Christian Jacq, PC Doherty and Michael Asher who execute beautifully the wonders of Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe I finish this book","review":"If you think that in this book you will read something interesting about the ancient Egypt, you are completely wrong, the main story of the book is the diary of Amelia Peabody, but I don't think that if someone writes a diary will write what think another person, you can't do that, you just don't know what others think.Basically the book is the story of an assassin who killed his wife ten years or so before this story, it really is boring and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing a Large Cat","review":"I finally finished this tedious and unimaginative \\"book.\\" If there were a possibility to rate this lower, I would. Amelia Peabody is a nosy, bumbling, stuck up character. I do not like the way she thought, talked, or acted. She did not solve any mystery. She was so caught up in her own interpretation of good and evil that she managed to put her family in harms way...nearly getting them killed in the process. However, I did like the new cat.

It was easy to put together, and the color-coded stickers on the product were very helpful. It is quite sturdy, and I felt confident putting the instrument on it.But the x of the stand is awkward when you sit down. I have long legs, so it was not as big a problem for me, but when another keyboardist went to use the stand, he had to sit too far away from it (so his knees could avoid hitting it), and he ended up being very stretched out as he tried to play. This also makes using a pedal far more of a chore than it should be. That's why the product recieved 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra price","review":"I got this because of the easy clutch release since I would be transporting this stand frequently.

I just stick'em back on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rotating the stand 90 degrees","review":"Given the other positive reviews, I will add the following observations:a. I wish there was another notch so that the stand could be lowered a little more. Given the limitation, there is the suggestion by others here to rotate the stand 90 degrees to the left or right. This allows the stand to be lowered almost to the ground. The drawback to this strategy is that one end is about 2 inches higher than the other yielding a slight incline.b. an additional benefit of rotating the stand onto its side is that its possible to place a 40\\"x20\\"x1/2\\" board on top so that the stand be used as a computer table while working from the sofa near the HDTV. At the dimensions given, the board sits securely on the rubber grips on both ends. I found a laminated birch board at the local hardware store, cut it to size, and sanded the edges. The small incline makes little difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I remember","review":"Good shipping. Nice to watch what I remembered from a very long time ago.

They are all complimentary to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for coaches","review":"Being a new corporate coach, I am always looking for resources to use and share with clients. This book has proven to be a very valuable reference personally and professionally. In fact it is becoming somewhat dog-eared from use. The insights and models have been useful for my (sometimes difficult)conversations with clients. Additionally, I share the techniques with clients and ask questions based on the book to help guide the client's development with having better conversations.

However, this book, with the descriptive and detailed examples, as well as pragmatic, candid, and scientific insights into the dynamics in communication between human beings, has finally opened my eyes to the dual reality of being both right and wrong at the same time (depending on what data I'm drawing my conclusion from). I was both startled and liberated to learn that I also contribute to the problem, because from this realization, I know that I can contribute to solving the problem as well. What I learned from this book has empowered me to be a better team member at work, a more supportive and caring wife and mother at home, and a better friend.This is a true success tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivy League Lawyer Geeks interpret Family Therapy","review":"Very disappointing, thin material presented in double space format and large type to bulk up a thinly veiled version of family therapy technique. The chapter on Listening is particularly facile and lacking any rigor or new ideas apart from bashing active listening.

I recently picked up another book on this subject: The Coward's Guide to Conflict by Tim Ursiny. I loved Coward's Guide because it approached conflict as an opportunity, which I think is a tremendously positive outlook.

The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The \\"What Happened?\\", The \\"Feelings\\" and The \\"Identity\\") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like \\"How to win friends and influence people?\\" by Dale Calegie, \\"Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again\\" by David J.

At last, I thought, someone will give this author the respect and scholarly attention she has long deserved. Instead I found the author gave up on scholarship somewhere around the second page of Acknowledgments and instead settled for a compendium of previously published reviews. Yes, there are several rarely published short stories (although not \\"previously unpublished\\" ones, since I had already read them) and a few republished pieces by other authors. Certainly if a newish reader wants an extended bibliography of Miss Heyer's works and doesn't mind the having plot endings routinely given away without warning this book might help set the chronology straight.

TM2 is probably the best playstation game around, which was my basis for buying TM3. The characters and the descriptions of the cars are sooo cheesy. Some of the race tracks are pretty cool but they are small. The cars in this version are also incredibly difficult to control. The Rob Zombie- and-friends soundtrack is ok but after playing the game for a while the repetitive songs get annoying. 989 studios ruined this game. I do on the other hand recommend Twisted Metal 1 and 2. They are great.(since they are done by Singletrac)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the TM series","review":"TM3 is nothing like the first two of the Twisted Metal series and it's not nearly as good either. The only improvement from the first 2 TM games are the graphics. The sound is about the same and everything else about it just sucks. The control ruins the rest of the game. Just about everytime you even get nudged by another vehicle or fall off a cliff, you end up upside down and that's what I really didn't like about TM3. When you get turned upside down, it slows you down and it gets frustrating. The control is not good at all when you compare it to TM2. You can't turn on a dime no more. The control is so messed up it ruins just about all of the fun factor and replay value.The only thing good about TM3 is the improved graphics. The levels are laid out pretty good and there's not as many pixels anymore, but like I said the control ruins the whole game. This is the worst of the Twisted Metal series. Twisted Metal 2 is still the best and Twisted Metal 4 is the second best."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't be mislead......","review":"NOT terrible, like the other reviews say....it's solid... just not as good as parts 1 and 2....but at this point in time, you should be playing the newest version released... look it up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"twisted metal III","review":"the service was fast....the game was in very good shape on arrival..was very pleased with all parts of the transaction...very good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell way below #2 but a little above #1","review":"TM3 i must say was quite dissapointing. The main reason for this is beacuse the characters...There were three good characters in the whole game, the rest were poo piles. Also, the levels were too small, and there wasn't a lot to blow up. In TM 2, one of my fav things was taking down the eiffel tower w/ a remote. That was sweet, especially if an enemy was residing in the tower at the time. You just can not do that in TM 3. The graphics also, were worse than 2. I just do not understand how you can make a 2nd sequel to a great series and have worse graphics than before. But of course, 989 studios, the ones responsible for the absolutley horrific graphics of the psx nba shoot out series, were behind this game. The only good thing i can say about this game is that it is a tad better than the first and that it can become a little addicting, as each game of the series can.

The game also adds almost nothing new.

Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning.

Done by 989 Studios, not even the original team SingleTrac, TM3 is pretty much a slight improvment over TM2. Being a big fan of the first two I expected 989 to do a halfway decent job. I was wrong, it was the worst. It didn't even feel like you were playing Twisted Metal anymore other than the name. They lost the control of the originals, and the gameplay seemed more boring.

My main problem with TM3 is that it has terrible physics for a fast action game. Flipping over every two seconds during high adrenaline moments was not fun for me. It felt too loose, like every car was some giant 70's mobile or something. In my view the best Twisted Metal experience can be had with TM1, TM2, and TM: Black.

The second half deals with Freddy's graduating class coming back to Springwood for their high school reunion and just finding out that the kid that wore that dirty red and green sweater all the time is not only dead, but a vicious child molester and murderer.

SACRED SINS was on the USA Today top 150-bestseller list in August and September 2001, peaking at position eight.SACRED SINS is a suspense thriller with a touch of mystery and a romantic subplot. Dr. Tess Court, a young, attractive psychiatrist, is chosen to assist Detective Ben Paris, a handsome unattached detective, in finding a deranged serial killer. Paris doesn't think a psychological profile of the killer will be helpful, but he finds the physical profile of Tess irresistible. Throughout the story, the push and tug between Tess and Ben examines the treatment versus punishment of criminal dementia.In SACRED SINS, the author switches amongst multiple points of view without separators, occasionally having two points of view in the same paragraph. At times, I found this confusing and difficult to follow. Otherwise, this story is well written and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a Great Punch!","review":"This book was great from cover to cover. I did not want to put it down at all. It was filled with mystery and you can see the struggle within each character. I was kept in suspense till the very last page.

It's because of the fact that in spite of these flaws the characters still get together that makes me love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fast paced or intriguing enough","review":"I didn't find that this book had enough intrigue and suspense to keep me interested. I found the relationship between Tess and Ben to be a little too important in the book. It was more prevalent than the story line. What was that again?

Unfortunately, though, I couldn't believe in the string of events that transpired to put so many unlikely characters together, and I definitely couldn't believe in characters who constantly said they couldn't believe themselves or what they had just done, and what annoyed me the most was the characters were so ultra cool or ultra stupid or ultra rude or worst of all ultra heroic; nobody was normal.

Considering its a debut album with modest production I'd give it 4 stars.The songwriting has attitude and is really solid thanks to Willie Hines. The backup vocals & harmonies are very good and there a bunch of smokin' guitar solos courtesy of Johnny Feikert. Check out Johnny's solo on \\"Outside\\" or \\"Bad as Heaven\\". He was a worthy replacement for Marty Friedman (as in the Megadeth axe slinger).I also have Flight Plan (their second CD), which I really like, although I think this was the better sounding CD of the two.This rates a 5 out of 5 on the Neumann hard rock crank-a-bility index.

No I'm not biased because I'm a friend of Willie Hines. I first saw and met Willie in 1980/81 as a member of the Central Calif. band called \\"The Lights\\". They were good and Willie new then how to put on a show. With Jet Red, he got better and matured as a performer and a song writer. This album is a must have. I'm a sucker for simple structured songs and one of my favorite songs on the CD is \\"You're Not The Only One\\". A cross between New England's \\"Don't Ever Wanna Lost Ya\\" and The Babys \\"Turn And Walk Away\\" and then add some original flavor to it as well, makes you miss the melodic rock era.

However, it's not a consistent game in terms of the answers required to win. Some of the questions are really challenging and, given time to think, you can often come up with a good guess. But about 20% of the time, the answer is so ridiculous that you may never get it. Some of the questions are mensa-type questions, but others are borderline absurd - you'd never get them right even if you had all the time in the world. Perhaps that's one way to guarantee that even a braniac is going to lose a turn eventually, and it keeps everyone on a level playing field. Check out Mindtrap II as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes fun, most often not","review":"This game seemed like it would be an interesting and fun way for my friends to spend an evening in a different way. Most of us like thinking and problem solving games but the questions in Mindtrap are more often than not the kind that are based on some sort of logical twist or trick and not very analytic-- some cannot be solved without making some sort of absurd assumption, a feature which I would think the question writers could have avoided. This game can be fun for awhile but it ceases to be enjoyable a long time before anyone can come close to winning. It is much better to just ask questions and see who can come up with answers in a more informal way, the unevenness of questions makes fair competition impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your mental muscle","review":"I think this is super for older people who want to exercise their mental muscle. \\"Use it or lose it.\\" Even if you miss every question, you're thinking here. True, some are impossible, but you soon get the idea of lateral thinking. I play with my dad sometimes, and we ignore the rules and just alternate asking questions to each other. I found this especially valuable to him post-surgery as he feared being weaker mentally. This might have proved to him that he is not, because he did great, but be ready to work that brain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, but...","review":"Lacking. Many of the math-related questions are old and/or plain easy. Some of the story-type questions are old, some are reasonable, many are inadequate in their answers or they are absurd. (For example: in one, a king tries to commit suicide by poison but, though he takes enough to kill a person, he does not die. The answer? Many members of royalty built up an immunity to poisons by taking small doses over a period of time (that part's ok) - but no one would come up with that because if he'd built up an immunity, why would he try to kill himself that way? The answer does say 'who knows' why he would do this, but that's a ridiculous to have someone try to come up with because it makes no sense). My friends and I love challenging questions, but we found this game more stupid than fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This game is slow, boring, and sloppily made. The cards are full of mistakes and typos, hardly educational! There are no tokens or playing boards.

If you succeed, you can roll a die for the number of spaces to move and then give the next player a try, or you can move one space and get another question. We played two teams of two.

The questions are all either ridiculously easy or impossible, with nothing in between. It can be very frustrating when one player gets three easy questions in a row, while someone else gets all the impossible ones. The other problem, and this is a big one, is that lots of these questions have more than one logical answer, so how to you give credit to something that sounds reasonable, but isn't on the card?

Some loose ends aside (which, this is a series, so perhaps they will be tied up in the next book!), this installment definitely is the most exciting and downright thrilling! It is absolutely action-packed!Merrily and Jane and other series regulars continue to feel like real, living and breathing people. And Lol returns in this book which was so pleasant (although his return may shock some American readers considering Merrily's position in the clergy...). A lot happens with Jane as well, as she matures and grows.And though my \\"to-read\\" pile of books is growing, right now I only want to continue reading this series - I am so thoroughly enjoying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickman Is a Master of Suspense","review":"I am a tremendous fan of the Merrily Watkins series.

It is a tale well told--unfortunately for the wrong reasons. There is no question that these people should be honored but not at the price of compromising today's ongoing intelligence efforts.The author seems to feel that \\"the peoples (relatives) right to know\\" trumps any need to protect \\"sources and methods\\" and national security. He attributes all attempts at secrecy to a desire to hide blunders. And he feels that certainly anything that happened over 30 years ago has no need to be withheld. For an opposing view I would direct readers to most any non-fiction book on \\"intelligence tradecraft.\\" You can search that term on the Internet and get a good book list. ###"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finest example of journalistic mediocrity!","review":"The only reason why I managed to finish this book is just so that I can write this and say: \\"After reading this book...\\"The style is characteristic of \\"Washington Post\\" and \\"Time Mag\\" - each true hero is patronizingly framed in a human interest story format of Yello' Jo School of Journalism.Each story seeps with condescension and thinly veiled anti-CIA political slant.

The book is extremely well-written--it's clear, without the sensationalism that could easily creep in. How the families handled the blatant misinformation about the deaths of loved is fascinating. I wasn't surprised by the CIA's actions and doublespeak, though, which is a sad commentary.A few minor editing issues are probably just that, and not enough to cast dispersions of the thorough research performed over many years as a labor of love and dedication by Mr. Gup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Enjoyable Biographical Sketches","review":"I really enjoyed reading this well-researched, and well-written, book. I felt all the people in this book died in sad circumstances, and it bothered me how the CIA had to make their deaths appear unconnected to the Agency--it is cruel and inhuman to their familes, even if necessary.Reading this book made me realize I could never have been in the CIA, even if I had wanted to be. I'm a talkative, not a secretive, person. Also, even though I can understand the reasons why, I don't like organizations that operate on a \\"need-to-know\\" basis.Overall, a slow and thoughtful read, but never a boring read. A lot of interesting details were included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacrifice in Secrecy","review":"The sacrifices made within the book solidify the strengths inherent within the Agency. It is generally forgotten the heroicalness that permeates the souls of the demised. The book also reflects the high standards, moral courage and intellectual capacity officers in the Agency hold even as nothing is returned except a negative connotation. These beliefs should be invalidated and a more appreciative attitude should be taken. I humbly offer my condolences to the Agency and their families and reaffirm they did not die in vain. It has led me to thank these quiet soldiers every morning for the freedom they live and die for and to reevaluate the importance of their continuation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This is a depressing book.It's entirely about all of our people who were caught and killed....No happy ending, no success stories..EVERYBODY gets killed...a real downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asleep at the Switch - Gup","review":"Many brave men and women have paid the ultimate price for their country.

In addition, the paper backing warped easily. Having purchased the game in another state, I couldn't return or exchange it.

Other costs involved with high employee turnover include the manager's reputation as a leader, lost customers and damaged morale of \\"survivors\\". In the super competitive, downsized work environment today, retention accountability can no longer be ignored.The author provides research examples that supports the need for managers to make employees feel apart of the organization, go home at night feeling appreciated, excited and he provides \\"best practice\\" strategies being used by managers and organizations with low employee turnover.A great management training tool that provides interesting examples and stats to capture the attention of managers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of bronzer=good, but smells weird","review":"I ordered this because I was running low on my current tanning lotion which I love and it smells like skittles, so I read the reviews for this one that was supposed to smell like cherries or almonds and it does NOT smell like either.

'Brought you something', Judd says. ''Ma opens a sack that Judd is holding and finds a squirrel that dad says will go nicely with some stew.'' The scene that shows suspense involved the town people trying to get to the top of a mystery. The scene was when David told Marty that the man that's outside at night with the light, always seems to be looking for something.

Every album is a masterpiece on it's on, with a different mood on each one, yet they all have the dEUS imprint on them. The latest one succeeds in following the dEUS legacy of unbelievably high musical standart. Personally I like the one before Ideal Crash, \\"In a Bar Under the Sea\\", better, but I still think that on this album the band has evolved musically, and that this album is more original and more complex musically.

On this album they became a not very good band. The songs on this album are very formulamatic, very predictable, and boring. They start off pretty and low key, then low and behold by the end of the song they are raging with artsy noise. This album is very contrived. The lyrics are another weak point. dEUS lyrics on previous albums were brilliant, but on this album it sounds as if they hired Billy Corgan as poetry consultant. Two of the founding members of dEUS quit before this album was made to pursue their own bands.

It's good to see a band who aren't afraid to experiment a little - and it's not just that they use a violin; it's the whole approach.

The fact that he has been an accepted liberal voice to counteract the conservative position is not due to his erudite observations of the political scene or his perceptiveness, rather it has more to do with his detached pomposity and off the wall comments. They flow so naturally that one almost believes him to be an authority. This book just confirms the opposite. He makes unsupported statements and claims in the book just as he does when involved in roundtable discussions. To say that this indivdual-author is empty is clear upon reading his book or listening to him in a communal discussion but his overall appearance implies otherwise. He is certainly not physically empty and the book's title attests to his admission of this fact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk show presence does not translate into book sales","review":"Mr. Germond believes that is now his time to 'cash in' on book sales. Being a pseudo talk show/journalist celebrity does not qualify him as being a successful book writer. Whereas his jaundiced opinions expressed on TV and newspaper are free to the listeners, books must be sold and the readers must be convinced that there is value in the book and must be attracted to Germond's typical diatribe against family values and patriotism. Unfortunately, this lop-sided liberal anti-American stance is only shared by a minority of Americans--those who also found some entertainment in Michael Moore's tasteless, misrepresentation of history. The content of this book is more drivel that Germond expressed for years in newspaper articles and on TV. Mot for me and and not for the majority of readers.

I know it says there is a simulated pheromone in the product but the ingredients don't seem to indicate one. I'm not a chemist but the ingredients shown on the label are Sodium Laurel Sulfate, Rosemary Oil, Thyme Oil and Purified Water. I tried this a couple times but our senior cat was not deterred at all.He was urinating repeatedly in one spot in our foyer. What worked for us: We purchased two grass-like entry mats and blocked his way into the area using those. He doesn't like the texture on his paws. Plus, we added Precious Cat Litter Attractant to his litter boxes. I just sprinkled about 1/4 cup in each box and mixed it in slightly. I had to put him in the box the first time I added it but he went right away and soon the problem stopped altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work with our 4 Cats","review":"Sorry to say that this product doesn't work with our 4 male cats.

A bit of checking on his sources serves to reveal the lengths to which he'll go in order to deliver something sensationally unbelievable: he simply makes it up.Whether Mr. O'Reilly's information is bad or he's deliberately misleading, anyone looking for an informed, factual read would be better off going elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"O'Reilly Really Loves O'Reilly","review":"When I finished this book I realized that there was no way I could love O'Reilly as much as O'Reilly loves O'Reilly.

He never will flat out say it, but he will make it clear that he does not care about other people's opinions and that the only right person is himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to TV","review":"O'Reilly is entertaining on TV, but when you take away his interrupting privileges, he doesn't have as much to say as I had hoped. I read this book expecting Bill to expand upon the views he mentions on TV (Jesse Jackson, Hilary Clinton, etc.). I figured the television format just didn't give him enough time to articulate about these issues, and that the book would give him the time he needs to present a detailed argument. Bill doesn't even mention these issues till the last few chapters of the book, at which point he barely glosses over them. The bulk of the book consists of Bill telling the reader how to raise children and interact with friends. Bill really doesn't tackle any issues in this book. He's more interested in having a Hallmark moment with the reader. Despite my disappointment with the book, I will still enjoy watching Bill get into a good shouting match with Neil Cavuto."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKING CLASS?","review":"I read the first few pages and I didn't want to finish the rest. There are several things about Bill O'Reilly that irritate me, but the thing that made me not want to continue with the book was his constant attempt to associate himself with \\"the working class\\". While he may have originated from a working class blackground, can he say he is still there? It's irritating to myself and others who actually do come from middle class neighborhoods to hear some schmuck wearing 3000 suits and getting paid quite a bit of money to sit there and berate his guests and ramble on and on about his one-sided, unreseached views without letting the other person have their say.

He hand-picksissues to be bombastic, just for ratings. Never mind the facts, betterto sway emotions.My thesis is that O'Reilly needed this book tospout more than he was allowed to on his show. Best guess is Fox toldhim to cool it and try to be more fair [thus, the \\"fairnetwork\\" slogan].But he can't be fair. You can always see theveins in his neck bulging as he holds back what he REALLYthinks!!!If you read this book you will see why, and also how heseems to have fallen into the aging white-man trap.

Having read a little criminology in the past, I can think of good reasons to pay for a study of the reasons prisoners want to escape, as the Amazon reviewer alluded to. But I would venture to say that a reader interested in that sort of thing would not be considering reading this book anyway. No one who has this many opinions forms them carefully. This is a performance rather than a book of ideas. The author can not criticize what he has not tried to understand. If you are part of the herd of people who finds this entertaining, or if you mistake this type of talk for insight, you might like this book.

Thanks, Bill, for telling us how to think, and what is acceptable for us, as human beings. The attempts at humor are tragic, and the constant \\"I'm an independent thinker, but my independent thoughts just happen to line up exactly with the current RNC leadership\\" get old very quickly.

Or the a**hole crewcut high school coach who'd been a clerk in the army and hated the peace movement? Well, that's Bill O'Reilly in a nutshell: arrogant, ignorant, vicious, cowardly, sucking up to the rich and successful while putting down anything different. Surely nobody looks up to this clown as any sort of moral authority; his sole appeal is that he publicly airs and shares the narrow, bigoted, hateful attitudes of his miserable viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Compelling, Must-Ignore Book","review":"Yet again Bill O'Reilly hits the mark with another compelling, must-ignore book. When you think about it (and let's not spin this) there are few contemporary writers more important to ignore than O'Reilly. The man, one must admit, is a giant in his own mind: he was the first to climb Mount Everest (or at least \\"was there\\"); fought heroically in the Civil War (\\"was there,\\" at least, for most of that war's seminal battles); spearheaded the allied attack (and victory) against the Germans in WWII (or at least \\"was there\\"): marched with Martin Luther King and, more impressively, wrote most of Dr. King's greatest speeches; and presently holds \\"the true\\" world records in the mile, 100 meters and 400 meter hurdles.

Most surprising is that Bill O'Reilly could have gotten as far as he did in the journalism business while being such an aweful writer. I try to finished every book I start even if it's not all that enjoyable to read, especially if I'm going to criticize it later. But I've read several different books by political writers all over the spectrum, and Bill O'Reilly's book is by far the least enjoyable to read and certainly among the least inciteful or profound. An alternative title for this book could be 'A List of Bill O'Reilly's Opinions Excluding Any Significant Analysis or Reasoning'. This was a BORING, UNENJOYABLE book.

This book reads like an extended version of his Fox news program The Oreilly Factor. It is hard hitting, anectdotal, and witty throughout. There is no one in the media more incisive and relentless in his pursuit of the truth and accountability than Bill O'Reilly, and his book vouches convincingly for that assertion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional American Values and Common Sense Live On","review":"In these times of sound bites, subliminal ads, high school shootings and other non-sense it's nice to see a man who holds to traditional American values and common sense.

I thought something like, \\"Wow, even Bill thinks these things (are true).\\" What I'm talking about is: how the rich deliberately try to keep the poor poor, or rather keep a supply of poor people around to manipulate.

The only way to preserve one's reputation as a TRUE journalist,which Mr. O'Reilly is NOT, is to maintain a balanced perspective. Obviously, this man has lost that sense of balance. The STORY matters -- the journalist's opinion does NOT. In this case, I cannot say that I am shocked that THIS so-called journalist has forgotten that basic tenet of journalism, because his low standards were evident years ago when he hosted a pseudo-news tabloid TV show.

My daughter says that her professors are concerned about Americans' eroding confidence in the news media and that this kind of book fuels that lack of confidence. \\"We're told to present just the facts as impartially as possible,\\" my daughter said, \\"and to keep our opinions to ourselves.\\" I guess that Mr. O'Reilly did not study journalism.

We are at a time when we all need to be honest and say things like HEY, public aid isn't working, politics is broken with a bunch of self serving rich lawyers (who really care very little about the middle or lower class), and the supposed charity system also isn't what it seems.O'Reilly cuts beyond the usual rhetoric that we are blasted with every day and gives us some hard facts. I also liked that the facts are usually backed up by numbers. Yes, this book has a great deal to do with O'Reilly's opinions on the subjects he deals with, but at least it is an informed opinion, and not a bunch of self-serving bull hockey. I appreciate that.Thanks Mr. O'Reilly, and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment as well as advice for life","review":"This book is quite insightful. O'Reilly offers a lot of his own advice for living a good, honest life. This book has a lot to offer people of differing political bases.If you have ever watched The O'Reilly Factor you probably know how Bill O'Reilly thinks, and you will read a lot of those same opinions in this book. However, I think the highlights of this book are all of O'Reilly's short anecdotes, stories, and life experiences scattered throughout the entire book. They are about growing up, politics, the media, and tons of the silly and stupid things people have done. These stories and personal experiences are entertaining by themselves, and they are the main reasons why I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some just don't get it","review":"Bill O'Reilly should not be compared to beat journalists in your daily newspaper or news readers on your local TV news. It perplexes me that some have ripped him for not being \\"objective\\" in his well-written and thoughtful book. He is a news analyst, and only a journalist in as much as he gathers the pertinent facts before hand. His show is based on a philosophy of vetting out the so-called objective journalism based mainly on talking points. Bill goes out of his way to explain the premise of his show regularly.For someone who graduated from one of the best public school journalism programs in the country, I believe O'Reilly meets the objectivity quotient by not taking sides and being tough on everyone. As he states in the book, he is a watchdog, not a lapdog.This book is not Journalism 101, anyway. It's Life 101, a text many Amercians should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, simple and uncontroversial","review":"I was hoping O'Reilly would take a stand on some controversial topics, but instead his book contains mostly advice that absolutely no one in the solar system would ever disagree with.

Although I may not agree with some of his statements (although I agree with most of them), one has to give him credit for having studied the facts and giving pointed well thought out arguments for his ideas. One has to admire the way in which he has ducked any issue and all though his show is not a totally level playing field (it is his show), he at least asks the hard questions that most people want answered. His book is the same way, offering his ideas on current issues in a manner that is easy to understand, thought provoking, and sometimes frustrating to read. What's more refreshing is he actually seems to want dissenting viewpoints to discuss, rather than easy, yes-men type interviews. Good job Mr. O'Reilly on transforming the way we expect to hear about current issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"very thin book","review":"You won't get a lot of reading out of this bookette.At just over 200 pages it doesn't justify the price.But on to the minimal content,O'Reilly is supposed to be amusing and insightful,but this book doesn't give much evidence of either.Basically banal,a mile wide and an inch deep,the book is an ode to irrelevence and someone cashing in on their 15 minutes of fame.His observations of class,politics and the like are pretty much on the mark,but he reveals absolutely nothing we didn't already know.It is a fairly enjoyable read but not anything worth reading twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a ridiculous read is what it is","review":"Perhaps never, in the history of mankind, has anyone written such a lousy book.

The things he wrote about Hollywood, the news business, and just life in general confirmed many things that I suspected were true, and he made me aware of some other really ridiculous people and situations. The truth in his very short paragraph about Bill Clinton was chilling. (You'll know it when you see it.) I have only one negative comment--he got a little self-indulgent in the last chapter. His book is well worth reading regardless of your political views, because neither liberals nor conservatives have a lock on the ridiculous.

It is a book of great width but no depth. O'Reilly rants about his likes and dislikes, but provides little supporting information, no evidence or research, and zero philosophical support for his positions. Take religion, for example. Here is a chapter that is not worthy of the ink it took to print it. O'Reilly proudly proclaims faith in a deity because there's just too darn much stuff science can't explain. That's it. That's as deep a thought as he can muster. To use such a flimsy premise as justification for worhsip of an invisible power reveals how shallow and ludicrous O'Reilly's logic is.

The negative is that one doesn't get much out of reading it. On the positive side, one can read it extremely quickly.

I bet he'd rattle off 200 pages of dialogue before you can respond! Thanks Bill, for bird's eye view with the worm's eye perspective. P.S.

His chapter on class discrimination is of particular interest. His book only gets 4 stars because of the lack of a chapter on education. He skims the education card lightly in his other chapters.

I agree with most of his opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Points is Furious that some people don't have this","review":"If you like the style of Fox News Channel's \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\", this book is a must have. While it does jump around a lot(i.e. letters from viewers appear in the middle of a page), you find out where Bill O'Reilly came from, what he did, what he thinks, and why he almost got fired from his old job at another network.

I rate this book poorly because it is of the same nature as his program. It's predictable and totally composed of recycled themes and right wing slogans (you can predict the whole book just by reading the first chapter). Its virtually an amalgam of bumper stickers. There's nothing wrong with being conservative, as long as you've reasons for that viewpoint, but this is mindless composition of the lowest calibre. Unless you can't get enough of his shtick, don't buy this book. You'll find nothing provocative or interesting in it.

This may be O'Reilly's best book. He breaks up the paragraphs in each chapter with \\"Talking Point\\", \\"Viewer Time-Out\\", \\"Ridiculous Note\\", and \\"This Just In\\"; this adds to the humor and fun. His program on Fox radiates loud and clear in this short read. The last two chapters are entitled Bad and Good respectively; each highlights an organization, object or person that fits the bill (pun intended).

He's one of the best interviewers on television, and I enjoy watching him. Reading his book, however, was a waste of my time.In this book, Bill is preachy and unimaginative. He advises us not to disclose our sex life to the world. He tells parents to discipline their children. He reminds us that materialism can be bad. He rarely stays on a topic for more than a page, and he writes at a third-grade level (if you have ever read any of his weekly columns, you'll understand).

I was under the delusion that this book would talk about politics and current issues of the day. But this book seems to be confused in its focus. At times it is biographical giving details of his work history, and his upbringing, which to be honest I found the first chapters of this book to be depressing. Then it drifts off into what I guess is suppossed to be issues, but he really takes no stand either way. His chapter on Religion is the most wishy washy hogwash I've ever seen. And finally this book ends with a high school like who's cool and who's not list. Which includes everyone from Madonna to The Grateful Dead. Anyway I'll stick to the show which is definately more exciting than this book which I have determined will become what I call ebay fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill O'Reilly hates animals and little children","review":"This book was great.

I try to watch his show but Fox News is such an overproduced Hollywood monstrosity I can hardly stand it. On the plus side it sometimes takes a more conservative view of the news (though far less than people would have you believe). I had been given the impression that O'Reilly was the new face of conservative commentary in America and I bought this book to see what he had to say.Let's make this short: O'Reilly is about as conservative as Stalin. Just because he bashes liberals like Clinton doesn't make him a conservative. If you listen to his actual politics he's as far left as they come. So what if he more of a national socialist, whereas the Clintons are international socialist. The are both morally bankrupt concepts that do not deserve the time or attention of true freedom loves.Take it from me and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"O'reilly has a very interesting and semi-informative newsprogram.

Instead I heard O'Reilly continually trying to claim he isworking class. ...There are a few good chapters where he deals withcurrent affairs and politics but the bulk of it is \\"How to lead abetter full-filling life\\". Stick to politics O'Reilly. NOTHINGlike the Factor new program."},{"rating":"1","title":"SURPRISINGLY BAD","review":"Although Bill O'Reilly seems to be a decent individual, I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Most surprising is that Bill O'Reilly could have gotten as far as he did in the journalism business while being such an aweful writer. I try to finished every book I start even if it's not all that enjoyable to read, especially if I'm going to criticize it later. But I've read several different books by political writers all over the spectrum, and Bill O'Reilly's book is by far the least enjoyable to read and certainly among the least inciteful or profound. An alternative title for this book could be 'A list of Bill O'Reilly's opinions excluding any significant analysis or reasoning'. This was a BORING, UNENJOYABLE book.

I never finished the book, I wasn't able to.Mr. O'Reilly jumped from topic to topic, point to point, and then back again so quickly I was unable to derive the logic of the book.What may work on Television, which I usually enjoy, just did not cut it for me in written form.At some point, I hope to be able to finish the work, but I must say it will have to be at a point and time in my life where thoughts and logic run awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Outright Fraud","review":"I have to admit to being a little let down.

Knowing of O'Reilly's tastes I was willing to shuck out a few dollars for his take on the \\"completely ridiculous in American life\\"...unfortunately all I got was this smug litany of the usual right wing gripes with the usual disregard for context and proportion.

There are some people who might add an interesting dimension to his show, such as author Charlotte Lopez (\\"Lost in the System\\") or Ken Grant (\\"The Wanderer\\")who might reinforce O'Reilly's basic precepts of a caste-based American society. There are people in America, like abandoned kids, kids lost in state care and for whom people care little, that O'Reilly may be a good voice for. O'Reilly made me laugh and think and though the book is a little skimpy in size, it has many gems.

I can't help but wonder how it would be to actually meet O'Reilly, so he could tell me how he became so opinionated about everything.

Unfortunately, his book offers few insights and little substance. There are no profound revelations to be found here.

They are not a good introduction to the music of the Smiths or a good overview of their career; the 'Best Of' albums leave out many of their seminal songs and contain bizarre choices. The CD entitled \\"Singles\\", which simply has all 18 of the Smiths' singles, is far better than the 'Best Of' CDs as far as showing what the Smiths were all about, or giving you much of their best material in one source. \\"Singles\\" works very well as an album- it doesn't have the disjointed feel of many \\"greatest hits\\" collections, probably because the Smiths released all of their material in a period of only a couple years.

The keyboard is small but still big enough to type with ease and when I don't need it I can simply slip it off.

He just doesn't write well."},{"rating":"1","title":"this WILL happen if we deploy a shield","review":"The terrifying thing about warday is it envisages the inevitable result of what would happen if the US tried to put a system in place that could stop a russian attack. any russian premier would be criminally negligent not to launch an attack before it was deployed. ask yourself; would the US allow Russia to get in a position where it could destroy the US without retaliation? of course not. with the latest attempt to launch a missile defense system we are back to the dangerous 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Afraid","review":"I first read this book as an early teenager, pulling it from the browsing rack in my small-town library in 1984. Since then, I have revisited it several times and been astonished to find that it continues to improve as my own grasp of science, politics, nature, and the world evolves. Though we no longer live in day-to-day anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war, this book is no less relevant now than it was 13 years ago. The warheads are still there. The technology is spreading to less \\"advanced\\" countries. Strieber and Kunetka have created something that frightens me more than Stephen King at his best, because it is entirely possibile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well thought out book","review":"Another reviewer was right, there really is nothing to compare this book to. It details the journey of two journalists in a post nuclear US.The level of detail is impeccable, as is the way the book goes to lengths to show the human side of the war. The \\"interview\\" sections of the book were great, letting each person give their own experience of the war and aftermath is thought provoking.Whether you like the post-apocalyptic genre or not, you should give this book a chance. It's fiction, but not sci-fi by any stretch of the imagination. Very much a \\"What if?\\" book. It stays with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear Whitney's voice at all!","review":"I have to admit that Whitney's mother is a GREAT singer. I really think so. I expected that Whitney sang duets with her mother, like \\"I know him so well\\" in her 2nd solo album. But she was just a back vocalist here. And I can't hear her voice. I'm really disappointed. I like Cicy. But this album is not what I expected. SORRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT","review":"This is a Cissy album with Whitney singing back-up. You can barely hear Whitney.

If you love to spend long hours searching through trees for some hidden switch with very poor lighting then this game is a good investment. The new weapons, improved graphics, and \\"duck & crawl\\" move are a plus. My advice is to stick with the first two and possibly get the fourth which is more in the lines of the first: actual \\"tomb raiding\\". All in all, not a pleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard","review":"Why do developers contiue to insist that the best games are virtually impossable to complete? Instead of using pro-gamers as play testers they should use regular people. The game looks good and plays well but unless your a vidio games freak you wont be able to get your moneys worth out of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say NO!","review":"I adore the TR games & I have completed them all except for this one. I have tried to get into it and have started it on 3 separate occasions. I just do not find it fun. The most frustrating aspect is the save crystals. This game is unreasonably hard in some sections yet you are afraid to save and waste a save crystal in case you need it more later on. I don't feel the crystals add to the challenge of the game. They just make the game annoying.Don't waste your time and money. Just enjoy the rest of the TR series and pretend this one didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"Compared to the other Tomb Raider games in the series, this one is somewhat of a disappointment. Yes there are more weapons and moves, but the difficulty level is much too high. You might find yourself in the middle of a level saying, \\"Uh..where do I go?\\". It's nearly impossible to know the routes through the levels without some kind of game guide. Also, some levels require you to travel very far to find one item or key or switch, then walk ALL the way back to the beginning to use it. This makes the levels tedious and boring. The cut scenes look pretty bad as far as graphics go. Very square. The heads bob when characters talk, but the mouths don't move! Pretty funny actually. The enemies are pretty cool though, especially the raptors and crocodiles. The music is cool, and the plot is kind of interesting. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a die-hard Lara Croft fan and absolutely must see her gigantic---well, you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb Raider 3 Classic","review":"dont get me wrong i love the first two tomb raider games and was eager for this one to come out. I got it when it first came out. I played the first level and was bored out of my mind. I got pretty far in it but my intrest was lost in it. It just doesnt have that thing that makes you want to continue on to the next level like on the firts two games. There is one thing i liked about this game and it was laras improved house. There is a secret key that you can find that unlocks a race course that has a four wheeler. I have to admit that was pretty cool. But all in all i was very disapointed in the game. Take my advise DONT BUY THIS GAME. If you really want to see here new house just rent it or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Repugnant!","review":"The objective of this game is to plunder Third World art treasures while brutally wiping out as much endangered wildlife and indigenous people as possible. It's a truly repugnant scenario and I would not let a young person anywhere near this game.On the other hand, if you don't necessarily look to computer games for political vision and leadership, you may want to play it anyway. The game is incredibly large with plenty of beautiful and varied scenery to explore, but most players will probably find the gameplay very difficult indeed. I personally found the most enjoyable way to play was with a complete walkthrough solution plus the cheat codes to maximise all items and scores. The game is still a challenge even then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A goodin!","review":"Ok, alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd, and 4th onwards) should be named \\"City Raider\\" the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd, and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"I love all of the tomb raider games but this one was really bad. The most frustrating aspect of this game are the saving crystals.Unlike all the other game where you just go to the pasport at will, you must collect crystals in order to save. This did not increase the difficulty of the game at all. I just found it annoying.

When I received my package, and opened it, I was very disappointed because my product was damaged and looked like it had been stomped on by children. This was my first time ever ordering merchandise online by Amazon for Galactics. I can say on honestly, on a positive note Amazon and Galactics resolved my issue immediately which I appreciate very much. I wish I had the opportunity to play the game I always wanted as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"This game is the epitomy of greatness as far as Adventure/Action games are concerned. Today is 2004, and I installed this game on my PC after finding it buried in the back of my drawer. I expected crap. Man was I off....Basically, you are Lara Croft, and run around from the Jungles of India to Area 51 in Nevada, to the abandoned railway tunnels of London's Alwych, to the stone age wilderness of the South Pacific(infested with Raptors, of course ;D), and finally to Antarctica to this really cool lost city.On the whole, this game breaks down like this:- Graphics: 7/10 - For it's time, not bad.....- Sound: 9/10 - Excellent. Music is good, voiceovers believable, etc.....- Gameplay - 9/10 - Not much different from other TR games yet strangely, it's a lot of fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"This seller deceived me.

About half of this collection reprints the best of a limited edition broadside of epigrams extravagantly attacking John Ashcroft's threat to civil liberties. Like the classical epigrammatists whose work he has taught, Barth is bitter but redeemingly witty and insightful. Every reader should find at least one epigram here that he or she will reread, remember, and pass along. Barth's earlier small-press publications, many about his war experiences in Viet Nam, are hard to find but well worth seeking. This desktop publishing chapbook should be enjoyed and then preserved against the day when Barth is widely recognized as one of the most honest, talented, and uncompromising veteran writers from any of our wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"the genetic family history","review":"this book is out of date and does not reference autoimmune diseases in relation to rheumatologic disorders such as lupus and leaves out any family genetics in hispanic disorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I received a bottle of this for christmas last year, and it is one of the best olive oils I have ever tasted!

But unfortunately, it mistakes this proclamtion of hope as missional, even if the message remains within the walls of the worshiping space.My dictionary has 12 definitions for \\"mission,\\" everyone of them implies an action. This book rarely talks of Christian mission as an action. For these writers mission is simply the declaration of justice and hope God gives the world--which is taking place within a worshiping community. There is little sense of actually taking this mission statement out to the people who could benefit from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book's a good read and a terrific resource.","review":"I found this book to be very well organized; a plus for a book with this title.

Not only that but the graphics are realy chunky and badly detailed.When WARZONE looked so great you would expect them to spend a little more time making it visualy appealing . Its not atotal failure though,there are loads of characters and moves and its nice to beat up on Hollywood Hogan or Goldberg for once instead of Kane or Stone Cold.

The ring enterances are improved, the play control is very easy to master but still has a lot of surprises, there's a very cool Quest For the Best and Royal Rumble mode, a Spirit meter instead of a life meter, and tons of awesome wrestlers. The costume change mode is more in-depth than World Tour's, too.There are a few flaws, however. The graphics, although improved over World Tour, are still a bit blocky. The animation's kinda cheesy (although WAY better than the hyperfast or super slow Acclaim WWF games.) And if could have used more game options (all it has is Singles, Tag Team, Handicap, and Royal Rumble.)Overall, it's a good buy, especially if you have friends playing with you (as a multiplayer it eats Goldeneye's gun tag for lunch.) So far, it's my fave wrestling game, it's definately better than Warzone, Attitude, Nitro, and Mayhem.

The choice of wrestlers is very good though. The battle royal mode is a disappointment. It takes forever to win but when you do nothing happens. Basically it says, \\"You won.\\" What fun is that? Any gamer will win with any wrestler regardless of size. When will we see a game where the actual storylines and drama of wrestling come into play?

But still, they could look worse....And the gameplay is still easy to pick up & enjoy! Infact, I wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple & fluid as on this N64 game. If they could remake this game w/ an expansive create a player/wrestler and simple controls. I'd easily buy that too! I highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector.

While my daughter easily understood the game play, she and I both were done after just finding a couple of each others boats. It just takes too long and doesn't compete with the many entertainment options.As for construction, I will confirm other reviewer comments that the build quality is poor. I remember that in my old game, the pegs would sit firmly in the holes. Now, with a simple move of the board, pegs can fall down, causing you to lose your place. They also don't sit well in the boat pieces. I also received a number of crooked pieces, making them useless.I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't be disappointed by this game.

But I have to give this edition one star, for its fatal flaw: the pegs fall out of the holes very easily. This is mildly inconvenient if you want to suspend your game and resume later, because if you try to fold up the game board, you'll lose your pieces. But the pieces are so loose, they can fall out if someone just bumps into the table. One false move and you lose the whole game. I guess this is true of lots of games, like chess, but Battleship, with those pegs in a vertical surface, is a special case. There's no excuse for making pieces that are the wrong size."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great direct bury wire","review":"this is a great direct bury wire. the cables are thick and the outer sourounding is thick and strong also.

I personally think pre-teens should not even think about playing this game, yet I'm sure many have. Parents be warned, this game is far more grusome than The Patriot in my opinion. This is a very long and tedious, yet fun game. So far it is the best game in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Turok 2 is a great first person shooter. It's only real fault is the frame rate, which is horrible. In Turok 1 the framerates weren't bad, although they had problems. In the sequal, the framerate ruins the whole game. Everything else is almost perfect, the graphics are astounding, as is the AI and weaponry. Even with no baddies on the screen, the framrate dips pretty low, and if you have 2 or more monsters on the screen, it gets almost impossible to shoot accuratly. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, but if you can't stand low framerates like me, you might want to hold onto your cash.

The puzzles and gameplay on some levels does get repetitive, it barely takes away from the overall experiance. The weapons in single player are some of the best I've seen. In the multi player you and a friend can choose in being a few different people and fictional beasts, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The only gripe that I have with the game is that you cannot use some of the weapons in the multi player levels. The game is hard, and the controls are confusing, but if you enjoy games like Goldeneye or Quake, this will give you a nice challenge and a good emersive game. I would definately rent this one before you buy as the gore may be too much for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turok 2: Lost in Caves","review":"I guess that it had been a while since I had played Turok I and so I went out and got II. The graphics and action are very good but the downfall is that you have to keep backtracking into former levels (that I often don't remember from playing a couple of days ago) when you acquire a needed piece of the puzzle. This has caused me to quit the game out of tedium as I cannot unlock a level and have grown tired of back tracking to hidden areas for the needed keys. Mind you I say all this even with a gaming guide open on my lap as I play. So unless you are really dedicated/obsessive (I could see doing this when I was 15-18 years old) I can't advise wasting your time with more aggravation when you are just looking for a couple hours of escapist fare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turok 2","review":"Love this game.

It by no means is due to the lack of thought put into the game at all. It is very challenging yet has very little strategy to it. Also, there probably is little desire to kill dinosaurs for the viewer. Here is where other games like Goldeneye 007 (for N) shine. A real highlight of the game is multiplayer. It has great multiplayer action. It is hilarious to shoot someone in the butt with an arrow....and watch him run around all day long with an arrow still stuck in him. This game isn't the best you can buy, and it is by no means anywhere near the worst.

She tells things like they are, and she makes no apologies for some of her bad behavior! But she also lets you know that PERFECTION can be a disease, and she lets you in on how to fight that.I love this book! It's not a literary masterpiece in conventional terms ... more like a gab session with one of your wildest friends. Definitely funny! Definitely shocking! And so much fun you don't want it to end.I don't care if her modeling advice is suspect (as one reviewer noted), or if she's seen as just another washed up model.

Janice has not worked as a model for 20 years, and when she did work she had a VERY bad reputation for being difficult. Please , do not use her advice.

I guess this is what happens when a person has gotten by all their life on looks and has no substance. This kind of bragging about millionaires and movie/rock stars would only appeal to the teenage crowd of whom would be hardly likely to read a book written by a washed up old model who refuses to let go. Never would of been published had she not been well known decades ago. FAR from being the first super model!

From the moment you blow the first Probe droid to smithereens to the second you blow the last enemy to bits this game enthralls you. The missions are great, although at first some seem boring, when you get to about mission five it gets a lot tougher and better. You get to fly five craft, X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing, V-Wing plus a Snowspeeder which you can take AT-AT's down using the tow cable like in Shadows Of The Empire. There is hundreds of enemies ranging from Probe Droids to Cloud Cars to AT-ATs. Something that isn't in the first three films is the AT-PT, All Terrain-Personel Transport, which are tougher than the AT-st's but not half as hard as the tough as nails AT-AT's. From start to finish this game is great, and the medal system lenthens the game a massive lot, you have to replay the missions to get Gold medal on all levels to access secrets like the Millinium Falcon, T-16 Skyhoppers plus Battle of Hoth mission. This is a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for star wars fans","review":"This game was very good if you love Star Wars.

There is a lot of action and a lot of enemies to destroy. The enemies you destroy are : Tie Fighters , AT-STs , AT-ATs , Laser Turrets , Missle Turrets , and more. There are plenty of levels to choose from , and there are two secret levels \\"The Battle Of Hoth\\" and \\"The Death Star.\\" You can use the Naboo Star Fighter as your star craft at times , which is good because it shoots lasers very smoothly and is very fast. The characters you play as who fly the star crafts you control are Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antillies. The levels you go through are intense. And my favorite level on Star Wars Rogue Squadron is the Defection At Correllia. Star Wars Rogue Squadron is the perfect video game for people who own a Nintendo 64.

My favorite part of this game is the special ships, such as the Naboo N-1 Starfighter and the Millenium Falcon, as well as a buick that looks like the \\"flying car\\" from MIB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that loyal to the movie","review":"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \\"Mission Complete\\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't set wheel to desired number as described in the directions","review":"I needed to start at a number higher than 1 and can't set the wheel as described in the directions. I now have an expensive paper weight instead of a numbering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Full of awkward stereotypes, what could be a decent chick lit book is marred by poor writing ridiculous & silly characters . There's some real emotional content there but it's buried inside inanities. This book actually made me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy and entertaining.","review":"Easy read and fun. The story depends on the foolishness of the characters and is not a well woven tale but it was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"I purchased the book because of all the great reviews and because the plot seemed really interesting...It started out boring and after 10% on my Kindle it didn't improve (this is generally the amount of attention I give to every book, boring or not). And after 20 % it didn't improve. After 23 % I gave up. This is just bad writing. Too much about the past and too little about the task at hand (reinventing Mona)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinventing boring","review":"I am one of few who did not like this book. It certainly was not the worst book I have read and I breezed through it in a couple of days, but there were parts that were so entirely unreasonable I just wanted it to be over. I know its fiction, but it wasn't believable fiction. Plus the conclusion was a joke, and not a laughing with you joke, rather a laughing at you joke. To her Credit, Coburn made the other characters very likeable. Coburn has great potential, I just felt that she was pushing her charcter in a direction that no real person would go. Though she was REinventing Mona, so maybe I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I couldn't put down","review":"I saw it on Amazon. I read the description and was like eh. But once I started reading I was hooked! THis was a book that was different than what I usually read but loved it. At times *spoilers* you have to really pay attention because it goes on a different route. It kept me reading and will be reading more from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J Love Lucy....Or.Mona","review":"First off props to Jennifer. it's not easy writting romance and while this kne was predictable, its the events that made it interesting.My critiques: Spoiler alert. I don't like how the christian guy turns out to be tbe \\"bad guy\\" in tbe story.Also, and not to sound perverted but We dont get to hear about Mona 's first sex adventure after so many years. We wondered how she would handle love, kissing and everything else amwd that was all skipped. I can do without details, but would have been nice to see how she dealt with it. since thats how the book began..As for the book \\"Christian\\"? I found it on Kindle under that tag and Mona started ti sound Christian but she was far from one. Luckily Im an open mjnded Christian. Otherwise I woukd have rated it 2 stars dur to the cursing, lesbianonic moments and the sex talk. but overall a good book if you can get passed all that stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be something better for you to read than this","review":"I've read quite a few books in the \\"Chick lit\\" genre and this one would have to be the worst of the lot. It starts out as a serious book with a horrific tragedy, but then moves on to scenarios that were so outlandish they weren't even close to believable. Maybe they were supposed to be funny? Bottom line: I just didn't enjoy it. It wasn't laugh out loud funny (like so many in this category are), it didn't hold together, and it just wasn't convincing at all.It felt to me like the author couldn't decide what to do with this book. If you have a choice, I would opt for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book!","review":"This is without a doubt the most awful book that I have ever read. The story idea was cute and could have made a fantastic book...but this book was just horrible. I have no idea how it can be considered a romance novel. There is not one ounce of romance in the entire book. There is no way that a reader would think that Mike and Mona have fallen in love by the end of the book...and speaking of the ending it was a completely ridiculous and unrealistic ending and frankly it wasn't even funny. I don't usually write reviews and I usually give ever book I read atleast 3 or 4 stars even if it was just okay...if I could have given this book less than 1 star I would have. Please don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Fun, quick read. Yes, it's predictable, but it was an enjoyable read.

I didn't want to stop reading so I took the book with me everywhere I went...doctors appointments, gym, my son's swim lessons... I read it every chance I had. I'm sure I got strange looks as I laughed out loud many times while reading. This is a fun read and totally entertaining. Coburn is so funny, witty and clever.

As the writer got bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST","review":"I cant say that I wasn't disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for Mona, but this book was so dull I wanted to cry. I try my hardest to make it to the end, and unbelievably I did. The ending was laughable, and not in a good way. One of the WORST I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much self help","review":"May be just me but there was too much self help and syco babble for my taste.Didn't even finish it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"The leading character, Mona, is the luckiest person on earth. SUPER rich because her grandma left her millions of dollars. At 30, she retired. To me, her character is contradicting. At her young teenage time, she experienced death of her whole family (a total of almost 20 people) leaving her staying with her super wealthy grandma. Yet, she did not show any feelings at all... it was like... cold-blooded.She was looking for love in a very naive attitude - hiring actors to play the game. I also always wonder whether if it is possible to get close to someone who just simply a 10 minute introduction from a stranger? The author carefully avoided any sex scene perhaps her character of being a christian. (That's a praise from me.) I think the closing of the book was over exaggerated.I still like the total feeling about this book as it really displayed true love is being your true self. Nothing can beat that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I liked this book. Mona is likable and the story kept me engaged. I will look for more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinventing Mona","review":"Good story line, but fails to deliver.

Too much sex and cursing. Some things just aren't necessary to make a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave 2 stars for the first half, and zero star for the rest.","review":"The idea of the book could have made a fantastic story. But it wasn't. The beginning of the book was good but the ending was the worst part of this book. I just hate it. It was ridiculous. It wasn't at all worth my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"What started out with potential turned into a total wasted read. Towards the end, there were too many non-important characters introduced and then everything ended abruptly. There was no real relationhip development between Mona and Mike and Adam was a complete loser. Not sure that I will read another book by this author after this awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you Commenters","review":"glad I read the reviews! I have The Wife of Reilly, and am still trying to read it, not for lack of time but because the story is dragging and I just can't get into it. I thought, okay the Author has another book, I'll try it, but thanks to the reviews I will save money and time. I only gave this book 1 star even though I never read it, but because Amazon will not let me comment without rating, dumb concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and thought-provoking","review":"Fun read! Enjoyed Mona\` s transformation - kept my attention with every chapter! What a ride; thank you for a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, miss bigger paperback version","review":"I used to own the larger paperback version and I loaned to someone and never got it back. I bought this one to replace the other. This is one of my favorite novels that I read from time to time. Totally about finding oneself and making friends with people whom you never thought about. I like the larger version as it was easier to hold and read, but this is easier to tuck into my purse. If I had the resources, I would turn this one into a movie....it would be a hit. I see Sandra Bullock in the lead role and Matthew McCon as Mike the \\"DOG.\\" The stripper sister would be perfect for Kathrine Heigl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It and Want more like it","review":"I did not expect this book to be a strong romance novel. I was expecting something more along the lines of Bergdorf Blondes, The Botox Diaries and The Dirty Girls Social Club. I was wrong but I in a good way. I found the charactor of Mona to be pretty relatable, despite her having grown up on a commune. I loved Mike \\"The Dogs\\" charactor and I feel his feelings were portrayed pretty on par with men today. I would love to find similar books to this hip fun modern romance.Only problem was the sugary sweet ending, but I must confess I am very critical of book endings. I want a happy ending, but I also want a believable one and this one was a bit too high in the \\"gag me\\" factor. If you can get past that this book is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I saw that \\"Reinventing Mona\\" had gotten pretty good reviews here so I bought. I'm really glad that I did because this book was so good. The story was a little different then I thought it would be, but in a good way. In some ways I could identify with Mona and that made me really like her character and root for her. I won't give away the ending for those who haven't read the book yet but the ending was so good and it made me a happy reader. This was my first Jennifer Coburn book and I will definitely be reading \\"The wife of Reily\\" and anything else she comes out with. So if you are looking for a good light read, this book is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Early Edition is a great show and I recommend everyone watch it. This DVD was long overdue to be released, hope we will see the remaining seasons real soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Bout Time!!!","review":"It's about time that this gets released. As a Chicago native it's great to see so much of the city (and some of it's residents - a younger Bert Natarus for example) on the small screen.

This show from the late '90's holds up ok. Some of the story lines are silly and not the greatest, but Kyle is terrific as a guy who gets tomorrow's paper today and uses it to help people. The most annoying thing is the narration at the beginning and end, really bad, overdone writing and Fisher Stevens' voice grates on me. Just mute it or fast forward it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The product was just what I was hoping for, and the reason I made the order.

I watched the first 2 seasons back in Mexico and the last 2 in Sydney, so I associate this show with a transition period in my life. The show is light hearted and inspiring without spilling honey all over and making you want to gag.I got season 1 and 2 as a birthday present. I was planning on pacing myself and was going to watch one episode a week but I have watched 11 episodes instead in less than a week, it's so good it's addictive.Does any one know by any chance when seasons 3 and 4 are coming out? at this rate I am going to end up watching both seasons 1 and 2 in less than a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary for a general audience","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the narration, the expert commentaries, and the computer graphics (which give a clear view of the battlefield and dispositions).

What makes Pictionary so much fun no matter how much you play it are:1. Each player has his/her own imagination. So no matter how often you play the game, each player might draw or guess differently the same card!2. It's fun for parents to enjoy it with their teens.3. It's fun for friends to play it together.4. It's fun when men play against their wives (oh I love this one)!Do you know it's very difficult to draw simple objects? Just try drawing anything and see what others guess it. Oh sometime they go very far that even if you wanted them to guess that word they'd have not :-)One of the best games that are as good as this one (if not better) is Taboo! Have fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All age-groups and use dry erase boards","review":"Pictionary is a great game that anyone can play. You can play with your entire family and people from different age-groups. Kids can play as long as they are told what the words mean, and even people who do not speak English so well can enjoy this game. It is a great ice-breaker for anyone. I pull it out for parties without worrying about who will fit in or who will feel left out.Our family has been playing this game with dry erase boards for a while now. Not only does it save on paper, it is so much more fun. There are new strategies in eraseing pictures and using multiple colors. It really changed our game nights with these boards. My husband just purchased whiteboards at, eraseboards.com(?), I think. Pretty affordable. Every Pictionary owner should try using dry erase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"Pictionary is a holiday tradition in our family.

Please, don't throw away your hard-earned money, get yourself a fun and more worthwile game, like Trivial Pursuit, or Clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This game is a classic because it's funny when other players CAN'T draw and surprising when they can. That's why I like all of the party games that give you an opportunity to discover the hidden talents of your friends and family like Rigmarole, Taboo and Cranium."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com","review":"This game is a new classic, celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. It came out just as the board game market was being flooded with Trivial Pursuit imitators, and because it was so different, it stood out in the crowd and became a huge hit.It's become something of a cultural icon, being featured in movies (remember that great scene in When Harry Met Sally, where Sally's trying to draw \\"Baby Talk\\" and Jess shouts out \\"Baby Fish Mouth\\"?) and has become a staple in many game closets.This game is deservedly popular, and will remain popular for many years to come. It's a great housewarming gift to help a newlywed couple or recent college graduate build up their collection of games.

It has a great range of characters to play with and has a phenomenal lasting plot/story. I played it several of times with many different characters and never got tired because of the seemingly endless array of possibilities with buying upgrades and abilities of the different characters. Buy this game if you are a Marvel maniac or if you want a game similar to Xmen legends 1/2, or want to know how the first game was before the second one came out.

But is missing something to become a great game.You have over 20 characters to play in the game, but only once does it seem to make a difference who your playing.Building a specific team, Fantastic 4, Avengers, etc does give your team bonuses in XP, Health, Focus etc.Side games are good to get a sample of the other characters, and they are challenging since most of them you're playing only 1 character, not the team.The game play is fun, but repetitive and there seems to be bugs on assigning abilities to the controller.

The words are not that meaningful. The lyrics are dull though she picked best composers.The pictures are horrible. She always looked better than that. The best songs was 'Save The Day' and the english version of 'Tu Y Yo'. The remix of 'The Mexican' was not good. 'I Want You' was good but not like 'Arrasando'. I know she could do better than that.

Why, make an English album of course. Despite my limited espanol, I've been a Thalia fan for quite a while. Her latest crossover album, however, is bland and uninspired. Her best songs are still sung in Spanish, because they were delivered with the confidence and sureness that the English songs lacked. It is a real pity that, nowadays, an artist have to sing what she thinks the public likes and not what she's good at in order to sell records. We've seen it all too often before with Shakira, Paulina and even America's own Jewel (Kilcher). At least those records aren't bad.

The most important thing to be remebered, in fact the only thing that should be said about this album is this...It lacks personality!!This, coming from an artist who's known to inject that \\"special little something\\" into her music! What made her previous releases so compelling was the fiery, sharp-witted, self assured delivery and soul that was so full of life and joy. She seems to be going through the motions on ALL of the ENGLISH tracks, not till you get to the second half of the disc, the SPANISH half, do you sense why Thalia is one of he biggest stars in Latin America, making this relase all the more disappointing. for what its worth, the pictures in the booklet are GORGEOUS...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's kind of good","review":"This ablum is okay, but I think that people who are very interest in Latin music will love it so much. But if you wnat to buy and CD that does not contend beats...please select another CD. The most update song in this CD is \\"I want to\\"- featuring Fat Joe. But after I don't like it that much because maybe I am not really interest in listening to Latin music...but it is good enough. I think you might want to try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick To Spanish","review":"I really dislike this CD (Ok, ok she is better then Paulina Rubio in English (Paulina is today's WORST singer, Brittney and Justin included)). There is no heart to this CD, just more dance tracks like JLO does. There are a few singers who can crossover into different genres and still be good: Shania Twain, Shakira, Linda Ronstadt, and of course, Elvis come to mind. Thalia is not on that level, she should do songs with meaning such as \\"Rosalinda\\", as opposed to \\"Another Girl\\", which could be called \\"Another Girl SINGER\\" because there is nothing to differenciate Thalia from anyone else. If anyone who is unfamiliar with Thalia, and wants to listen to her, go get \\"Arrasando\\" and enjoy it. PS: You can still love it without understanding Espanol (I don't understand it either), but it is a great listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Did Thalia just turn 15.....I discovered Thalia a few years ago and have been blown over by her last few albums. More fun than Shakira, more of an artist than Paulina....but what is this crock? I feel like I bought a new CD by Mariah or Christina...not my beloved Thalia. And what is with this new look...she serious looks 15! And since this is her 10th CD I am sure that she is a few years older than that.....Thalia....I want the old you back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats not Thalia !!","review":"Well. First I thought, wow Thalia will sing in english, why not. But I can say that this Record is not her best. I love really her music, but its not her style. Where is the Rhythm and the flair?? All songs have the same style. RMB sounds and Thalia's voice NO!!I hope its her one and only Record in english.The first 10 songs are in english. The other five songs are the same like five of the first ten songs, only in spanish.Sorry Thalia, come back to your roots. You can sing in english but dont lose your style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"In my opinion, THALIA is a great , talented artist. This cd is average. She's very hip-hopish it's ok, songs are very powerful, but when I'm listening to it, I feel that something's missing... Thalia can really sing, she's great at it. Nobody can say, that she's a bad singer. If you don't believe, listen to her older tracks like \\"la vie en rose (life as a rose)\\", \\"no hay que lloral (why do I cry)\\", or No me ensenaste.1. Don't look back (Toda la felicidad) - my favorite, very happy song, should be 4th single2. Cerca de ti (Closer to you) - Hot latin tracks #13. Save the day - Great medium tempo4. Baby I'm in love (Alguien real)- 2nd single5. Misbehavin'- Very r'n'b song, should be 5th single6. Another girl - It's excellent7. I want you feat. Fat Joe - Everybody knoes it:)8.

This diva is no singer (and no actress either). This material probably wouldn't even make it on a J-Lo or Paulina Rubio production. Nevertheless, even if it's critically trashed and a commercial flop the U.S., the Mexican press will, as usual, turn a blind eye and deaf ear (as they've often done with everything she does)and hail her as a crossover hit, money talks and Tommy M has that along with enough clout to force that kind of publicity. But to be fair her English pronounciation is good. One star, take away her \\"singing\\" and perhaps I'll add 2 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"she sucks big time","review":"i got 2 spanish cd of her in both suck!in what is she trying to do be the next j-lo will she cant she has no ass in is very ugly her voice sucks i would kill someone instand of hearing her sing in english dont buy this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Next Time Thalia","review":"One thing I must say I think that it was great that Thalia would switch over to english. I think my problem with this album the most was the lyrics and sme beats that sounded similar to other artist that had hit songs out at the sametime. On one song she sang about \\"I can do this, I can do that, I can pull a rabbit out of my hat\\"......Ummm ok. Then \\"I don't need no rock to be off the block\\" I think she was trying to mock Jennifer Lopez. On the track \\"What's It Gonna Be Boy\\" that song sounded oddly fimilar to Brandy's \\"What About Us\\". I think the lyircs were not strong. She was just ryhming to ryhm. There was no feeling or heart into it. I think maybe next english album she should put more heart into the project instead of just singing in english. I've had this album for years now but it's going to the donation pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Jlo...","review":"This album has absolutely nothing to offer .

What a waste of money. She only has one decent song on this CD. Some artists need to know what their specialty is and stay there. This crossover does not agree with her AT ALL. Did she not listen to herself when she was recording this CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THALIA ENGLISH DEBUT WITHOUT MUSICAL PERSONALITY","review":"Musicly, this compilation has nothing new and exciting to offer, she is an entertainer that has no direction, the only virtue she has, is her beauty and her ability to make people feel sorry for her, trough her constant media exposure, fake news about her personal life and excesive publicty.Her musical career has gone nowhere after marriying to mogul Mottola, ex of Mariah carey, the difference is that Mariah has a REAL voice. Thalia's english debut is the less Thalia cd, trying to sound to Minogue or Lopez or Rubio.Another quality of this latin star is to do FARSE in the spanish soap operas, her career is a complete farse, a REAL PRODUCT. Honestly i would not buy this HITS not even download it from internet, it may cointain a virus.But she still PRETTY. Kisses Thalia and all her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets worst as her \\"career\\" goes on!","review":"One of the worst albums ever released, Thalia tries extremely hard to gain the American public. Her songs have weak lyrics, her voice sounds like a kitty being strangled and the r&b beats are fake. This is a true waste of studio time, composer time, and our time. True waste of plastic, paper, and energy. Spend your money on something else, as this is a true hit& miss by the very untalented Mrs. Motola."},{"rating":"1","title":"closer to.....................crap","review":"This is thalia's second full english album. the first one was released only in Philipines and on it was included some tracks in english. this album lost all Thalia's scent, this is not her typical music, her spanish album THALIA is her best work to date.

Enrique Iglesias came second, for being the most talented of the crossovers. Then Shakira and Paulina Rubio, the first one for being the most successful female, and the second for being the first Mexican crossover.

She only sold 180.000 albums in USA and only have a million worldwide."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm....","review":"Okay, now I'm puerto rican and I'm sorry but I see nothing going for this album. I like the three first songs 'I Want You', 'Baby, I'm in Love' and 'Misbehavin' but that's about it. She doesn't suck, I mean she did good for a first English album but she can do better. And for that one person, Thalia isn't ugly at all. She probably looks better than you but yet I don't judge women.

True to the reproduction, there was no reverb on the amp. This box was a cheap way to add it. The only downside are the little silver knobs which pop off easily, but I just set them where I wanted them (not a real wide range of sound offered up by the knobs anyway)and held them in place with a piece of electric tape. The result -- a very nice reverb/echo effect on my vintage repro tube amp which I use primarily for lap steel. If you don't need something heavy duty to stomp on, and don't want to put out a lot of money, this is a nice solution to get some cool 50s reverb/echo into your tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the sand paper","review":"After reading reviews on the poor quality of the hook and loop model 333, I settled on the adhesives back model 334. The local hardware store and the home depot don't carry the 5\\" 5 whole paper. The only place to buy the sanding disk is here on amazon.com. Porter cable didn't supply a device for punching holes in the whole less paper. I guess I could by a paper whole punch and make my own holes. To do again I would by the model that uses standard sheet paper and the unit also comes with a paper punch. The manufacture recommends not to leave the paper stuck to the pad for long periods of time. You can't take the same disk on and off to many times. The best part of this model is the suction created from the spinning for the dust collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genesis: Translation and Commentary by Robert Alter (Kindle Edition - Sep 17, 1997) - Kindle eBook","review":"Was enjoying Mr. Alter's work but this Kindle Edition is so full of errors I got frustrated and returned for a refund.I wonder that authors don't make an attempt to ensure their works published via eBooks are free of blatant errors such as paragraphs being cut off and pages being out of order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Translation - but a better deal is available","review":"This translation is wonderful - but note that it appears to replicate Genesis in \\"The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary\\", also by Alter.

The writing style is over a thousand years old, this combined with the density of the material makes it a very time consuming read. The text requires a lot of analyzing and critical thinking while reading. While it is a hard and dense read, in the end it is a very rewarding one. You cannot claim to have an understanding of literature until you have read Genesis. Being one of the first true texts and the guide to life for many, many great novels have drawn connections both to and from it. Robert Alter's translation of one the greatest texts ever written is magnificent. He uses a great deal of footnotes to help in the translation and explain the old Hebrew. Genesis is truly a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alter's book deserves better than this (ebook version specific)","review":"Alter's translation of Genesis is superb and he provides an exhaustive level of insight into the source material. Too bad the publisher didn't treat such scholarship with a little more respect--this Kindle version is appallingly bad.

Not this book. It is full of info that's new to me. In fact, this is the only book I need. There's alot of contradictory information out there about what you can and cannot eat, but this book is pretty accurate. Check it out, it certainly helped me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting graphics and cool items","review":"Zelda \\"occarina of time\\" is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around, the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world, play carnival-like games to win power-ups, collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword, but you can't use a shield), magically powered arrows, and more!This game is fairly easy to beat, but finding everything will take you much longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda, a legacy to live on.","review":"Zelda 64 is an awsome game.

It's far too dark and serious, and the playing style is nowhere near the first four Zelda games. Those of us who remember the early NES Zelda games as children and teenagers will be heartbroken after being exposed to this game.On another note: How did Ocarina of Time get an ESRB rating of E? After playing this game and feeling how dark it is, I think it should get a rating of T (teens and up) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a rpg at all","review":"my first impression of this game was really frustrating, 'cause i was one of many gamers that i know to be fooled by that big expectation nintendo created about this game. I expected something huge, a really big rpg easily capable to beat ff7, but when i played i found out it was not even a rpg. I mean, there are no skills, no level ups, and you can control just that link guy. The graphics are not the best ones i've seen in the n64, not mentioning the poor storyline which is based in that old story -the bad guy picks the princess and you, the hero, have to solve the problem. Very poor game! if you want real rpgs you should try some playstation titles like xenogears, breath of fire 3, legend of legaia, star ocean: second story among others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro: Soundtrack Cons: What isn't a pro","review":"There's many that love this so-called masterpiece, but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack.

I have to say that this is the most boring game I have ever played.The whole ocarina thing has really no point at all. This is a very hard game to control. The horse that you win (Epona) is very hard to turn around coners. And when you are in the water, it is very hard to move slowly (ex. if someting is under you that you have to get)I would recomend not geting this game unless you want to sit through hours of text.Also, This is not an RPG!!! an rpg does not have the kind of fight sceens in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game","review":"this is the 1st game in the chronological time order series. the one in 1987 already takes place after this game. so when you pop this game in, you are seeing the beginnig of the legend, better yet, playing it. that last game in the series is the one from 1988, when link has to battle himself. but in ths game, you half to use ur mind more than ur physicall abilitys. but it is fun to play, you cant stop. the game really starts to get mind blowing when you enter that jabu-jabu fish. then it proggresses more harder with each temple you fight threw. i would say you would alf to buy a players guide for this game, like i had too."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY MOLY!!

He's the toughest boss so far... I still haven't beatn him!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hook,line,and sinker.","review":"Personaly I love fishing on Zelda the ocarina of time. It's a perfect thing to do if your stuck on something. Here's a little hint for you: If your an adult,the fish will be bigger.[duh]. Now here's the big thing. Go to the fishing pond around Lake Hylia at night. Look around the pond and cast into the sweet spot.[that's around the log],and wiggle the line. I did this and caught a fish as big as me.[link not me in real life]. If your just starting as an adult you've got two choices. Work your way through the temples to restore the water, or plant a magic bean when your a kid and ride the hover leaf after becoming an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Ever!","review":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best game ever.

This is a masterpiece and if you want a video game that is sure to be a timeless classic, this is the game to get, this game is a reason to buy an n64!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game!","review":"This took me quite a while to beat! Although it really should have a Teen rating cuz it is pretty violent (which I think is cool myself) little children shouldnt play it. Forget about these people who give it low ratings: they dont know what they are talking about. This is an awesome game, buy it. Then buy the sequel when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very little to complain about!","review":"It's all been said this game is fantasic! It's loads of fun and very challenging! But it's not really the action that keeps you the most challenged it's the puzzles.The only tiny cons I found were the fairy was a little annoying sometimes. ... Other then that the only thing I found that bothered me was that when you found items like keys and compases it never failed, to every time tell you exactly what they did! It's like I know already you've told me the last 10 dungeons! I know what the key does, it opens doors, HOW DO YOU THINK I\\"VE GOTTEN THIS FAR! :) oh well. There should have been an option to turn that off! OII! This game is great! and I bought an N64 just to play it! that should say something."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't already GET THIS GAME","review":"I bought this game cause all my friends told me to get it. I was wary cause I never did like the Zelda games until now. This is by far the best game I have ever played it even manages to beat Goldeneye 007 in my own personal scale. If you own a Nintendo 64 why in the world do you not already own this game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Great Game for All Ages!","review":"I'm very happy that I bought this game for my 9 yrs old son! It's very hard to find a good game that makes you think, not just \\"Go kill him\\"... This game is great for problem solving, also very entertaining. It's a challenge for the whole family without the strategy guide. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Perfection!","review":"Travel from deep within a watery temple, to the very heart of a volcano. Explore marvelous ice caves, and journy to a scorching desert. \\"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time\\" is all this and much much more. The game has exceptional graphics and mind- bending puzzles. And let's not forget the Fun Factor. What more could you want? The game is truly a masterpiece, \\"a beautiful work of art\\". If you own an N64, then you simply must have this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best nintendo64 games","review":"I first played this when I rented it.After that I had to have it.I was amazed.I still am.It was really cool going around and collecting spiritual stones.Then you have to collect medallions.The graphics and sound fit game really really well.It wouldnt be right to own a nintedo64 and not have this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Game EVER","review":"I've loved this game since I was in second grade. I've played playstation games, nintendo gamecube games, all those other sorts of newer game systems, but this is still the greatest game ever. The plots great, the graphics are awesome, and the characters totally rock. Even if you don't feel like fighting bad guys all the time, there's still other great stuff to play around with. Zelda Majoras Mask is also a great game, I would definitely recommend both of these games to anyone who loves video games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtual Console Benefits!","review":"I own the original of this, and beat it. I also bought the Virtual Console version of it on the Wii, and I must say, STILL AMAZING. Though the graphics are getting out-dated, the gameplay keeps you wanting and craving the end result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Link's Back!","review":"In this new adventure, you face new enemies, solve cool puzzles, and meet new people. Most games don't have the kind of involvment that this one does.Collect items to advance in the game. This game is the most fun i've had in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intoxicating adventure","review":"I thought this game was brilliant and played it incessantly; frequently staying up until the early hours of the morning driven by the intoxicating adventure. There's no real need for me to mention the graphic because it's all been said before but the attention to detail is such that the sun rises and sets changing the landscape hues accordingly. The levels are incredably diverse in creatures, noises, tasks etc that you can't wait to get to the next stage to experience more. Another good thing about the game is that, in addition to running around overcoming monsters etc, it requires stratagy and stealth. Sometimes the tasks are too much to solve and you really need to look at some gaming hints to get on. I cant wait until Nintendo release another Zelda game - I though it was so good. So good, in fact, that I haven't bought many more games since because I can't find one that compares."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET IT....NOW","review":"If you have an N64, buy this game. It is, by far, the best N64 game you can get. Link can no longer throw his sword when he has full health, but he doesnt need to 'cause hes got a million weopons and magic moves and even a horse so that he can get the job done. There is not one problem with this game, and anyone can play it. good graphics, perfect sound, INCREDIBLE replay value, and mini quests if you ever get stuck......oh yeah, and same good ol' hack and slash Zelda battle system (but more skill involved). A MUST BUY. TRUST ME. BEST GAME EEEEEVVVVVEEEERRRR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Classic Game","review":"You must own this if you like games. It's spectacular in every way, perfect.

It has incredible graphics, awesome sound, and perfect play control. The Story, although Generic, is done very well and is the main factor that draws you back to the game. You will have fun coming back and playing this game long after you have beaten it. If you arent one of the 8 Million people who already own this masterpiece, then you should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST Dazzling N64 Title Ever!","review":"\\"The Legend of Zelda 64: The Ocarina of Time\\" is truly the most magical, exciting and amazing video game ever played. The story is absolutely enchanting, a young fairy boy on an exciting quest to save an entire kingdom. The visuals are without a doubt dazzling, and it's very very involving. The creative side of creating your own music through your own Ocarina of Time is also a great aspect.The ending is simply genius! I almost cried at the ending, that is has moving this game is to me. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone and anyone. Just absorb everything and remember everything, and most of all have a great time playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This HAS to be the best game ever!","review":"I have a ps2, with Jak and Daxter and FFX (and I loved both) but this game leads them by FAR! The game has a great story line, a cool main character, good graphics (for n64) and brilliant gameplay! I've beat this game about 50 times and I'm still not bored of it. There is so much to do, and so much to see and beat. One of the best parts about this game is the puzzles. You actually have to think sometimes to defeat a room instead of just fighting and fighting. There are lots of monsters and characters, cool temples (the fire one is my favorite) and good controls. The only downside to this game is that you can't jump whenever you want, you have to go to an edge of somthing before you jump. Maybe that makes it easier. This is the best game I own, if you don't have it, take out you wallet and buy it right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda Ocarina","review":"do u want a fun game? if so then Buy Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time! this has so many challenges and puzzles u'll wish u were at school where the tests are easy(actually no one wants to go to school unless they're derranged or something). If u have a choice between this game and Majora's Mask, buy this because it is alot more fun. Link is back with new enemies, friends, and oh yes the fat gorons that want to hug u! buy this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding game..!","review":"I would recommend this game for anyone..You can learn alot of skills by playing this game..you increase your common sense and you learn to observe things better..the graphics and music is great (especially coming out of a cartridge), one small flaw though.. there is a very huge landscape..the land of hyrule to huge..sometimes (around the beginning of the game) you tend to get lost.. sooon enough though u get the hang of it and everything comes pretty naturally then..but untill you get that horse its a pain in the neck to get from one place to another..for bux this game will give a xpierieced gamer about 3 weeks of playing everyday..and a newbie..probably like 5 to 6 weeks..one suggestion though..please do not get a players guide..it defeats the whole purpose of an RPG especially one like Zelda..so for the price its worth every penny..just buy it..!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever Made","review":"Amazing. This one word completely wraps up this game. Everything about it just stuns anyone who plays it. The soundtrack is one of a kind. The game play was the first of its kind. I played this game when it came out, and i still come back and play through it. You can never get enough. It was voted Best Game of the year by several notable magazines and other company's. The lowest rating it got from everyone who rated it gave it a 97.48%. You can never go wrong with this classic and what i would say is the Best Game Ever Created. Thank you Shigeru Miyamoto for creating such an amazing game and experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Game. Ever.","review":"There is a reason this game makes all the 'top 10' lists.I could go on and on about the gameplay mechanics and how revolutionary they were in 1998. Or the graphics and sound and how they are a pleasure even today. But just play the game and you'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!","review":"I have zelda at home and i thought it was really bad at the start because me and my brother couldn't even get past the first level. But once we passed the first level we started to think it was really really good. Once you get the hang of it it is easier because my 5 yr old brother is now able to pass most of the levels. It has good graphics and is challenging but not so challenging that you want to give up, if you are unsure about this buy it because the violence is not that bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Game... no exaggeration!","review":"Wow! This defines an adventure game! Everything about this game is beautiful!Its been 7 years since i got this game. I played it through once and it seemed like i had played it for months.With the Wii being out and the new Zelda game, i have become excited to play the Twilight Princess. Everyone has been talking about how closely it resembles Ocarina of Time. I have been playing my N64 alot these days and i popped this game in. I had totally forgotten all the memories i had of this game! I had my old game saved to the point of entering Ganon's tower and my god! It brought back so many memories! This game is truely amazing in every way! The music is so well done.This game is on my top 5 favorites list, behind Mario 64 and Resident Evil 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good review done by the Smantie","review":"THIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE SUPERIOR GAME EVER MADE!

This game is no exception. It has great graphics, good storyline, and easy contols. Get this game if you don't already have it! ZELDA ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME EVER!","review":"This game is the greatest. It entertains for months to years. It can be frustrating sometimes but the diffcuty is not that high. Players will be astounded by the graphics, easy controls, and puzzles. The lighting and errie music in dungeons suit the mode. Some of the task that you have to do are way to slow but you usally get something very good at the end. The idea of switching from boyhood to manhood is a great concept. The areas look different an older when you switch to manhood. HOWEVER you must get a guide. Its sometimes hard to figure out what to do next. All and All this is the best game ever made. I loved and if you buy it you will to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda is the best ever!!","review":"When I first heard about The Legend of Zelda Ocaraina of Time, I thought that it was some stupid game that would be too hard or too easy. But then I rented it over and over and over again until I bought it! It was awsome. The graphics are wonderful, the temples are beautifuly desighned, and the colors just put me in awe. But, as you get older, the worlds get harder and harder to conquer. You must collect keys, and beat bosses of all kinds. You can talk to the many different races of Hyrule, and ride the wild horse Epona. You will learn many different songs on your ocarina, and earn many different weapons. You must collect (well you don't have to) hearts to keep up your energy, and visit the Great Fairy of Power to get spells that will help you in your journey to defeat Ganondorf and save Hyrule. If you arn't planning on buying this game still, then you should at least rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY LINK!!!","review":"VERY FUN,endless fun,great replay value...now all I want them to make is a Ganondorf game...that would be sweet!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game i ever did play","review":"If anyone knows how to escape from the giant magic tree, please god contact me. Ive been stuck there for 6 years and its causing sleep loss, dperession etc. Anyways, i dont like this game very much, although probably becauase ive lost many friends due to the thousands of hours ive commited to its luminous glow and wind boggling theme tune.

The number of good games to which the Zelda label applies, currently totals 4 (I'm talking about the first four, natch). The others are pure [crud], and I blame OOT for starting it all. It and Majora's Mask are guilty of the first cardinal sin of Zelda: setting it in a 3-D environment.It does NOT belong there! (As for the \\"Oracle\\" series, it's guilty of the first cardinal sin of RPGs: don't ever let Capcom create an RPG. But that's another story.)Really, I ask the world, what in the name of all that is holy was Miyamoto thinking when he conceived the idea of a 3-D Zelda game??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong information on web page","review":"... I purchased the game for him and he waited patiently. But he was very disappointed when it arrived. It was for Nintendo 64, not game cube. When the web page came up, nowhere did it say Nintendo 64.

Zelda is wihtout a doubt the best game to come out in a very very long time. The story line is very dramatic and had a very epic feel and dirves you to trudge forward in your quest. The controls are a abousulte gamers dream come true.. My one minor knock is I would have loved to have a Jump button it would have helped a lot. The graphics are the best I've seen on any system and the music is actuly very very good for it being a cartridge game. All in all this shows that the 3 year wait for this one was worth it and I think any gamer would be well adivsed to buy this game it will be a purchase you will never regret."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],W={key:0},x={key:1};function N(a,e,n,u,r,s){const g=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(o(),p(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const D=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-f7a85404"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/50.md","filePath":"library/50.md"}'),j={name:"library/50.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
