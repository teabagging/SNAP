In a series of tales about the seven taoist masters, it shows how each of these 6 men and one woman have attained enlightenment, and the snares that they had to pass to reach it. From these tales we can come to understand Taoist philosophy, and contrast it with Buddhist philosophy (in the interactions between Buddhist and Taoist masters).

That is perhaps the most appealing thing about it. One can enjoy the stories, and learn the basic principles behind Taoism.However, the depth could have been a bit more - but maybe then it wouldnt be an easy read. One of the stories might even suggest wrong ideas.. that of Sun Pu Erh disfiguring her face so that she could go on her spiritual quest - is indicative of her initial ignorance but there is almost a sort of glorification of this act.However, the stories are rather good and entertaining.

Fans of falsetto singers like Cedric Myton (Congos) and Junior Murvin will instantly fall in love with Delahaye's wonderful (but honestly, high pitched) voice, and bass players will be blown away by the intricate melodies of these Bullwackies riddims, which all develop in the classic showcase style into some awesome, very smokey dub; standout tunes like 'Movie Show,' 'Love,' and 'All I Need is Jah' make this really essential stuff for any fan of reggae music."},{"rating":"2","title":"description of physics in this century","review":"Prof. Casimir describes the life and personnage of many very important theoretical physicists, mostly through his personal experiences.

I am sure these are not bird calls: (1) because they are audible as very close to the point of capture (microphone) and (2) the off-key, flat tone and pitch do not resemble any bird calls or sounds.Unfortunately of course this sound is very unpleasant for any seeking a peaceful nature recording.

Recorded between 1998 and 2004, these 16 tunes are all short and mostly machine-generated, but range widely in mood and timbre. Yasuda harmonizes with herself atop the chiming riffs and fuzz-bass pulses of \\"Knock That Door,\\" while Schmersal rants over harsh bleeps and heavy thumps on \\"Marbles Explode.\\" This package (which includes a DVD) demonstrates that Enon enjoy both melody and noise but savor unpredictability most of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch closing tool","review":"I found this item to be very useful at a great price....

The S&H on this product was excessive ($28.55) compared to the other two vendors.

The consistency with which the late Scott Ross delivered elegant, polished performances, eminently musical, was extraordinary! In his short life (38 years, dying in 1989), he recorded all 555 Scarlatti sonatas, and I can attest that there isn't a dull performance anywhere in that vast collection. He wasn't really known as an organist, and the organs he used in this recording were certainly historically significant. Alas, the recorded sound is shrill and screechy (and I do appreciate good recordings of organs of many periods). The performances are skillful, but the off-putting sound of the instruments is a big liability, and, to be blunt, the music itself isn't interesting enough to overcome that problem. The playing is very good, of course, but not very interesting listening. If you are interested in the rarity of a Scott Ross organ recording, get it, but otherwise, I'd skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY?

But, \\"the eye\\" don't reach the peak of perefection of \\"Ringu\\" or \\"Ju-on\\" because just in the best moment of the film is introduced an unnecessary love-story.

True, it has a couple chilling creepy moments (like the elevator) but other than that, I was actually surprised by the lack of scares. The story was easy enough to follow and from what I remember, wasn't confusing. However, the end of the film pretty much ruined the rest of the movie for me. It was just weird, but not in a cool way. It just seemed off and it reminded me of another movie I've seen that had the same type of idea- Final Destination, which was alot better. It wasn't a bad movie, just an uninteresting one with a lack of chills."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way jose","review":"is this a 5 star film. there's plenty of reviews already so no point in going over the plot. but sheesh, special (sickbag) mention to the scene where our previously blind heroine is all upset because she can't play with the blind music group anymore. i mean really. so this downside compared to the upside of she can actually see again is supposed to be a highly emotive scene. it's like your friend who has just won millions in the lottery turning up on your doorstep and crying about all the problems they've now got since they became rich. boo hoo. oh and another thing. you get a donation of a body part but the donor's identity must be kept secret? really, why would that be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The eye was good, but much too creepy","review":"i liked the eye but it was way to creepy. i watched it a month ago and i'm still freaked out by it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asian Cinema Perfection.","review":"I cannot speak highly enough aboutthis movie. \\"The Eye\\" is Asian suspensecinema at its finest.In my opinion,what makes this film so greatis the credibility factor.

When I first picked up the box for The EYE, and read the synopsis I really thought that this film would be a very exciting psychological thrill. To my disappointment, the story was a little predictable, and doesn't deliver the suspense and trill that typical Asian horrors do. The movie also dragged on aimlessly to me, while going on a witch hunt for the truth of the donor. The EYE 2 recently came out, not a sequel however, maybe it will be more thought provoking as well as suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Eye is slow and not that frightening.

None even come close to the terro I felt by watching this movie. I had to actually switch seats several times, and during many scenes I found myself glancing nervously around the (empty) room. Every second of this film builds to the moment, so even when nothing terribly frightening is coming, you tense up....the scene where the camera quickly tears around corners to the hanging rope had me scared as hell of what might come.

The base sound was so boomy that the talk radio that I listen to is unintelligible. I keep a radio with me outdoors where I spend many hours gardening and landscaping on the 8 acres surrounding my house. I used a Dewalt worksite for the prior 4 years and took a chance that the Sangean would be a good update. I was wrong. The price was good, $129 when I bought but the thing takes 6 large batteries so I paid another $110 to get 8 rechargeables and an automatic charging unit. The sound quality is horrible.This week I gave up on it and ordered the latest version of the Dewalt with an 18 volt battery for $168. The Dewalt recharges in one hour and the charge lasts much longer that the batteries in the Sangean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sangean U-3 Utility Radio-Sound quality and phone charge ability leaves a lot to be desired","review":"I recieved this in hopes to be able to put this in my barns feed room. The room is not very large nor is the barn so I do not have to blast the radio at all. However right out of the package the sound, maybe its the single speaker is terrible. scratchy. Whereever you are at the bass or treble levels or in the middle you almost think the speaker is cracked. I would hope no one knowingly sent me a defective radio. Any way the phone jack is useless.

When I received it I read the owners manual and it said nothing about the radio being water resistant. However it did say \\"do not operate near water\\". This would be fine if my boat stayed in the back yard! Also it would not work on battery power. It worked great plugged into a wall outlet, and it worked fine using the dc adapter I bought for it. It is a large sturdy radio tho, with a very good sound. I don't use it on the boat because it may void the warranty and I can't use it on the beach because of the battery power problem. I can use it in the car with the dc adapter but it is really big and takes up the whole passenger seat. Amazon won't take it back because it is not their product.

Try solving given problems, implementing them or designing hardware for alike tasks: No way after having read this book.I think that just showing diagrams and reduced information without mathematics cannot help and give the impression that the author lacks deep understanding of the subject.

It is written by a computer science major with no background in the law and no understanding of the issues underlying the law.

But as an intelligent discussion of the DMCA or the issues surrounding it, it is a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"second-rate film noir","review":"Elsewhere in this space I have noted my love for film noir. The black and white photography, the story lines and the sparse and functional language. However, not all film noir is created equal and that is the case here. Robert Mitchum along with Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas and Orson Welles were the masters of this genre. However this one falls flat as Mitchum plays an old-fashioned steady reliable no-nonsense cop untainted by the corrupt public officials around him. Robert Ryan as an old fashioned small time crime boss who is not hip to the new ways of doing criminal business is a wooden stereotype, as are his henchmen.The plot, such as it is, revolves around the tension between these old foes. If you want to see Mitchum when he reached for the noir stars see Out Of The Past.

Whenever I watch this video, it seems like she is still here, the interviews and clips of her are just that fresh and new looking.

As things start to sky rocket for Selena's career her fan club president is suspected of stealing money. When Selena confronts her she kills her.

It has so many great moments in it. Really good script..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a movie about generations....","review":"This movie was one of those that surprise because of the misleading trailers. I really thought this was going to be more of a screw-ball comedy between father/daughter/boy-boss. It actually turns out to be more about finding your way in the world--both at the beginning and at the middle. Topher Grace is great as Dennis Quaid's younger boss. He has just the right mixture of anxiousness and charm needed to make the character believable. He reminded me of Tom Hanks quite a bit. Dennis Quaid is also wonderful as the middle aged man being squeezed out of a job he's held for 20 some years. The whole vision of the company take over and \\"synergy\\" is a great metaphor for what's going on during this movie.That's not to say it doesn't have it's lighter moments. The comedy is fun but not in the same was as say, \\"Meet the Fockers\\". I'd peg it as a Dramady..and a fine one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Little Movie","review":"I put this movie in not expecting it to be much and came away feeling I'd seen a great little movie with a lot of emotion and humor packed in. This film covers several different plot points: the importance of money and status versus love and family; the importance of employer/employee/customer versus corporate synergy; the importance of living for the little things in life. I especially liked Dennis Quaid. Quaid doesn't always get the chance to show he can actually act and this film really allowed him to shine. A major suprise in this film was Topher Grace -- he actually can act without being the fool like he is \\"That 70s Show.\\" Now that Grace has left that show, \\"In Good Company\\" may prove to be a great stepping stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Most Annoying Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"Until half way through I was laughing out loud. All the principals are well acted and funny. The Grace character is weird, and in a way the whole film revolves around him and I am thinking how the hell are they going to bring this movie to a conclusion in a way that is honest to these characters.Well the answer is, they don't. Grace and Quaid's daughter start a relationship with zero examination of what that will mean for Quaid who has effectively been professionally leapfrogged by Grace. Quaid then becomes a Hollywood numskull and socks Grace one and then becomes a Hollywood hero in the board room and everyone goes what a hero with no examination of complexities.Cod radical."},{"rating":"2","title":"the corporate world seen from a different perspective.","review":"\\"In good company\\" deals with the instability that corporate jobs can have.Dennis Quaid sees most of his old coworkes losing their jobs simply because they are too old and not that \\"dynamic\\" anymore. Quaid gets a new boss: a 27 year old Topher Grace who has a nice car, a great house, and a lot of growing up to do. Topher's character gets involved with Quaid's daughter which complicates their relationship even more.Both characters have a lot to learn from eachother and have more things in common than they suppose.Overall, this movie is pleasent to watch and reminds us of what really is imporant in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movies","review":"I enjoyed all three of these Romantic-comedy movies. Hilary Duff plays matchmaker in the perfect man to cheer up her mom but things get mixed up etc. Freddy Prince Jr. is great in Head over heels even though he gets accused of some strange things in this romantic comedy. In Good company was interesting with Dennis Quaid as the over protective father/boss of a guy who falls for his daughter etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for trying","review":"Hats off for taking on the human aspects of the shark-infested waters of today's business ethics.Gloves down for only coaxing mildly adequate performances, for failing to project the slightest idea of what professional sales is all about, for concocting several totally unrealistic scenes (e.g., Malcolm MacDowell's absurd inaction when his keynote speech is artificially interrupted by Quaid), and for creating a very pale imitation of \\"The Graduate,\\" with cross-generational dymanics, secret affairs of dubious morality, and Simon-and-Garfunkle-like songs in the soundtrack.But then, would the film had been produced had the screenplay been more critical of today's business practices, and bit the hands of those financing it? No way!Go see \\"The Corporation\\" instead, and get a better picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately a let down","review":"After seeing the previews for this movie, I was definately expecting a wonderful movie. I anticipated to see a movie that incorporated family and business issues, along with a romantic storyline.The movie was very good until the end, although somewhat slow at times. The conclusion was not what I expected, but not a good way. The problem was, there really was no conclusion.I'm upset that I just wasted 2 hours on the movie, for a riduculous ending such as that. If I would've known it ended as it did, there is no way you would ever get me to see it.On a good note though, the soundtrack was incredible, with artists such as Damien Rice and Sountrack of Our lives.

Until his company is bought out and he has to deak with an ego driven younger manager that is still trying to find his way. There sre many interesting facets of this movie that make it a gem and one that you have to watch more than once. Personally, this was not that bad of a movie and many people should watch it as soon as its available to them. I highly recommend it to all. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals the complexity of wants and needs","review":"Not a typical no brainer movie. This movie presents complex people with complex motives. Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways. He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life. This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife. He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work. Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies. He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it. He even tries to help his new boss. The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss. Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie About Jobs and Life!","review":"I just got back from seeing this Drama/Comedy and it was much better than I expected. I thought going in that it would be mildly entertaining, but by the time the credits began to roll I didn't want to leave these characters I have come to know over the last two hours. Each character is well written and the three leads are cast so perfectly that none really stand out due to the fact they are all equally good. Dennis Quaid is usually hit or miss in the acting department, but this is a role that he really shines in. Topher Grace may be best known so far for \\"That 70's Show\\" but this role here proves that he will have a long acting career. And finally we come to Scarlett Johansson. While this is probably not her best role to date, she is good in any part she is in and her presence is undeniable. She is gorgeous (never looked better) and I love that voice of hers. All in all, this is a movie well worth seeing and I am glad I didn't pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak character development combined with slow slow moving \\"plot\\".","review":"This movie has no plot and moves (when it moves) painfully slowly.If this is romantic I'd hate to see their version of Cinderella. Summed up, this movie's message is \\"nothing is guaranteed and do what you want and if you don't know what that is then go for a run on the beach.\\" The actress reveals the philosophy when she expresses dismay by saying she has been cursed with a stable family.I found myself fast forwarding through scenes just to get on with the story.When it finally ended the ending was empty and incomplete with the exception of the baby which they didn't even show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God.","review":"This was possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen.

Watching the film, I was amazed to think just how realistic this plot is. Older employees get demoted all the time in order to bring in a newer younger genertion.

Linear storyline? Who needs these when we're expounding on the Major Issues of Our Times!?

I have contacted Kitchenaid about this issue and they have been less than helpful. In order to have my pans replaced I would have to mail them all in. That would be very expensive, and I would have no pans to cook with in the meantime. I emailed them a photo of one of the badly cracked pans and they said that they can only replace two pans with a photo and the rest would have to be mailed in.

My preference would be that the edges went straight down so that the bottom of the pan was truly 10 inches. The same is true for the smaller pan as well.

Let's just say they don't hold up so well. One month later, my fry pan (the one I use the most) was starting to discolor. No big deal, since it still got the job done. Now, a little over six months later, the pan is practically useless! I used it one day to cook some bacon, I had to pry the bacon off, and what got left behind stayed there. I soaked the pan for hours, and then again for days, and now I'm convinced that it will never be clean again. Anything that touches the pan fuses itself there permanently! The rest of the pots are just fine, but I'm thinking that since the pan saw the most use, it's only a (short) matter of time before they all end up like this. I got the set at a discount, so I guess I got my money's worth, but I was expecting to get a few more years of use out of my pan. I've upgraded to allclad, I hear it's worth the money, and after my experience, I sure hope so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally...a pan that works on a flat cook top","review":"I have never been disappointed with a KitchenAid product.

Some things do stick to the pans but that's true of any stainless set. Biggest problem so far is they seem to have feet, two pieces have walked out of my house, probably with the help of one of my daughters who claims to not have them but I'm thinking she does. Unfortunately you cannot buy the pieces separately so if you have sticky fingered relatives this might be a problem. Apparently you can dent the pots as well. I wasn't there to witness how you do that but it's definitely do-able. The dent has no effect on the cooking efficiency. The only drawback to the set itself is that they really needed to add a 4 quart pot to the set, none of the items provided were particularly well sized for things like a pot of spaghetti. So I bought a Kitchen-Aid 4 quart pot separately. It's not the same set but because it doesn't have handles you don't really realize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand name only, fyi","review":"Keep in mind that Kitchen Aide, Cuisinart and many other familiar names in the kitchen do not have anything to do with manufacturing cookware. They merely put their names on products built to their specs....usually mid grade. I'm not criticizing, merely pointing out something to be aware of. You are buying a name that you have trusted for another product that they actually can claim as theirs. That said, these are a good set for the price. If your budget allows for something higher up the line then you will end up with a better set.

I was tired of replacing my nonstick cookware constantly due to scratches so decided to try stainless instead. I was not disappointed, they cook meats so much better.

Amazon's delivery promptness was perfect as always. The pots are nice and heavy at the base, but not too heavy overall. They look great and most importantly cook really well.My only complaint and the reason for the 4/5 stars is the fact that one of the pots has some pitting marks on the bottom of the inside. I noticed them after I used the pan for the first time, but I'm not positive they weren't there originally. I can't get them out, even after scrubbing hard with Bar Keeper's Friend and vinegar.

I couldn't beat the quality at the sale price I got and it gave me a better variety of sizes. They can be washed in the dishwasher but it will scratch them over time. You also have to be careful about not having the heat too high so learn to be a little patient.

I got it to replace my set of calphalon nonstick because of my growing concern about the safety of nonstick coatings. I have been really happy with this set over the past year. The cool touch silicone handles are great & the pans clean up very easily. I also love that I can throw them in the dishwasher if I don't feel like handwashing & they are none the worse for it. I also own a few pieces from the more expensive cuisinart multiclad pro line. The multiclad pro pieces are really nice, but in my opinion they don't cook or clean any better than my kitchenaid pans. I definitely recommend this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stick","review":"The set was purchased based on other peoples good reviews.Problem: metal surface is not polished (kind of ruff) and food tends to stick during cooking to the walls more then to to other stainless steel utensils.It was a mistake to purchase this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great non-non-stick cookware.","review":"If you're like me, you (generally) revile non-stick cookware. It's fussy and can't handle regular (ab)use at best, and kills birds with toxic fumes at worst. These pans have been a great addition to my kitchen. I would proffer as a mea culpa that I do keep one small, non-stick skillet for eggs, but otherwise, I use these daily. They're solid and a really good value.My only knock is that I would prefer a slightly larger saucepan between the medium sized one and the stock pot, the latter of which is a chore to haul out just to cook pasta, and the former of which is too small to handle the volume of water necessary for the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrrible pans!","review":"Lets start off with the rivets leaking!

I tried to use the Barkeeper's Friend to remove the stains - this helped a little, but the stains remain. I called Kitchen Aid and told them about this and they said this shouldn't happen. I am not pleased with this product and am going to return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent heating","review":"I recently got this set for Christmas, after agonizing over the many choices of pans on the market. These pans are very heavy feeling (in a good way, not an oh-my-god-I-can't-lift-these way)and the lids fit really well. They heat very quickly and I've found that they even boil water faster than my old pans. My only complaint is that after being heated, the bottom of the pan on the inside turned colors, like what gasoline looks like. Also, they seem to stain fairly easily on the bottoms as well, even when cooking with plenty of olive oil. Neither of these problems effects their performance however, and from the other reviews, I gather that the stains can be removed. Overall, I highly recommend this set, despite the staining problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected","review":"I usually like to see and feel things before buying them online, but I took a gamble this time based on review here and elsewhere and it paid off. I could not find this set in any store locally. This set is MUCH better than I expected it to be. The pans are Heavy, (but thats a quality heavy not a too \\"heavy\\" to lift) and compared to a stainless Farberware set I've bought in the past, I think I will like this set even more.

I have used them for years in the past to buff out cars. Dropped them, run them over with cars, burnt the edges of paint on cars with them and made a lot of money with mine. I have had Makita and DeWalt in the past and had problems with both. The only problem I had with the Milwakee is the electrical cord shorting out. That was after years of abuse. The balance and weight of the machine also feels better. If you are an auto bodyman, painter or detailer, this is a must have tool. If you just want to wax your car you don't need this.

It's for the child - not the parent. My son (just like one of the other reviewer's child) shouts \\"foul ball!\\" and \\"you're out!\\" He looks for Jimmy's mother in the crowd and he points to his own feet when we get to the part where George picks up the ball with his feet. I think what matters is that it's a fun, easily understood story for toddlers - with bright, neat illustrations.

As usual, George's playful antics get him into a little trouble, but (and also, \\"as usual\\") he winds up a hero.

I was disappointed by this first one. It was a little boring. We don't get to see much action. The lead character, Theodora, is not fully developed. Much of her past and her powers are just glossed over. And she is annoyingly stubborn to a fault. The Watcher sent to watch her is said to be a great warrior but we don't get to experience much of that. Instead, he spends much of the book just mooning over Theodora to the point of being irritating. If you are looking for an action book you will be disappointed. This is more of a romance.

But it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"whitewash of the Cuban History process","review":"I read this and the other volumes and found them lacking in the documentation of the Cuban people. It whitewashes the fact that Cuba was and remains a generally racist country. The book ignores the abuses by the Spanish and eventually the Spanish-bred white citizens upon the native and black population.This book and many others turn a blind eye to documenting a people's struggles. While one may encounter many Cubans who would affirm that racism did not exist, the fact remains that racism was an integral fabric of the history of Cuba. Many historical events were shaped by this, and authors (especially predominantly white ones) prefer to ignore this and fail to mention it. History is made up of many white lies, and this book is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long before there was such a thing as a feminist","review":"Hildegard von Bingen was an abbess, composer, migraine sufferer, and, in her own way, a champion for women's rights before there was such a label.

This is a good movie that brings a period of history and an important historical figure alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie with a modernist Church theme and behaviour","review":"This movie was produced in 1983 with modernist themes like the nuns kissing the priests.

Knowing a little about the life and works of Hildegard von Bingen, I was surprised by the omission of her contributions to music and science as well as the depiction of the anchorite Jutta. Von Bingen's most known work, the Scivias, is completely ignored as it relates to her visions. Oddly enough, the director also neglects Hildegard von Bingen's wide correspondence with political and religious figures of the day.

The book explains the topics in quite good detail with screen shots so that one won't get lost! The examples are bug-free and work fine. The chapter on objects and classes, though short gives quite a clear idea of object oriented programming and how VB handles it.The only hitch I found was that Chapter 12 onwards, the book gets a little too fast and some things are explained very tersely. Moreover, there are quite a lot of grammatical errors in Chapter 13 that ruin the train of thought and are irritating! It's as though the editors didn't go through the last few chapters very well.Overall, a very good book for anyone who wants to learn the basics of VB 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for the design time","review":"This book is just meant for beginners.

Peter Wright's book on Visual Basic 6 is a joke. He skims over the material in a laughable fashion, not even providing a single code example for some topics. How you can write a book on a programming language and not provide a code example for using mulitdimensional arrays is just plain BAD. Then on numerous occassions the author blows the subject off by saying, \\"That's all there is to it, so I'm not going to dwell on it anymore.\\" The truth is that there is a lot more to a concept like arrays for example than the skimpy coverage he provides. Books like this just want to make me write my own that much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad approach","review":"Anyone can write a book which can explain the basics of VB environment.

He will get your feet soaked with VB6 and then some; not only that but Peter offers suggested reading, a whole course outline is included on the back of the book (thanx to Wrox.Com), and he even provides 3 major distributable projects created by Professional developers so that you can actually create yourself.

With zero programming experience you can delve right into meddling with complex GUI interfaces that will astonish any hard-core unix programmer. Of course, he doesn't go into detailed analysis of every bitty control, and that is explained in the intro. My only quip with this one is that, as with most beginners books, there is too much unnecessary hand-holding. At times, the steps of operating VB6 are more in-depth than the actual programming; which means it will prolly be a longer read than you're expecting with slower results. But the lessons are quite effective at introducing us newbies to the VB6 interface...preparing us to delve into the sticky MSDN help files for VB6.

I play it a lot with my friends and family!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dutch Blitz is wunderbar!","review":"This game is so much fun. This is my 8th purchase of this game. I'm giving it to my friends. We have a group that meets Friday nights to play it. I bought it as a \\"gag gift\\" last Christmas from my husband to my grandson as my husband's family lives in Penna. Dutch country and several of the relatives speak it somewhat. It was a blast and I am hooked. I play it almost every night. It gets hectic with more than 4 people but since I have two sets of my own I have played it with 6. I mark the backs of one set with an X so we can sort them at the end. My goal at retirement is to spread it to all 50 states. I have introduced it in N.Y., Calif., Virginia, and all over Florida. If you haven't tried it, I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Children Love IT!","review":"I played this when I was little as did my wife. So now that we have children, they enjoy it too. It helps them learn to play with and love each other. There's nothing like a card game where they interact vs. watching TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Really fun game, takes a while to understand the rules, but after that it's really fun. Cards are slightly smaller than your normal playing cards, but good quality nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun For Everyone But Bring Band-Aids","review":"It may look like a \\"sweet litte amish game\\" on the front, but don't be fooled! This game will bring out the competitivenss of even the most quiet and reserved people you know!This game is tons of fun for people of all ages and backgrounds. My favourite amount of people to play with is 8 (4 decks, teams of two). You can play with as many decks and people as you want but it does get kind of crazy with more than 4 decks at the same time. If you do play with more than 4 decks make sure you out a marking on the other decks becasue tehy all have the same for symbols on the back (plow, bucket, carriage, etc.) My sister put her initials on the back of all of her cards and I put my initials on the back of my cards, that made it way easier to sort out the cards after the round was over.My only qualm is that for such an intense game the cards get bent in hald easily. They aren't as felxible as normal cards. other than that its simply a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dutch Blitz Review","review":"Dutch Blitz is a fast-paced card game in the style of Skippo. While the game has to receive gentle care to last because the cards are made like any playing cards, it is well worth the effort. Dutch Blitz is fun for any group of players: 2 friends, a family of 4, or several groups of people at a Youth event. It causes people to think and have faster reaction times. I would recommend this game to almost anybody. My child learned to play at Summer Camp and was thrilled when I bought a Dutch Blitz set just for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"family fun","review":"Super game for the family - 8ish year old kids to adult.

He just loves to play this card game with his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting game for the family","review":"Dutch Blitz is a great fast-paced game for anyone who wants to try their hand at outmaneuvering their opponent. A great break-out game for a small group at parties, Dutch Blitz is easy to learn, fun to play, and hard to master. If you can count from one to ten, you can play this game, which makes it great for kids to play (although their motor skills might make for a slower game). Laughter is bound to prevail when playing this game, and it would be a great addition to any type of gamer's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this game","review":"I have been playing Dutch Blitz since I was about 5-6, 40 years.

I have had hours upon hours of intense competition with one, two or three other players. The game can be played quietly at a slow pace, with teams, or as a four-person, high-speed free-for-all where you pull out all the stops...and yes, there have been small unintentional injuries while players share colorful comments about each others' ethics or personal appearance ;)The game requires quite a bit of attention to your own cards, cards in the center, and if you are good enough the cards in front of other players. It really is a game of speed, but also tactics. At one moment you need to let another player lay down a card or two, but then you have to act fast and shut them down with your own cards...oh, did I mention that this is a group play game? That's right, there is no waiting to take \\"your turn.\\" Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wonderful good time!","review":"Love it! My family can't stop playing it.

Can't say any more about it since it was only used once or twice in two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This is a fantastic game for family game night or just playing with friends! It reminds me of Uno a little. Instead of taking turns laying down cards you just have to pay attention. You must lay down cards in sequence. It is very fast paced and a lot of fun. It makes for a great family game since it's easy enough to play and learn that younger kids can enjoy as well. It doesn't get old like some games either so you can keep playing it for ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN FUN FUN :D","review":"I loved this game when I learned it among friends.

We just have to mark the second deck so the players colors can be separated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dutch Blitz","review":"This is an excellent card game for families.

It's just a repackaging of a card game you can play with regular face cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get comparison-list checkboxes without being useful","review":"The picture's a little fuzzy, but more importantly, this TV is a case study in manufacturers adding features just to get checkboxes, not to add functionality.There's a composite input, an S-Video input, component input, and a side composite input. But as it turns out, there's only one audio input on the back, so you can choose just one of composite, S-Video and component. And if that weren't enough, the side input overrides the back input. So even with four supposed video inputs, to watch more than one device, you need to swap cables or an external switcher.On top of that, the users manual was only in French.

I really takes a beating, and has enough torque to twist the top off the Super Dome (well, maybe not quite)! With self-feeding bits, this drill does an exceptional job of knocking out holes for any plumbing or electrical rough-in. I've dropped it, it's been rained on, bounced around in the back of a truck, and otherwise subjected to the \\"normal\\" job site wear n' tear, and it continues to perform flawlessly.

He mixes humor with powerful material. This is the best of the newer crop of financial books (post 1995) available. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who is interested in improving their financial situation. I also recommend More Wealth Without Risk by the late great Charles Givens and The Millionaire Next Door by Dr's Stanley and Danko, a excellent work. Most of the other books, I feel are too generalized and leave the reader puzzled as to what to do next. These books are powerful and pragmatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth about Money","review":"I found this book lacking in honesty.

I hold a degree in Business Education but I was rusty.I selected Edelman's book to focus much of my pilot program on...and the pilot went extremely well. To make a long story short, I presented the training program about 70 times and requests for it are still coming in on a regular basis. My training was \\"mandatory\\" so, at times, I had hostile members in the audience. Edelman's work held up to some tuff scrutiny.If you are in the market for an excellent, to the point, book on personal finance, get your hands on \\"the truth about money.\\" The tone of the book is conversational and down to earth. Edelman strikes a great balance here. The book is a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Financial Planning in a book.","review":"This is the best personal finance book since More Wealth without Risk by the late, great Charles Givens. Edelman pushes Givens in a lot of areas.If you want to achieve financial freedom, read this book.

This book has an updated edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and buy one for everyone you know!","review":"We heard Edelman on an NPR interview on the Derek McGinty Show. He was hilarious and his advice seemed sound -- and we weren't disappointed in reading the book. The book is chatty and filled with useful information. It's well organized with short easy-to-read sections if you want to use it as a reference book. It covers the gamut from 401(k) plans to life insurance to buying a house. It's good for 20-somethings through those preparing for retirement and planning their estates. We will buy Christmas copies for our parents and siblings and friends this year, in hopes that they will be enlightened into financial and investment security"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarcastic and self promoting","review":"A little good information lost is a sea of self promotion.Save your money and look at the clean, less dogmatic books put out by the Wall Street Journal.Mr. Edelman's style is to make you feel stupid for being human, but then try to sweet talk you into buying his other books (which have pretty much the same information in them).Also, question any book written by someone who makes his living earning commissions selling insurance and invesment funds - how unbiased can he be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only financial book MOST people need to buy","review":"I have read every review here, all 30 of them. I have two major complaints. Firstly, this book IS NOT JUST FOR PROFESSIONALS. They make their living giving us advice and if we don't have this info we are at their mercey. Not all \\"professionals\\" are competent or honest. It also assumes that ALL of us are too stupid to understand this book. It is true that this book is not for everyone, if you are an (...), don't buy it, it won't help. If you are a financial expert, you don't need this book, either. All of us inbetween will benefit.Secondly, there is nothing silly about this book.Oh, and just as a side note, if you get offended by the way this book is written, especially all the funny footnotes, you are just too uptight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, and yet informative","review":"Excellent book for a novice like me.

The examples are funny, observant, and terms that many find confusing are explained. For example, what are bonds, cds, IRAs, Roths, etc. Also what is important if you want to build up your Savings. I found it to be eye opening and relevant. If you want to get out of debt, the real answers to how it works. Each section is short, and can be read within a few minutes. Each chapter isn't just a long tome, but is divided into subsections that can be read in a few minutes each. I recommend this as a good beginning book regarding money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth About Money","review":"Money is often a scary and complex matter, but one weekend with this book made me a much more informed manager of my money.

She runs the gamut from straight-ahead country to rock-influenced flavors that would give the Pretenders a run for their money.

She is the rare example of both, and this wonderful CD displays her talents at the pinnacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Cher","review":"This is a very good CD. Allison Moorer has very Cher/Dusty Springfield voice -- phrasing as well as sound. The video for Send Down an Angel is great -- Gram Parsons lives (and dies)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Music from Moorer","review":"The Hardest Part is an excellent sophmore album from Alison Moorer. She is a very talented musician [singer and writer] and it's just weird she never made it bigger with the quality of this album and her first, Alabama Song. Alison remains in the country genre on this album. Her later albums migrated to different sounds, but this one definitely belonged on country charts, if radio had given it more respect. Alison has a great voice with a wonderful Southern accent and they're on display to good effect here. The songs contain numerous excellent guitar parts. Great songs:Hardest PartThink it OverBring Me All YOur LovingNo Next Time - very good slower tuneThere is a very powerful and haunting autobiographical \\"hidden track\\" at the end. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Country","review":"Allison deserves so much more attention than she is now getting. Her voice is absolutely knock-out and the soul she puts into her music and writing is beyond comparison. We play her two CD's so much that I now need to order new ones from overuse!If you don't believe the studio recorded versions...see her live. You'll never be the same. You'll become Allison junkies like us. Talent like this should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Seen the Future of Country","review":"I first got an earful of Allison when I bought her traditionalist Alabama Song. My first hint that she was an emerging talent came with the beautiful vocals that literally paint a picture in your mind's ear: Nowhere is that more evident in this CD than on the title track.Not one to get too comfortable with a particular style, Moorer then went on to produce two phenomenally eclectic CDs, The Hardest Part and Miss Fortune. Her voice is light years ahead of her peers', in my opinion. I have never heard a singer-songwriter who can sing with such precision, emotion, and Mack-Truck power. She is one-of-a-kind.Comfortable with the most kickass rock as she is with ballads of kudzu-draped sorrow, she has completely convinced me (a rocker) that she is one to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl has the country blues!","review":"Wow! What a sultry country blues voice. I haven't been moved enough by a country artist like this a long time. I can't get enough of this CD.

I'm 1) not sure it captures the notions of Grant, & 2) I believed this was going to be a more technical discussion - dimensionally.Excerpts don't reflect renditions of the same title from artists that Wolf names in the individual title discussion.Apparently superfluous info rather that expectation setting or guides for further development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of Grant Green","review":"Although this book covers quite a few of Grant Green's work, It primarily only covers the solos. Instead the chords are only listed and not charted. From my experience there are several chord voicings to choose from and it takes a lot of time to look at the solos and find the correct voicings. I have purchased Hal leonard products in the past and they were much more comprehensive.This is a good book if you just want a little insight into Grants Greens music. But an authentic recorded version of some of his better works would be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't look at birds the same anymore!","review":"I've had a bit of a Du Maurier fest recently re-reading her classics, watching The Birds once more on DVD and finally getting round to reading the short story. Du Maurier's tale is very different from Hitchcock's movie but still retains the terror and suspense that delivers shock, after shock. It is focussed on one man and his attempts to keep his family safe when the birds strike, again and again. There is no one to help them and the way the story unfolds and ends is a masterpiece of suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intense Flavor","review":"These berries aren't dried, nor are they advertised as being so. Rather, they have a candy-like texture and flavor. They are somewhat sticky and gummy, and have a very very intense, sweet blueberry flavor. They do not contain high fructose corn syrup, only corn syrup - don't be mislead by other reviewers. Also, they contain no sucralose (Splenda), only sucrose - otherwise known as sugar. They are wonderful for cooking and baking in muffins and pancakes, and serve as a more healthy snack than conventional candy when you're looking for a sweet-tooth fix. These rate very high in our household; they're delicious and embody everything BLUEBERRY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fake-sweet with poor ingredients","review":"I was disappointed with the taste of these, having had dried blueberries before. They were too sweet, and a sickly unnatural sweet unlike the blueberries I had previously.When I looked at the ingredients, it was clear why.Wild blueberries (good)Corn syrup (there's the cause! ugh)Sugar (maybe okay if corn syrup was gone, but you don't need much sugar with dried fruit)Natural flavor (uhhh... natural? added?)Citric acidSunflower oilPotassium sorbateI am not too big on the ingredients but could forgive them if the flavor was right, but as is, horrible. I am donating the rest to a food bank and hoping someone who likes refined-hypersweet tastes gets some enjoyment out of them. I am going to a different supplier for my dried fruit needs. I had enjoyed the cherries in the past, but after this I'm afraid to try anything else from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great album!","review":"Fate is just a great band! This album in particular is the best they did! I own 4 copies of the LP, 5 copies of the cassette, and only one of the original cd's (in which I paid almost $50.00 for)!

I initialy picked this CD up just to listen to Roxie on the guitars and expected nothing special and then - BAM - this CD rocks! Been there Lately, Shine, Speed Parade, Serial Killer - they are all kick ass rock tracks. Sure - there is nothing \\"new\\" here, but they arent pretending there is. Rod Jackson's voice is perfectly suited for this kinda stuff, and well - Slash and Roxie are just awesome axe men!!If you're looking for a straight out Rock and Roll album to jump around playing air guitar to - get this- give it a listen or two and rip out your leather pants!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't G'NR Memories Grand . . .","review":"I am a Slash fan. The guy has his own style and can play.But alas, listening to this album was like watching a movie sequel: predictable, a few thrills, but not as good as the original. Guns 'N Roses ruled. This stuff feels like a great guitar player with an average band playing to the past instead of seizing the future.There are exceptions. I think \\"Back to the Moment\\" and the title track sound like they were written after 1993 and rock, standing brow-to-brow with strong G'NR material. But there's no \\"Rocket Queen\\" or \\"Coma\\" or \\"You Could Be Mine\\" here. Most of the riffs feel like outtakes from the Use Your Illusion sessions, with flashes of mellow or fiery brilliance in the middle or at the end of a few tunes.If Slash had released this four years ago, I would've thought, \\"Well, this isn't his best, but has its moments, cool, the band just broke up, and his next album, next year, will be astonishing.\\" But I waited five years between albums for this? ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slash is Back (and he brought Rock with him)","review":"Slash, or the \\"Top Hatted One\\" has brought back classic rock n roll, with a modern hardness to it. Slash who is now world renown for his amazing style and catchy riffs has packed this rockfest album full of tunes that will stay in your crainium all day! Rod Jackson on vocals has a Steven Tyler air to him and the res of the bnd is a bunch of cool talented mofo's!Its full of blues based riffs with a hard rock feel. If you own a single rok album, be it Toys in the attic or Back in Black you have to add this to your collection 'cause it will run with the best! Slash is the king"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's rock...who pays attention to the lyrics?","review":"Ain't life grand is a wonderful guitar album, with plenty of Slash's riffs to go with a singer who can finally sing. I know that I listened to Guns because of the guitar work, and do so here also. As someone who likes hard rock with a blues tinge, this suits my taste fine, although there are certainly places where the melody is sacrificed for technique. Overall, a very good effort. Songs like serial killer and landslide are addictive, and speed parade is a great song to drive to. The songs that devote time to melodic development are very good. Those that don't....well, they're just good old fashioned guitar rock, just not as catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slash is back!","review":"It's not Guns N Roses. It's not even like the origional Snakepit. But it is good. The guitar is amazing (as usual) and the lead singer is much less annoying than certain previous ones. It is a very different album, but enjoyable nonetheless. If you like hard rock and blues, this album is highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful work from my one of the best guitarists","review":"Their lead singer sounds a heck of a lot like Paul Stanley from Kiss, and that's alright with me. It took some time to adjust to that. More people will be comfortable with him, unlike the first snakepit singer. I would say the album has 3 or 4 really addictive songs that just plain rock. Slash is wonderful on the album, but he is not trying to perform guitar heroics...even though we all know he can. Slash gives a tremendous performance. He puts the songs above showing off. This is a team effort and it is wonderful. It is well worth the buy of any rock fan. And if you like Slash do not hesitate, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab A Les Paul And Lets Rock.","review":"I love this mans style, his attitude and most of all his guitar playing and music. He makes brilliant music with a truly beautiful instrument, a proper rock n roll star. In my opinion Slash is God of the guitar and yet again has produced a good time rock n roll record. The album is full of cool guitar riffs, listen to every track because it shows Slash can still rock and it justs out lines the pure talent of the man. My only complaint is Slash don't leave it so long between albums, I've waited five long years for this, but it has proved to be well worth the wait.If you apperciate good rock n roll you will love this album, so pour yourself another JD and Coke, sit back and enjoy, I know you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, Super Strategy Guide","review":"Great Game, Super Strategy GuideThe strategies introduced here will enable the new player to survive long enough to really enjoy the game.

And he's no ordinary cardinal --he's a favorite of Francois I of France, a patron of Cellini, and the like.The downside of the book is that every so often you feel as if you're reading anannotated Visa bill. Long discussions of how much money was paid for differentitems, where the best items came from, etc. Not everything is likely to be interesting.In my case I enjoyed details of how clothing was made (and discovering that furswere often recycled from one piece to another) but was bored by long discussion offees to bargemen and carters for hauling produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, intelligent and sensitive exploration of subject","review":"Kane has crafted a thoughtful, intelligent and sensitive exploration of a Jungian approach to working with issues of incest. She uses examples from her obviously extended experience of working with female survivors of incest to put forward a convincing argument for the importance of a Jungian perspective in working with issues of incest. This book is, I would imagine, primarily aimed at therapists, although it is accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject. Kane's narrative has a depth and a richness to it that allows the reader to get a strong sense of her arguments. She draws on an evidently extensive knowledge of mythology and archtypes to explain and illustrate her points, and her writing is poetic and evocative as well as scholarly and well argued."},{"rating":"2","title":"another mind-opening peek into zorn's amazing world","review":"zorn rules. everything I hear from this guy blows me away. he has made me realize that music is in everything. this recording is great, especially hearing how zorn can take any medium (in this case, the string quartet), and make something completely his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"What driving???","review":"I'm watching this video tonite and there's no driving!!

I do like 'Do No Wrong' (It is very upbeat, you can dance to it, and it reminds me of just being on the dancefloor), also I like 'All In Me' (which is featured in the KRAFT Mac 'n Chesse commercial.) But The Cheetah Girls really need to get back Raven. She brings the vocals, she co-produces the tracks like \\"The Party's Just Begun\\", \\"Do Your Own Thing\\", and more from the CHEETAH GIRLS 2 movie.But I really don't no teenager, or even little young kids would like this CD.

If you're going to read \\"Flags,\\" please do wait until you've already read \\"The Sound and The Fury,\\" \\"Absalom Absalom,\\" \\"Sanctuary,\\" and some of his other stars, but don't read this one first. You'll miss out on the beauty of his other works because you won't want to read him again. The sentences go on for days and are just incredibly rambling, even for Faulkner. The story doesn't live up to many of his other ones. One of the aspects of the plot is, is that southern male is troubled somewhat by his sister's sexuality. That usually juices up the rest of Faulkner but it's just kind of voyeuristic, gross and boring here. The copy I read had wisteria on the cover, and that is what this book reminds me of....faded wisteria, with a lingering sticky-sweet smell, but having lost its vibrant color and its potency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faulkner Bootcamp","review":"While excessively verbose (though one its outstanding features) 'Flags in the Dust' is a requisite early read for the serious Faulkner reader. If you must, read 'Sartoris' which is 'Flags in the Dust' with 80 or so pages edited out. If you just want a taste of Faulkner and aren't too serious, go for some of the more well-known works. If you want to understand Faulkner, you must familiarize yourself with him through such works as 'Flags in the Dust', 'Sanctuary', and 'Unvanquished'.

The game is at least playable but has no appeal. Making a brithday-themed game is one of the worst ideas ever with a big name like Bugs Bunny. The plot is third-rate. Everytime you get hit you see stars and you can't use your hammer awhile. All the bosses are no-brainers like Daffy Duck. All you have to do is get the carrot. No fighting him at all. The side villians are weird. I mean walking boxes with the letter S on them,little hammerhead guys,guys in trash cans,the flying fireballs but worst of all,the walking clocks becuase they're everywhere,you can't hit them without hurting yourself and when you kill them they explode like forever and you have to stand back.

Both members were vital to the band's success, as is proven by this CD. The new lead vocalist pales in comparison to Karen Casey - she has a fine sense of pitch and a clear tone, but she lacks musicality almost entirely. The new guitarist is adequate, but no match for the previous musician's unique rhythmic style. I suspect that the addition of a percussionist to the group is a sad attempt to make up for that loss. Unfortunately, both the percussionist and the new electric bassist only serve to drown out what's left of talent in this shadow of a formerly fantastic band. Seamus should take some time off and reconsider his next musical adventure instead of hanging on to the crumbling shell of Solas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that I highly recommend","review":"This book is a very interesting read.

I felt around expecting air to be sucked in the plastic mount because why else would they make something that blows air out? I felt my nearest open vent and air was not coming in because the fan did not push air out, it goes out the plastic mount.I talked to their CS who insists I did not have enough open intake vents but that is just their excuse. They should have a fix of a free roll of duct tape to wrap the sides closed so this fan pulls air. Don't waste your electric or the manpower to install this fan. You will find other manufacturer's do not have open sided fans but enclose theirs in a shroud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The description of this fan is wrong.","review":"In the description of this fan it states:1/12 HP, 180W 3.2 ampsThis is impossible. Electrical power measured in Watts is equal to Amps x Voltage. 3.2 Amps times 120Volts is 368 Watts, not 180 as claimed.Furthermore it states 1/12hp. This is also impossible. Hp is equal to Watts divided by 746 because there are 746 Watts per 1 hp. So even if you believe the 180W, that would be 1/4hp, and if you believe 3.2 amps then that's 368Watts/746 or 1/2 hp. Neither are 1/12th Hp.So if you buy this item, you really have no idea how much electricity it's going to use because the description claims 3 different values and none match the others.I'm not saying whether this is a good fan or not. I'm just saying the claims made by the seller are mathematically and scientifically impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems right out of the box","review":"Purchased the vent to alleviate heat collection in the attic.Mounting and electrical connections were easy, but time consuming.After verifying placement, electrical service, I found the unitthermometer would not work at any temperature setting.

The throttle control is so tight that you can only move it if you hold the base down with your other hand and feels like it's about to break off. The product was shipped without the required software.All of these can be fixed with a little know how. But the fact that after repairing the throtle and getting the correct software the computer does not even sense that the controller is plugged in tells me that the shipper either new it was broken or never tested it.I know that it is the item I purchased that is faulty as I have another X45 I was replaceing due to a worn out switch.I recomend looking for a different vendor.

I am not sure what type of connector it is because there is absolutely NO statement of any type about this either on the box or in the manual included. In fact I don't think there is any mention of installing the hardware at all (except for saying to install it prior to loading the software).I never used the IL-2 Sturmovic WWII combat simulator software working because it slowed my whole system down. just trying to click on what I wanted to do (mission, etc.) was almost impossible.

The stick is WAY too big as well. I'm all over it trying to get to the different buttons. A REAL fighter joystick has all buttons VERY easy to reach. You can forget about quick response with this thing.The stick's programmability leaves A LOT to be desired. There is no way to program a key to do different keystrokes on subsequent presses. For instance, button 8 could map to \\"g\\" to lower gear. And then, hitting button 8 again would map to \\"U\\" to cause gear to retract.The stick's plastic resistance base at the end of the springs also doesn't move smoothly - it's jumpy.My recommendation: Cougar HOTAS from ThrustMaster.

It has really helped me put things in perspective for the fall semester,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Knows College Students","review":"Steve Shadrach has done an incredible job of presenting the way to reach and mobilize collegians. The Fuel and the Flame is interesting to read and full of humor and great examples. If you want to have an effective college ministry that will have impact for decades, reading F&F is your strategic first step. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel and the Flame","review":"I have read this book multiple times and every time I read it I am challenged and encouraged to pursue the purpose and vision God has for our lives. Fuel and the Flame reaches college students where they're at and provides practical ways of what it looks like to live for God in college. It is one of my top favorite books of all time and I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great; Practical Book!","review":"An incredible book! Steve does a fantastic job through this book explaining how to implement a practical and biblical strategy of ministry on a college campus. He uses biblical principles plus real life situations to explain his points. I have been doing campus ministry for 7 years and I walk through this book every year with my students. I would recommend this to be read by anyone who is trying to have an impact for Christ on a college campus."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIghly recommended","review":"This book is a \\"must have\\" for anyone working in campus ministry. Steve provides quality tools, tips, and ideas that will help any college ministry worker to train students not just to be Christians, but to reproduce disciples which will change the world. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting the world ablaze","review":"Working in a Catholic ministry, this book provides a useful structure for building and sustaining a fruitful and active Christian ministry. There's a lot of information that I'm eager to share with my students once I return to campus... Particularly the discipleship road map. There are several histories and quotes of people I had never heard of, but the main theme and points are highlighted by discussion questions at the end of each chapter. The book is written in a way that is readable, yet allows your mind to think critically about the way you're spending your time and efforts. This is definitely a book a would recommend for Christian ministries to evaluate and gage their work in winning over souls for Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for casting vision for college students","review":"if you are a college student that is looking for a means to cast vision for your campus and for beyond your campus, this is the book to go to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had a Magic Chief microwave that looked exactly like this one before. I needed the built in toaster. This microwave is a much lower quality. First problem was the toaster drawer stop failed which affects the spring loaded bread holders, you have to position the drawer just right so they would open. The hinges on the main microwave door are weak and cause the door to sag down and not close properly, I have to bend it up repeatedly to close the door. And finally the toaster stopped working all together. I had it for one year, I had the Magic Chief for 5 years. I purchased this because Magic Chief model was not available anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not work.","review":"This product was a Christmas present for my daughter-Disappointed- It would not work- We will be taking it to a Daewoo dealer. This is annoying and inconvenient. I hope the dealer will not be a hassle. It is beutiful to look at and the toaster feature was an eye catcher. It did arrive in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes you long for a sequel!","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago and have loved it ever since.It took me years to track down a copy (this was well before Amazon and eBay).This haunting tale will stay with you and leave you longing for the author to write a sequel.I contacted the author and she said she still receives many letters about this book. She wrote in her letter that the picture on the front of the book shown above is the actual Gingerbread House in Colorado. Although the story is ficton, the house actually exists.This book is perfect for a rainy Saturday, when you curl up on the couch with a cup of hot tea.Just a warning, don't read it before you plan on going to sleep!No, you won't be too scared to sleep and it won't give you nightmares, but you will stay up all night, because you can't put it down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted to see how many love this book.................","review":"I love THE MIRROR and believe it is the best book ever published with my home town Boulder, Colorado as its setting. Those who are not big time travel fans (I confess I am not usually) can enjoy the book for its page turning plot and the historical detail Millhiser uses to make Boulder in the year 1900 come to life. I was under the impression this was a fairly obscure book but what a pleasant surprise to see it is still in print and loved by many. Great reading choice for Boulder lovers whether residents or visitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"The first half of this book, the \\"modern girl\\" living in her grandmother's body, is good. The second half, the grandmother in her granddaughter's body, is just bizarre. I also found the ending disappointing. I wanted a different resolution. I would also recommend Replay if you liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"very good reading. the book is well written and covers our history of yesterday and today. you can almost feel what it would be like if you were switched in time. i recomend this book very fascinating....."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY! A long lost friend!!","review":"I borrowed this book from the library when I was a child. The story stayed with me as a long lost friend would. The characters are so real and the story is SO romantic. I have searched book stores, libraries, garage sales, bargain bins... with no luck in finding it. Finally, one click on one webpage and here I am looking at my lost friend...I cant wait to get it home!!! This book is a very special treasure for any girl or woman of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It deals with a young woman about to get married. She receives a present of a strange mirror. The mirror has powers and shows strange things. The mirror causes the girl to switch bodies with her grandmother, transporting her soul back in time about 70 years to her grandmother's 20 year old body.Anyone who had read Michael Moorcock's \\"Behold the Man\\" or has seen the Twilight Zone episode where an Elvis impersonator goes back in time to look for Elvis can guess what happens next. Mainly the young girl is forced to live out the life of the grandmother based on what she knows about the grandmother and thus creating the grandmother. What makes this book so good is that it returns to the present and we see the grandmother living out her life in the body of the granddaughter. The author does a marvelous job of showing us the present time through the eyes of someone from the past. It makes us want to re-examine our own lives for wonders we took for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held my attention from page 1","review":"This is a very unique and interesting time-travel yarn. It is also a family saga covering a period of more than 70 years and with a cast of finely crafted characters. The Colorado setting is clearly landscaped throughout the story.The time-travel mechanism is a magic mirror that transports young Shay back 70 years into the body of her grandmother, Brandy. We later find that Brandy has also entered the body of Shay. My interest was stirred by the contrasts of the different time periods, being accented by the obstacles encountered by both Brandy and Shay as they adjust to their drastically changed lives.I felt this book to be a metaphor for everyone's life and that it delivered a message that people have and will always hope, dream, love, adjust, accept.I, quite simply, recommend this book to anyone who considers himself a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Book You'll Never Forget!","review":"I first checked this book out at the library when I was a young teenager (1979)...and decided then that it was my favorite book.Well, I'm 35 now, have the original copy, plus a new copy with Marilys' autograph, and have since named my daughter, Shay.(the grand-daughter's name) This book will leave you with a feeling that you are right there with Shay and Brandy struggling to adjust to their new lives, and finding out that they are alot tougher than what they thought! Thank you, Marlys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be read again and again and again...","review":"The mystery of switching identities with an ancestor, the exploration of a place 100 years ago, and a rousing love story are combined into a delightful foray into the mind of Marlys Millhiser.Long out of print, the book has once again become available, just in time to reach a new generation of those who like to read a mystery that is a cut above all the others. Additionally, those interested in the history of Boulder, Colorado, will be intrigued by what it was like a century ago.While the $14.95 paperback price may seem high, this is a book that will be returned to time and time again over the years. I've read my copy at least six times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Remember It For A Lifetime.","review":"I too, have looked for this book for years. I bought 2 of them and loved them so much that I loaned them to dear friends. The dear friends must of loved them too for I never saw the books again. The story touches you and leaves you with memories that will haunt you. Things will happen in your everyday life that will remind you of the characters and situations of the book. To this day I look in a mirror with care. One day my grandaughter was in my bedroom and we both looked into the mirror at the same time and all kinds of thoughts ran through my head. Read it, read it and you'll never forget. I loved it. I would like to meet Marlys Millhiser. Is that at all possible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a mystery, but more of a historical fiction.","review":"My father bought this book for me thinking it was a good mystery thriller for me, since he knows I love to read the supernatural, mysteries,etc. As I started to read, it didn't really seem to be a mystery, more of a historical fiction. Thora K. Corbin and the McCabes all were all pioneer families. Shay was transported to their life and times through the mirror as her own grandmother. So things go back to pioneer life there. The book is more about Shay learning to get on in Brandy's body and learning about how to do things. I really didn't consider it a thrilling, suspenseful, or horror or mystery story.If you love ghosts/mysteries/supernatural/horror, like me, then this book is not for you. I would reccommend it to people who like to read books about the pioneer time, or who enjoy history."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this be your favorite book?","review":"I found this book because is is linked to Finney's Time and Again, a book which is delightful, and after I read all your glowing reviews, I couldn't wait for The Mirror! What a disappointment. Are we all talking about the same book? The plot is shallow, the character's have no depth, there are unexplained twists. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reading the same book?","review":"If not for the plot discriptions other readers wrote, I would think that we are reviewing different books.I read this book based upon the large number of excellent reviews and the story started as I expected. However, as the book progressed, I became less and less enamoured of it.After the first half of the book, I skimmed for about 100 pages then couldn't finish the book. I found it boring and couldn't care for the characters. The author seemed to run out of fresh ideas and should have ended the story earlier.Many of the other reviewer's comments stating that this was one of their favorite books in the 70's or the 80's. Perhaps that is why I did not agree with the reviews, I read it 30 years later and maybe the story does not age well.I recommend that you don't waste your time finding this book in the used marketplace or the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading and re-reading","review":"This book remains one of my very favorites. Love, sex, romance, danger, time travel, death .... it has it all and I think it is a very well told tale. I was enchanted at the idea of young Shay exchanging bodies with her grandmother and then living out her grandmother's life. (You have to read to understand) I thought the author did a most excellent job of telling the tale from the two characters points of view when they were thrust into a total foreign (to them) world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best....","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. My mother gave me the book to read during a trip for school. I just finished it and I would have to say that it left me spellbound. I want to read it again, right away, but my mom wants to read it, since she forgot what it was about. Shay and Brandy have the most interesting stories. If you have a chance to get this book, you better get it right away! :) Out of a score of 10, this book is an 11!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever!","review":"At the age of 14, I first read this intriguing story back in 1978, right after it was published. I've read it more than 100 times, going through 4 copies. I even took a pilgrimage to the small mountain town of Nederland to see some of the places mentioned in the book. It is an excellent read. It is a wonderful trip back in time, not only to our disco era of 1978, but back to the year 1900. I recommend this book for all history lovers who like a bit of fantasy and a lot of romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mirror","review":"I purchased this paperback book in 1978 and I have read it three times and will read it again before long. this was a excellent book, did not want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I decided to do an on-line search for \\"The Mirror\\" after finding my public library didn't have a copy of the book. I first read the book twenty years ago when I was in high school *several* times. For some reason, I've been thinking about the plot... about Shay... in the last week and decided I had to find the book somewhere! I'm so happy I found it... I think my nine year old will enjoy the plot, too, maybe before she finishes up all her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books!","review":"I first read this book years ago, and it always stayed with me as one of my favorites. I'm old enough now that I have re-read it several times and I always enjoy it. This is one of those books that I keep for myself and never donate to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very unique and entertaining plot","review":"This is one of those fiction stories that remains with you long after you've read it. I enjoyed the book, then loaned it to a friend, but never got it back. The plot continued to tease my mind, so I purchased the book again years later. Since I read a lot, it isn't often that I remember story lines in that way. It changed the way I looked at my family history."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I owned this book years ago and when I couldn't find a good book to read I always reread The Mirror. I loaned it to someone and never got it back so I'm thrilled to be able to find it again. I definitly need my fix after not reading it for so many years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favourites!","review":"I bought this book years ago and was fascinated by the fascinating storyline. I picked it up again recently and the tale was just as interesting, just as fresh as the first time I had read it. I would have loved a sequel. It is particularly interesting to go back through the first part while reading the second to see what both Shay and her grandmother are doing at the same moment. It is also interesting to see how a person's time in which they live shape their lives and personality. a truely timeless tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting generations","review":"This book is one of the many my Mom recommended to me. Everything she recommended was great but this was my favorite so far(as I haven't read all the ones she had bought me). I unfortunately have lost the copy she gave and am in need of a new one. I am prepared to read this one again which is saying a lot. I am 37 years & have only read one other book twice. I just don't re-read books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!!!","review":"I have read this book at least 10 times! It is my very favorite book and I've read many. You get so wrapped up in the story that you'll spend many-a-night up later than you should. You won't want to put it down, and then when it's over you're sorry it won't go on forever! I absolutely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book takes you back in time.","review":"I first read this book about 20 years ago and to this day it is my favorite novel. A friend of mine read it, loved it, and referred it to me. I am not a fan of supernatural books, but I love sentimental stories. This book does a great job of taking you along with the main character. I consider this book a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will always remember this book","review":"When modern woman goes back in time and lives a life without all the things she is used to is a wild read.

I loved it so much and I really got caught up in the characters and the author's description of the two different women's experiences. As I was reading it I became fascinated with the two women - it's unlike any book I have ever read. I put the book away, but when I went to look for it I couldn't find it. I never forgot about it and have looked for it over the years. What a thrill to find it on Amazon.com! I can't wait to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful read!","review":"This is the first of Maryls books I ever read and I couldn't put it down! (I have since reread it many many times and love it still!) There's nothing better than a good story that makes you 'believe' it was REALLY happening only you find the story is over and your mind makes you wonder, was this fact or fiction?As a lover of history, I was pleased with the small 'facts' tucked away and am jealous as I would LOVE to travel back in time but don't know if I could handle meeting my ancestor so well! Thanks so much Maryls!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller","review":"Seller was fast and courteous, quick to respond, and eager to make me happy. I would definitely buy from them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Escape","review":"Quite a long time ago I bought The Mirror as a hard copy book. I hadn't really heard anything about it but became involved with the story almost immediately. The reading is easy and it's such a delightful escape from \\"today\\". In the early 90's I loaned it to another CO friend. I recently made an attempt to get it back for one of my daughters but my friend has been unable to find it (she thinks her daughter who's away at college has it now). I was pleased to see this book recently in soft cover and now plan to just go ahead and purchase one for my daughter since I think chances are slim that I'll be seeing my first copy again. Read it; you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it end-Audible edition","review":"I am almost to the end of the story, and I am so depressed. These are unpleasant, self absorbed people, and I am sorry that I ever met them. I hate the way they treat each other and even the animals around them. I cannot relate to Brandy or Shay because they seem to lack any real identifiable emotion that would make them empathetic characters. Brandy seems to pout throughout the story, and I don't think it is just the way the reader is choosing to portray the character. Her interactions with her family, in the past and present, lack any real depth, and I find her cold. I can say the same for Shay. The idea of the story seemed so promising, and I liked that the author chose to portray the story as more realistic and less romantic than might otherwise have been, but the actual result takes a good idea and peoples it with unpleasant, dysfunctional people too damaged to be interesting or anything but sterile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase of Used Book","review":"The book I purcahsed \\"The Mirror\\" is an old book, but was in good condition as promised. It was delivered promptly. I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mirror","review":"What a wonderful read. Very fascinating trip through time.

I found it a compelling story, and I don't usually care for time travel stories. The author does a great job of putting a modern heroine (and the reader) inside the mind, body, and heart of a woman of the 19th-century...fascinating and romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem.","review":"I read this book in two days - I couldn't put it down. It's a flip-flop, Freaky Friday kind of tale with a Grandmother and her Granddaughter changing places with each other, each being the age of 20 in each others body.The Granddaughter is sent back to the late 1800's and has to face living as a modern woman in not-so-modern times. She is called crazy by many due to her \\"uncanny\\" ability to see into the future. At the same time, the Grandmother is transported as a 20 year old into her Granddaughter's body in the present time.Both have to face enormous challenges living each others lives. This book is wonderful and is a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mirror","review":"Read this because I enjoy time travel stories, especially Time And Again. The Mirror was an excellent read, and tough to put down. I thought that the Shay section was more interesting than the Brandy section, which seemed more of an afterthought. Perhaps it's always more interesting contemplating another time period than the time period one lives in."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have the original edition of this book, copyright 1909.","review":"A well written book covering almost all aspects of trapping. includes animal types, variations, habits, food, and methods in detail as how to trap the animals. Excellent vocabulary, sketches of animals, track drawings, trap pictures, and proper handling of hides to preserve furs. Most important, a table of contents by animal species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference - Recommended","review":"\\"Science of Trapping\\" is an excellent resource for those wanting to learn traditional trapping of fur bearing animals. This is an older text only book (no illustrations), and is well described by the subtitle as it does provide very detailed descriptions of traps, animal nature (useful in placing traps), and a good variety of trapping methods.There are references to specific trap manufactures and products that are no longer available, but it is easy enough to find contemporary products (even on Amazon). I found the description of Native American traditional trapping methods to be very interesting and worth reading just for the historical value.This would also be good for writers looking to provide more realism to historical or survival fiction.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"No pictures or diagrams.","review":"Was very disappointed.

You won't want to put the book down"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit bland","review":"My first Stuart Woods novel. It was a little bland with characters that could have been more developed and a slow start. I finished the book but didn't feel like this was something that was extremely mesmerizing nor captivating. If you have nothing else to read I suppose this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought I was the only one!","review":"I was very pleased to see someone else comment on the slow dim dialogue in this book - it was PAINFUL. Page after page was spent on such exciting things as preparing a Caesar salad and other exciting tangents. The story moved slooowly and the plot, characters and ending were all terribly lacking. None of these lacked as much as the motivation for ANY character. I was so moved by how poorly this book ended that I had to come here and \\"warn\\" others! I am not a tough critic, but this book was a stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 hours later...","review":"This is my first novel by Stuart Woods and I have to say that I enjoyed it very much. I sat down Saturday night at 10:00 to read a few chapters only until my husband came in from the garage with the intention of then watching a movie that I had taped. Needless to say 3 cups of coffee and 4 hours later I finished the book and we never did start the movie.The novel moves quickly and there is no unnecessary detail to skim over.It has lots of plots twists and I had fun trying to figure them out(even though I was only partially right)My next book is \\"Swimming to Catalina\\" which is where this novels ends. I look foward to it and I hope it is as enjoyable as this one has been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Salt Water Adventure","review":"Great story with twists and turns right to the very end; intrigue, deception and politics abound.I highly recommend this fast paced salty story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a few cold winter nights you can escape to the Caribbean","review":"This is a fun, exciting read! Stuart Woods has hit the nail on the head with some of the government folks that you'd find on an island such as St. Marks! Compare this with \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" for that island feeling!

This book has it all - sex, suspense, and a beautiful locale. You will not want to put this one down until you learn the fate of Allison Manning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very sad that a great writer turned tabloid. Sigh.....","review":"Where was the writer who once wrote great story like RUN BEFORE THE WIND, GRASS ROOT, CHIEFS? Now, all I could find in Woods' stories were just tabloid garbage. There were no profound characters anymore, only superfluous down-to-earth low lives or disgusting people who spent too much time in murderings, eatings and drugs. Woods was once treated by me as one of the greatest and most talented current writers in America, but not anymore. Maybe a writer too enjoyed good life did hurt his greatness in the long run, that's why there is an saying that \\"The great writing could only be achieved when the writer was in poverty.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Barrington wades into some pretty deep stuff!","review":"Stuart Woods writes fast paced fiction and I really like his detective turned lawyer Stone Barrington. However, more than once during my quick read of 'Dead in the Wa;ter,\\" Woods lost me. There are more plot twists and turns in this than a bad day at Wimbeldon. Ultimately, I liked the book, but I think he could have simplied the plot some...ex-wives, insurance investigators, a blood-thirsty Prime Minister, a dowdy old attorney, a bar-keep with his own secrets, a downed plane, reporters...well, you get the picture.I hope Woods will trim down his character list for the next Barrington mystery, which, by the way, begins where 'Dead in the Water\\" ends.A good summer read"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BEACH READING","review":"So it wasn't War and Peace but it was a Stone Barrington sequel and I love his charachters and the characters he finds and socializes with. The ending was not a complete surprise, however Mr.Woods drew it out instead of just figuring it out and ending it there. I will now read Swimming to Catalina."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the end I realized that I really enjoyed the story","review":"This is my first Stuart Woods book I have read. I was a little put off at the relationship between Stone and Allision. I found it to be unrealistic. Because of this relationship I was convinced in her guilt.

I won't read another Stuart Woods book.","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. I had never read Stuart Woods before and don't expect to read him again. The characters were shallow, the plot unrealistic, and the writing sophomoric. The only redeeming value is that I could finish the book on one overseas trip (and leave it in the airport because I wouldn't want anyone else to PAY for reading this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveably bad, unbelievable plot.","review":"A friend at work recommended Stuart Woods and lent me this book. What a disappointment! The plot is so far fetched and riduculous, I lost interest midway through the book. The main character has no moral character and I wished I'd never met him.

Alba and Nee do credible justice to the idea that America continues to be a Nation best characterized as a nation of immigrants and where assimilation into the mainstream is still, by and large, possible.However, the book minimizes the significance of factors related to transnationalism, racialization, and the dominant, emerging, and overarching impact of panethnicity in contemporary American society. Fundamentally, the discussion boils to this: does race continue to define and delineate American society and opportunity? Alba and Nee believe that while it has some impact, it is still residual. As a scholar coming from an alternative orientation, I disagree, and in a forthcoming book, my team of researchers will describe an alternative perspective that emphasizes the salience of race which we believe is more rooted in American experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD SOLID ENJOYABLE READ - RECOMMEND","review":"I enjoyed this one. Very gripping story, well told. Unlike Publisher's Weekly, I rather enjoyed the \\"Gothic\\" wording at times and felt they added to the overall feeling of the story.

Can't you see that Richard Montanari has just repackaged every television cop stereotype since Dragnet? In fact, the entire book seems derived from TV, except the fact that the main character, Jessica is a beautiful female boxer. What an original concept! Although it served ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE in the book, I'm thinking Mr. Montanari might have an Oscar-Winning Movie concept here. Ha! Look for my copy of this book on ebay. I'm posting it for auction starting at $.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Murder Myster...","review":"I found THE ROSARY GIRLS to be one of the best murder mystery novels I've read in a long time.Interesting characters, great plot development, a terrific psycho killer and a few red herrings made for a fun read. I finished the last 140 pages in one sitting. Just when you think you know who the killer is, a new wrench is thrown in making you guess again. I was completely surprised at the end.One minor problem I had with the book was the \\"trying to make a name for himself\\" reporter. It seems this type of character is becoming a trend in books like this. I could have done without him, but it's a flaw that can be easily overlooked. I hope there are more books to come featuring Balzano and Byrne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that interesting","review":"This book was not as interesting as I had hoped. The book did have some good parts but sadly, they were not strong enough to hold my interest. The main characters were very 2 dimensional, despite the author's efforts to make them have depth. One thing that really bothered me about the female character was that she had a 18 month old that she apparently spent very little time with - I guess because her childcare situation was 24/7. she apparently could drop the kid off at a neighbors morning, noon or night without warning. I didn't bother to finish the book because despite plodding through most of the largely slow paced book, I realized I didn't care who was killing the girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read!","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long time.

I rented it for $2.99 and I feel ripped off. I should have known better considering someone named Pearl Jr. is listed as the host of this garbage. If anyone claims this is a good video, they are lying--point blank. The lady hosting this fluff (masquerading as a hard hitting journalist) is beyond weird. Save your money.

It is both entertaining and in depth. Although it leaves you hanging it does follow the diary or at least the part of the diary that has been found and decoded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary of Ellen Rimbauer","review":"I read the book before seeing the movie. The book was good. The movie was terrible. I did not like it at all. The movie did not follow the book. The movie had inaccurate accounts compared to the book and the Rose Red movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer was absoluteley riveting. The movie left out all the essential character building storyline. The Rimbauer's entire year of travel was cut into a couple of quick scenes (and they are completely inconsistent with the book). You are let in on secrets too early and without any background. Suspense is built on not knowing everything right away.You never get a sense of Rose Red as a character, when she is supposed to be the driving force of the story. The movie cut and pasted events and character roles into places where they do not make sense or are ineffective. I had to force myself to watch the rest of the movie...and it didn't get any better. Scary? I don't think so. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange.....","review":"Since the rest of the reviewers on this page have said it best, Ill simply give my two cents and point out a huge screw up on the DVD side of things.The movie is decent. They use the original sets from Rose Red( which is a big plus because the house is what made the movie in my opinion) the acting is fairly well done and the story sets the stage for Rose Red itself.BUT there is one huge flaw in the production of this DVD. When you click on the \\"scene selection\\" option on the menu, another movies clips show up. Yes thats right, Lions Gate put ANOTHER films pictures in the selection menu with titles from The Diary of Ellen Rembauer. Its an asian film from the looks of it, and is also probably much creepier in that just the pictures from this film gave me the jitters.Well thats it, go check out the movie for its prequal info, and then look at its interesting mess up. And if anyone could tell me what movie they mixed the scene selection up with, Id like to know, it looks rather good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prequel To Rose Red......","review":"Being a huge Stephen King fan ( I think the man is brilliant ! ) I saw Rose Red and enjoyed it. When The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer came out, I was interested in seeing it so I bought the movie. Although not as good as Rose Red, this movie is just ok. Set in the early 20th century, this movie shows us why Rose Red became a haunted mansion. It tells the story of Ellen Rimbauer who marries a wealthy man and inherits the mansion named Rose Red. When strange things begin to happen in the mansion beginning with her husband's strange behavior, Ellen begins to question both her husband and what could have happened in this mansion to make it haunted. Crawling with ghosts and spirits, Ellen begins to research Rose Red and doesn't like what she finds. Good special effects but can be boring at times. Only worth renting, I wouldn't suggest buying this movie unless you have seen it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough info","review":"wasnt what i thought it was going to be and it is very short and not very detailed like it should be"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love Rose Red.

I am very happy I own both movies. The two movies are a must see together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE LET DOWN","review":"This movie is a big let down if you have read the book. The movie leaves out certain key characters and events because of time. I think it would have been much better if I had seen the movie, THEN read the book. Look for the actual writer of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, who plays the Rimbauers head butler. This DVD is 88min. long and the only extra feature is the commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disjointed Diary","review":"High points for production details but no thought went into the disjointed totally inconsistent plot.Just don't waste your time on this.... not scary or sexy or entertaining.

The acting is ok, totally not Oscar winning acting, but not bad for a straight to DVD movie. If you have not seen \\"Rose Red\\" I would watch this first then watch \\"Rose Red\\" becouse it is a prequal.If you are a Stephen King fan, like sci-fi ish mysterys and movis tha that take place in the early 1900 I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love hate relationship","review":"I've had this video in my collection for a few years now and I love it, but it is painful, hence the love-hate relationship.

None of the language seems to flow naturally from the speaker. Is she trying to \\"keep time\\" or end the spoken word before the harp solos? The first script leaves something to be desired, too. Harp music is nice, but the second track zaps you wide awake and the startling voice begins again. The music for track 2 is too active for drifting into peaceful place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than satisfied","review":"Great product...if you don't mind stopping every five minutes to empty the canister and clean the filter and filter screen. Filter and screen becomes clogged very quickly even in a pet free, adult only inhabited home. This greatly diminishes the suction power of the vacuum cleaner. In addition, all of the onboard tools have holes manufactured between the suction point and the vacuum cleaner hose. ?????? As long as these holes are taped up or otherwise covered, and the filter and screen are clean, the attachments work fine. However, I've never owned a vacuum cleaner that required altering the attachments to acheive their basic intended use.Edge cleaning claim is a joke. Cleaning along baseboards requires the use of the altered onboard attachments and....again, a clean filter and screen. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I do not recommend anyone to buy from this seller, Cardinal Industries.

She first made the jazz scene singing with Chet Baker in the 1970s and also had a central role (the sexy blond in the black dress) in the Baker bio-flick \\"Let's Get Lost.\\" Her version of that song heard on this album is quite good. Although she tends to take many of the tunes here at too slow a tempo, when she picks it up a little she really shines. LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING swings nicely, but the real gem is BUT NOT FOR ME, one of the best versions I've ever heard. The presence of vibist Wolfgang Lackerschmid and especially altoist Herb Geller adds a great deal to the proceedings. (Geller, after all these years, is still at the top of his game.) This CD is a good one, definitely worth looking into."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound okay fit","review":"sound is awesome, the fit at the front required customizing. the crossover tube was to far back and the bends at the front of the system placed the crossover to close to the drive shaft to line up with full length hedders. basically had to replace front two feet of system and installed new crossover tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures","review":"Pictures are all large and great looking.

Hall creates characters that are clearly presented and embedded in your mind. From the gruesome Hal to the motherly heroine Hannah, Hall's portrayals are exceptional.This is a really fast read and it doesn't slow down a bit-it actually picks up in the last 50 or so pages until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Good Read!","review":"James Hall is a fantastic writer! I read other suspense novels and few of them engage me as much as James Hall. In Rough Draft James Hall creates a villain named Hal who is a wonderful character study - complex, evil and with a little bit of humanity. What more could you want in a antagonist? The heroine in Rough Draft has a son with mental issues. Reading the first part of the book, it seems like the kid shouldn't have as severe mental problems as he does. He witnessed his grandparents death, but his mental problems seem over-the-top for what he witnessed. However, this is why James Hall is so good. By the end of the book you suddenly understand why the boy is the way he is. One other thing about this book: it is actually two mysteries in one -- worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, but cliched ending","review":"This was my first James Hall book, and I plan to read some more in the future as he seems to be a very good writer. His writing flows clean and easy, making for a fast paced read. The main characters Hannah and Frank were good, but I would have liked to see a little more depth into Frank. Hal and Misty are also good villians, but Hal is perhaps a bit cartoonish, particularily his method of killing. The plot was interesting and had some original ideas compared to the typical plot in the genre. The only problem was that you could see how it would end from a mile away. Although the identity of Hannah's parents killer was a nice suprise. Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"I dropped my well worn 1979 copy of 'The Romagnolis' Table' tonight and it split in half. Horrors!

The directions are clear and simple, the ingredients obtainable, the results magnificent.My favorites? Their Sugo alla Bolognese is not only the best pasta sauce I've ever made, it's the best I've ever eaten.

This ebook based on the first edition!Although, when looking closely at the webpage, the product details of this ebook do state 'first edition'. It could be improperly inferred that it is the first edition of the Kindle version. I do not think that the Kindle version of an old edition should be linked to the page of a newer edition, because then people are tempted to purchase it thinking that the books will be exactly the same.

We weren't. The problem is I got an oversupply of it and ended up tossing it all. Next time, if I try eating bulgar again (which I might because I'm trying to make more healthy food choices and I don't doubt the value of bulgar) I would instead buy it plain and season with our personal favorite seasonings and use that as a starting place.This is not the fault of the company that made this product, it is entirely my fault for not knowing what I was purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well written review of the best practices in","review":"This is a well written review of the best practices in Movement/Dance therapy.

It is a great eye opener, which explains how stupid we can be when we try to fix broken women or when we try to care for them. Damsels in distress, according to the author, are \\"evil witches\\" who are \\"the architects of their own misery.\\"The rest of the book I found insulting. I felt irritated when I was reading on almost every page \\"you guys... you guys\\", and the word \\"stupid\\" as a title for every chapter.How was she hoping to influence someone while insulting him is beyond me. Most other self-growth books respect their readers; this book does not. The author of this book is, virtually, bullying her readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Balanced","review":"Laura Schlessinger goes beyond psychiatry/psychology to good common sense-something that we all (male & female) need to hear when it comes to the matters of the heart.

My Mother is the sports fan and my Father loves tthe soaps. They both worked and we grew up as very happy \\"latch-key\\" children. In this book Dr. Laura (the physiologist) attempts, in her tedious prose, to compartmentalize men as she did women in her previous book. She is more lenient with the guys, however, blaming a lot of their \\"stupid\\" activities on their women. A well-known hater of her own sex, Schlessinger seems to be using her books for the sole purpose of attacking women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer to 2 1/2 stars","review":"Dr(?) Laura does make some solid points in this, but most of the bottom-feeders that need to read this, won't. Her biggest problem is using her concept of a god, to *prove* that what she says is correct. Instead of just stating that such and such type of behavior is not correct, she has to use a particular religion to *prove* it. Always be leary of using a religion as the foundation to build your arguement on. Laura evidently feels that there is only one valid religion and uses it to write her books. As any logical person realizes, there can only be one valid religion or none at all. In Laura S's, the Judeo/Christian is THE valid religion and bases her interpretations on that belief systems. Gee Whiz, that ignores the millions of Buddhists..Muslims..Confucious' etc. Religion wise Laura, you are in the minority...Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Scares Me So!","review":"Everybody knows about the good Doctor, 'cause she has spent a good deal of her life persuing publicity thru the channels of TV, radio, etc. That is not, however, the reason I picked up and read her book about Men and the stuff they do.I became fascinated with Doc Laura after meeting her at an art opening in Dallas about six years ago. I was there with my girlfriend, (at the time!) and we were trying to enjoy the work of some goofy modern impressionist cat. I look over at the buffet table and I see this women stuffing her handbag full of finger sandwiches! I point it out to my gal-pal, she goes, \\"Hey, that's Doctor Laura!\\" We go over to say hello.She was pretty cool and all, and ever since then I read all of ther stuff.

I am generally a big fan of Lonely Planet Guides, and this one did not disappoint. We stayed in hotel in the Gold Coast but used public transportation to get around to several other sections of the city, and this guide covered all of the areas that we visited very well. Information was concise and useful, and overall I was really pleased with this book. It's maps were invaluable while traveling around - it is worth the price for them alone.However, there were a couple of recommendations in the book which I did not feel were very good.

The biggest problem is that very many of the page number references throughout the book are just plain wrong! For example on page 51 in the section titled Famous Loop Architecture is a reference to tours offered by the Chicago Architecture Foundation on page 262. But page 262 has sections for Relocating, Safety, Taxes, and Telephone usage -- nothing about Chicago Architecture Foundation or tours or architecture. Sometimes it's possible to find the reference a few pages nearby the referred page but at least half the time I just had to scratch my head and wonder.Also the book is laid out quite differently from other LP books. I've used LP books all over the world and this one just wasn't as helpful as I hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide to Chicago","review":"Found the guide really good for sites to see, restaurants + hotel bookings ... the all important shopping section was excellent but didn't mentione that non US residents can avail of discounts in most of the large department stores by registering with the customer service desks ... the 2 and 4 day itineraries ensured that we hit all the must sees ... used it in conjunction with some top tips from Trip Advisors fact sheet on Chicago.

It is an afternoon story because you have to make it up on your own and you don't want to be too tired. It is a book with only 18 words and each pictures is equal to 1000 words. If you have a wild imagination this book is for you. In the book frogs can fly. Frogs can hop from the city to the countryside. So, much unrealistic stuff can happen. A two year old can read it, but older kids will enjoy it too. So fly over to Amazon and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I really like the book.

There are less than ten words in this book. It was no challenge to his reading. The story is told in pictures. Rather creepy pictures to be honest.

It was a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the little ones","review":"The pictures in this book are great, but the theme is not for little ones.

Very wonderfully illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look to the skies on Tuesday nights!","review":"If high-flying, mischievous frogs were an everyday occurrence, the mysterious Tuesday by David Wiesner would not exist. In Tuesday (Clarion Books, 1991), the author writes that some magical event occurs every Tuesday and in this particular book, readers are treated to the puzzling case of adventurous frogs. One of the marvelous watercolor illustrations depicts dozens of frogs hovering on lily pads in a sleeping (and unaware) woman's house, entranced by the glowing light of the television. Curiously, Wiesner omits the child character found in his previous works, and readers looking to identify with the story may have to look elsewhere. The author demands creativity from his readers of this Caldecott Medal-winning text, and he expects his audience to construct their own text. Since Tuesday is such a clear indication of Wiesner's success in literature, readers will gladly look forward to his next clever and inventive book with dream-like illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video quality","review":"Not only is this video lip-synced, but the video quality is bad.

Lemme guess it's from the publishers of \\"Healing the Dead\\". What group of people was the author targeting?In reality, this gem is too conservative to yield results for women trying to spice things up, and far too risqué for say...you're average Mormon 'nice girl.' The result is neither cold nor warm, here nor there. It's extremely cheesy and about as awkward as having a sex talk at 13 with your father.I predict that in the future (like in 50 years), this kind of book will be a kitsch collector's item. That's the only reason I bought it. It's just too funny. So I give it 2 stars just because it's funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Nice Girls","review":"If you're really a nice girl, then this book is not for you. I found it distasteful. Sexual Immorality will not enhance your sex life. It may for the short term, but it always creates long-term problems. I wish I had done a little more research before I bought it. I would rather read a book that does not promote masturbation or say that sex outside of marriage is ok. It's not. If you are a nice girl looking for sex the way God intended, then I recommend the books \\"Intended for Pleasure\\" and \\"Sex Begins in the Kitchen.\\" These books will not only guide you on a path to increase your libido, but they will strengthen your marital relationship as well. \\"The Nice Girls Guide to Sensational Sex\\" will only help you become naughty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the money but...","review":"Considering it is a fairly cheap wheel I suppose you get what you pay for;It is sturdy but the pedals dont have a high enough resistance and IMO have too much travel in them.The paddles are easy to reach but the other buttons are a little awkward and take some searching-for if you are in the heat of a moment.The steering is EXTREMELY notchy, which for the game I play makes this wheel almost impossible to use with certain high powered rear wheel cars that are extremely sensitive to slight movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, But Only Lasted 1 Week.","review":"I bought this wheel for 80 dollars at Circuit City, and to tell the truth it was a waste of my money.

I cared just enough about the characters to see what was going to happen to them. <Spoiler alert> Every character is a cliche - the codependent, needy wife; the husband who wants to abdicate his responsibilities and takes up with a prostitute; an anorexic girl; and a girl who cuts herself with razors and Swiss army knives. Marquit's jaded, in-your-face style, with liberal use of profanity and a Darwinian view of high school, is one-sided. Her characters are GOOD or BAD, not multi-dimensional. As far as the plot goes, I got the sense that most of this stuff had never happened to her, and she was going for shock value rather than authenticity. For a high school experience that is rendered in living, breathing, convincing color, I would recommend Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut the Door","review":"I like Marquit's style, absolutely hated the book as a whole.Someone earlier mentioned that teenagers cannot identify themselves well with this novel. I believe this is completely false. While the characters in this novel might be a bit exaggerated, the emotions each character displays are certainly things one can relate to from time to time...especially teenage girls. Desperation, hopelessness, loss of direction, superficial goals, confusion; they are real problems that don't just exist in the world of books, hollywood and soap operas. I enjoyed Marquit's portrayal of these emotions through the characters (who are all deliciously troubled and screwed up).The thing that killed the book for me though is how repetitive Marquit got after the first thirty-ish pages. After being so moved by the first thirty pages, I then half-heartedly read/skimmed through the rest of the book.I look forward to reading Marquit's writing in 5-10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly dreadful.","review":"This book leaves you feeling like a diaper rash in the August sun.

A MAJOR improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top stub checkbook cover","review":"Some of the reviews are pretty,,,, interesting. I guess the picture is somewhat deceptive. This cover is perfect for a top stub checkbook. This refers to check books that usually are spiral-bound at the top with a stub that you fill in yourself above a perforated line seperating the stub and the check. It is most likely too big for a typical checkbook that has carbon copies or has the usual glue-style binding at the top. Top stub checkbooks are not seen often anymore and therefore covers for them are hard to find. I bought this as a gift for my grandmother and she LOVES it!! I will buy another one soon so that I don't have to search so hard for it the next time! It is made exceptionally well and I don't anticipate needing to replace it anytime soon, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Needed something heavy duty to replace my plastic check cover.

Based on the description and reviews, I purchased this movie last year. My teenage daughter and I sat down to watch it, only to turn it off shortly after it began. We kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately the weak story line and poor music (It is a musical.) failed to hold our interest. Perhaps a younger viewing audience might find it amusing, but certainly not teens or adults. Keep that in mind if you do decide to purchase. I plan to give our DVD away this year, and have no desire to even finish viewing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the whole family","review":"This movie was a bit corny but very enjoyable.

Some really cheezy boring songs. Some OK songs. Some filler songs. A really poor effort. Eric Johnson set the bar too high with his previous albums which were fantastic. This just misses the mark in so many ways. Vocoder. 80's electronic drums. Vocal auto-tune?? Really??? Pass on this one and get his previous albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"I loved Ah Via Musicom. It displayed great musicianship, and the guitar tone we all love. Bloom gets the tone back, but this album is very hit-and-miss as far as songwriting. There are definitely some good tracks; Eric starts out strong; most of the songs in the prelude section are great. The last 2/3s of the album, however, sounds like elevator music. Particularly bad are 'From My Heart', 'Your Sweet Eyes', and 'Sunnaround You'. Mr. Johnson has never had a very good singing voice, and the sort of simple and obvious songwriting in these songs makes them even harder to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Monster, But Plenty Good","review":"Can this live up to Ah Via....no, but who could top that? That being said, this is a really good listen as long as you're not comparing it to his masterpiece.....and we didn't have to wait a decade to get this one. I will admit, I was a bit disappointed with my first few listens as I was expecting some huge runs with that unmistakable, larger-than-life tone. But trust me, just let this kind of wash over you and you'll appreciate the music and the thoughtful way the tracks are ordered. Everything is kind of understated and stays in the mix, even his heaviest licks, so it kind of feels like Tones, but there are the usual nuances that you really have to listen for that make this one work for me.But I will absolutely applaud, and eagerly await a work that will rival Musicom. Until then, this will definitely work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise, Charged Up, and Awesome Sounding,","review":"\\"Bloom\\" is a diverse, fantastic collection of sounds and melodies that will surely please any Eric Johnson fan and those who are new to his music. The album begins with the rockier stuff and progresses to more subtle songs towards the second half of the CD. Johnson is a master of every lick, phrase, and riff. Not a single note or beat is wasted. Yet, his music still retains a \\"live\\" feel. This type of musical precision makes for an eminently satisfying sonic experience. Johnson has been playing and recording for a while, but he is still getting better with time. Overall, \\"Bloom\\" is inspiring and sounds marvelous.(Simeon Hein is the author of OPENING MINDS and PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE and composer of the CDs EARTH DREAMING and OPENING SKIES.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Pat Metheny, and now Eric Johnson... when will it end?","review":"Why are all my favorite guitarists putting out albums with absolutely no sense of emotion, majesty or scope (see Pat Metheny's The Way Up)? Instead, this latest effort on the part of Johnson is a collection of hackneyed riffs and song structures, entirely devoid of inspiration and fervor. Where is the enthusiam of Tones? Where are the creative melodies of Ah Via Musicom? Where is the grandeur of Venus Isle? I mean, come on, Columbia, which so many are hailing as the best song on the album, sounds like it could be the theme song for Family Matters or Step by Step. Finally, the album is mastered too hot. My ears hurt after listening... every frequency is overloaded. A great disappointment indeed, considering the nine year wait. On the positive side, the artwork is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable Pap from a Great Guitarist","review":"As a guitar player, I have followed Eric Johnson's career since hearing his early solos on a Christopher Craft record in the 80's. Ah Via Musica was a terrific effort, but this new CD was as disappointing as any I've heard from a major guitarist. The tribute to Jerry Reed cut is cool, but the rest of the songs are really second rate pop-rock that are so devoid of passion or invention that it makes me worried for Mr. Johnson - perhaps he needs to tour w Joe Satriani again to gin up some inspiration. Buy any of his previous efforts to hear how fluid and interesting he was when he was in his prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to review","review":"I can see why some are disappointed with 'Bloom' since a few songs aren't so fresh. Still, this CD is amazing if you make a copy of a \\"Best of Bloom\\" (Of the first six fast songs, I usually only listen to Bloom and the cooler than cool Good to Me.)For me, this would be:1. Bloom4. Good to Me7. Sea Secret8. Sad Legacy10. Cruise the Nile12. Your Sweet Eyes9. From My HeartNot to knock the other songs, but this is the 27 minute CD I like. Perfect in the summer.

In bed resting with headphones on....judgement: this was the perfect time for me to receive Bloom. I can't imagine another release by another artist that would have fit so perfectly. Bloom; transformation; release from pain; connection; openness. Thank you, Eric Johnson.OK, that's not the musical stuff. Headphones were the best way for the first encounter. This ain't no flatland, these are 3 dimensional musical structures. This music integrates, has as essential framework, structure in space. I hear walls being built and cages of tone that hold an incredible menagerie of musical fireflies within.But hey, that's just me - I just got off a morphine drip two days ago!Tones: Set the controls for the heart of the Sun.

Live In Austin is still my favorite all-round disk, but Bloom slots in right behind.

I can see other reviewers rate this cd as a 4 and 5 star? How can they do that. Someone says it's as good as \\"A Via Musicom\\" and \\"Venus Isle\\" I think this cd is very, very booring. Eric plays the guitar like George Benson and his voice sounds like Michael Jackson. And...we've been waiting about 10 years for this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bloom CD","review":"The Bloom CD IS the best yet. This incredible, underated, misunderstood talent--- should have been born in the 60's(when record contracts were easy to get) virtuoso of the electric and acoustic guitar as we know it.... Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you...Eric Johnson.Finally, some cuts from Austin City Limits! I have had the privilege to see Eric three times in concert. In Tempe, AZ. last year, I couldn't make it, but my friend did and he played for an audience of about 150.This wonderful, shy, yet approachable person continues to create and share his talent to others who are aspiring to understand the guitar and it's many facets.And in my estimation, a humble person as well. Just look at the G3 concert DVD. I was in Mesa, AZ. when they had that jam, and you can see, Eric gives way to Vai and Satriani...so they have the highlight when they worked together.I can't say enough about Eric and I can tell you if you don't purchase this CD, you will be missing out big time!Dan CraigArizona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I picked this CD up in another site's bargain bin, not expecting much. I knew Smith from his song on theCocktail soundtrack, which I liked, so figured it was worth a chance anyway. I was very pleasantly surprised with what I got, which was a mix of mostly up-beat, pop-rock songs.On several tracks on this album, Smith shows Caribbean influences, both calypso and reggae. Standouts for me were \\"You Gotta Go Back\\" and \\"Piece of Paper\\", but almost every track was at least good. Exceptions were the lead track, \\"Suzy Wong\\", a mediocre song centered on a fantasy regarding the titular actress on which the faux-East Asian elements fell flat, and \\"Dying Embers\\", which really sank the tone of the album like a stone in the middle and single-handedly brought my rating down from 5 to 4.I don't see any other albums by Smith here on Amazon, but I will definitely be willing to seek his music out in the future based on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected from SOG","review":"I returned this in favor of a knife with a partially serrated blade, but this is still a great knife. Blade is sharp, blade steel is AUS8, which isn't the greatest but it's good, should hold an edge and stand up to a reasonable amount of abuse. The blade is bigger than you would expect, both in length and in thickness. The back of the blade has ridges for your thumb to provide more support. The rubber handle is comfortable, and unlike some knives which have finger grooves cut in, the grip is plain, making this knife comfortably ambidextrous. While it does have a full tang, it isn't as sturdy as I would expect - see for yourself by unscrewing the screw at the pommel, and be careful about flexing the blade side to side, as that is most likely to break the tang. This knife isn't the greatest, and it has a few problems, but it does have the quality you would expect from SOG and it is a nice-looking and well-performing tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrolls update","review":"A thoroughly comprehensive and concise review of the history, palaeography and findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The casting and acting is really good and most of the writing is very good also. There are so many shows that are similar to this on television now that you can watch a dozen each night on cable, if not more. However, it was really fun to watch these first season episodes with relatively youthful actors and marvel at how they have aged and their characters have evolved since the show premiered. The program itself has evolved as well, with different characters and conflicts. If you enjoy this type of program you will really appreciate the episodes in this product. In addition, the price is right! I bought two, one for Christmas present and one for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Show!","review":"I recommend to anyone who wants to watch a show that keeps you on the edge of your seat to buy the first season of Without a Trace. This show is amazing & there is definitely no show out there like it. The cast is extremely talented & I couldn't pick a better cast for this show!

Of course I read the reviews and knew that Bruckheimer produced Without a Trace. However, I was unprepared for how well Bruckheimer differentiated Without A Trace from his CSI franchise. Everything from the opening scenes in which the missing people always 'fade' away to the wrap of each case all has a unique feel.

The series follows a group of specialized FBI agents through the time they learn of a missing person through the time that person is found (alive or dead). Periodically, subtitles pop up to let the viewer know how much time has passed, and as the hours tick by, the sense of urgency grows.With a cast led by the great Anthony LaPaglia, this is well-written and well-acted television. On DVD, the episodes run about 40 minutes each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, AWESOME price.","review":"$20 for a season of any show is a good deal, even a half season.. I was expecting the DVDs to be low quality, lacking subtitles, or something else stupid, but there's plenty of special features and the quality is great.As far as the show goes, it tells a good story, and most of the episodes are well thought-out..

The Season One set is amazing! I agree with other reviewers that you can watch several in a row without feeling like things are getting repetitive. The way the writers slowly allow you to gain insight into the person that is missing makes each episode fascinating and original! I can't wait any longer for Seasons Two and Three to come out on DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No reason not to Buy!","review":"I only saw an episode or two until I purchased the DVD set two weeks ago and I can only say that at $8.99 this is a complete STEAL. If you like Law and Order: CI, you'll definitely like this show as well. What I really liked is the consideration they put into the effects of each case. The pilot doesn't capitalize on it much, but while each witness or suspect is questionned, the scene blends seamlessly into the incident. The transitions between the present and the past is impressively well-done.In terms of value...the series is on 4 double-sided DVDs, which may be an issue for some people but it's a negligible thing to me. The boxing isn't the most impressive thing I've seen either, but it definitely passes. Overall it's a very good deal and I would like to see Amazon put more items of this caliber at about the same discounted price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the show, 3 for the disks (and a huge minus for the seller)","review":"The show is great, no problem with anything about acting, plots, etc etc But - as it happened before - putting series on both sides of the disk drastically reduces quality. In my case, I bought the 1 season from a dealer, watched about half of it, then never finished until a year later. Found out that disk 3 side B - the 2 final episodes - did not exist there. Or may be they exist but the DVD player says \\"No disk\\" to side B. I have no idea whether the disk was like this at manufacturing, or the seller simply did not mention that there was a serious problem with the disks. But because of the time lapse, there is nothing I can do except buy a new copy - this time directly from Amazon - and hope for the best.This happened before with the double sided disks.

One I am a new watcher of Without a trace and wanted to know what season the show is in. The second question was I see all other shows come back next week but do not see Without a Trace on there lineup.

I want to buythem, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for ALP fans","review":"As an Aussie Without a Trace / Anthony LaPaglia fan, this DVD set is a must buy (even if it only plays on my computer DVD player). ALP truly is the show's rock - he MAKES it so compelling and repeated watching of his fine performances only make you appreciate what an extraordinary actor he is. All the other cast members are also wonderful ( especially Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Eric Close) , and you see how fine the set and production values are. The extras are fascinating too - especially the commentary for Fall Out. One slight gripe is that while all the other actors are interviewed on their characters/ favourite episodes, Anthony LaPaglia is noteably absent ... I would have loved to see his take on the complex JAck Malone. That said, it's a fantastic DVD set you want to watch over and over to see the subtle or not so subtle performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show on TV!!!","review":"This show is one of the most sophisicated shows on TV at the moment. Each hour-long episode focuses on the story of the missing person with highlights to the characters' personal lives, and the mix is perfect. Full of suspense and intrigue, you will find yourself hooked to each episode as I am! I am living in the UK at the moment, and we have Season 2 and 3 on DVD - which makes up for TV still showing Season 4! Antony Lapaglia is excellent as the senior agent (see Season 7 of Frasier to see him in a totally different light!) and the other agents are played by extremely good actors.

Collector's Edition my foot.The title is misleading. This dvd has nothing to do with Everest.

If you want to see anything about surviving Everest, watch the Nova series: \\"Everest: The death zone\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie about the mountain...","review":"This movie plays out like a dry cultural movie of the Nepalese people and Edmund Hillary's life. The movie focuses on all that Hillary has done since he first climbed Everest, and how he has dedicated his life to helping the Sherpa people. All this is fine, but the title: \\"Surviving Everest\\" implied that the movie has something to do with the climbing of Everest, when in actuality it's just a half-baked biography / cultural lesson.It is rather slow, and contains no exciting parts. If you're goal is to find out more about the mountain, the other NG movie \\"50 Years on the Mountain\\" is actually about the mountain and is a pretty well-produced film. I also thought \\"Above All Else\\" was pretty good, especially for its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"For mountaineering buffs, who associate Mount Everest with the idea of mountain climbing, the title to the DVD probably suggests the subject of mountain climbers who \\"survive\\" the DEADLY challenge of climbing the world's highest mountain. If so, you are mislead, and if that subject is what you sought in this DVD, this DVD is probably not for you.The one star rating is not intended as a total condemnation of this DVD, which has merits in areas other than the subject which interests me (see previous two sentences). The title to this DVD does not address what this DVD is actually about, the subject of which is unique and is probably of interest to the right audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming movie","review":"Sherpas of Nepal are the people who live in the mountaineous regions near Everest. Following his successful climb of Everest, Hilary asked the Sherpas how he could thank them. The result: he had bridges, schools and hospitals built throughout their region. Later he also brought other major benefits such as reforestation. Because of this, the Sherpa region began to thrive. Anyone who has climbed or trekked in the Everest region has benefitted from the many well constructed foot bridges across torrent rivers. I met Hilary in the high country during one of my 4 climbing trip to Nepal and saw how honored he was among the Sherpas working with our expedition. This movie is about the rich little known culture of the Sherpas and the tremendous humanitarian work Hilary performed among them before his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"History made interesting","review":"This fiction work based on the Bender family really holds your interest from front to back.

It's good for ideas on where to go. But any native Angeleno (such as myself) and avid urban explorer (such as myself) will find these tame strolls too limiting. My advice? Take Walking L.A.'s short routes and triple them, perhaps even quadruple them. Go into the areas suggested but go a lot wider. In a city like L.A., where you often have to get into the car and drive 5-10 miles just to get to the neighborhood you are going to explore, there is no point in taking a mile and a half walk.Although many of these routes are standard and well-known there are a few hidden gems that many natives don't know about, such as Castlemarre and Mount Washington. But again, go longer than the book suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"As an Angeleno my whole life and an avid walker myself this book was a huge waste of money even for the most jaded west-sider who never travels east of Hollywood Blvd. Most of the tours are through the well paved neighborhoods of urbanized Los Angeles and there isn't a single tour of any area, park or point of interest east of the 110 freeway!

When I went to stay with my three-month old grandson, I was delighted that my daughter had provided him with a board-book edition, but when I started to read it to him, I was appalled at the omissions of plot, language, and character. I checked the copyright statement and found no acknowledgment of this abridgement. I think that any copyright holder who attempts to pass off an abridgement as the original should be stripped of the copyright."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember","review":"I remember this book from the early 1960's when I read it. I don't remember that many of the books I read at age 6, but this one stayed with me. It's the sort of simple story that I loved as a child, with characters I could identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting to a 4 year old boy","review":"My son Christopher loves the book. He's 4 years old and this book appealed to his sense of trucks and things as well as to little people in a big, big world. The steam shovel's on its way out, but the characters find usefulness for it beyond it years in a challenging environment. The language is fun and the end is satisfying. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a great classic kid's book, perfect for toddlers who are starting to sit through longer bits of text.

Plus, it's great to read my child a book I remember from my childhood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel","review":"I had this book when I was little ( in the sixtys ) and it was my favorite so I bought it for my grandkids."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABRIDGED!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my 2yo son and was unhappy to discover that the story has been significantly abridged. The plot is there, but much of the charm is gone. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike and his shovel find a use.","review":"This is a well-known children's book first published in 1939 about an Irish-American worker whose steam shovel is soon out-of-work due to the arrival of newer electric, diesel, and gasoline-powered shovels. Yet, Mike and his shovel are still able to find a job and still be useful. No matter how out-of-date one may be, there is always value and usefulness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Fantastic, Wonderful Classic!","review":"As a girl, I read this book a bunch of times and found it very neat. My little one just absolutely loves this book and finds it so neat how Mary Ann and Mike can dig holes so very fast. He loves to watch them build things and work hard, but was really intrigued how Mary Ann could turn into a furnace. What a great, timeless classic to be enjoyed by kids everywhere. I came back and bought it for my child so you know, it's timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes FOREVER to read aloud","review":"Although the story and the characters are classics, this is a book for children who can read to themselves, because it is just interminable to read to them. It's a very long story, with a lot of detail, and can be painful to read again and again (and again and again and again and again, which is really how often you read books to little people)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY DISSAPOINTED IN AMAZON","review":"AMAZON SHOWED THIS BOOK TO BE PRINTED IN THE USA.

The ending... living forever in a basement, immobile, was hellish. I cried in horror at the steam-shovel's fate. While I wouldn't recommend this book to any child, I would be especially cautious if the child has demonstrated any interest in construction machinery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging no one cares about rigid gender roles","review":"It's discouraging to me that no one even mentions the extremely rigid gender roles in this book (straight out of the early 1950s). All the fireMEN are MEN, all the policeMEN are MEN, there is no gender neutral language, and worse, all the girls and women are in totally old fashioned roles...I can't stand it, and the book isn't that great anyway.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Mulligan Kindle","review":"This version does not translate well onto my PC. I can often see the book's narrative at the same time as the narrative added by Kindle.

This is the first time I've had this kind of problem with a PC Kindle book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Got this for my son as I remember reading it when I was a kid. Everything came as promised, on time but it did have significant wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story that builds excitement","review":"We checked this book out from the library and my son had me read it almost every night that we had it. He loved the building excitement as Mike and Maryanne dug their cellar and things got going faster and faster with dirt flying everywhere (it seemed). He even came up with some interesting solutions to the problem presented in the book. Which also brings to mind that the book presents good practice for using problem solving skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Board Book took out the plot","review":"I hate to give this such a low rating, but before you buy the board book edition you need to know that it isn't just shortened, but the whole plot is gone.Yes Henry B Swap is mentioned, but no mention of a challenge to dig the cellar in one day, or he won't get paid.No sun high in the sky and being halfway done.No Henry B Swap saying that since the steam shovel can't get out they don't get paid.No ending where Henry B. Swap sits in the cellar and smiles in a way that's not mean at all.If you want the great story, DON'T BUY THE BOARD BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Kindle edition","review":"The Kindle version of this book is by far the worst ebook conversion I have ever seen. There are multiple pages of repeated text. The illustrations look absolutely terrible, scanned at an unacceptably low resolution. I believe it is an abridged version of the story as well. Don't waste your time or money. This version will only sour your kids on what is an otherwise wonderful children's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the e-book","review":"The e-book was a poor scan job on the book.

Locksmiths will bill you serious money to handle this type of situation, so I went online and discovered this type of bolt cutter will work even on hardened steel.When the Neiko Heavy Duty 4000 LB Bolt Cutter arrived today, I immediately gave it a test on a hardened steel padlock I have that is about 50% thicker than my friend's lock. Just as advertised, it crushed the shaft and barely left a mark on the cutter blade.A note to prospective buyers, the Neiko is heavy...13 lbs and with its 36 inches takes some physical strength to handle. It took a few moments of grunting and maneuvering the Neiko, but it worked just fine. Great product that works as advertised and at an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overkill","review":"This bolt cutter is a good deal, for just a bit more money than a smaller one, you can get this heavy bolt cutter that to some might seem like overkill; but it is not. With the longer handles you can get leverage on almost anything you would need to cut up. Hardened steel and square bolts might take a bit more strength, but this is a very usable tool for even those who are smaller or are not body builders either, although it is a heavy tool in itself.You never know when you might run across something that needs to be cut apart. I have used this on everything from chains, to bolts and fencing, to even cutting apart various pieces of broken lawn furniture so I could recycle some of the materials.It works fine and smoothly and does the job for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and dismal","review":"The poetry itself is great, but you wouldn't know it listening to this tedious depressing voice.

Jilly Cooper knows how to write a thumping good book, and knows her polo, too. The first time I read it, I read it for pure enjoyment. The second time I read it, I paid closer attention to the polo descriptions-she scored both times. A fun, vastly entertaining book that will make you laugh, and give you insight into the fast-paced world of \\"polo-tics\\". Polo players will recognize a few of her characters who are based on real people, or amalgamations of several real people, which gives the book an extra fun twist. Don't give it to your teenagers, it's a little too \\"R\\" rated, but adults looking for a horsey read, with a sexy, over-the-top life-styles-of-the-rich-and-famous touch, will enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"too good to put down","review":"i had heard of jilly cooper before i read this book but i didnt think that her books were for me, boy was i wrong. i couldent put it down i even went to the extent of bringing it into college so that i could find out what perdita was up in between my classes. it was absolutly spellbinding stuff. and as a result i have gone on to read many more of her books and loved them all. she describes everything so brilliantly that you get a perfect image of these people in your head. she brings you to a world that we all think we would love to live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"My copy of Sculptured Knits arrived yesterday.

First, he cuts a major part of the 4th movement (a cut that was common in the 1920s and 1930s). There is no reason for such cuts, on record or in concert. So with this cut, the Maag is out of any competition. The performance was recorded, I believe, in performance, and the orchestra is rather sloppy. Maag, a conductor I respect, is very dull in this performance. The sound is okay. The accompanying Nutcracker Suite adds little to this disc. As far as I am concerned the recording is a waste of aluminum and does little to honor the memory of a fine conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden agenda?","review":"Can't help to feel there is a \\"hidden agenda\\" so to speak with this \\"Art\\". The odd feeling of being around those \\"conspiracy theory\\" types that I have grown to loathe is the only feeling evoked upon my conscience when viewing the hundreds of pages.

It sets the stage well, building characters enabling you to understand how difficult the struggle to overcome life's hardships. A good strong female character that was able to become once again who she had temporarily lost in her life's darkest moments.With the leading male strong and confident enough to encourage, the one he loves, to be just as strong and confident as he himself is without feeling less of a man.A book to ponder how strong all of us can really be under any circumstances in our own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing story","review":"Loved the story line, good read.

Will be reading the rst of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have ever been abused... careful","review":"First i want to say I LOVE Catherine Coulter... She is a great writer... but this book was very disturbing to me... so graphic regarding the sexual abuse. What was nice was she meets a man whom is very gentle and understanding of her. And shows her that all men are not like her first husband. Maybe I am thin skinned.... but this book was very hard emotionaly for me to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Good in 89 and its good now!","review":"I have read all three books in the Night Trilogy. I like it when Catherine goes back and cleans up a book or even adds to it. I personally like the orginials. This book is no exception to her skills. It was kind of hard for me to read through the abuse part but at least she had some one to love her completely.Its not for those who like your typical girl meets boy amd fall in love. I felt sorry for the nanny who lost her mind and became a murdering psycho who turns on her charge.Then there's the sister who keeps her husband with sex. Talk about a screwly family. Its a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"where do I start?","review":"In the begin I liked coulter, but after reading night fire, and then remembering to plot of warrior's song... I'm starting to think she has this weird thing about abused women, and women getting abused, is that a good thing? While warrior's song was flat out rape and then the guy becomes a hero...at least this abuser died. Coulter is really starting to scare me with her writing. Also the dialog is always sooo boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I've always enjoyed reading Catherine Coulter so when I saw that she had a trilogy out I bought the first one and planned to settle down for a great read.

My recommendation is to get a sample first."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Pretty much what everybody else said, this book is...twisted. The beginning was such a turn-off, I actually felt nauseous, and had to put the book down for a long while. When I came back to read a little more, it was boring...It had this cold, unfeeling aura to it. As I attempted to go on, I immediately started seeing what another reviewer mentioned. Burke was pretty much using some warped psychological method of healing Arielle, as if manipulating her to believe him and only him and...I gave up right on the spot. I didn't even try to continue, I already knew it was going to be awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets.","review":"It's hard to believe that a capable writer such as Catherine Coulter would choose to write such mind-numbing drivel as Night Fire.

This version contains the one page introductions of the characters who would become the first Brotherhood of Dada (whose story is told in Volume 2). However, it is still missing Holly-Sleepwalk's one or two page introduction. It's not essential by any means, but I was very disappointed, because I thought all the missing pages were going to be in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Just... Wow.","review":"Grant Morrison is my hero now. Wanna know why?He ripped off Borges, turning an idea into a real story, then introduced (literally) some of the most mixed up superheroes I've ever seen, and kept it coherent and, better, funny. And that's just the first four issues.That's amazing.I can't say enough good things about this comic, probably making this a largely unhelpful review. But if it helps, I can't say enough good things about very many things.I've now read the next two volumes, and can't wait to get volumes four and five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution","review":"\\"Doom Patrol\\" is the kind of graphic novel you'll either love or be completely mystified as to why others praise it so highly. After purchasing and reading the first three books based on rave Amazon.com reviews, I have to be one of the few to add my name to the later category. It's an admittedly clever idea with a lot of interesting concepts and artwork, yet it remains a surprisingly tedious and un-engaging read (a la \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Black Dossier\\"). I have absolutely no desire to read any more of the series and I cannot recommend it to anyone other than philosophy 101 or pseudo avant-garde art students. DP quickly collapses under it's own pretentious and surrealistic weight, skip it, and move on to the excellent \\"Ex Machina\\" or \\"Y The Last Man\\" or \\"Invincible\\" series for a true dose of current comic genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet moments deserve a good read","review":"Sometimes we only have a few moments to read when on camp-outs.

Very nice reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Woman","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books, and Rachel Remen is one of my heroes. Her love and compassion shine through every page of this and her other book, Kitchen Table Wisdom. Each chapter is complete in itself, yet the flow of the book is smooth. Her work is like a river, wide and lovely and deep. I've waited for years for more, but haven't found any. Rachel works with people who are diagnosed with fatal illness. She is a detailed observer of the movement of the soul, and expresses her observations lyrically. I've given both books as gifts, I read and reread them. In times of high stress or anguish, these are books I return to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Stories","review":"This book is a collection of extraordinary stories that have altered my concept of compassion.

Any discriminating person looking for an inspiring and intriguing book will also enjoy My Grandfather's Blessings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom combined with love","review":"I am impressed by how wonder-ful this book is. The book provides brief and easily-read vignettes which can be reflected upon over several hours, and which make excellent points of focus for meditation or for prayer. One can see the blessings follow Dr Rehmen throughout the book. She begins as an appreciative young child who is blessed to spend time with her beloved, wise, and cherished grandfather. She uses her grandfather's advice as she travels through adolescence, through her studies in medicine, and then through her teaching and healing years. One can follow the advice of her grandfather and her character development too, and how important love and wisdom are to a person at any stage of life. The love and wisdom spoken of here are not something she owns or acquires, but are something which she participates in, adds to, and then returns to the source.I think you will find this a loving and wise work, and that you will be happy you have shared with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"Purchased this as gifts for our book group because a speaker at a workshop we attended had referenced it.We all are enjoying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great book!!!!","review":"Dr. Remen is amazing...story after story inspires and is deeply insightful and her gentle healing manner is well revealed in her beautiful writing...

However, it took him until April to just get on and ride it (this due to the jolt you get from stepping on the gas it was kind of scary to him and to the neighbor boy who turned 2 last August). Once they got use to it then it was no problem EXCEPT this vehicle will turn over on your child if they turn it to fast or if they go to fast around a corner. For the same reason they took 3 wheelers off the market they should also take this one off too. I would not recommend this for your child unless they are over 3 1/2 and even then I would not recommend this to be their first vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far fetched and contrived","review":"This was a disappointing tale from a writer I long to love because of my southern roots. The story was unbelievable - the trauma suffered by the protagonist's daughter just didn't seem significant enough to warrant her almost wasting away from depression. Logic was missing throughout the book.

It went on and on; too much redundant sex and back and forth relationship issues. It could have been so much deeper and richer if it hadn't been as repetitive with happenings.

Every tree, every blade of grass, every change in the weather, every emotion felt by Andy, the feel of every fabric, on and on and on. So tedious!!

No more Anne Rivers Siddons for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal lovers beware","review":"Siddons tries hard to make us care about the spiritual, one-with-nature character of her wild mountain man Tom Dabney, but the truth is he's a sadistic and evil beast who ritually sacrifices healthy animals to appease some unknown force in the woods. I normally enjoy Siddons' books, but this one was a huge disappointment. Disgusting descriptions of hunting and cruelty to animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful ending ruins book","review":"I enjoyed the book until the ending (particularly the epilogue). The end so bad I doubt I will ever read another book by Siddons again. For Andy to return to the woods - to live non-the-less - is utterly unbelievable especially considering the extent of the contamination described by the author. By the end, the melodramatic drivel was making me ill (and that's coming from someone who loved \\"Low Country\\").

The content of this book is only surpassed by the excellent execution of its design. Content is well-written, clear and easily understandable. As if this weren't enough, the authors outdo themselves by using a design concept for their FCP3 topics that make already clear explanations, crystal clear. It's obvious that much of the book's high price is due to the high quality screen shots and illustrations all of which are in color. Color makes all the difference, especially when talking about FCP3 where color in the application itself conveys information to the user. The screen shots chosen by the authors to illustrate their explanations make this book a perfect choice for beginners or intermediate users. An excellent book, an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, well done book!","review":"A wish that other software books would be as this... beyond Final Cut it cover many aspects of video editing and is a great source of tips of any kind, very useful for beginners (but also good for experienced video editors who have forgotten some aspects about their work).The design layout and color images of the book are very nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service","review":"We have a quad zone Klimaire.

We have had this unit for 6 months and have not been able to get customer service to help us. We tell them the problem, they repeat their previous instructions (which did NOTHING to fix units). We are considering giving up recouping our $3,700 and ordering a Mitsubishi (we understand they actually have customer service).

The style is primitive, the situations seem forced (like a formula - a book about growing up must have ingredients A,B,C,...), and I am not even commenting about certain axioms the author assumes regarding the equations between GPAs and relationships.

The particularly harsh rating is, because, the book has a very good premise and the writer has potential. But i guess the market forces combined to give this utterly dismiss-able book.Surprisingly,this book has been on the best seller list in India for over 2 years now and the writers new book on Call centers in India, is supposed to be the next best seller.Well, if the writer tried to be more than superficially smart and thought through some issues, spend time to chart the character development of his protagonists, and rise above displaying the quirky exoticness of \\"Hinglish\\", then maybe he would have delivered a satisfying read. But this is just a LAME attempt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing","review":"Granted, no one expects a new author to be a Shakespeare as one reviewer has put it. However, one does expect a decent plot, well developed characters and a rudimentary amount of style.This book has got nothing among the above but a lot of hype surrounding the way it has been marketed.The plot is shallow, a celebration of slackers in the world who are portrayed as the wise ones. The whole point of the book, the story and the marketing and associated success points in one single direction - mdeiocre stuff will grant you success, hard work is for fools.

The story is told from the perspective of those who were his musical peers and those a little younger who would be influenced by his amazing talent. I love the technical stuff about how he strummed and the way they worked different drum techniques into the recordings. The best part may have been the few seconds of Keith Richards or the Everly Brothers though. To hear how sincere they are in their love of the guy was great. As Richards says, he was the first guy to do it all; write his own songs and perform the songs as a self contained unit. There are many things that Buddy Holly did FIRST in the world of rock and roll but that might be his most lasting. This is a great DVD for a big fan but a casual one may not be as crazy for this as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for All Buddy Holly Fans","review":"In reaction to the popular, but historically inaccurate Hollywood film The Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney decided to set the record straight by hosting and producing The Real Buddy Holly Story. Although McCartney's documentary has been around for awhile, it is still among the most important biographical studies of Buddy Holly. The film includes extensive interviews and recollections from the Jerry Allison, Tommy Allsup, Joe B. Mauldin, Sonny Curtis, Buddy Holly's brothers, and other Holly associates and friends. Because of the recollections of all of these individuals a well-rounded portrait of Holly emerges. About the only nagging point is that at times the film oversteps the boundary between telling the \\"real\\" story of Buddy Holly and focusing on Paul McCartney as the carrier of Holly's torch. Kudos to Mr. McCartney, though, for putting this together all those years ago, and kudos to White Star for reissuing the documentary on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of Buddy Holly","review":"We really loved this DVD,as a fan of 50' 60's music and really enjoying Buddy Holly's music,it gave us alot of information on Buddy's life and start in the music business,it's one of the best DVD's we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I got the VHS of the Real Buddy Holly Story and it wasn't closed-captioned.

The movie \\"The Buddy Holly Story\\" isn't his story; this is. Here Buddy Holly is portrayed by Charles Hardin Holley (Buddy's legal name).It is slow moving at times, but the film footage of Buddy himself is worth it! He was quite a performer and quite a man. One gets a little taste of how much rock and roll lost when the plane went down.So, if you want the REAL story about Buddy Holly, get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening reading","review":"This is a book that you'll keep by your bedside for years, referring to it whenever issues arise. As the white parents of an (adopted) biracial daughter, this book completely educated me on the issues that she may face at every point in her development. Not only does it highlight the issues, but works through sensitive and sensible resolutions.I found it valuable that Raising Biracial Children looks at the history of black oppression and how that impacts relations with biracials and whites.I also liked that, although the content is quite \\"meaty\\", they don't dumb it down for the reader, and the book is very readable.Although the book is aimed specifically at those rasing biracial children, educators, etc, it is a useful resource for anyone wanting to raise racially sensitive children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great professional resource!","review":"We live in a society where we are constatntly negotiating race in relationships. Even though we are part of a multiracial nation, we do not always negotiate race successfully. As a clinical therapist who has practiced in the field for over 7 years, this book has proved to be a valuable asset to my professional library. I deal with the impact of race on their lives of my clients (who also happen to be children) on a daily basis. This book has helped me remember the complexity of race and how it infiltrates all human interaction - especially in the lives of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better for grad or high-level, good for novice as well","review":"Many discrete-event simulation books make this book unique. Banks didn't focus particularily on some packages, but the foundation of discrete-event simulation. I think this book intended to people who has some simulation background. It's also a good reference for researchers or grad students as well as practitioners since many literature and simulation vendors are listed. For no-simulation-background reader, this book may be a good starting point -as the first book for simulation. However, you may need other related books if you want to learn some packages. Not a bad book at all, very recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but not for faint hearted","review":"Excellent book for a modeller, but don't ever think that you can take on a modelling project equipped with this book and \\"learn as you go\\".The book is highly detailed and contains no-nonsense advice on approach to simulation of live systems, but it is not a tutorial.For discrete simulation science this book is what Knuth is for algorithms. You do not start studying computer science by diving into Knuth head first.

However, finally took the plunge because I was going to Italy for a couple of weeks. Well, 400 shots later I can say this is an excellent camera. Light weight, great resolution to the pictures, vivid color saturation and the big view screen cannot be beat. I tried out manual settings, auto settings, pre-programmed settings. The portrait setting seemed to have a tendency to take multiple shots even when the camera was in single shot mode and evening photos were tricky but that may be due to my lack of familiarity with the camera. I used it with the Canon 28-105 USM lens. I have been using digital cameras for about 4 years. This is the best camera I have used so far. The camera was also very popular in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to go","review":"This camera has everything that you need, has been easy to learn how to use (it's my first digital camera), and takes great pictures. It's been a lot of fun to play around with. I'm especially interested in low light photography, and have been very impressed with the sharpness and quality of the images even without a tripod. I generally like to set most everything manually, and it's been easy to work with in that regard. Many of the auto features are good enough that it's been slowly tempting me to become more lazy.Also, the software package that comes with the camera has been easy to use. It makes handling the much larger number of pictures I take now (vs. my old Canon AE-1) a lot easier than I thought it would be.If you're looking for a capable SLR camera at a good value, I would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"What a difference. I haven't had much time to learn the ins and outs of it but its easy to pick up and use, even if you've never touched it before. I have an older Sigma telephoto/super macro that throws an error code when used outside with this camera. Canon customer support is awesome though and directed me on how to remedy the problem. They are courteous and professional. The customer service alone is enough to keep me with Canon. The flash mechanism rattles a little bit and makes you think somethings broken when you pull it out of the box but if you read the manual you'll find thats normal. LCD screen is awesome. Functions are pretty easy to navigate, especially if you have experience with any of Canon's PowerShots.

That's about it.Do NOT buy this camera, because you'll be sorry. I'm sorry I spent the 1300 dollars I did to get this piece of junk.

I can only hope that it was returned to some reason other than it was defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice camera but alittle small","review":"I had this camera for about a week now. I bought an EF 28-105mm lens seperatly. I don't know why, but the auto focus did not work right away.It took some fiddling around before I was able to use the feature. I get gorgeous pictures with this camera. My one complaint is it feels small in the right hand. After 1/2 hour of shooting pictures my hand got a cramp. I have small hands and it still felt small to me. If you are considering this camera I'd go to a store see how it feels. I can't imaging being able to use it for a long time if you have a big hands.I'm still learning how to use it. But so far its meeting all my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underexposed","review":"This camera underexposes all photos taken in the automatic mode due to poorly programmed software. This is a very well documented problem with the model yet canon pretends that there is no issue. Obviously this doesn't affect photos taken in the manual modes but for this kind of money the camera should work better than my point and shoot on auto and sadly it doesn't. Aside from this issue, still a great camera, however canon support (or lack thereof) makes this overall deserving of 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Camera !","review":"I bought this camera a couple of months ago and I could not be more satisfied. I have enjoyed photography since I was very young~10 yrs old. Now 35 years later the technology has come a long way and the enjoyment of taking a great shot is attained much easier with the sophistication of a great camera. This camera has many great features that provide quality shots like a pro at the price and simplicity for the enthusiast. I think I will be enjoying this camera for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding camera","review":"Graduated up from an Olympus E-20 and this Rebel smokes it. The user interface is outstanding, really top notch. You can make quick changes on the fly to AF and white balance and ISO speed. The ability to use interchangeable lenses is outstanding. I put a Sigma 70-200mm lens on the Rebel and I get much better shots than ever before. I am a believer that the lens is more inportant than the camera in what kind of pictures you get, but I wouldn't change my mind on starting my rig with a Rebel XTI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP with EF 18-55","review":"I recently bought this Rebel XTi with EF 18-55 lens.

It has features and functions I never would have dreamed a camera to have...Now I have to say, I'm \\"old\\" (56) so I'm used to more dinosaur like cameras. But the Canon Rebel XTi is the absolute coolest thing I've ever used in photography. And, I'm just now learning it. It is like buying a Ferrari and only going 60! There is so much more this machine can do. IT is a dream camera, for me. I can hardly wait to figure it all out!!! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great older version","review":"This is an older version in the Digital Rebel family, and it is a great purchase considering its much discounted price. It does not have a \\"live LCD screen\\" (meaning you have to look through the viewfinder), but the picture pops up right after you take it. This saves on battery life anyway, so I think that's fine. It has all the basic settings you would look for in this type of camera. If you're just an amateur photographer (like me) and don't need a fancy high-end camera, then this is a very smart buy.If you don't have this kind of a camera already, make sure you know what kind of memory card and battery to buy as accessories. Also make sure you know that if you are buying just the \\"body\\" that you need to get a lens separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is my first dslr camera and am I glad I got it!

Yay amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for those looking for a little more","review":"Great camera for those looking to leap into photography in a more serious way or just take better pictures. This was my first SLR. It's simple enough and easy enough to use (and has good enough auto settings) that my wife, who only likes to point and shoot, can use it and be happy. It's light enough I can take it everywhere, even snowshoeing up the continental divide (didn't even slow the battery or performance a bit). Lots of room to grow and customize (I'm using the program setting pretty much exclusively now, very useful). Not very expensive, either. Very comfortable to use (for me, at least). No exposure issues, and exposure is pretty easy to control. Good camera for someone who doesn't quite know what they're doing or for someone who knows exactly what they want. The silver looks cool, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I've had this camera for almost two years now, and I've taken well over 10,000 pictures with it.

Anyway, a great camera, anyone buying it will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy enough....","review":"This is my first digital slr, despite that fact that I have used several others. I bought this camera when it first came out when it was around 700 bucks so it really sucks that it's now down to 600. But anyway, for the price it's unbeatable, I'm an amateur photographer and it gets the job done for me. When taking landscapes however, I would recommend a polarizing filter to counter the extremely over exposed skies, but other than that it's great. Right now it's my primary camera, but in the next few days I'll hopefully be getting the 5D, not to say that I won't still use my old faithful 400D :). TO sum it all up, great camera, great price, despite the fact that it is not a professional camera like a Mark Ds II, but obviously you can't expect that...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Camera","review":"This camera is fantastic.

Indoor photos with the built in flash are also very poor.The exposure problem renders the auto modes. In the total manual mode also if you set the right speed and aperture then light meter shows that it is over exposing. Probably the problem is the light metering issue in the camera. The indoor photos are incredibly dark and underexposed.I also saw many people gave this complain, I hope this is not the problem of the camera model but couple of cameras which are having this issue.When you buy this camera, please check whether the camera is working properly in Auto mode in low light conditions.

The price is not too high that a first-time buyer is intimidated and not too low that you feel its a cheap starter.

I know that I've spent about $2300 on the camera and 4 lenses. It's unfortunate that you still have to spend that to get a precision photography experience, but that's how it is. You can't go wrong with this DSLR.My only complaint would be that I'd trade the 2.5\\" LCD back to the XT for the smaler LCD and the monochrome LCD info screen.

My bro' has a 20D, and that thing is a tank compared to the Rebel, which is amazingly compact. Feature-wise, the XTi matches or beats out the 30D in every respect except burst frame rate (3 vs. 5 FPS) which shouldn't matter. You'll take more pictures if you don't have to lug around a brick. A recommendation: ditch the kit lens, which is not worthy of this body and get an EF-L 17-40 or the EF-S IS 17-55, which most certainly are worthy.My one question to Canon: why don't you put a movie mode in your SLRs?

It is a many-pinned nightmare. I believe there are 28 separate pins on an array in the camera. One dead center of the pin array came loose- on the backside of the printed circuit card inside the camera. It was loose and bent, failing the camera. For whatever reason (lack of customer service I suspect) Canon service refused to warrant the pin array. No damage to the card pin slots, yes I know how to CAREFULLY install the card, and a single loose pin in the center of the array with all others OK, I said? No matter, operator error Canon maintained. Also, Canon sent a canned email response after staying on the customer service line for over 20 minutes. My suggestion- find a camera from another manufacturer with a SD style card! $260.00 for a repair on a camera less than one year old is a crime. 1/3 of the sale price for a pin array repair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable - Won't Boot","review":"After careful use for about 2 years (never dropped or abused), our xTi will not turn on. Canon has been less than helpful. They said to send it in, then when they received it, they said it would not boot (which we already knew and explained to them on the initial call). To fix it would be a minimum of $227 and a maximum of who knows what! They should have told us that before we sent it in and we could have saved the shipping expenses.Research on the web shows that this problem is widespread.

After taking about 20 shots while using the internal flash, the camera starts giving me \\"busy\\" errors and I would have to wait about 15 seconds before I can take another shot! I literally have to wait for 15 seconds on EVERY shot after the error appears! As a result, I would miss a lot of great shots of my daughter, because the flash has to recycle itself! I have read different forums online and many other people are getting the same problem, but Canon refuses to admit that there is anything wrong with the camera. I have had many Canon cameras before this and I never have any problems. Even my Canon SD450 point and shot takes photos using the flash and NEVER gives this error. This camera costs a lot more and performs very poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice!","review":"Very nice camera and worth every penny.

The shipping process was quick and the purchase was easy with amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera Body, Decent Lens","review":"The camera body itself is pretty much perfect for the price. I think the big contest in any of these reviews is the included kit lens, which is pretty okay. It's not a L series by any stretch of the imagination, but if you're comparing it to those lenses, may I also suggest a higher-end camera -- this camera kit is meant for beginner forays into dSLR, and you always have to option to just buy the body...My recommendation is for anyone who is just starting off with dSLRs, this is a great kit to grow from and the lens (while not perfect) will give you a fairly decent normal to light telephoto range. If you've used Canon EF or EF-S lenses and own some already, I would recommend going body-only unless you need this specific range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone Digital","review":"Finally went big time digital. Have a Canon FTb 35mm w/lenses(don't fit this new camera)tired of film processing by outside companies. Now I can take the shot, see what I have , adjust if necessary. On auto mode, it's a point and shoot that's pretty well fool proof for just general shooting. I've had it for a week plus and just starting to use some of the features. Short learning the curve. I bought the kit and the lenses is very usable. Just ordered a Sigma APO 70-300mm lenses to increase my capabilities.The camera was easy, the lenses are a bear!!! So many choices and so many price ranges.Overall I've taken and enjoyed more pictures this week then in the last year. Have a point and shoot that wasn't reallly what I wanted, but will remain a fine edition to my camera bag. My recommendation - GO FOR IT. Best in it's class (this week any way)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good camera but BEWARE OF UNDEREXPOSURE!","review":"I returned the first XTi I received because all pictures were underexposed and after a few weeks of use a permanent green pixel appeared in the picture display. It was a fairly large green pixel. This prompted me to return the camera. The second XTi I received also underexposed every picture. I called Canon, sent the camera in for recalibration (shipping, handling, and recalibration were all covered by the warranty), and received the recalibrated camera within two weeks. The recalibration worked however just this past weekend, a small green pixel appeared in the picture display. It is not as large as the first camera's green pixel. Nevertheless, I am concerned that two XTi cameras have had this green pixel appear within a few weeks of usage. My Canon Powershot S80 has gone through 2 years of tough wear and tear with no such green pixel appearing on the picture display.Overall, I am happy with the camera but have quality concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This is a great camera, loaded with features. Can use it as a fully automatic cameral with great results, or shoot it completely manual with full control over all settings. Intuititive menu and settings. Accurate color. It feels a little small in my big hands, but I paired it with an opteka battery grip and am happy with the heft and feel of it. Still learning about all the features. Brings excitement back to photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera Horrible Media","review":"I have had this camera for a couple of years now and I really liked it until recently while I was in Italy and the camera wouldn't read my CF card. Fortunately, I got a full 4GB card full before it failed.When I got home I realized that one of the pins in the camera was bent and now Canon wants $220 to fix it...........ARGHHHH.Though no fault of my own, I have two San Disk CF cards and one of them goes in label up and the other one goes in label down...GO FIGURE?? WTF.This is just STUPID. To make it worse, I just bought a cool Tamron 18-270mm lens and if it weren't for this I'd throw this POS in the trash and buy a Nikon or some other camera that uses SD instead of CF.Even if I fix the pins there's is no assurance this can't happen again and then it'll be another $220 to fix. Forget about lending my camera to ANYBODY who might do the same thing.This is a very disappointing development so BEWARE if you buy.

I like the larger fonts and LCD screen, being 58 my eyes need a little help . The settings are easy to find and change. The battery life is great, you can shoot all day long. Using a lens with IS cuts it down a little.I like all of the adjustments for the picture styles, you can change the contrast, saturation, sharpness or color tone. You can even make your personal settings and save them. For being the cheapest Canon DSLR this is a great camera. I have three Canon digitals the G3, 300D, and 400D and I like them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Another dodgy compilation from Curb Records and a strange mix of music from the past 50 years to boot.

This a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Share This with All Your Friends and Laugh Out Loud!","review":"We have played this game in a large area that is by a local book store called Third Place Books. There are tables and chairs and there have been as many as six of us playing. We laugh so much that folks come by to find out what we're doing and we have to show them this crazy headlines game. The game is so simple and so silly that it makes no difference what ages are playing. We are all completely entertained for as long as we have time to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Even for the Adults","review":"My 9th grader asked for this card game.

Played it with my mom and daughter (19 yo). We didn't find it fun. This is more like a game for kids. It would help them with reading. Going to give it to a friend who has children. If your looking for a fun party game this is not it. If you are looking for a game to play with your kids and help improve their reading skills this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rules are unclear","review":"The rules for this game are very unclear. It comes with a single card with the rules and the only rule explaining what is valid is:\\"Headlines may be funny and unbelievable, but they must be structurally sound. Acceptable: Blind Dog Weeps for Mayor Unacceptable: Vaccine Tells on Blonde. If the Majority of the players decide that a headline does not make sense, the player who laid the headline down must pick it up and submit a new headline.\\" It does not say why that is unacceptable, it's grammar is structurally sound (Noun verb preposition noun). Is it unacceptable because a vaccine can't tell on something and therefore it doesn't \\"make sense?\\" What defines \\"makes sense\\" in the terms of this game, then? Would any impossible headline therefore not \\"make sense?\\" That would remove a huge amount of funny headlines.Every time my friends and I have tried to play this game we've ended up arguing over a headline on whether it is valid or not, so this game just sits on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"We love playing Quiddler and when we lay down our cards, we generally make sentences out of the words we've spelled out; which can be quite hilarious.

It might be fun for a group or party."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb game don't bother","review":"I got this game thinking it sounded fun, it wasn't. I have purchased a lot of card games and this is the only one I was disappointed in. You want a fun card game buy Five Crowns, Phase 10, or Rummy Royal. All three are very fun and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for all ages","review":"An easy game for anyone, even if they don't like regular card games. This is all about making a grammatically correct headline and scoring big points at the same time with an Exclusive card if you can get it (double your points in the cards played in the hand). It is good for the younger ones to learn how to make sentences and the headlines can be as funny as another person's and score more points too. The only gripe I have is the selection of words; there seem to be many duplications that show up fairly often. You would think that there could not be any duplications given the amount of words in a dictionary. I would like to see additional word card sets offered for sale to expand the selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, an absolute riot!","review":"I got this game around 2004. I brought it to my gaming group and it was an instant smash. Some of the headlines we've made have been hysterical, like \\"Blind widow marries 340 lb. mayor.\\" We've also added a little bonus for each round. The headline voted the best in each round gets an extra 25 points. You can't vote for your own headline. A simple card game that's easy to learn and fun to play. I actually bought a new version of this game because the cards were starting to look worn from so much playing.It comes in a small box that fits in any backpack. My friends and people at gaming conventions have all loved this game. I keep hoping University Games will put out a new edition of this game soon. Cheap enough, around $10, and definitely worth the money. Provides lots of laughs, a great party game."},{"rating":"2","title":"loads of fun!","review":"We play this for family nights. It is a blast!

I'm glad I bought this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"D'oh","review":"If you're a philosphy head and watch the Simpsons or if you watch the Simpsons and want to make some sense out of philosophy, this is a good book. It is a compilation of essays so some are more lively than others, but on the whole I enjoyed it because it gave all sorts of little tid bits to think about via Simpson character disection, but also, reading about episodes in a way where they are all put together in order to abstract philosophical points of view (impressive considering how many episodes there are and the wide-range of Simpson adventures)makes for an enjoyable trip down philosophy lane with much entertainment value enhancing the experience.

However, after having read The Simpsons and Philosophy; it has sparked my interest in philosophy, particularly an interest in Frederick Nietzsche.

It can be entertaining, but also enlightening at the same time. I would probably recommend this book only to those who have seen a lot of simpsons episodes, and/or studied ethics.

It's limitation to \\"experienced people\\" though gives it four stars instead of a full five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrrring.......","review":"This book is less interesting that straight-up philosophy. The relations/references to the Simpsons are normally a stretch or at the very least not funny, which to me makes the reference pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Simpsons Please","review":"This book was less about how philosophy relates to the Simpsons than it was how the Simpsons relate to philosophy. Almost every essay would describe a tenet of philosophy in great detail and then it would somehow remind them of this one instance in The Simpsons. I felt the essays would be both more enjoyable and interesting if more of The Simpsons were in the essays. It seemed to me that The Simpsons were just the ruse to get me to read a book about philosophy. I felt a lot of the essays were not successful proving their theses in relation to The Simpsons. On the plus side, I did enjoy the essay about Lisa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for experts and novice alike...","review":"I read this as a beginner in the world of philosophy and many new and wonderful ideas were brought to my attention.

Really makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get to the D'oh! of it...","review":"The Simpsons and Philosphy, is an interesting look into not only the ficticious characters of Springfield, but as a reflection on American life as well.Not only is there a great debate about the characters and their many flaws, but there are also some insightful ideas about them as well; for example, Marge and Aristotle's virtue ethics.Alot of it seemed to be based in pop culture, an it also seemed to be repetitve at times.The most disapointing thing, is that there are over 30 books in this series, covering eveything from Seinfeld to The Matrix.That being said, it was still an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Tragedy in the Amazon","review":"Hatoum's \\"The Brothers\\" are siblings born to a Lebanese-Brazilian family in Manaus, the largest city on the Amazon river. Twins Yaqub and Omar are each other's mortal enemies and mirror opposites. The story reeks of jungle noises, river smells, and the crowded, complicated family lives of a working class family with secrets and betrayals. Hatoum's structure -the narrator's identity is revealed only slowly, and the narrator himself evolves just as the family and the city itself- is successful. The prose never rises off the page, perhaps a function of the translation or Hatoum's own deliberate style, but the story is a good one. A family and a story whose birth and development bear the seeds of their own tragedy and fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a British Point of View. . .","review":"Sometimes we in the US cannot see the forest for the trees when it comes to our educational system.

If your major is in art or business, you still need to read something more substantial about genetic inheritance. The only part of the book going in the depth of Forensic DNA analysis is a chapter about paternity testing, but... The author of that chapter could not adequately explain how to calculate the probability of inheritance of a genetic locus/marker from alleged father for Paternity Index calculation.

I use to be able to lightly scrub on my trash can and toaster with the abrasive side of my old sponge, and it never damaged the surface.

Not only is author Whitewolf chock to the brim with creative concepts and fun, he's a competent storyteller and has a firm grasp of plot, pacing, and other narrative tricks essential to good stories.The book does suffer though from a lack of strong editing. Aside from cramming way too much into one book, there are numerous unforgiveable grammatical errors (most noticeably \\"it's/its\\" confusion) and the short, choppy sentences and minimal paragraphing are annoying and distracting to the reader.

It has whimsy and fun that will appeal to younger children and themes that will appeal to adults and older children.Aunt Puff's friend Minerva has disappeared while trying to teach Alexandra, a twelve year old girl and the ture hero of the story, how to blow bubbles to play bubble gum charades (just one of the many wacky, highly imaginative creations of the author).

Everyone involved in the DVD played and sang their hearts out. Some of the performances were extraordinary for sure: Al Perkins' steel on every song, James Burton's Tele playing, Raul Malos' singing and the manic but totally appropriate lead playing of Dwight Yoakam's guitar player to name a few. All the \\"big stars\\" rose to the occaision. The concert rocked from the first note to the last. What more do ya want if you love Gram Parsons?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for Lucinda","review":"The production quality is really poor: Bad lighting, worse camera direction. Countless hot guitar solos can be heard, yet few are ever seen. And it's frequently hard to tell if the crowd is even into the show. Still, it's worth to bucks and time to watch. Lucinda Williams is on, especially in her rendition of A Song for You. The two pairs of John Doe and Kathleen Edwards and Keith Richards and Norah Jones are fun to watch. Jim Lauderdale shines as a contributor to many of the performances. Everyone is else is typically solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey I want to have my associated with Gram's, too","review":"Buy the real stuff -- Gram's music, along with the music of the Byrds, Burritos, and related artists like Gene Clark. The music on this isn't so much bad as it is stiff, remote, reverent, fakey country, and just plain dull. No doubt Gram would have loved the attention but he would have listened to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"At its best :Rough . At its worst: Creepy","review":"None of the numbers comes any where near Parson's originals. Would it have dishonored the spirit of the event to have practiced just a little?Sound quality is rough.The low point of the show was the awkward pairing of Keith Richards and Norah Jones for Love Hurts. Keith croaked and leered.(Did he drool? It looked a little like he drooled.) Norah seemed to struggle to hide her revulsion throughout the duet. It was just creepy. Who was more relieved to have the song finally end? Me or Norah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GP Defiled","review":"Why no Emmylou Harris & Chris Hillman? This \\"Tribute\\" DVD is overblown crap, including the worst of Grams' legacy.

I have to admit that even though it was his first novel, it was his best. I was totally absorbed by the story. Set in the late 21st Century, Dickson postulates a world in a cold peace with the fractious CSSH (Confederated States of the Southern Hemisphere) stirring-up trouble. Add an independent space city state orbiting Earth and controlled by a cult-like artificial intelligence, a voyage to Europa to discover the first living examples of extra-terrestrial life (fossils already having been discovered on Mars), and a mysterious and powerful group of aliens now returning to reassert control over our civilization, which they initially started in the dim past, and you've got the recipe for great science fiction. I look forward to Dickson's next work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable Prophecy","review":"This book is really a blend of science fact and fiction. While the story line was good, I enjoyed the science more. From the detailed description of a fast plasma fusion reactor engine for a spaceship to his brilliant discussion of the engineering marvels of a space city, Dickson is right on the mark. There is nothing phony here. He did his research well. He also appears to be prophetic with his discussion of the late 21st Century geo-political scene. Given disastrous current events, we seem to be headed in the direction he theorizes. Dickson is a great futurist, and though his dialogue needs improvement (what author's doesn't?), his story and excellend command of science shine through. I give this book a hearty recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This Book is one of the best book i have ever read. Oni, the author has such a sad story in her life that really touch your heart. Those who survided the 1975 Holocoust you might want to consider read this book. as young child Oni was taken to the Killing camps along with her family, she suffered many death and very harsh treatment.

Not only was her story tragic, but motivating and heroic! I applied her story to some aspects in my life and it has helped. This book is a must read. Not only do you experience one person's struggle in the Khmer Rouge genocide, but you gain knowledge of an event that we should all be aware of, and Oni tells of this event in great and vivid detail that will leave one asking themselves what they can do to help change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring","review":"I have taken a long time in writing this review because I have been searching for a way to convey the impact that Oni's story has had on my own life. This is a story of survival in the face of one of the most deadly regimes of the 20th century, and as one reader said, the fact that she is still alive and could write this book is amazing. But what is even more amazing to me is that Oni has managed to somehow transcend the horrible atrocities she experienced and with great passion has dedicated her life to developing initiatives to help the world choose to live in compassion and peace. Anyone who reads her words or has the opportunity to hear her speak will surely be inspired by this remarkable woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Wings of a White Horse","review":"This is a very good book even if disturbing because of the real life events the author shares. I encourage all to read it if interested in Cambodia and it's people.

Because it is very simple and because the examples are so straight forward, the children can understand the lesson. The first lesson talks about the church as a building and why we gather in a church. There is no big long reason other than it is physically easier. At this age level, this is the only reason they need to know. It also states that you can have church at other places but does't bog the children's mind down with details.

The rear caliper has the emergency brake mechanism on it and is extremely difficult to get in the correct position so that the brake piston will recede into the caliper.

Karl Malden, and B.) a terrific musical score for an opening/closing theme. Actor Michael Douglas's early entry into Hollywoodland is a serendipitous plus. A lot of these episodes show a great deal of \\"topicality\\" -- that is, the social problems that plagued the 70s form a template for dramatic criminal plots that Lt. Stone and Inspector Keller must deal with. In this way the show is somewhat of a social \\"time capsule,\\" but it is interesting because while times change we are still facing many criminal problems today and crime drama is still just as relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streets of San Francisco Season Three","review":"I have yet to buy this season on DVD. I have no doubts as to the quality of the scripts, the acting, and the video quality we're accustomed to from this DVD series and indeed was one of the best seasons if my memory serves me correctly. My disappointment is that they haven't offered the season as a bundle, and almost $60 sure is a lot of money for a TV series season especially after we waited all these years for it. Season 4 was released as a bundle, but it appears that with S5 they're on the same money making scheme of S3. They know the have us, and they have us where they want us.

And it's still as good a book years later. Sarah is a very good writer and, perhaps, a better story teller. Her experiences are interesting and enlightening. Her sense of humor and her ability to relate the same are exquisite. I feel badly for those French women who wouldn't give her the time of day - she is the sort of person that most women would (underline) want for a friend. As mentioned, I love this book.

I was even more put-off with her constant whining about things that did not go exactly how she pictured.There are so many unanswered questions that I wondered if she bothered making a seconded drafted of her story.There is too much whining and too little about the people around her, especially about Fredrick. I think she expected too much and did not give enough of herself. True, there are some funny moments, but to put it bluntly, I'm glad I only checked this out of the library instead if buying it like I was intending to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed outloud","review":"As an American and a part-time resident of Paris, I had to laugh at the many funny situations described in this book.

It seemed like an interesting true story, and I enjoy reading books set in the locations I am traveling in. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I felt like it really helped me understand French culture a little better. As an American who speaks only the amount of French learned from Pimsleur's first level of language CDs, I was really nervous about going to Paris as the reputation of Parisians is that they are really snobby. This book was great because it was written by a backpacker who visits Paris and ends up staying there. Her experiences with Paris and Parisians helped me understand a different perspective on locals seeming snobby or why everyone had dogs. I'm sure someone who is a native French-person or has lived in Paris for decades might find the viewpoint simplistic, but I found it enlightening and entertaining at the same time. A perfect read for a trip to Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delightful","review":"The book is interesting and delightful. The scope, probably due to the narrative focus, is very limited. The book will be better if the author describes her experience in other parts of France."},{"rating":"2","title":"paris assimilation","review":"This is an interesting perspective in assimilation into a fairly closed culture that include the difficulties and frustrations of attempts of entry into life in a large foreign city. I would recommend this not as a model, for other foreign cities have their own personalities, but as a preparation for issues that one may encounter. There is a romanticism of living abroad, but that may need to be tempered with a little realism and I believe that Almost French: Love and a New Life In Paris provides some a foreigner's insight into particularly this fairly closed culture upon arrival. I enjoyed this portrayal a great deal and would recommend reading it to both travelers and armchair travelers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and fun","review":"Very well written. Entertainingly true story of an Austrailian journalist who moved to Paris and eventually adapted to her new life with the help of her French boyfriend. Of course, there are many missteps and misunderstandings along the way. Turnbull presents these in a way that shares both the frustration of the moment and the amusement of looking back from a more enlightened future. Provides an interesting outsider turned near-insider's perspective of French culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not An American in Paris...","review":"After reading several reviews of this book I was surprised to see how many people misinterpreted it. The woman in the memoirs is AUSTRALIAN not American.I acutally read this book while I was living in France on an exchange program and was terribly homesick. The memoirs kept me engaged and I laughed outloud at some of the French mannerisms that I ran into every single day and could totally relate to the author.The book held my interest and at times is extremely funny and lighthearted. I'm almost hoping the author moves somewhere else and writes another book about that. Fans of Bill Bryson will enjoy this book immensely.I reccomend this book for anyone who is going to live in or visit Europe.

When I tried to take the CD out of its case I noticed that the material it was made of was thin and flimsy. So as I pulled it out the disk in the middle was split.

The author must have alot of family and friends registered on Amazon, because I really, really don't get it. There is no love story to be had; and yes, the one and two star reviews are right- why is Frederic, an alluring and charming Frenchman, with this unsophisticated, whining, (unattractive, even by the author's subtle descriptions) foreigner? I just don't get it. Not a good way to be introduced to the French culture. And not even an entertaining love story to read during lunch break. Chuck this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read, but a little irritating at times","review":"I flew through this like a box of peanut butter M & M's! It certainly rang true and was witty, entertaining and romantic, (It would make a somewhat entertaining movie, too) Although Sarah tends (in my opinion) to whine a bit, \\"I don't actually *live* in Paris, i'm two metro stops away, oh noo! Tragedy!\\" I can understand her puzzlement and anger, but I think she should have considered herself damn lucky she had a well established, wel-to-do French boyfriend. Some Australian women who go to live in Paris don't have anyone to support them, spend money on them or let them live in modern spacious apartments. Apart from this, \\"Almost French\\" is a very good read. Read it on your way to Paris on that long flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"good writing, a clever, sincere view of Paris and the French","review":"I got this book to read on a business trip and it went almost too fast. Sarah has a great style of writing to make the sentences disappear. I'm one of hundreds of poor Americans who love Paris and dream of living there.I wanted to write this review only to point out that her mention of the movie Ridicule is inaccurate in saying it is about Louis XVI's court: it is Louis XIV's court.

I would return it, had I kept the receipt. I was perplexed about why she didn't just focus on making a book about her love life. Maybe that would have been more interesting, but she hardly makes her French boyfriend sound the least bit important to her. I am an American young woman, so maybe I don't understand her humor. Most of the time I felt like the French had to put up with her, and her lack of sophistication,than the other way around. Yet another whiny book about someone living in Paris and complaining about it, which I find completely rude, and sort of seems to justify the French people's animosity towars Americans (though the author is more like the Brits)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an idiot","review":"This is an awful book, written by an idiot television presenter, about her romance with an obnoxious and jingoistic Frenchman with zero social skills.

You literally open the hood, take the cover off the filter, take out the old one, put the new one in, and close everything up. It only takes a minute or two, and next to no skills with cars. If you know how to check your oil, you can change an air filter. The price on Amazon is great too, better than going to an auto parts store and definitely better than having your mechanic do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"Got this item on Amazon, and put it right into my Mom's 2006 Mazda6 Touring with no issues at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really really pleased!","review":"Bought this Air Filter for my 2008 Mazda CX7 along with a TYC cabin air filter. Easy to install, took like 90 seconds and can't say enough about the great price. Dealer had quoted $48 (dollars!) to replace the engine air filter and $58 to replace the cabin air filter.

More like total slush...","review":"So, I previously purchased the \\"chunk\\" version of this product [Native Forest Organic Pineapple Chunks, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)] since I love pineapple, and they were delicious. The chunks were of a nice size, and even my cat kept bothering me when I ate them, as he apparently liked the sweetness of them.Then I saw this version, labeled as \\"crushed.\\" The picture basically makes it look just like smaller chunks than the \\"chunk\\" version. But it's not. Instead, it's like this awful kind of sludge or mush, and for some reason it comes from a different country than the \\"crushed\\" version, and doesn't taste as good.In my opinion, stay away from \\"crushed\\" and go for the \\"chunk\\" version.

The various family hiccups in central character Zach Walker's life are centered around his relationship with his daughter in this book, and as in Bad Move, the have a resonance with any father of a daughter. Barclay continues to take everyday occurrences that any one of us could find himself in and twist them into a farcical romp that will put you in stitches.

The latter seems to be the case here, as this came out in 1986, way before metal developed a sense of humor.

That's what made it a great challenge and joy to read. The amount of sources mentioned were amazing due to the incredible amount of work that the author put into shaping the story of our country's beginning. It appears he wrote this book for the more advanced student of American history, compared to the Oxford series which was really a great summary of numerous years of history. I specifically enjoyed the many references to John Adams and his correspondence with other decision makers during that time period. In summary, this is an advanced American history book that will stretch you a bit but make you better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cards to keep","review":"I really enjoyed the mythic tarot cards.

It was, in fact, my first deck. I've done readings for friends and family that amazes them with the accuracy of the readings. The cards are a little large, but one gets used to that. The cloth is unhemmed polyester, with the Celtic Cross stamped on it. The books has much good information, although the binding isn't as strong as it could be. Mine is still holding together, but I am very careful with it. I've recently purchased several more decks, but my friends and family still like the readings from this one the best. Since this has been my one and only deck for such a long time, and Reversed cards are not addressed, I'm just learning how to do reversed cards (with the new decks) within the last few months. I've got two friends that want this deck for their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing for Beginners... Flimsy Book!","review":"I am a beginner Tarot reader.

This is the reason I purchased them. And the cloth is a nice touch. But the book is shoddy...the cover fell off the day I purchased it. I was so disappointed! On top of that, you can tell when a card is inversed - and there's no mention made as to the symbolism of a card should it happen to fall into that \\"upside-down\\" position.

Upon discovering from a friend, I was in love with the imagery based on greek mythology. The book is very informing and descriptive on each card and more. The cloth is in fine condition. The deck itself is wonderful, the images are beautifully drawn and vivid. So far I've had about an 80% accuracy rate of this deck. Which is good and sometimes amazing when it is accurate. The only problem and it's probably the old edition but the glue on the book spine wore off after a week or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be better for the beginners .","review":"It is worth owning especailly for the beginners interested in gaining a deep insight to the story behind each character on the Tarot card and knowing how to apply it to the real life .

I think this is because the Greek stories that are used are deeply familiar and embody universal archetypes and meanings. I use the deck for stimulating my thoughts and clearing my mind rather than for divination; the symbols and their associated ideas are highly potent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mythic Tarot","review":"I promptly received both the book and deck in the original box in great condition.

Its basis in Greek mythology enabled me to understand and remember the cards and their meaning far sooner than I anticipated. If you are familiar with Greek or Roman myths, you'll catch on in a snap. I find this deck particularly helpful when I'm reading for friends. They don't need to be metaphysically inclined to appreciate and understand what the cards are illustrating for them.The important thing in choosing your tarot deck is that it speaks to you. If you feel a connection with the imagery or source theme of a particular deck, then go with it. You'll have clearer readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Beginners","review":"I had never seen, let alone used tarot cards before so I was a little nervous about purchasing a set that would leave me behind, lost and confused.

If you are a beginner or are just someone looking for a beautiful deck, I would recommend this to you. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"The Tarot Deck itself was missing the Death Card it had two of the The Hanged Man Card.

It starts off really boring, and got me thinking \\"I'm glad this was only straight-to-DVD\\". The whole film is really weird. The scary scenes aren't even scary, either. There's really nothing that's special about this film. Another thing that was really horrible was those creatures. They were so fake and dumb looking. The ending sucked also. Altogether, this film was a HUGE dissapointment, especially when it came from the creators of [REC] and Quarantine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I watched the whole thing!","review":"This is one of those movies that, watching it, you keep thinking \\"it has to get better!\\" It doesn't!

There are just too many holesin this movie, and as you get closer to the end, you can't stop thinking \\"come on, this isridiculous!\\".Just to give you an example, the highlight of the movie is when his young son finds a loadedrifle hidden into the piano. And Kevin Costner, who is the dad, buries the rifle into theground. Who does such a thing? Especially if things are getting scarier. I could see orderinga machine gun, or more ammunition for the rifle. :)There were just too many holes in this movie. Your mind is wondering about these inconsistenciesinstead of feeling the suspense and drama. Kevin Costner is a great actor with many good moviesunder his belt, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This movie was horrible.

The editors did a poor job with the result that the viewer feels \\"how did we get here?\\" quite often. The ending is not expected and you have to sit with it for a while to come to any kind of understanding of its origin. \\"I'll never leave you, \\" Costner's character swears, in a touching bedtime moment.

The whole flow of the story was chaos. Ant people associated with Native American mounds?!?!? Plllleeeaaaase! That was an insult to my ancestors who built these mounds in the south! What was with the spiders in the doll? What did that have to do with ants? What was the relevance of those nest looking things in the closet? Not to mention the total misperceptions placed on Native American ancient history of the mounds, there was no consistency or flow to the actual scary parts of this movie. In addition, what were the bites on her back? Were they spider bites? Were they ant bites? All in all this movie lacked all of the necessary ingredients that make a quality movie. I feel sorry for all of those people who spent their hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, it stinks!","review":"The New Daughter has NO CREDIBLE PLOT and the film is without merrit.

If you are expecting anything of quality, or well done suspense, you will be sorely disappointed. He must have been desperate for money to make this insult to our intelligence. This film is a blight on his fine career!!!! The director is either a novice or needs a refresher course on what makes quality suspense.

I was not expecting Bose quality for the price and location, but I did expect to be able to hear music. As other readers mentioned, the volume was pretty low- when it was working. Shortly after the warranty ran out, the CD died, leaving the radio as the music source. Neither the tuner, reception, nor the sound was much good, although I must admit that radio reception in my housae can be spotty. The \\"fog free mirror\\" is not a real mirror- it appears to be some kind of plastic coated foil, and is pretty distorted right out of the box. In a short time, it gets water stained, and becomes totally useless, so if you need a mirror in your shower- don't count on this one. It also seemed pretty big and heavy for something so lacking in guts.After this failed, I bought a Sony, which cost about double the price, but seems to be worth it. If you don't want to spend that much money, I'd consider trying one of the alternatives in that price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL DUD !!!","review":"After reading some other reviews on this shower radio cd player, I just want to add, that the sound is so FEEBLE, you could place it next to a sleeping baby, turned on, volume set to maximum, and not worry about waking baby. Impossible to hear in the shower!!! I would have settled- if all I could hear was the treble, but this thing can barely muster a whisper. It's a joke. Don't buy it-you will be stuck with a useless radio/cd player. Too bad, because it is a good idea- shop carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Immediately when I got it in the shower, the mirror fogged up. I tried to turn on the radio, but the nobs don't have edges and if you're fingers are wet you can't turn on any of the dials! Sounds like the engineering department never actually took this into the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality","review":"For a shower cd/radio player this product is terrible.

Then I realized that, unlike what's stated in the directions, there is no pull out tab for the clock battery so the battery is dead long before it gets to your door. It's a pain to replace and an annoyance because it's supposed to come with one working battery. Sound quality seems okay so far but be prepared to buy your own clock battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips","review":"I couldn't find one cd that would not skip in this thing, and it wasn't even in the shower, it was on the steady toliet next to the shower.

Yes, the sound was horrible, but I could deal with that if I could just listen to a song on the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JENSEN JCR SHOWER CD PLAYER","review":"There were no problems hearing any CD's or AM stations, but the FM stations had too much static.

This radio/cd player however, is JUNK! the maximum volume is very low and completely in-audible with the shower running. Even in a quiet room- the volume is barely above a whisper. So don't buy it - you will be very frusterated and have an essentially useless product on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and Baulky","review":"Put any source of music into the shower, and you've vastly magnified the experience, whether that means waking up with more zest or soothing down with more soul.

For a few bucks less, you can get more in some competing products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"PLEASE do not purchase this item. It sounds terrible, eats batteries, the mirror fogs, the knobs don't work once it's wet....the worst part? That neither Target nor the manufacturer will stand behind this product.

The clock didn't work (pull the tab and it connects the battery) and neither did the light. The knob to turn the radio on is difficult to grasp especially when in the shower. The volume is loud which is a plus. The mirror fogs up immediately making it impossible to shave in the shower. I was looking for a unit that would let me listen to sports radio in the am when I shower, provide a fog free mirror so I could shave and provide the time so I wouldn't be late for work. This unit promises on all 3 but only delivers on 1. I wouldn't buy again or recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing way too small","review":"These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small!

But it went through abuse, drops, on aircraft, car, foreign countries. Basically surprised this lasted as long. Only technical issue is that the battery never lasted more than 90min. And only got worse as time went on. Now it lasts about 30min, is starting to get flaky with reading disks at startup. It's been retired to being a home player hooked up to our LCD tv. Not sure how much longer it could last, so will start shopping for a home blu ray player.In summation, I expected it to only last a few months, which is why I got it from \\"return-it-for-refund-after-a-couple-years\\" Costco.

The picture quality is nice, the price is low, the design is sleek and the case seems really useful.But that's the problem. The case will only hold the machine securely (or close at all) if the battery is removed. So, if you want to watch in the car and strap the nice case to the seat in front of the kids, the machine has to be plugged in! Doesn't seem very portable. If your children are done watching it by battery and you are ready to put it away, you have to dissemble it to get the case to close. Not really acceptable for me.Also, we have, in the past, hooked the Nintendo up to our portable DVD players. This does have an AV In, but I couldn't get it working. I admit, it may be my cord, but it worked in my last machine. I will likely return this machine and try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 8 months","review":"This DVD player was pretty nice while it lasted.

This album has the hit \\"Goodtime\\" that you will probably recognize immediately, but there are so many other gems that deserve a listen. The song \\"Sindy\\" is one of the few (if not only) spiritual songs that addresses temptation from a man's point of view, and Brent deserves props for including it here.This album is a strong contender, and in many ways is superior to some of his more popular peers' efforts (such as Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation project).

Well I returned to it after a few days and sparks started to fly ITS very good and different to anything else i own. I realy like this CD, it has a progressive edge and also rocks, I cant stop playing it and it keeps getting better and better.

This album is a great example of how diverse a metal band can be, here Therion provides a real soulfeast for versatility lovers. The other remarkable thing that shows on the album is a selection of tracks originally belonging to other bands - not quite the most popular, but those which attract Therion's musicians by their very musical essence. The re-evaluation of those tracks, which shows apparent respect to the authors, is also impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang, I should have listened to this before I bought it","review":"Sorry to break the string of good reviews on this album, but I just can't let this album slide. Having really enjoyed Theli, I thought this would be a decent album. Maybe I'm just a bit tired of the whole orchestra metal thing, but this album is boring anyway. Thought there are moments of intriguing composition, most of the album seems like a forced effort to combine church choir and rock. And what the heck are songs like Crazy Nights and Thor doing on here? They don't quite fit, but maybe that's an attempt to break up this monotonous recording. As I listen to it right now, I can see how parts might grow on me a little more, but Theli is just far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, one of the most underated country singers out there","review":"I won't regurgitate what all others have said.

While Nashville claims it was an oversight (they normally don't allow so many new artists to release albums) I think the infusion of new talent enhanced country immensely. They probably need to do it again (and soon!) judging by the decline in quality country music today.Hal Ketchum was in that crop of rookies in the early 90's and I think his voice stands out as one of the most unique and melodic I've ever heard. I highly recommend this album to any country fan. This was his first and arguably his best album, though I also enjoyed his \\"Sure Love\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good schtuff","review":"Instead of saying \\"recommended for Mars Volta fans\\" it should have said At the drive-in.

It was a masterful story, wonderfully told. The protagonist, Ian Gidman, is easy to identify with - his struggle against his bte noir, Richard Tweedle - his devotion to his lover, Claire - his fight against other overwhelming odds. The agony builds, as does the ecstasy, and you simply can't escape. You've GOT to keep reading. Putting this book down part way through is not an option. There's double-dealing, unsettling family relationships, deep intrigue, loyal friendships, love, lust, greed, pain - it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride. I just read through the other reviews (16 at the time of writing this) and many of them say it better than I can. This is quite simply a book not to miss.

What you may not know that Mr. Preston is also an accomplished horseman and survivor of several long journeys across the deserts of the Southwest U.S. As always, you learn about the subject at hand as well as his traveling companions. This book is about traveling the Navajo creation story and learning a little about the traditional Navajo people's world view.

I'm exploring gastric bypass surgery and this is one of the few books I could find. Dr. Martin, as an MD who has gone through the procedure, has a unique opportunity to give detailed advice from the inside. Unfortunately the advice is not nearly as detailed as I need and the book reads like it was transcribed from an audiotaped lecture by someone with a limited vocabulary. Typos, sentence fragments, paragraphs out of context, mistakes like \\"undue lading\\" for \\"undulating\\" and \\"peculiar ready\\" for \\"peculiarity,\\" a length of 93 pages in a large double-spaced font ... this book is not nearly ready for prime time.

Before dismissing this concept completely though, I should point out that no one has yet met any aliens, so we have no idea of alien culture and know absolutely nothing about their laws. This might make the premise of the novels slightly easier to swallow.Having got that objection out of the way, I think that Rusch does an extremely good job in creating a realistic future world although I was somewhat bothered with the hero on the moon speaking to someone on Mars in apparent real time. The character development is very well done and the police work a believable future extrapolation.I didn't think this book was quite as good as some of the previous ones but it was still a very enjoyable read.

The articles that I have read are well written and reliable in the information they provide, while also remaining accessible to a general audience.

In this, our first intriguing glimpse of the Underdark, we are introduced to the bleak, gothic netherworld of the Drow - your veteran heroes (levels 8 to 12) will battle through endless hordes of their minions, as well as the Illithids, as they confront the dreaded lich Asberdes, and plunge deeper into the depths in search of the Vault of the Drow! A true classic, highest recommendation; the next chapter in the Against the Giants saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brownie Points","review":"This is a very good album, especially for fans of traditional country music. Traditional fans would probably find this to be a 5-star effort. The music definitely has traditional instrumentation. Jann's voice is very clear and well suited to this genre.

Schwartz is an especially astute observer of telling historical parallels and refined ethnic sensibilities, probably because he speaks the languages and makes himself available to discuss the political and religious implications with soldiers, politicians, scholars and common people. The study represents a political analysis of the central issues between the Serbs and Albanians that continues to exasperate the area. Unlike many political commentaries this work provides glimpses of the history, culture, literature, poetry and passion of the people making this account rich read with the narrative flow of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!!!!!","review":"Unless you have a computer with 1995 windows or lower DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!

In addition, Mr. O'Toole inexplicably does not include the details of the porn star Savannah's untimely suicide at the end of her career. He refers to her as having \\"died\\" after quoting her at length on her financial success at the height of her career.

They explain it as Cayce speaking English but at the same time gathering the information in another language...whatever the reason is, you have to really read closely to get his meaning many times. The fact is the man had a connection like no other and helped many, many people with the information he accessed. I think the additional insight it provides will allow all of us to maintain an open mind vs accepting literally everything we're told by the organized church (whose motives have always been pretty obvious from the beginning...they've killed more people in the name of God than we've lost in wars)....we need to form our own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"\\"Tedious\\" is the word I would use to describe my experience with this book and that's not the experience I'm looking for.

What I found difficult was the author's explanation of the Readings and the Readings themselves. I found myself reacting after each Reading with \\"Huh?

I will admit I mostly only watched it for Kate Winslet, since she's a truly amazing actress, but I ended up loving it for more reasons than that.This series isn't for everyone... don't watch it expecting a rollercoaster ride of adventure. This is strictly drama. I loved this series because of how true these actors/characters were to human emotion... you almost start feeling what they're feeling when you watch it.

We have seen the excellent movie with Joan Crawford many times over the years, and it never fails to hold our interest.

As a matter of fact we haven't even bothered to look at the whole thing losng interest by the end of part two. I'd rather look at my DVD of the Joan Crawford film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Status Anxiety","review":"Mildred Pierce is a 5+ hour HBO series about the lengths people will go to to prove to themselves and others that they possess an uncommon fineness of spirit (even though artistic and other forms of hard won success provide no such evidence). In James M. Cain's universe everyone seeks some kind of elusive (economic, artistic or other) status but no one ever finds it and thus no one is ever fulfilled by anything and this turns everyone against each other. Any fine qualities that may exist are trumped by petty ones. There is no alliance that is not tainted by envy or resentment or disapproval. This vying for status is not unique to the American experience but Cain identifies a particularly American brand of existential insecurity and distrustfulness that isolates individuals and drives them to construct their own private universe of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK WITH NO THRILLS OR EXCITEMENT","review":"Where was the excitement? Where was the tension and suspense? This book had everything happen in such a straightforward and dull manner that nothing was a surprise at all. The villians, heroes, side characters were all done so matter of factly that it was impossible for the reader to feel anything while reading the book. Moreover, I think the book can't compare to the same level as the masters in the genre, so it comes across as a pale and weak imitation. I would advise the author to come up with something more original and unique the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY QUITE DULL AND UNINSPIRING","review":"Too many predictable and unoriginal parts to this thriller. I think the author borrowed too much from what was already out there--I've seen hundreds of movies and TV shows and read many other books that have similar themes. What was the point? The characters could have been better developed and made into more interesting characters, but as it was, I found them all too predictable to get any interest in them. The technical part of the book was way over simplified and unbelieveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING NEW TO ADD...","review":"I agree with the others who have found that this book is unoriginal. Author evidently had other reasons for writing this book-- the plot is borrowed from countless other thrillers and he manages to update it with a computer/high tech slant. But the big issue I have with this, is that he doesn't carry this to the end. It seems the \\"importance\\" of the high tech threat fades away toward the end so that the climax and conclusions are reached without so much as a strong word about the original threat. Strikes me as if the author wasn't well organized in his thinking. Some of the action scenes are OK, most are dull and borrowed from something else. This book neither thrilled me, or frightened me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DULL HODGE-PODGE OF BORROWED THEMES","review":"This book was very unoriginal and uninspiring. The plot was not really unique, all things considered. Another high tech threat to the world brough upon us by misguided (and illogically defined) bad guys to be resisted by the tragic hero and the good loooking, cold-hearted heroine (who secretly has a crush on the hero). Enough. What could have been an enjoyable read turned out to be a seemingly mindless outporing of borrowed themes and copied characters. I wish the author had come up with something more original than this. Ending doesn't satisfy or leave you with anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"ORDINARY AND NOT VERY EXCITING","review":"Intriguing premise but the way the characters interacted with each other made the novel seem so ordinary and run of the mill. Nothing unique in the relationships or in their interactions and this detracted from the novel a great deal. Others have said that the characters were very predictable and even stereotyped, and I would agree. This entire book is very ordinary and not remarkable. Given that there are so many other fine books in the genre, I think you would be better served to find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAVES YOU WITH THE BIG EMPTY FEELING","review":"After enduring chapter after chapter of the same old actions, you'll wonder why you started this book in the first place. Of all the books in this kind of genre, it has little new to offer, virtually no new wrinkles, and it borrows heavily and liberally from other styles and plots. Everything is predictable and this makes for very little tension and excitement. The characters are a farce and a pale imitation of real people. The motives for each of the characters is incredibly weak, and this makes it very difficult to be persuaded with anything that they do. The ending chase is so long and drawn out that you feel no thrill when its over--just glad that the author finally moved on to the next scene. This book doesn't even read like a movie or screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AND NOT ENTERTAINING","review":"The author was unable to really sustain any suspense to this book. The plot was so typical of thrillers these days, that only one skilled in characters and imagery could pull it off, and the author was deficient in both areas. I found the actions totally predictable and the characters were so weak and illogical, I just about gave up on finishing the book. Those looking for this type of genre would be better served waiting for a Crichton or a Cussler."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE THAN AVERAGE","review":"The plot, assuming some connection between electronic computer communications with the human body was wound up with a \\"living\\" program with a backdoor. What a convoluted, overly-complicated plot. The characters were pretty much run of the mill cardboard stereotypes the way the author wanted them and this added to the general poorness in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELOW AVERAGE, RUN OF THE MILL THRILLER","review":"Don't confuse this with anything from Michael Crichton--it doesn't come close on any level of originality, suspense, science, or characters. Instead, this is a very ordinary thriller that has very little impact on you after you're finished with the book. The science part is promising, but what I really don't like is the haphazzard way it is introduced, and, toward the end, it seemingly shifts to secondary importance. Really! The motivations behind the different characters is quite poor and unconvincing. The action is quite predictable so that the reader won't be thrilled or held in any suspense. In the end, this is a very very ordinary thriller with a very poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves you with a big \\"SO WHAT?\\"","review":"I found the book so unoriginal and predictable that it really didn't hold my interest. Characters were so predictable it was laughable. Even if the idea wasn't original, at least the author could have made it interesting, but he glosses over so many key details, and lingers painfully long on the unimportant, you wonder what's going on. The ending was so anti-climatic due to the failure to keep you in suspense, you're relieved when the book if finally over. I think the author needs to really refine his storytelling skills before trying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great colossal bore","review":"I guess these kinds of thrillers are a dime a dozen. Very little original here. The characters are wooden imitations of the real thing, and that in itself isn't the big shortcoming--its their poor development that makes the book such a bore. Of course, the heroine would be smart, cold, and great looking. Of course the hero would be a maverick, bitter with the world. Of course the villain would be hiding some nefarious secret. The sex scenes seemed so juvenile, I wonder what the author was trying to do. Ending was painfully long and overdrawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE THRILLER WITH LITTLE TO OFFER THATS NEW","review":"Not much new from my point of view. The characters were typecast right from a TV show or worse, a movie. The gratuitous sex seemed so out of place and juvenile in its timing that I think the author threw it in just for kicks and nothing else. The plot villians were cardboard stereotypes with wholly unrealistic motives and convictions that really wouldn't withstand the test of time. The ending was a complete bore. The author needs to seriously contribute something unique rather than just be another Clive Cussler or Michael Critchten wanna-be...."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VERY ENTERTAINING","review":"The book was quite unoriginal and very predictable. Very few twists or surprises to keep the reader's attention. The main characters were like cardboard with very little interest. The plot read like something from Clive Cussler except that it lacked the style and originality. The technical aspects were pure trash and the medical mumble-jumble was thrown in for no good reason. I think the author needs to do some serious research next time before taking a stab at writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREDICTABLE AND WEAK IMMITATION","review":"The book was totally predictable and had very little original ideas. The plot seemed to be based on a TV movie or worse, a TV show. The science/technical aspects were a bit hollow and the characters were poorly developed. You could easily see how the plot was going to end. Chase scene at the end was absolutely so long and terrible, you ended up laughing and hoping for the villians to win. I don't think this book was very entertaining at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"As hollow as an empty cereal box","review":"I picked up Reaper knowing what I was getting into ... a technothriller not a literary classic. Still, even the wildest plot line needs some semblance of logic. Here the two \\"ordinary\\" people who are the main characters possess every ability known to man: brains, athleticism; plus knowledge of medicine, science, computer technology and criminal techniques. I'm surprised they didn't build their own cars from twigs and tape. And I think the chase scene at the end may still be going on. There are some interesting scientific concepts here if you can fight through the papier mache characters to get to them. It was a disappointing book ... probably because it was a really a screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first book that I really wanted my money back on!","review":"What a disappointment this was!

I read the first chapter online and liked it, and bought the book because of it. Then it turns out that the character who thinks he's dying in that chapter really does die, and he was the only likeable character in the entire book.The plot is ridiculous, the technology writing is inane, the business insights are ludicrous, the characters are pretty much all one-dimensional cliches.I would nominate this book for the \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" award. I think there's also an award for bad poetry (is it the McGonneghal?). Anyway, I've always thought there was something fascinating about absolutely wretched writing, and if you don't agree, then there's absolutely no reason for you to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's far better books out there in this genre","review":"Simply put, this book lacks distinctiveness compared to the many other books in the genre that are out there. Absolutely a weak and poorly thought out plot with very very artificial and predictable characters. Too many stereotypes throughout the entire book. I didn't find the evil woman sidekick very convincing at all, and I couldn't believe the author would try to have us accept her motivations behind the entire virus...absolutely ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"where was the editor?","review":"Ulike many here, I did not think the book was bad, tho unremarkable. But I cannot forgive STUPID technical errors that authors in the genre should not make and editors are paid to catch. A 15-round 9mm Baretta is NOT a revolver! How simple can this be? And if it WAS a revolver, it could not be \\"silenced\\". I am NOT a gun expert, but even I know this basic stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"i thought it was great","review":"i loved it, it was kind or sci-fi future stuff but it was good. Some parts were just alright and some were downright out there, if u know what i mean. but in the end i would recommend it to friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"SECOND RATE, AVERAGE","review":"Not much more can be said about this so-called thriller. The characters are totally uninteresting and are so superficial, you'd swear you have already encountered them in countless other movies and TV shows. The lead character, the doctor with a grudge, is so predictable and corny, you'll almost root for the villians to succeed. The female woman is so lightly developed, you know that there's not much to her personality, let alone her psyche. And the plot absolutely fails to excite or thrill the reader on both the technical as well as the high tech level. Forgetable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUVENILE PLOT AND JUVENILE WRITING","review":"This book really lacks the substance of a good thriller. The plot, however unbelieveable, is brought about using such an old, worn, predictable formula that it really doesn't offer much suspense. The characters are brought in like stereotypes and offer little to interest the reader. Villians are surprisingly weak and predictable so that it doesn't offer any suspense when they plot out something nefarious or when they get thwarted by the good guys. The hero and heroine are also from the same mold. A good-looking, bitter and tragic doctor and a young, smart, cold on the outside but hot on the inside type of babe government investigator--hmmm. how unique. Of course the two should fall into bed as soon as they can and the author really doesnt' try to develop anything believeable on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books you will ever have the pleasure of picking up","review":"If you were looking for a text book on how to write just the most awful novel possible, this might be a landmark contribution to the field of literature. I can think of few books that rival this mess for tops on my all time least favorite list. From the insane silly plot to the plastic characters, this novel sways from one disastrous misguided idea to the next.I can see that I am not alone here in tanking a book so heartily. Often I dont enjoy a book and then am startled to see that it is getting mostly four or five star reviews from my fellow critics. So it heartens me a little to see that for once, not only I but just about every other reviewer is joining hands in panning this trash to its fullest. The sad thing is that I have to give this story at least one star. 'Reaper' makes the argument that we should be able to remove that one star, its so bad that it does not even deserve that."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST ONE OF MANY IN THIS GENRE--UNREMARKABLE","review":"After finishing Reaper, I think you'll conclude that this is just one of so many books now in the medical/thriller category. Unlike the good ones, however, this book seems so formulaic that it tires easily and can't give you much thrills or excitement. The plot has some interesting aspects to it, although I found it a bit too far-fetched. The charactes in the book were so predictable and common that they must have been borrowed from other novels or TV shows. Author could have been more creative in that regard. The seemngly endless climax left little satisfaction and I agree with other reviewers who felt that somehow, the author changed his slant in the middle of the book to de-emphasize the virus and suddently go after something else that was more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY UNBELIEVEABLE","review":"The book is unable to generate any fear in the reader that \\"this could actually happen\\" so it fails to excite and thrill on that kind of level. That's not necessarily a big weakness, but when you couple that to the very inconsistent writing style and the absolutely horrible characters, you end up with a pretty ordinary and unremarkable book. The last chase scene at the end seemed like it lasted for days and days--I don't know exactly why, but I can see from other comments from other readers that we all felt that it was way overdrawn and became almost comic in nature. I'm sure that wasn't what the author had in mind. The overall premise could have been real but the author was unable to convince me. I think the idea of combining a \\"medical thriller\\" with a electronic high tech type of story was somewhat interesting, but this author failed to bring it about to a successful conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GENRE","review":"This book is seemingly one of so many medical thrillers. Unfortunately, to me, this book seemed like a rip-off of other books so that the plot, the characters, and the literary tricks were old and boring. I thought that the overall pace of the book was very uneven and that the characters were so matter-of-factly presented, that this seemed less like a novel and more like some sort of high school report. The medical aspects were never properly developed and, after spending a lot of time at the start of the book about it, the ending seemed horribly short and unjustified--did the author simply get tired of writing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF THE BEST","review":"Very ordinary plot and very very predictable actions. The whole premise was very wild and not well thought out. Many faults in logic--never did answer why some of the victims fell victim to the \\"virus\\". Main characters were very shallow and seemed like cardboard characters. Ending was the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREMARKABLE AND ORDINARY","review":"Not a very suspenseful or thrilling novel. The plot has some minor new elements, but is based on the same old formula that has been used countless times before. Typical, stereotypes abound throughout the novel so that there is little to offer that's new. The climax is long and plodding, and what makes it seem more frustrating is that you already can predict how its going to end. You might try this book if there's absolutely nothing else to read, but you won't be very excited or happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all to the good, it's good all the time.","review":"I hadn't even heard of Brent Jones til about 2 years ago.

There's the jazz tune of my favorite track \\"Much Love\\". The slow jam tune of \\"Sindy\\"... A wonderful CD. Although I like his other CD - \\"Beautiful\\" - better, this is a keeper as well.

I borrowed this book from the library and HAD to buy it! She offers common sense advice on becoming a healthy and fit person. This book motivated me to exercise not just for weight loss, but for all of the other benefits that exercising gives you in ALL aspects of life! I have more energy, confidence, and am a much happier person. I'm proud to say I LOOK FORWARD TO EXERCISING every day after work! I will never crash diet again. WE HAVE TO EAT to keep our metabolisms high and to give our bodies the nutrients it needs. Buy this book - you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fitness newbies!","review":"We all know we \\"should\\" exercise, yet have many excuses why we don't, and Kathy Smith provides excellent advice on how to overcome those barriers and achieve good health and balance in our lives. The focus of the book is feeling better, not looking better, and how we can become empowered by living a healthy life. Smith is not a great writer and her message could have been delivered more eloquently or with more power, but her easy-to-follow ideas come through nonetheless. Great for someone trying to get fit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A historical study in itself","review":"While this book may have shifted the historian consensus on how decent, capitalistic, and God loving Stark's ever-shifting definition of Dark Ages was, it seems to be more of a symptom of the far-right's attempt to rehabilitate 800 years of theocratic oppression.While I understand that this attitude is currently out of favor, in 20 years when the consensus shifts back people will point to this book as the ultimate manifestation of this curious aberration in scholarly thought. Anyone who has taken a serious glimpse at commerce in the Classical era is well aware that Stark's \\"faith-based capitalism\\" was not even a shadow of what came before until the late-16th century (right around the time the church began to wane, curiously enough!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Christianity Led To Freedom and Capitalism","review":"I am proud to recommend this fascinating book to my friends. It is scholarly, but never boring. Capitalism started in the Catholic Church--in Europe--and stayed to change the world. It brought us out of the dark ages. This historical account by a well known historian and author, should not be missed by any thoughtful person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch","review":"This book will give almost everyone something to think about. It explodes several myths that have become part the air that we in the early twenty-first century breathe. Most jarring and probably most important to the modern reader is the myth that the \\"dark ages\\" were a time of oppressive poverty in both economic and intellectual terms. Not true. The author gives many examples of technological and business advances that occurred during this period including the rise of capitalism in virtually its modern form. He chronicles the rising living standards of almost the entire population.In addition he endeavors to give a reasonably rigorous definition of capitalism, something that is almost never done even by its most ardent defenders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenge to Think","review":"\\"The Victory of Reason\\" challenged me to think, and I like that in a book. Stark's premise that Christianity led to capitalism and Western success flies in the face of political correctness in the U.S. today. I knew that it led to freedom, but he goes beyond that. His analysis of history and comparisons of Western culture with Chinese, Greek, and Roman cultures are carefully and convincingly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor revisionism","review":"If i could rate this book a zero, i would have. stark embarks on a journey polemic, revisionism, and wishful thinking. This book will appeal to those who lack critical and objective thinking and only seek to re enforce theor mosguided views of Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Victory of Reason","review":"This book does not really do justice to the title. The origins of reason in western thought are not adequately explored, with the contributions of Greek philosophers being almost completely ignored. And, even though Dr. Stark touches on the close relationship between faith and reason, he fails to adequately elucidate the nexus between Christ's calling to us as \\"brothers\\" and the medieval European notion that the world is indeed formed upon principles that our minds are capable of understanding.Also troubling is the author's attempt to credit the unique success of the British to capitalism, rather than to a strong protestant work ethic which persisted in Britain right up to the modern age.In the end, this book offers, not an exposition of the relationship between reason and Christianity, but an attempt to transform capitalism into absolute and salvific truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victory of Reason Review","review":"Victory of Reason is a well researched review of the impact Christianity on freedom and capatilism in the West. Freedom and prosperity both are based on a sound set of principle which this book thoroughly documents. Excellent reading for those who want to increase their knowledge of the fundlemental ingredients of Americas economic strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Victory of Reason","review":"This book is a detailed account of how the Christian religion encouraged the rise of capitalism and a free market world.

It covers everything and has great tips for the exams and has very good sample question which reflect how the questions are in the CCNP tests. Yet another marvel by Todd Lammle. There are virtually very few or no errors and its a comprehensive all in one book. But dont use this as a single source. It is best to use it as the last thing to give you that added boost to pass the CCNP exams. Has some real great material on Routing though the Support section could do with more details. Overall a 5 star book. I myself am going over it for my CCNP exams.Hersh CCNA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough reference...","review":"And not much else. The author tries to pack too much info into a single book. It did work for Lammle for the CCNA study guide. However, CCNP covers a lot more. For a recap of technologies this book is fine. If you are looking for a deeper coverage of routing protocols however, check out \\"Cisco IOS for IP Routing\\" by Andrew Colton (ISBN 0972286209). That book explains the mechanics of modern routing protocols, such as RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP in great detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, but flawed","review":"This book was helpful, but I found a number of flaws and inconsistencies. I have passed 3 of the 4 required to complete the CCNP. I always start with the Cisco Press books first, and then use this book as a review. Of the three tests I've taken, I've passed all on the first try.This book is a good way to test your understanding by spotting the statements that are wrong, partially right, or right but misleading. For example, on page 242 VTP is defined as \\"Virtual Trunk Protocol.\\" Then at the review of terms at the end of the chapter (p269), VTP is defined as \\"VLAN Trunk Protocol.\\" There are other cases where information is correct, but misleading.To sum up, this book is useful; but definitely do not use it as your primary study material. If you don't find yourself reading sections more than once because they seem to conflict with what you've read elsewhere, you probably don't have a thorough understanding of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is San Francisco?

I still do not understand after years and years of putting out fantastic albums that this band is not as popular as Lacuna Coil or Nightwish. Yes, I know they aren't exactly \\"metal\\" anymore, but the quality of the music and songwriting should have catapulted them to super stardom long ago.Anneke's voice sounds amazing as it always has. Her vocals seem to get better and better with each album. Stand out songs include: \\"Walking Hour\\", \\"A Noise Severe\\", \\"Alone\\", \\"Your Troubles Are Over\\", and of course the single \\"Shortest Day\\".Unlike Souveneirs, this a little less experimental and a little more straight forward. They seem to have added more of a guitar sound to this one than the last few. Nonetheless, this is definitely an album to pick up if you want to hear the best female fronted bands in hard rock/heavy metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tied but can't connect with this one","review":"I recently purchased this CD after hearing Anneke van Giersbergen do guest vocals on the John Wetton/Geoff Downes collaboration Rubicon II. I am always on the lookout for new music. Anneke had outstanding vocals on that CD as she does with the Gathering on Home. However, besides the quality of her vocals, I just have not been able to connect with the music on this CD. I like a wide range of styles and genres of music, but the problem here is that the songs are not catchy in any way, and pretty much all sound alike. You can have all the talent in the world, but if the songs themselves and the delivery are marginal, you are not going to sell a lot of records. Maybe I should have started with another release by the Gathering, but this one doesn't move me in any way. I give it two stars for the talent of the vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"The Gathering has been deteriorating in stature and significance ever since the unfortunate release of \\"Planet,\\" probably the worst album in the past decade by anyone.

Unfortunately, he seems to given little thought to the order in which he presents the material or the clarity of his explanations. As a result, sometimes difficult concepts are made to appear even more confusing than they actually are.For example, in discussing universal data access using ADO the author mentions that you can \\"use the Recordset object's Open method to execute the query that will return the desired cursor type.\\" (p. 547) This comment could easily leave many readers muttering \\"Say what\\" under their breath since, up to this point, the author has made no mention of all of the concept of cursor type. This is but one instance (there are many others) of a level of pedagogical sloppiness that is inexcusable in a book meant to guide beginning programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a professional developer","review":"I suppose this book is excellent for a beginner/amateur visual basic developer, but if you have knowledge of the language and want to write powerful database programs, this book doesn't cut it. Most of the examples in the book focus on using the data controls and bounded controls. That works fine for simple database applications, but for real ones you'll need to write most of the database code yourself. This book just relies too heavily on vb's wizards and point and click solutions.It does say it is for beginners, I just personally felt the author skimped too much on the code-it-yourself functionality that visual basic offers. So if you are new to VB and want to get a feel for database application design, this is the book to get. If you're an experienced programmer looking for powerful database applications, I'd suggest you save your money for a more advanced book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don&#65533;t buy this book!","review":"This book must be based on a pre-beta version of VB6, it is full of errors.

A few weeks after reading this book, we started doing Databases in VB in school.

For those wanting to learn VB, I strongly suggest you to buy books written by by John Smiley"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much chaff; very little wheat.","review":"If C/C++ programmers need any more reasons to dislike VB, this book will provide one. It's incredibly wordy and repetitious - I really believe the author was paid by the word. I've read introductory books on other languages with no complaints, but this is different. I don't need to be repeatedly re-assured that setting property values in design mode means I'm a real programmer. Wading through page after page of BS trying to glean bits of truly useful information got so frustrating that I finally gave up and stuck with on-line docs.I really don't understand how this book came to be so raved over. Petzold it's not, that's for sure. I can't help but think that if the author had stuck strictly to disseminating technical information in a concise manner ( a la Petzold, for instance) that the information in these 800+ pages could have been contained in a 20 page pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not super perfect","review":"Did not like the part that the book covers for the most part DATA controls for MS-Access programming.

As far as the reviews complaining it is to this or that perhaps they should have read THE TITLE a little more closely. Beginning.."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word - 'Excellent'","review":"This is by far the best programming book (not just VB, but programming book) I have ever purchased. It is clear, lucid, informative, and just well written. Connell is one of those rare breeds - he is a pro but also knows how to teach what he knows. That is a very rare combo indeed. I highly recommend this book to both beginners and seasoned programmers alike. That's my 2 cents worth, but you are guaranteed to find something worth knowing on each and every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best VBDB Book","review":"I did a search for VB Database books on the web, and ordered three of them. I also read all three. Mr. Connell's is the very best by far - Im sorry I wasted my money on the others. He covers all the right steps, in the right order, while anticipating my every question. It was uncanny how just when I would think of a question - Mr. Connell answered it in the next paragraph. I found the book to be the best, most well thought out technical book I have ever read. And I guess that when I read all of the other reviewers glowing reports - it should have not been suprising. I completely enjoyed reading this book - and that's alot to say for a technical read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to be a classic","review":"I use this book in a grad level computer science class. It has so many dimentions (i.e., DB design, DB programming, User interface design, Custom Control design / tips, HTML, COOKIES, use of the Internet, exchanging data, etc.) and shows how to interweave them and how they work together that the book stands above anything I have ever read before. It ties all of the technolgy together in a very readable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to get to the next level of programming.","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. Mr. Connell is a pro, wrote professional programs that are running at companies such as IBM, GM, and others. This guy knows his stuff. Besides learning more than I ever did from a single book on databases, literally each page has a tip that can be used immediately. If you are a professional programmer, you will know what I mean from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the rest - draw your own conclusions","review":"Funny, but I usually never get caught up in reviews. I guess Amazon makes it so easy that I can't resist. I read the reviews of other database books, and this one is the hands down winner. I ordrerd two others, as well as Mr. Connells. I can see why this one is far and away the most popular. And yesterday I found out that a large University is using Mr. Connell's book as the basis for an undergraduate class. I guess that speaks for itself. But being in the Christmas spirit, I just wanted to pass along my thoughts. I hope they might help someone - there is just way too much VB noise out there on the book shelves. When I find something that is excellent such as Connell's book - its very rare. I hope this will help others eliminate long and expensive searches."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Red Book","review":"I have taken several on-line classes, and the students refer to this as John's Big Red Book.

You always find some little tip or trick, that you haven't heard of which you find useful. In this book there are quite a few.However, some problems are that the book has quite a good chunk of errors in it BUT... the publishers web site does have downloadable code and explanation of the errors.Only beef is that I have yet to see the book make a SOLID bullet proof example. In this book you can see that he doesn't cover all the problems that can occour with an app, (you can tweak it yourself I suppose). But hey, if you are trying to teach someone how to make an interface make it BULLET PROOF so that when u go into industry you can do it right, not half way!Good coverage with the subject, but could have been better and the book is not a total loss with a lot of useful info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"Getting Started\\" Type of Book","review":"This book is very well written, if a little dry at times. Step-by-step instructions for setting up SQL Server were very useful for a non-DBA like myself, and basic ADO coverage was included as well. If you're looking for in-depth, advanced knowledge, you might want to look elsewhere, but this book rocks for those of us wanting to be productive with the basic aspects of VB 6 data access utilizing ADO and SQL Sever. Coverage of stored procedures is basic--also look elsewhere if you want to gain advanced stored procedure skills. Overall, I'd recommend this book to all but seasoned VB/DB programming professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Basic Authors... Learn From Example!","review":"If every programming book I've ever purchased even came close to explaining concepts as well as Connell's, I'd be a very rich man. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. This is also the first book that's been hard to put down. I've purchased 5 or 6 Visual Basic database books, and not one of them has come close to explaining concepts as well as this one has.

The only problem is that working sample code does not come with the book but does come online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just in Time","review":"I have been struggling with building a distributed db app for work and was stuck in quick sand. This book turned the light on in my head. Rather like a flood light. Connell shows the way a professional programmer approaches building a VBDB application. I got tons of ideas and am now - as I write this - adding many of them to my own app. I know my boss will think I'm a hero. Great Job - why has it taken so long for a decent, clear book on VBDB to be written. He also clearly explains DAO and ADO and shows when and how to use each. For me, Connell's book was just in time. I give this book my highest recomendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent comic","review":"Darby conely (may have spelled this wrong) is one of the most promising comic arisits since bill waterson of calvin and hobbes. his work is touching, yet hilarious, incredibly well drawn, and fun to read.

However, Edelman is also very knowledgeable and very accurate. He accurately called the Index Fund fallout as early as 1998. HE WAS WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR THAT. But as someone who listened to him, I am glad he was so perceptive!Likewise, Edelman suggests to carry a mortgage vs having a paid off mortgage and invest the difference. As another astute reviewer commented, this is a lot like the old term vs cash value life insurance debate. Which is better?Cash value is generally the better value for the insurance salesman. Likewise, a paid off mortgage is not doing you any good because it is a liability and provides no income. Better to put that extra mortgage moneyin good investments that can grow 20%-25% per year.Edelman may be controversial but his advice is right on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best Financial Book, But Certainly Worth The Read","review":"I found this to be Edelman's best book. After reading Ordinary People, Extraordinary Wealth I thought I'd never buy another Edelman book. That book was horrible. Somehow I found this book on clearance at a local bookstore for $5 and decided to give it a try. It was a good book but not excellent. It is worth reading and for $12 bucks on here its worth it. I do have to say if you are looking for a excellent book I'd buy Multiple Streams of Income by Robert G. Allen.

They were frequently inaccurate (e.g. he says that Vanguard Index 500 didnt exist 10 years back, whereas its existed since the late 1970s), misleading , and sometimes bordered on the dishonest (he says that while active funds don't typically beat their indices, index funds don't either, neglecting to mention that index funds fall short of the index by a far smaller amount (0.2% for Vanguard). He also makes comments such as -- if Intel were ever to fall out of the index, then huge capital gains would be incurred by the funds (neglecting to mention that the reason most companies fall out of the indices is that their prices are falling -- which means there will be very few, if any capital gains to distribute)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing gets five stars","review":"Critics take heed - Ric's conversational writing style appeals to most novice/intermediate investors like myself.

As someone who has used a bi-weekly mortgage program with favorable results on my finances, I must vigorously disagree with this \\"new rule\\", as stated in its respective section. Personally, I'm glad I follow the old-fashioned common sense of \\"doing the math myself\\" instead of any set of rules whose most salient attribute is purported as \\"new\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad advice from an angry financial planner","review":"This book sounds like the author is angry at index funds for siphoning off some of his commissions. His advice on investing in index funds (not) goes against most financial wisdom. He keeps repeating that these funds don't really beat the S & P 500 as they claim. What he doesn't mention is that most are within a percentage point or less of of matching the S&P. That's why people continue to invest in them. He also claims most funds will beat index funds in a down market. Oh yeah? Maybe he'd like to look at Janus Mercury, Janus 20, Fidelity Megellan etc. etc. etc for the last fiscal year. I could go on and on but you get the picture. Other advice I could get from my father or the man on the street i.e. don't spend too much on a wedding. Really? How insightful.

After the first complete cycle the latch that holds the lid in place started coming loose and has not worked properly ever since. When the tumbler reaches the bottom of a turn, the lid falls off and spills the decaying material all over the ground. Its messy and difficult to clean up. I have tried making a latch replacement myself with modest success. It is clear that the maker of this product has decided not to solve the problem, since reviewers here and on other sites have mentioned it and nothing has been done.

It would have been fine if it were actually on the ground (and therefore, didn't matter if it leaked)."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless composter","review":"I was excited when I bought this composter but quickly became dissatisfied. The tumbler is not big enough to create 'heat' to decompose. The opening is not big enough to get a shovel in to get compost out. It is ver difficult to turn when 1/2 full.

However, the print quality was so poor that even with the enclosed magnifying glass, it was impossible to make out any \\"hidden animals\\". Without the glass, they were virtually invisible - not just hard to see - impossible. With the glass they looked like smears in the ink. At least I think that was one of the animals. My 15 year old son and I put the puzzle together and searched for an hour and couldn't find anything that looked like an animal - just smears of paint in vaguely animal-like shapes scattered here and there.

I picked up this book with high expectations, but I am returning it to the library only half-finished. I am so glad I checked this out of the library instead of buying it. Coupland's character's are weak and unlikable. The crazy situations they get in are dark, unfunny, and so fantastical that they're painful to read. Coupland inserted himself into the novel several times, which I find pretentious. The non-traditional fiction pages are interesting, modern, and have potential, but overall seem like a giant inside joke between Coupland and someone else...anyone else but his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down and hanging around...","review":"This novel is Douglas Coupland's most disappointing book to date. I have been an avid reader of Coupland's work for the past 12 years, and this is my first experience with one of his novels where I actually contemplated putting the book down before I had finished reading it. The novel is an ultimate exercise in self-indulgence. Although I found certain portions of the book to be rather clever and insightful, the author appears to have sacrificed the narrative for the sake of making astute observations. I became thoroughly disappointed in myself for having paid the full $24.95 for the hardcover edition of this novel when Coupland, borrowing a tired technique that has been utilized by far too many fiction writers in the past 20 years, makes an appearance as himself in the narrative. I will undoubtedly read Coupland's next novel, but I believe that I will wait patiently for it to become available in paperback before purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly interesting premise... falls flat after that","review":"I was given this book as a gift, so I forced myself to slog through this book, hoping there would be some light at the end of this brick. From a slightly interesting premise of a quirky group of software developers, this book spirals downward quickly into a bizarrely unintelligible plot, many waste-of-space diversions that seem to just be there to make the book look thicker, laughable attempts at sounding twentysomething (\\"I'm going to download some jifs\\") -- and the key indicator that Coupland has truly jumped the shark -- writing himself into his own story. Poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've enjoyed every other Douglas Coupland novel I've read (Generation X, Shampoo Planet, Microserfs), but I am starting to wonder if Coupland is now slipping. This is a man who used to have his finger on the pulse of American youth, but he now seems to have lost it. This book just seems like a pale imitation of something he wrote ten years ago and pretty far from reflective of today's culture. It drove me crazy that he kept referring to himself throughout the entire novel. As if twenty-somethings today really sit around talking about Douglas Coupland novels. Get real! That above all made me realize that this man really has no clue how people that age act or think. The story was ridiculously boring and the attempts to make the parents wacky were pathetic (Helen Fielding did a better job with the wacky mom character in the Bridget Jones books!). Save your money and read one of Coupland's older books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I've read many of Coupland's books and this is the one I liked best.

I'm a Coupland fan from way back, and this was just so weak. His earlier work is so much better, it's like this book is a shell of his earlier, better books. The protagonist having a pot-dealing mother? Not funny. Coupland showing up in the book as a minor character? Not funny. The bizarre almost-blank pages with meaningless words and phrases, as well as pages and pages of numbers? Not funny. This book? Not worth the time.

I think the relationship between the main narrator, Ethan, and Kaitlin sums it up [SPOILER]: Early in the book Ethan lets on he's interested in Kaitlin (with no real detail). There are a few exchanges; he says \\"I like you\\" and in the next chapter they're boyfriend and girlfriend. A little later they're living together. Just like that. I'm afraid I didn't believe in a single character, so I didn't care what happened to them.There are too many technical errors to have any tech-cred (I spotted three or four high-school-science-level stuffups and I'm no coder, so I have no idea whether the code bits are legit).There are a few bits of clever dialogue, which are really the only redeeming features.And I'd so enjoyed Douglas' blog on the NY Times..."},{"rating":"1","title":"When An Author Inserts Himself Into A Novel","review":"it is usually a recipe for disaster and I must say that the recipe works all too well.

His boss insists on adding a talking turtle to the game, becomes infatuated with Ethan's mom, is sold into slavery in China, becomes addicted to heroin, and returns a better manager for his addiction - or due to his addiction.The main story points are too bizaar and complex to condense into a review. The cast of characters are far more interesting than the main protagonist; but the reader only gets to see them through the protagonist's eyes.This book is like Fight Club without the witty dialogue or fight scenes.

If you like Coupland's other novels, you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and fun","review":"If you like the show Weeds, you will love this book. It possesses the same sort of irreverence and wit. Is it a work of genius? Perhaps not. Then again, perhaps it is. There are at least flickers of Coupland's true brilliance. Blank pages and pages full of nothing but numbers. I believe some of the other reviewers here are missing the point. As for me, I loved it and anxiously await Coupland's next great adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun","review":"Why should I spend my money to carry around thirty or so pages of random numbers and digits of pi (with an error inside, so they're not even good for cryptography) just because Coupland felt he needed to use filler when he had nothing interesting to write?Predictable.

I purchased the audiobook from Audible and am just over halfway through it. What a disappointment. I'm about to give up and move on to something else.1. The book is overloaded with geeky banter and pop culture references, including references to Coupland himself. Very tiring.2. The book is very weak on plot; it just meanders, and not in a good way.3. I don't really like the narrator of the audio version. Not a big deal if you're reading the book unless you're annoyed with the inner voice you use when reading this.I'd probably slog through the rest of it if I thought there would be any kind of payoff, but alas, I don't think there will be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This book was disappointing.

I was very excited at the concept of a microserfs \\"sequel\\" and jumped in with both feet. However, right there on page one, a reference by the characters that they're in a Douglas Coupland novel. That was the biggest sticking point for me, that he had to bother putting himself into the novel, or some alter-ego. I've read them all (I think). and this one just seems quite easily the weakest of them. Bottom of the Coupland stack, glad I got it out of the library. Disjointed story even for Coupland, shallow characters, and too many pages of non-text with no decent context. Microserfs has been read and passed around, this will simply be returned to the library, maybe even late to keep people from having to suffer it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than microserfs 2.0","review":"absolutely loved it. my ex favorite was generation x but this beats it hands down. packed with dry humor and it's one of those that i can't quit quoting. i began to get disenchanted with coupland after all families are psychotic but no more. this has more than renewed my faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book blows.","review":"I have not read any other of Douglas Coupland's books. I would say that the best part of this book would be the cover art. All the characters are unlikable and it is as if Douglas Coupland tried to make the characters as cynical as possible to show how edgy he is. I could just see him as he was writing himself into his book, taking a break from it, reclining back in his chair, his hands together saying, \\"Heh.....these characters don't care about anything. A perfect portrayal of the Vancouver area's hip apathy. God, I'm a genius.\\" Then he hugged himself.The pages with random text were very refreshing, but the rest is boring crap that just leads you in a big nerdy circle.

X-Cops is one of my favorite eps of all time, though we never even get to see an actual monster (I'd love to see the hornet man, ha ha), and Je Souhaite is just hilarious, especially when she pops a ranting and swearing Mulder into Skinner's office during a meeting. Genius, though the end is obviously predictable.The resolution (if one can call it that) of Mulder's raison d'tre is horrible, and no real end at all for such a strong storyline. To never meet his sister after all of this time was a ripoff, IMO, just one of many perped by Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a GREAT Gift!!!","review":"This season does not disappoint!

However, as the episodes progressed it became clearly that xfiles had reached to its end and from that point on there was something missing.

But the quality and the sound reproduction accuracy of its center speaker is very poor. The center channel in 5.1 AVR typically carries the dialog and the main sound track of movies. The center speaker of this system does a poor job of reproducing the center soundtrack and music signals. I switched the center speaker with a Bose VCS-10 and noticed a major improvement. The latter speaker is not considered the best of the breed either. But it still does a better job than the center speaker of RM6000. A better choice is probably RM6700."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"This case is useless.

There are others that have bought the higher priced Hennessy's and one jungle hammock and the Byer is much thinner but you pay a lot less also.

The best thing is, you sympathize with ALL gaiman's characters(even the mischevious ones). And more references to mythology and even art are thrown in, as expected (watch Susano-o-makoto's expressions and poses).Excellent volume, Mr. Gaiman!

The entire sandman series is just that, and not just some needless need for the publisher and the author to make more money with the next chapter.That said, i think on its own A Season of Mists has bears little meaning and consequence, beautiful as it is.

First of all, this is a book completely biased toward working mothers. Ms Lerner refers to a stay at home in her book as a martyr. She uses this book as a platform for her feminist agenda as SHE sees feminism. The whole book feels like she's trying to work out her guilt over how she mothered. She feels the need to say over and over that we're not responsible for how our children turn out. What on earth does that have to do with the present state of mothering? That is flawed logic. Of course we have a huge stake in how our children turn out. Check it out from the library before you buy it. You'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful and sensitive view of a great journey","review":"At another time in my life I read and greatly appreciated Lerner's other \\"Dance\\" books. I have come upon her latest book some years later, when my own two daughters are both in their teens. Lerner's examples from her own life and those of some of her clients illuminate many of the challenges, joys and heartaches of parenthood in a very authentic manner. I think that mothers will identify with many of the feelings discussed, even if they have never given them voice before. I recommend it highly to all guilt driven mothers, whether their offspring are only just conceived, or have already grown and flown the nest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, very frank & easy to relate to","review":"A serious, yet entertaining, look at becoming & being a mother that is actually easy to read & very easy to identify with.

I'd recommend it for wanna-be mothers through grandmothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one long justification","review":"Typically, I enjoy non-fiction, anecdotal books about a subject I can relate to--like mothering--but this book feels like one long justification of the mothering style and feelings of the author. She obviously feels guilty about the way she parented her children, and is using this book as the vehicle to help herself feel right about her own choices. There is NO consideration given for mothers who actually do choose to stay at home, would rather raise their children themselves than have someone else do it, and who actually enjoy the time they spend with their children as stay-at-home moms. She acts like these mothers are lying to themselves about their true aspirations. She claims that couples that feature a stay-at-home mom and a primary breadwinner husband are \\"backsliding\\" into traditional roles. If you're a working mom who feels guilty about the choices you've made, this book is for you. Otherwise, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and practical advice!","review":"As a new mother I have read everything I can get my hands on! This book though is for ME, not advice on how to quiet a crying baby or what to feed a picky 12 month old. It is about the feelings, thoughts and worries that a mother obsesses over each day. I cried, laughed and learned through the entire book and then receommended it to two friends. If you are looking for a book to read that talks about how becoming a mom has truly made you a completely different person this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I bought this book because I thought it was about how life is different before and after you have children.

Stith --- author of such great books as REDSHIFT RENDEZVOUS, and this one, MANHATTAN TRANSFER --- isn't often mention in the same breath as Brin, Bear, Benford, Card, and other major SF writers. He's every bit their equal, as this story demonstrates. It's a sort of melding of KIDNAPPED and James Blish's CITIES IN FLIGHT (in that the whole city of Manhattan in kidnapped by aliens, and torn right off the planet into space). Actually, if it reminds me of any other book, it's probably Arthur C Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. That won a Hugo --- why didn't this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Piognant scenes","review":"Has the spirit of the Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon tales.

That building is one of those in the World Trade Center. And later, when our intrepid humans tunnel out to another alien city, they get their bearings by looking for the tallest towers of Manhattan.If this book is even made into a movie, certain scenes will have to be altered from the book's."},{"rating":"2","title":"In My Top 10","review":"This original and facinating story ranks in my top ten favorite sci-fi novels.

His sweet, powerful voice with it's honky-tonk, bluesy overtones, and his excellent Chicago swing-blues guitar style come through on every song, whether it's a real swing-blues style (Thirteen Step Boogie) or something a little folksier.

So, my normal 4:3 photos have to be 480x480, my portrait 3:4 photos have to be 270x480, etc. And after all of this squeezing and resizing, the photos look perfect when displayed in the frame.

The frame would not accept my cameras ScanDisk Smart Media card either. Photos are also distorted in 16:9 ratio and too small in the 4:3 ratio, with side bars taking up most of the frame.The frame is capable of acting as an alarm clock.

Very frustrating. Once the pictures were loaded I noticed that the quality leaves much to be desired. The frame only holds about 10 pictures and a memory card is needed after that. NOTE: You will need to load the memory card with pictures before using it in the frame. You cannot load pictures to it directly, once it's in the frame. Again, frustrating since the memory card the frame needs is different from my camera and it will not fit my laptop. I now have to find a way to get the pictures on the card. Again, frustrating. Frame $70.00 plus dollars. Memory card $19.99. Memory card reader $45.00. My sanity....priceless...and gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Directions","review":"I've got two gripes with this product.

Unfortunately it just gives you maybe a half page each on probably about 200 topics and never felt like enough to really do much of anything well and a lot of items that may be spiritual/feng shui oriented, but not what you would think would be in this book (like laughter, springtime and journal).

However, this plot is so jumbled and there are so many inconsistencies, it leaves the viewer more befuddled than frightened. It's very difficult at times to tell who is getting killed, why they're getting killed and just who is killing who. The plot slithers around a young girl who was obviously murdered and is seeking revenge on those involved, but the cast is so boring and obnoxious, one can only cheer when they are bumped off. An unceremonious and predictable ending only manages to bury the hatchet deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best one out there!","review":"I have owned the NEO Jukebox for over a year now and can now say that I have somewhat mastered the rig!

The grandfather of the girl is one of the candidates, Afro-american Lincoln Howe and his opponent is the female attorny general, Allison Leahy, who was a victin of a child abduction herself 8 years prior to the event. I can't say the book is perfect. Some of the charcters are great: Tanya Howe (Lincoln's daghter), Kristen Howe (the abducted girl) and the kidnapper who tries to help her, Allison Leahy and Howe himself. I did disapprove of some of the twists which I thought were tasteless and useless, and the ending was pretty quick and left some loose knots. it seems like the author lasted for 2/3 of the book, and than gave in to the temptation of a Holliwood-stile ending.

For example, after the ending of Korean war for over 50 years, anyone who is adequately read on that piece of history knows that the commander of the Chinese force is actually Marshal Peng DeHuai, not Marshal Lin Piao, as it was presented in Harvey's book.For a better narrative on the relationship and interation between Gen. McArthur and Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, read the books: 1) Hirohito, and the making of modern Japan. written by Harvard scholar Herbert P.

I just ran the program as it came on the tower and was very happy.

What ruins the whole experience for me is the constant focus on racism and black people being the true root of all things egyptian. The author is obviously involved in the revival of the black communities, somthing that is admirable and even long due. However, for readers who are not american, and have little understanding of whatever racist elements may persist over there to this day - it becomes annoying to read.Also, i might add - most of the mummies that have been found are neither black or white, but have more in common with indians as far as i know.

After reading quality poetry for years I was unfortunate enough to encouter this book. This book is filled with short cliches, familiar lines, indecent subjects, and a shallow approach to all of them. This surely is not what poetry is about. Jewel should do us all a favor and keep her horrible attempts at real poetry away from the shelves. And you as a reader, don't fall into the superstar trap of buying a bad product because you like the songwriter. This book provides no depth into anything, and furthermore it provides no poetry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry- this is not.","review":"Since I liked her misc, I tried really hard to like this book. The truth is that she kept me from doing so. She deals with inappropriate subjects, she can't write in prose, her poetry is force. The list of why this book is trash goes on and on. There is no true honesty in her work. She makes herself out to be a goodess among men because of her breasts. I found it ofensive that people would dare call these crude pieces of random words deep poetry. Trust me when I say that the deeper meanings if her poems are even more shallow than she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you call this poetry?","review":"I was naive in thinking that Jewel's book of poetry could shed some light on contemporary issues that this generation is dealing with. Instead of poetry, what I found were constant references to how great her breasts are. She proved herself to be shallow and too honest in a sexual way. Overall, the combination is deadly. Do yourself a favor and read some real poetry insead. Save your money. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I can't believe people actually buy this book.

Let's call it rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish games or poems in this case","review":"I think that this generation has sunk to an all new low- they need Jewel's \\"inspiration\\" to read real poetry. I'm sorry to let you all in on something, but she does not wirte poetry. I'm also sorry for all of you who are first being exposed to poetry in this manner. You will find that real poetry is much deeper, clearer, profound, and structured that Jewel's fragments. For the reviewer who asked for poets, try some of the standards. If you don't like Shakespeare who is wonderful, try some contemporary stuff like Robert Pinksy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a joke right?","review":"Someone tell me that she wrote this book as a joke, please!!! I study poetry for a living and I'm embarassed to have this kind of nonsense labled as \\"poetry.\\" Not only does it not have poetic merit but the meanings of the poems are absolutly absurd. She explores things about as deep as her shallow brain will let her, which I discovered wan't far (about as far as her breasts).

My friend let me borrow it, I expected some pretty good quality poems, because I liked Jewel's songs, however I did not get that at all. These poems were so bad! I write poems that have won contests all over the world and I never got mine published but this girl gets hers published because of who she is, this is a sad world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine book","review":"I like Jewel's book because she adequately portrays her feelings and emotions in her poems. The reader does not have to wade through metaphors and over-done symbolism to grasp the emotions that inspire her work. Jewel borrows the styles of many other writers and combines them to make her own style. Anyone who can open her soul to a world of critics deserves credit--not merely because of her openness, but because of her talent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"HS poetry for HS readers...","review":"Well, most people who praizes her poetry, as far as I know, are younger readers who grew up with lyrics of pop music rather than McCullers, Dickson, or Hurston. Her poetry does have the caughy rhythm and style of popular music, but it is still quiet amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Yeats","review":"Jewel is like a ghost in a dream. Her works speak to the ephemeral hart of the soul. Some crued spirits seem willing to suggest that her works are not tip top literature but, so what! All that matters of poetry is that it touches the heart and speaks to the soul, and that is what Jewel does in spades. Still, she is not as good as Yeats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel is the best at explaining unexplainable things in life","review":"Jewel is an outstanding poet and singer. I have her book and cds. I love the way that she helps us understand things in our times of trouble, saddnes and stress. I have undergone many hard things in life and what keeps me going is poetry. The poetry that I write and the poetry that talented people like Jewel write. Jewel has a way of expressing emotion and mood. Her words come out gracefully, like a river flowing in the sunset. I assure you that this book is not garbage, but this book is a tool, an entertainment and a diary. P.S. is the shortest and most non-graceful of the poems, yet if you have read it, you know what I am talking about: it is shocking. I seriously encourage you to buy this book. Not a cent shall go to waste. You get the benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Singer is now promising poet","review":"At a young age, Jewel has achieved quite a bit, but her poetry is still developing. This collection of poetry does show her clear insight into humanity but it also shows her youth. Many of the poems are little more than tidbits of observations. Many times, her imagery is cluttered and loses its power. She evokes nature very well, but it doesn't sound like Neruda, whom she clearly has read, but Whitman. With more crafting and improving of her art form, Jewel can become a really good poet. Poems like \\"God Exists Quietly,\\" \\"I'm Writing to Tell You,\\" and \\"I guess What I Wanted Was\\" are good poems and point to where she can go as a poet. In \\"P.S.\\" Jewel writes, \\"I wrote you those nice/ poems only because/ the honest ones/ would frighten you.\\" She should write those honest ones. That's what the greats do. Keep at it, Jewel. You have a lot of potential. You may write those great poems yet, but this collection isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel is a great Singer, Writer, and Overall person","review":"Get this book!!! Jewel has a way of writing poems that is sweet yet strong....she knows exactly the right words to put you in whatever mood you want to be in...my favorite poetry book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Repost","review":"This is what happens when you raise a generation on the idea that one can write poetry totally devoid of any meter, rhythym, attention to word choice, and, for that matter, talent. But to publish it? Uniqueness, contrary to what one of the other readers claimed, does not always make you good. I may be a complete and total failure, horrible at what I do, and still be unique. Jewel is thoughtless, amoral (who else would publish such a thing?), heartless, merciless, and completely talentless, at least when it comes to poetry. Yet so many people have read and bought her book, even though it reminds me of shredding scores of papers in a shredder, scattering them, then rearranging them in an order that hardly makes sense, nor wants to. So I guess she is unique, and yet none of us want to be like her.To the person who wanted to meet Jewel: Buy a ticket. You'll find her concerts are very rarely if ever sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only read one of the poems... and that was enough.","review":"The only way these poems can be done justice is if they are read my \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin on late night television. She looks good, tho. I looked in the back to see where these poems were published first and - surprise!- they hadn't been published anywhere. I won't try to sing and look pretty, Jewel, if you promise not to waste shelf space with more \\"poetry\\" volumes, 'kay? !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs or Poetry? Which one should she choose?","review":"Most definitely songs. Indeed I enjoyed her book. But, I think that singing is her main game and she should stick to that and that alone. To most people, this book was enjoyed by them. Whether it was because they enjoyed her writing or it was because they were laughing the entire time while they were reading it. Either way, they somehow enjoyed it. So don't be harsh, give her some credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"surface experience is cruel to offer readers","review":"Jewel is only offering the surface of her life. She has to hide because she is young and a celebrity. I read other reviews that said she shared her soul...well let me say from 25 years of reading poetry (I am 29) this is not it. I wish she would have saved a mere few of the poems for ten more years and worked on her craft so she could tell the TRUTH and not offer readers a poor example of art. She should be embarrassed and ashamed of herself for taking poetry to a new low. I hope it is many years before the publishing world makes such a horrid mistake as this. I now need to read some wonderful poetry to purge my system. Avoid this book if you have any desire to learn or support the art of poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"A person's poetry is something very personal, so I really don't want to bash this too hard. It reads like ok high school poetry that sometimes dips down to sappy, pretentious high school poetry. It's hard to compare this to another famous poet as it's not really on that level. If you're a Jewel fan and you're not into serious poetry, go for it. Otherwise I'd check out some \\"real\\" poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Junk","review":"This stuff is horrible.

Get something by Robert Pinsky if you want to read REAL contemporary poetry at its best. Jewel is a somewhat overwrought and sentimental singer/songwriter and she is doubly so as a poet. It just goes to show you, if a woman is attractive, she can do anything she wants and do it so badly that the stink could clear an arena and PEOPLE BUY IT. Don't buy this. Read it in the bookstore. It won't take but a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please","review":"Jewel, what were you thinking? Let me guess....your agent mentions a book deal and your eyes turned into dollar signs. Understandable, given your age and inexperience, but surely someone must have tried to talk you out of it? These \\"poems\\" are nothing but poorly wrought, moony, childish nonsense. \\"Sausages slipped from her pockets/I hope she misses them sorely\\"? Spare me! Even more offensive than your clumsy verse is the cleverly deceptive packaging, making this seem like a substantial literary work. In reality, everything is double or triple spaced, with far too many 2 or 4 line poems. Note to Jewel: Read Dickinson or Poe for lessons in sparse beauty. A Night Without Armor (ooh, clever!) reads like random scraps from a songwriter's notebook--words or phrases that, given time and effort, could have gone on to be good songs. I felt nothing but pain and embarrassment reading this sophomoric schlock. Do yourself a favor, Jewel, and keep it to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on REAL poetry","review":"Yes, I regretfully went through my \\"jewel-phase\\" about a year ago as most of you reading this probably did. However, I realized when reading this, how totally premature and inane her poetry really is. It would take her a while to seriously develop her \\"writing skills\\" and the only reason that she recieved so much response to this drivel is the blatant fact that it was written post-pop career. She uses a simple writing style but it soon becomes obvious that it is no more than her inadequacy to go further than that. For example, her poem \\"Too Many Nights\\"--- It's been too many nights of being with to now be suddenly withoutIt may sound OK, maybe for a scattered thought or something to elaborate on, but I wonder if JEWEL even knows what she's saying here.If you're looking for REAL POETRY try somewhere other than here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A question","review":"Is it bad poetry?

I hope my review cannot be described as either. Jewel generally writes mediocre poetry. I write poetry myself and I wouldn't pretend that it is the most talented work out there. She can't seem to write any better than I do...which is just not good enough for a published \\"poet\\". I agree with the reviewer who asked of those who described A Night without Armor as \\"the best book of poetry ever\\" - What they were comparing it to! No one can be so naive as to believe that her publisher didn't think her musical success wouldn't also translate to literary success. If literary is the word.

Don't waste your money on this book. Sure, it's poetry. You can call anything poetry. But it's bad poetry. The only reason this was published is because Jewel has a recognizable name and the publishers knew it would make money. Don't reward such blatant bastardizing of the word poetry by supporting their methods and buying this book. For every book out there like this, there's one less book by a good poet. We're already such a celebrity-ruled culture in every other respect, I hate to see the publishing industry go in that direction as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job","review":"Maybe one metaphor in this book is fresh, the rest is cliched.

Don't disguise your elitism by presuming to speak for the \\"masses.\\" A few poems are ok, but this is nothing great. Poetry takes a lot of revision (despite any false romantic notions of the inspired first thought, best thought artist).

Not only does she have a beautiful voice that is absolutely mesmerizing, she seems to be a great person inside, which she reveals in her poems. I find it ironic that people can read someone's poems, someone's feelings, and someone's life, and comment on it like it as if it were a new detergent they used on their clothes. Jewel obviosly knew she was exposing herself to everyone for their comments, by naming the title of her book \\"A Night Without Armor\\", but, to be as harsh as saying \\"it sucked\\" or \\"it was boring\\" is ludicris. I guess I just don't understand how someone can critize something so personal. The worst thing is to express yourself to someone, wanting them to understand your feeling so bad, and have them look at you with a blank stare, not knowing why you almost cried writing it; not knowing the many stories behind it.

I myself am a poet and what she had written were mere thoughts of a moment she cast on paper. Some should not even be considered poems, but fragments of broken and diminished sentences, not caught in full. Anyone with an idea can write like that. I found only a couple of her little over a hundred poems to actually have a poetic touch to it. Believe me I know that not all poems are meant to be understood by all, but only the poets themselves. But quite a few of these should never have been published to be used as gap fillers. Again I commend Jewel for her talent in music, but she should leave poetry to rest until she develops a true raw talent for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close","review":"She's Beautiful, she's talented but she's definitely NOT a poet.

I enjoyed a few of her poems, but some were just kind of not for me. I really like \\"Blanketed By A Citrus Smile\\", and refer back to that poem religiously! I think that poetry speaks from the heart and Jewel is a good writer, but sometimes I feel that she got that lucky to have her poetry published because she had music out first. I wiwsh I was that lucky to even have my poetry on the market! See what I mean? Life is hard, but poetry shoudln't be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Underwhelming Achievement","review":"What can one expect from an artist whose lyrics include insipid couplets like \\"Got my eggs, and my pancakes too/Got my maple syrup, everything but you\\"...This girls got talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS!","review":"I can't believe they don't let you put zero stars on this thing. I thought this book was the most horrible and repulsive book I've ever read! I don't mind her music, it's okay, but this book, ugh, I can't even find words horrible enough to describe it. I got the book for a gift. I thought okay I'll read a poem and if I don't like it, I'll take it back. I read one poem and threw the book in the garbage. It was to bad to go back in the store. If some people like it I don't mind but I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a failed attempt at being \\"deep\\"","review":"As if her music isn't whiny enough she needs to put into nauseatingly immature,trite verse.That lacks in any quality whatsoever.She just throws wordsm together to put a confused foolish messagre.I only wish that for every person that bought this useless book would buy a book by a real poet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Keeper","review":"Jewel never fails to blow me away. I have both of her CDs and her poetry anthology and am mysified by her talent. Whenever I am feeling down her words and lyrics console me. She is just incredible. I recomend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel's work seems shallow, childish","review":"Jewel's poetry is too like her song lyrics--somewhat childish and lacking in literary excellence. Certainly her work would never have been published without her celebrity standing; it is a well-intentioned attempt at deepness and intellectualism that falls short of either. On the other hand, poetry is as much about the reader as it is about the writer, and if Jewel's audience finds her work insightful and full of hope, then perhaps it has not gone entirely to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Deeper","review":"I write poetry, and it is difficult. Some of you people really vex me. Poetry in not just words. It takes patience, ditermination, hard work, love of poetry, and most of all talent. And lots of it! Please, read this book. But remember, look deeper in your heart and find the true meaning of all those words. Jewel is very talented. Reading A Night Without Armor, is really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa's Thoughts","review":"I thought the book was great. I read it every night before I go to bed. I can really relate to alot of the things Jewel writes about."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no poetry here!","review":"I was outraged after reading Jewe's book. I was looking forward to this book, after enjoying her first album. I was so disappointed that she turned out to be so shallow! Her work isn't even poetry. I feel like I got ripped off. I read a lot of poetry and I'm telling you, this isn't anything like real poetry. Please don't support this kind of garbage. This book is just another example of how superstars try to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, philsophical poetry.","review":"I have read this book, and it is, by far, the best poetry collection I have ever read. I recommend you read this book, and keep it by your heart to remember you aren't the only person is suffering from problems. Everyone is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like monotone poetry!","review":"While some of the poems are read in a monotone voice, in general, this suits the mood of the poems. Though this depends on your interpretation of the poems, of course. The booklet is great regardless. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her work is no Jewel","review":"This is the furthest thing from poetry that I have ever seen. If this book has anything is that it shows Jewel for what she is- a bold bimbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring to those who appreciate poetry as it should be","review":"When I first heard her music, I was impressed. Never had I heard a beautiful voice combined with such touching and meaningful lyrics. Her book impressed me! I know some people that are out there dislike Jewel, they say she's only a pretty face and that her poetry is that of a high-schooler. I know I am a teenage girl, but I did not become a fan of Jewel because of her \\"pretty face\\". I love poetry and appreciate Poe, Dickinson, Frost, and Shakespeare. Jewel is right up there with them. These five poets have opened their souls, wrote of the world as they saw it, and are honest. They inspire me. Read this. If you appreciate and refer to poetry as a pathway to the soul, you will cherish this book. Thank you, Edgar. Thank you, Emily. Thank you, Robert. Thank you, William. And thank you, Jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blake? hardly!","review":"Jewel has imagery in her poems alright- her breasts. I was shocked that the majority of her poems deal with her breasts, her sexuality, and drugs. It's sad to see that eager readers are turning to this trash instead of reading some real poetry. Yes, real. her \\"poetry\\" is no more than a bunch of cliches. I am sorry that I bought this book. Do yourself a favor and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a zero star rating was ever deserved....","review":"I have a bachelor's degree in Poetics, so don't *even* think to tell me my opinion is uneducated or ignorant. I am here to tell you that I have been educated to appreciate poetry. There is, in fact, value to simplicity in poetry. However, in this case, the simplicity is actually simple mindedness. Jewel's \\"poems\\" do not have any deeper agenda. They are simply the drivel of a teenager which no self respecting literary journal would ever publish. Shame on Jewel's publisher for capitalizing on her fame and publishing a book of poetry they should be ashamed to have on the shelf. It is utter mediocrity. If you want GOOD poetry, try pre-ordering Vice by Ai. She writes from the perspective of murderers, rapists and other mean nasty people. It's some good stuff. Send me e-mail if you want more recommendations for poetry you might like..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful Songwriter=Crappy Poet","review":"I remember hearing Jewel say that the only difference between her songs and her poems is that her songs have music to the words. That about sums up how completely out of it she is as a poet. Her poems are clunky, meaningless, and plain old stupid. People seem to think that the simplicity of her song lyrics and poetry means that there is a deeper meaning. Here's a revelation: there is no meaning, because she is a bimbo. I'm giving this book of poetry (I'm using that term quite loosely)one star for two reasons: (1) amazon.com doesn't allow you to give zero stars and (2) I like watermelons (wink wink)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come there's no lower rating?","review":"I'm glad that Jewel is the first to admit that her terrible book of \\"poetry\\" wouldn't have been published had it not been for her singing success. I've read a lot of poetry, and this is by FAR one of the most pathetic attempts I've ever read. She tries, a little too hard, to write like water, fluid and moving, but instead writes fragments of thoughts that can barely stand alone. I pity anyone who actually bought this book. I read it in a bookstore just to see what kind of poet Jewel was, and I can say that my expectations hit the target. The poem about your breasts is absurd--just like your new song \\"Hands.\\" When it comes to poets like Deborah Garrison and Rita Dove, or singers like Sarah McLachlan and Lauryn Hill, Jewel is as far in talent as is Alaska to Florida."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is poetry?","review":"Unfortunateley this is what passes as poetry today! As an English Literature major I was looking forward to reading a book of contemporary poetry that would inspire me. Instead what I found are verses that could hardly be called poems. The rhymes are childish and the phrasing forced. The ideas presented are worn and repeated. Jewel does not even offer a new interpretation on the issues she adresses. At best this is a rough collection of ideas for poems (as presented by someone who does not know what poetry is). Save your money and buy a real book of poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Girl Without Talent","review":"How low can you go? According to Jewel, pretty low. This stuff sounds less like poetry and more like someone babbling to themeslf about their own greatness!!!! This actually offends me. I read tons of poetry and I can guarentee that Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost are ROLLING in their graves over this. Jewel already thinks she's the greatest singer known to mankind - now she's a poet too????? She is talentless. All she has is an angle. And I'm 13, so cut all this crud about only old people hating her!!! (And if I hear \\"Hands\\" one more time I will commit justifiuable homicide!!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not an inspirational book, lacks beauty of form","review":"I purchased this book(s)for my daughter and niece for Christmas, naively believing it would be comparable to her music. My mistake, another one learned in this life. This book is composed of certain material that I knowingly cannot condone or submit to them to read, or better yet classify as \\"good poetry\\". Literature it is not !!! This book sets a terrible example for our youth and by excepting it we help to contribute to the immorality of our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't take much to get called poetry these days, huh?","review":"What's with all these 2-5 line poems taking up a whole page on a book? I used to try that trick in school, you know... write bigger and hopefully the teacher will give you credit for having written a 12 page essay which really should have taken up 6 pages.This book is an insult to those who have studied real poetry, and appreciate real poetry. I am glad this was a borrowed book. All it takes is a record deal and a few whiny angsty lines on a page and bada-bing... \\"poetry\\".I have nothing against modern poetry in general, and the creativity and the lack of rigidity in poems these days, but how low do you have to sink? There are still fresh ideas left in the world, and poetry to be written about it.If you absolutely must see these poems, use your library card, not your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel has unwittingly written poetry's answer to Spinal Tap.","review":"This is pretentious garbage that is an insult to legitimate poets who struggle for publication but lack the celebrity privilege thrust upon the likes of Jewel. It is the height of arrogance that Jewel actually takes this mess seriously. Such amateurish drivel can only be read as a parody of stuffy poetry, literature's answer to \\"Spinal Tap.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel thinks we are shallow?","review":"I was offended by a comment that Jewel made in a recen interview. She said that people who didn't like her poetry were shallow. Well, I thought that manybe I could overlook her horrible poems before and still try to listen to her new album. The truth is that every writer knows to take criticism lightly and to stand by one's work. Jewel's comment was not only unprofessional, but it makes her out to be even more aloof. As for this book, it truly is dreadful, take it from someone who studies this for a living."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"I can proudly say, I'm not a Jewel fan. And after spending an afternoon, reading this whole book--nothing has changed. I've heard more pleasant poetry emitted from various orifices in public restrooms. I can't believe I wasted $... on this dung heap of paper and ink...There may be no pretension in this work but there is no substance either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like paying for scraps of paper","review":"Much of the poetry in Jewel's book is beautiful and moving. She clearly has a way of turning word into image and emotion. However, I could not help but get the feeling that Armor was put together from discarded ideas for song lyrics and unfinished thought, as a way to wring a few extra bucks out. This was only reinforced when I heard some of the same lines in the songs on her second studio album. Save your money - even if you like it, you won't find yourself missing it after."},{"rating":"1","title":"How?","review":"After reading this one question lingures in my mind: How ever did Jewel manage to get this published? Jewel seems nice and has great music, but her poetry can not live up to that, I write better: \\"What werer you thinking? Seems like you were drinking, After writing this book, You sure had good luck, Could the publisher read? Because your poetry we do not need!\\" So im not a world famous poet, but if you think that was bad, then you realy dont want to read this, if you want to get inside Jewels mind then you want this, but if your looking for poetry, look else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Kilcher: My Heroine","review":"Since the first time I saw her on a late night talk show roughly three years ago, I was taken with the autour of this book. She is, of course, the goddess-on-earth, and singer extrodinar, Jewel. Upon opening the book, I cried. something about one on the first few works in this book gave me such a picture as to weep. I'm not completely sure why. It wasn't sadness. It just had to be done. I continued on through the thing, a few every night. Jewel's thoughts on life have thus far had me laugh and cry. Some of her stuff is life lessons in poetic form. They are thought provoking, in the least, and glorious in the most. She had many analogies that would neveer even occure to me. Comparing love to speeding traffic, for instance. Or meeting Spivy Leaks: a drip of a man. If you are a thinker, an artist, a lover, or filled with passion and emotion, this book is good company.P.S. I Love You, Jewel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography of Jewel","review":"The book was very interesting. The book almost seemed to tell her life story in little segments. The poetry was very interesting and I could relate to some of it myself. I enjoyed that none of the poems were fiction, yet they were all based on her real life experiences. I feel as though I know Jewel I can relate to some of her problems. I almost feel like she is one of my good friends, because we are so alike. The book was very interesting to me I enjoyed reading every poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book from a women of the world","review":"i am only 14 and a very huge fan of hers and all of her poems she has expressed the way i feel some times about love and hate and all that is in between. i recomend this book to anyone who enjoys poetry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetaster Laureate","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the last writer (\\"A Reader\\" from \\"A Place\\"). What must it be like to be a real poet watching this celebrity-penned koob climb the charts?

Talk about completely gut wrenching music, this is it...especially towards the end of their career, with the 12\\", we see such a tremendous evolution. What is consistant is vocals which are so passionately screamed it is breathtaking and a general sensation of sheer speed. Some of the production makes the guitars a little buried and the vocals sound distant, but it doesnt hurt it too much. Heroin is one of the best bands ive heard and holds a very special place in my mind and collection...infinitely recommended to anyone who enjoys original emo (i certainly hope you know what i mean by emo, if not, than it will probably do you more good to buy this than a previous fan of the genre) and has an interest in the amazing 90's san diego scene (angel hair, antioch arrow, clikatat ikatowi, drive like jehu...all of which equally recommended).

Some of the music tracks were VERY poor, worse than on other CDs I've purchased.

The music was authentic and did have some good recognizable tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Is What It Is","review":"I'm really not that happy with this music. Don't know what I was thinking when I bought it, and I'm very glad I didn't buy more than one CD from the set ... there is a CD of Luftwaffe marches, a CD of Panzer marches, Kriegsmarine marches, Landser Marches II, etc.Obviously the Nazis just loved, loved, loved to sing and march and kill.As one might expect, the recordings, singers and musicains are all rather low quality. Mono recordings of the great orchestras and conductors from the 1940s and 1950s are also rather poor.I'm much happier with a Deutsche Grammophon recording of Marches.

The author has made thorough studies regarding it. The book will make a comprehensive reference for researchers and scholars interested in the field of language shift. There is no such book that gives a full description about the language shift from Javanese to Indonesian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shifting language? Errington is simply shifty.","review":"Errington strikes again. In this book Errington repeats his sophomoric fallacies of ignoring all established theories on the subject.

A clear connection between Aikido and Daitoryu Jujutsu is made, especially with the visual aid of the many photographs of the techniques. Their similarities are evident. However, not much is given to readers on the actual working relationship of Daitoryu and Aikido, and what exactly makes them different. I feel that this book was created for the Aikido practitioner who perhaps is looking for answers that he may be asking about where his or her PHYSICAL techniques originated from. Philosophy is barely touched upon. The author's treacher was a second generation disciple of the headmaster of Daitoryu, (who taught the founder of Aikido). I wonder how much of the book's content is synthesis and how much is authentic. All in all, it is a fascinating book, and does provide insight into the workings of both Daitoryu Jujutsu and Aikido technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent work for Aikiju-jutsu beginners","review":"I am an instructor of Goshin Ryu Aikijiu-jutsu and I really enjoyed this book.

He wasn't even on the main stage on that small venue, but he played some good music.I bought his 'Rover Songs' CD that day. Appropriately titled, it's one of my favorite CDs to play for road trips. The lyrics are intelligent, but are about everyday people.That's also what you'll find on this album. Intelligent music about everyday people.

I connected the RCA jacks to the back and all is good.

A word of advice, however: once you plug it in and turn on your stereo, DO NOT TOUCH THE CABLE. For some reason, the cable doesn't fit into my computer's speaker output very well (Macbook pro). And since the output is on the left side, in front of the USB ports and the charger port, I found myself accidentally brushing up against the cable a bunch of times. When this happens, you hear a loud POP sound like a gunshot. My ears are still ringing from this.

THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER, CELL PHONE, TV, VGA CABLE, ETC. NEAR IT, IT WILL CREATE A TON OF NOISE.* As usual, audio distorts horribly when the output device is at 50% volume on the mini plug jack* Not gold plated, and the red and white plugs are not as long as standard RCA plugs (though that's really just cosmetic)The lack of good electromagnetic shielding was a real deal-breaker for me.

This has the edge over the Rhino piece on the basis of track selection - Rhino was a bit stingy in that regard. One track, \\"Kansas City\\" included here is not found in the other quality Midnighter CD's.While there are no sonic revelations or stereo versions here, the sound quality is reasonably good. The fold-out liner notes contain five pages of musical background on Ballard and his group.Overall, this is a reasonably competent effort by SFM.

The headset works perfectly with my desk phone as well as my Uniden cordless. I'm able to use both hands on computer in addition to move around and perform two handed tasks using the cordless handset. Audio is excellent. Headset is lightweight, comfortable, and secure.

The included CD doesn't even carry the needed software to run the card it instead directs you to Orange Micro's website to download thier latest and greatest drivers. On top of that for the past 3 weeks I have used this I still run across WinXP's warning boxes telling me that I need to reinstall the software since the drivers disappear. Finally the need to attach an external AC adapter to run anything attached to the cards ports is kind of hard to take as well. In my computer I need the AC Adapter plugged in to keep the card running or else WinXP shuts the card down since it is too much of a power drain.

Especially when dealing with rock. So, the film plods on with some quasi-academic, English \\"experts\\" seemingly forever until Jimmy Carl Black finally appears. I must admit that the interviews with J.C.B. , Bunk Gardner, Don Preston and Kim Fowley are interesting enough. However, the bulk of this DVD is endless chatter from self-important know-it alls and very little footage of The Mothers.

Burnt Weenie Sandwich and Weasels Ripped my Flesh are mentioned. DVD did a good job putting the recordings into perspective accordingly to the time of their release.

Even having read most of the books available on the subject this was still fun with the stories from those there and the actual footage that was shown. My only real complaint was not enough of the \\"best live band ever\\" playing was included. No doubt in large part to this not being an \\"offical\\" Zappa Estate product.

I felt again and again the urge to put it down. Ficton is supposed to provide a means of communication between men, across the barriers of space and time. Well, the man on the other end was little short of a US version of Adolf. A bigotry feast that I have found difficult to swallow, no matter how fascinating the technology description may have been. I suppose - or should I say afraid - that it may prove to be more acceptable to the US public. At least the author spared us from the cliche of the loner that saves the day, gets the recognition he deserves, and gets the girl at the same time.

For a start, those that gave this book, and also NIMITZ CLASS(Mind candy reading? Sounds fine to me!) one star made me want to read this more. I loved KILO CLASS from beginning to end, it was awesome! The story concerns a group of Kilo Class subs on sale from Russia to China, which must be stopped at all costs before the balance of power shifts in Asia to China's favour. So the US President approves a set of covert strikes against the subs en route - including some very unusual methods involving Navy SEALS on a tourist cruise in Russia! Also, what is the secret of a sub base on a remote island off the coast of Antarctica? Read this brilliant book now! The characters were entertaining, the prose was simple to understand without getting bogged down in too much technobabble, and Robinson proves he had done good research into his subject matter. I look forward eagerly to HMS UNSEEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save uyour time & money","review":"Reviewers compare Robinson to Clancy...Not even close....Clancy doesn't portray the US military as foul mouth arrogant murderers. It is evident that Robinson has an underlying animosity towards the brave men and women of the US military. They have shown great restraint in serving their country under extremely frustrating situations. Talk to pilots of the Viet Nam era. No one in the US military would commit the acts described in this book. Our military have been trained in the use of military hardware; we have also been trained as to the limitations of the use of same. The scenario of the SEALS is an insult to these brave men and women. No one is trained to needlessly murder anyone. Quite the contrary. Leadership training has a scenario that discusses the neccessity of killing unarmed civilians and the conclusion is YOU DON'T!!!!!

As a career Naval Officer I found his lack of technical knowledge distracting. Even with this limitation, if Mr. Robinson was a better writer the story might be more engaging. The characters are shallow, predictable, and very unbelievable. Had I not been stuck in an airport overnight with nothing else to read, I would not have gone past the first 50 pages. But I did make sure I threw the book away so no one else would waste his or her time. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but not great from ex Sub Sailor","review":"Interesting story line but not much in action or facts. Patrick spend way too many pages on his personal sailing trip and less than 2 pages on the first double torpedo shot. The interface between China and Russia was too superficial as well. I did finish the book but skipped a lot of the fill. So this guy has specific orders and then throws away a career in the end.

Too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy New","review":"Two of the CD's were no good but rush was Ok Next time I will buy new so this will not happen again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naval Warfare at its best","review":"A good, detailed work of art.

At the slow speed of 5 knots, nobody can pick them up on sonar, hear them much less see them in the dark depths of the sea. The story touches on the effectiveness of these subs in any real navy. Though fictional, but it can be very true in the fast changing world of us. There is a saying; \\"He who strikes first, strikes last\\" China ordered 10 new kilos from Russia, see how the USA reacts to it with their 688s (USN) and their covet Navy Seals...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robinson Produces Another Pacy Thriller","review":"Patrick Robinson has quickly established himself as a leader in the submarine thriller genre. Kilo Class, his second novel, is tightly plotted and fast-paced. High class literature this is not, and if an analogy can be drawn between the world of books and television, Kilo Class is definite TV movie material. In fact, at times this novel reads like a TV movie script, especially the dialogue. Still, this is a competent thriller sure to grab fans of the submarine actioner, and is perfect wet weekend reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, if you skip large sections of the story.","review":"The cover denotes him as the next Tom Clancy. In my opinion, Tom need not worry. This book has a wonderful storyline that could be developed. However, we are forced to read excruciating details about the commander's wife (who is only a secondary character) and a North Pole undersea crossing. Mr. Robinson then only devotes a couple of pages to hunting down and destroying two Soviet-built submarines. The book is full of finite details of things which do not move the story along and comes up short on the areas which are exciting and relevant. Finally, the plot is very contrived and the story seems to revolve around luck (like being in a sailboat in an antartic region and seeing a submarine periscope where nothing exists and nobody ever goes but our heros happen to depart their path to Australia and end up here). These sort of happenings are not realistic but seem to be the only way Patrick Robinson could move his story along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"Briefly, I'm only halfway through this book at I don't plan on finishing it.

I strongly recommend you avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome pace, predictable outcome, irresponsible premise.","review":"Barely readable prose, but two things stand out. The major problem I have is believing that the US Government would do something so irresponsible as to sink Chinese subs in international waters without provocation - so what if they blockade the Taiwan Straits or the South China Sea - go around them or send in the MPAs with mad gear and MK 46s. The US was just plain wrong, and stupid, to do that. The second point was minor, but my experience in the military suggests that when a group of admirals get together they don't litter their speech with four letter words the way Admiral Morgan did in the book - that's really declasse, and totally unbecoming of professional flag rank naval officers. This book ranks right down there with R. Karl (Carl?) Largent's stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bozo-class technobabble, high rankings notwithstanding!","review":"This book fails as technothriller and as fiction. The plot lurches and blunders and lunges, making lots of noise and precious little progress (e.g., the first thread lies doggo for hundreds of pages and barely resurfaces until the last two pages) and finally comes to rest, not with a bang but a blurb, in a thoroughly unsatisfying ending. The characters almost to a man are cardboard cutouts-the Chinese and Russian naval officers are nearly indistinguishable from the U. S. Navy contingent and the token civilians. The prose is banal at best, embarrassing in the occasional galumphing attempt at lyricism."},{"rating":"2","title":"French reader giving his opinion","review":"I haven't finished reading the book (in English) and I already think it's a very interesting book, the plot seems plausible to me but I didn't know admirals sweared that much (I don't have any problems with it but is it realistic?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real hard to put down.","review":"An overal excellent book.

What makes me upset is the utter lack of depth and knowledge in the characters, particularly the Chinese. The author continually has the Chinese referring to \\"honor\\" such as \\"It would do me no honor to remind you...\\" etc... To my knowledge, the Chinese do not have as high a concept of honor as the author might think, and it is certainly not used every other sentence in conversation. Such stereotypical association leads me to believe that the author is writing some sort of cheap sci-fi novel with extremely archaic Japanese characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, bad facts - waste of time","review":"This book is just as bad as Nimitz Class, the author's previous. Pages and pages of boring dialogue full of foul and obscene language - seemingly a Brit's weird attempt of writing \\"typical American\\". If even I discover so many \\"facts\\" to be wrong, there must be many more errors. For example, a \\"Super Cobra\\" helicopter will NEVER have 16 seats - it's an attack helo!

It has a lot of potential.However, Mr Robinsons complete lack of understanding of how the American military is organized and operated makes this work an insult to any person who serves their country in uniform. He has delusional fantasies about how the chain of command works and what the rules of engagement are.His portrayal of the Chinese in this book is nothing short of ignorant racism in its worst form.His portrayal of the noble Russian people is not quite as bad but is still insulting.Learn how to use a oompass and a GPS. You did not even get reciprocal course bearings right.It is not that hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overly-heralded disappointment","review":"I disagree with the Florida-Times Union. The book is NOT \\"superb,\\" and Tom Clancy is far and away a better story teller. Unless you are a devout submarine buff, any Clancy book is better than this one.There are three sequences that may genuinely hold your interest in this story - the mysterious destruction of a science research vessel in Antartica, and a Navy Seal Team assault on some subs in transit. The third likeable scenario is the US sub's hunting of a couple Kilo subs, but you have to wade through 350+ pages to get to it.The characters in this story are cliche and shallow, and the basic premise is not credible. The US risks nuclear war to destroy a few diesel submarines purchased by China? Yeah, RIGHT! We've already let Iran procure a few such subs (in real life). This book is a disappointing treatment of a supposedly \\"realistic\\" scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than listening to Terry Gross . . .","review":"I had this on tape from the library and it seemed better than listening to NPR. Also, I'm terribly interested in subs. But this book was thin on submarine action: instead it focussed on high level power politics.

I went looking for more in Kilo Class - and I may have had an unreasonable expectation. Nevertheless, I was not disappointed. Kilo Class attempts to intertwine two very interesting plots that finally come together in the end. However, Robinson neglected to fully explore one of the plots as much as I would have liked. It would have been better if he had explored more of the storyline about the mysterious secret lab on the frozen Anartic island.

He fills out his characters and their habits, but for technical details he's no Tom Clancy. His understanding of Chinese and Russian cultures is stereotypical in the worst way, if not downright ignorant. His writing style is infantile; it's as if he adds detail as he goes because he's just remembered something important--it's like listening to a 6-year old tell you a movie plot.I gave up halfway through the book; god help me, soap operas are more intellectually stimulating...I'm gonna have to try the soaps again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripping good yarn!","review":"This is a globe-trotting thriller starring the USSR's famed Kilo Class submarines & a host of naval brass in the Pentagon & their Black Ops Los Angeles Class skippers.

Vogel's choice of instruments (all historic instruments from Germany and Denmark, many still in mean-tone or modified mean-tone temperament) ensures that the listener hears the works on the instruments for which they were intended. The CD booklets (in English, French, and German) are full of useful information about the organs (including dispositions and registrations of the works played) and the works themselves. Vogel's playing style is unparalleled in this genre. He possesses an admirable baroque non-legato touch, and Buxtehude's rhapsodic preludiae are suffused with just enough 'stylus phantasticus' to completely impress the listener, without going out of bounds. In short, this series of seven is a true masterwork!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Interpretation of Dreams?","review":"Sokolov can boast of an extraordinary technique but his playing is affected and pornographic.

Therefore, this book was a great help to me. The pad thai dish was not too good, but the chiangmai curry noodle dish, fried rice dish, and basil with chicken dish was wonderful! From this book, I've learned that with garlic, onions, herbs, spices, soy sauce, fish sauce, water, or sugar, I can create something tasty for myself to eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook and very simple to understand","review":"I love this cookbook and would tell anyone who loves Thai food to get this book.

So far, I've tried 3 recipes from this book and 2 were excellent, plus there are many others I can't wait to try. Nothing is particularly \\"quick\\" for me in the kitchen, but these recipes are actually pretty easy. I wish McDermott had included more vegetarian recipes or suggested ways to make more of the recipes sans meat, but overall I am really glad I chose this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"style over substance","review":"This is the last time I buy a cookbook without cracking it open first. It was a real disappointment. This book is for beginners only. The dishes are easy, but not necessarily tasty or authentic. One recipe has fish sauce as its only seasoning, and I could figure that out myself. I found 2 recipes that used canned tuna - yuck!There is a distinct lack of quality control as well. I tried to make one of the curries but the recipe called for so much liquid, it would have been soup if I didn't modify it drastically. The book is designed awkwardly so it won't stay open by itself, a real pain when you are cooking. I only gave 2 stars because the pictures are lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Thai food, guaranteed","review":"This was my second cookbook by author Nancie McDermott (I have had the Curry Cookbook for several years and am in love with it!). I found this to be truly quick and easy. Again, every recipe I have tried is amazing, with ingredients easy to find. I have made the Green Chicken Curry with Zucchini (be sure to follow the recommendation to serve with the Tangy Cucumber Pickles for an amazing taste combination). After tasting it, a friend went out to a Thai restaurant and promptly voted this recipe better than the restaurant! You won't go wrong with this gem of a cookbook if you want delicious, easy to prepare Thai food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not have been more disappointed","review":"This book is more bright colors and design than substance and you will learn very little about Thai cooking from it. The recipes are very poorly described and there is a distinct lack of photographs to help you find your way. The stilted writing style fails to help you develop a passion for or understanding of the history or cultural essence of Thai cooking and food. The same recipes from other books produced flavors far closer to the food I eat in Thailand. It failed to touch my foody soul and left me totally cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Quick and Easy, but not Tasty","review":"Since Paht Thai has always been one of my favorite dishes, I thought I'd start off with that one.

The 6-foot length provides plenty of leeway to maneuver the devices, as I carry them from room to room. When I took the new cable out of the package, the first things that impressed me were the thick cord and the thick plugs. One would think that logically, when all things are equal, the more material is used to construct an item, the longer it would last.

When I started using the product, I thought at first that my speakers were broken, because at times I could only hear the bass line or only the treble line.

But somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around 8 days of use. When I moved the cable a little bit, it would go back to normal.I later returned the product as I had already bought a aux cable from radioshack, which I have to say, works flawlessly, I don't even need to remove the case.

The picture quality is so blurry it hurts your eyes to watch. I usually am not a stickler for picture quality, but when its this bad I feel cheated. Black Cobra 3 even has a black bar like widescreen movies at the top of the screen, but not at the bottom. The picture also shakes throughout all three films. The quality of all three film was so bad that I couldn't even finish watching them. What a shame because they were enjoyable B-grade action entertainment.

All he does is promote his CD's like he's a stupid rock band.

Not much more luck if you try from above. If you attempt this job, you'll appreciate spending money on a good mechanic (one with long, skinny arms!).Prices for these sensors seems to have come down a lot since the first one I had to replace about 3 years ago (my vehicle has 4 sensors).

Kind of like life, eh? The choices you make as \\"Kathryn\\" actually shape the course of her character development and love/sex life.It's a neat game this book offers, finding out what happens if you dare to do the things you'd never dare to do in reality... and let Kathryn enjoy (or suffer) the consequences!

I have tried composting before with little success, by using the traditional stack and fill composters. This composter comes fully assembled, is easy to use, and it is very durable. I generated beautiful compost over the summer in 3 to 5 weeks (avocado peels took a second \\"cooking,\\" but everything else worked great). I keep it on the back porch and it has no smell, it's reasonably attractive, and handy to the kitchen door. You might consider a kitchen \\"crock\\" to store your daily kitchen scraps, then empty into the composter each morning or evening.It's handy to have two of these, then you can have one digesting while you are filling the other.

I comes assembled so all I had to do was roll it out into the back yard. It is easy to turn and the hatch opens fine. I would give it 5 stars if I had successfully made compost in it. It doesn't come with any instructions though (doesn't really need any) so be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, easy to use, works well","review":"I got tired of buying compost all the time and explored the idea of a compost bin. I definitely wanted the convenience of something that allowed for easy turning, as I'm not about to use a pitch fork. This product works very well. It assembled easily and I've had it for over a year now and am quite pleased with it. It contains any odors (which if you compost right, you really don't have). It's easy to turn every few days. It seems like it will fill up, but I've yet to fill it up. Frankly, if my family generated more compostable material, I'd get more use out of it. But that's no fault with the product. Basically, every few months I scoopo out a five gallon bucket worth of compost and dump it in my vegetable garden. The \\"compost tea\\" feature is great. I've filled that same five gallon bucket with a mix of compost tea and water and used it in the garden. Works great. We're very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically very good","review":"This composter lives up to its billing in all regards and we are pleased with it. It is true that the more full it gets, the harder it is to rotate; but thus far (about 30% full), we can still rotate the bin without much difficulty.

As the founder of the CountryBound Web site, this topic is a passion of mine and several people recommended this book to me. I really appreciated Gene's insights and logical approach to realizing one's country dreams. His style of writing is reassuring but direct. He does not candy coat the trials and tribulations of country life. When you finish this book, you will know if country life is right for you.The other part of this book that I found extremely useful was the maps and detailed illustrations.

The map data and outlines and lists are all matters of public record. Even so, having all the information in one place and well indexed is very, very valuable. There are things I would add to the book, for instance in the section on tax rates I would also include sales tax and state income tax data because as the author notes, property taxes don't tell the whole story. I would also include information on concealed carry of firearms laws as these vary tremendously by state. Information on hunting and ranges for game animals and fish would help too.Incidentally, while this book is aimed at the U.S. in terms of the map/climate/social data, the themes and suggested plan would work for rurual property searches anywhere and would give you an idea of the data you might need to consider.

LITTLEST THINGS really solidifies, for me, just what a wonderful performer and talented songwriter this 20 year old wonder is. The lyrics are beautiful, the melody is romantic and you feel like it's a throwback to another time, and then you hear the percussive background and you are brought back to 2007.

I'd pay more $$ for working locks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the style","review":"I was disappointed with the style of the item that I received. Vaultz has changed the design of this item. I was looking for the old design, which had a separate bottom piece with 2 hinges (one on each side of the bottom piece), that allowed the binder to open up completely & D rings that make it easier to access all the pages in it. This was what was pictured. What I received however, was the new design that has just 2 sections, 1 hinge & U rings, that, in combination, make it difficult to access the pages in the back.

I notices my cats watching parts of cartoons, mostly chase scenes, and sections of videos showing birds taking flight or in a group feeding, and they were fascinated with long shots of birds at a feeder or taking to flight and one object chasing another. This dvd had none of that. There were some bird shots, but there was a lot of editing between shots and close ups--which didn't gets my cats' attention at all--no interest in pictures of birds. I didn't see any interest and didn't expect a cat to be interested in pictures of other cats doing anything, likewise the shots of cat toys fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I suppose it's always a crap shoot when buying entertainment or toys for pets, this one worked for me.

One of mine now jumps up onto the tv cabinet and just waits for me to turn it on when he's in the mood for some entertaining :)They tend to like the birds the most, and the toys moving across the screen. Also the fish seem to be a draw. They tend to turn away from the bunny though, I think because I have a bunny and they don't see them as prey.I kind of wish it lasted a bit longer, but I have my version of Feline Frolics on my Tivo via Amazon Instant Video, so I can just easily hit replay on the remote from across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"this product should have been lots of shots and sounds of other cats, for lonely bored cats to play with, instead it is mostly mice in cages, fish in tanks,and toys...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted natural soundtrack but cannot switch the track!","review":"I got the music track rather than natural track.

This track sets the tone for the remainder of the album which Curtis performs with utmost conviction, especially on 'message' tracks such as 'Keep On keeping On' and 'We've Got to Have Peace'. Everything a great album should be - great material performed in a way that does it justice.Like most of Curtis' early 70s discography, this album is essential to all soul/funk collections - a record that helped in consolidating the reputation of one of the genre's masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done.","review":"This album is a classic,arguably one of his finest(although not my favorite).It opens with a nasty,funky tune called Get Down,with it's sound much like If There's Hell Below from his first solo album.Next is a lovely ballad,and in my opinion,one of the best cuts here,called Keep On Keepin On,which has wonderful lyrics about perseverance despite adversity and a beautiful melody throughout.Other stand outs:the hippy sounding We Got To Have Peace(which I personally love);Beautiful Brother of mine is cool: and the album closer is gorgeous).Not my personal favorite Curtis album,I'm not sure why(just me),but I highly recomend it for every Curtis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one","review":"An antique dealer becomes successful from celebrities, then trashes them to make himself a few extra bucks.How original!The author forgets how he got to where he is today.

I started reading it at a time when I was feeling overwhelmed and out of my element in my research. This book has helped me find enthusiasm and wonder for the scientific process again. This is a fascinating book, and well worth reading for those of us who ask fundamental questions about human perception and the universe around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliably great!","review":"Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington novels are always well-written and enjoyable. I haven't had time to read this one yet, but I know I will love it. I have devoured all of the Stuart Woods novels(and especially the Stone Barrington novels) that I have read, and I know that \\"Swimming to Calalina\\" will be no different."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"I picked this book up in an airport, thinking I would get a decent crime novel to read on the plane. But it was terrible. The writing is generally poor, and the characterization is completely awful. The style seemed very similar to books written for 12-year olds, although the content was filled with unnecessary sex, needless references to (allegedly) fine wines, and very little in the way of wit. This trash doesn't come anywhere near the level of Raymond Chandler or Jim Thompson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - don't waste your time","review":"I remember reading a Stuart Woods book a long time ago & liking it. I received this one as a gift & thought it would be a fine beach read. It was horrible from page one. Typical of a once decent writer now writing fast & furious to cash in on the mass paperback trade. The main character was so unbelievable - is he a superman or what? This guy can do it all without a scratch or bruise. LOTS of unnecessary sex and contrived wit that was not funny at all. PLEASE do yourselves a favor & read a classic mystery instead. Unfortunately I couldn't rate this lower than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must've been a lousy edit job","review":"I listened to the book on tape, which might have been my first mistake (if buying the tape wasn't). I got a view of a man with zero personality whom women throw themselves after. Maybe it's a guy thing, being entertained by such tripe. Maybe it was poor editing, I don't know. I just couldn't understand how you can have a guy who's looking for a missing person. He already knows that the bad guy does criminal activity on his boats. Well, wouldn't you think that before you chose to sink one of his boats, you'd check to see if the missing person might be on it? Struck me as entirely too stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me pleased","review":"I read this book a while ago, but from my memory I know that this book was very entertaining, though not a piece of literary art.

'Swimming To Catalina'will go down very well with his fans, but isn't top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and pleasing","review":"Stuart Woods is an amazing author, he has never let me down. His novel Swimming to Catalina is the sequel to Dead in the Water. It is important to read Dead in the Water first to apprieciate Swiming to Catalina. Stone Barrington is the main character of both novels. He is an ex-cop of the NYPD from which he was forced to retire. Stone became a lawyer and joined a big firm in New York. In Swimming to Catalina Stone is trying to find his ex-girlfriend for movie star Vance Calder. Stone has plenty of trouble finding his ex. This was a great book just remember to read Dead in the Water first. Great job Stuart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Page Turner","review":"If you liked Dead in the Water, you'll love Swimming to Catalina.

I put this book down for 5 days and nearly forgot about it! If that tells you much..I have been caught in a spell of finding horribly boring books lately, where this book was recommended as \\"an amazing story.\\" How could you go wrong with that?, I thought. Yeah well, to my disappointment, I was bored through this entire book. There were so many different characters and names to remember, I got lost a nearly gave up in the beginning. Forcing myself to finish the book, I was hoping for a possible twist ending to wake me up, but that never happened. I ended up skipping about 30-40 pgs to get to the last chapter -just to see how it ends (so I could start on a real page turner). Little to my surprise it was a depressing ending. How do books like these get published? Honestly!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Barrington","review":"I enjoyed this one. I really like the Stone Barrington character.

I do plan on reading more of Stuart Wood's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very good Mystery","review":"I found the story a bit laborious but generally a good read. Stone's \\"escape scene\\" defies reader credibility. Perhaps the author could have thought of a slightly more plausible set of circumstances that would have been no less credible. After all, this is not a Superman episode, but a simple lawyer (\\"How do you describe a lawyer dead on the ocean floor?\\") who does complicated things.Having spent some of my teenage years in and around the area of this novel I can relate very well to the scene painted here. I think it is very well done indeed. But, I think it's not as good as \\"Dead in the Water.\\"This is a good book to take on a business trip: not too cumbersome, not too taxing, and absorbing when you need to be absorbed (like when waiting for a plane connection)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pageturner for me","review":"I'm always looking for a book that I can't book down, a who-dunnit that keeps me guessing to the end. This book was not it. Though Woods is great at fleshing out his main characters, he dragged out the mystery way to long to the point where I was disintrested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a corndog; lots of fluff, little meat","review":"Stuart Woods used to be one of the authors whose books I would buy as soon as they came out. Swimming to Catalina and the past few have moved him into \\"I'll wait for my public library to buy it, until I read anymore of his books\\" status. The plot is as thin as the Hollywood people Woods writes about and transparent from the first pages. Stone Barrington is supposed to be a character that women drool over, (Woods' prose is more explicit) but I could find nothing within worth emulating. Perhaps all character development has been done in earlier books. When the scheme that has Barrington moving from hotel, to hotel and back again is revealed, Woods wraps it all up within a few pages and calls it a day. A formula work at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"A typical Stuart Woods novel.

The book, misses the mark.It isn't so much a storyline as it is a thinly written set-up for the next explicit sex scene. There isn't a plot to speak of. Character development is less than lukewarm. Truly, the purpose of dialogue in this book is to set up the next porn-trash scene. Themes in both stories include forced sex and threads of beastiality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Internet as a medium for artistic expression","review":"I found this book to focus less about the art on the internet and more of a critique of it. Though it cites examples, it rather addresses issues about the internets role in culture, its role in the public domain vs. privitization, philosophies of internet and interactivity. The book is quite interesting and brings up issues that should be activly looked at in todays commercial world. I recommend this to all artists who are active in working with multimedia or even those in advertising and marketing who would like to brush up on some marketing schemes and how the internet applys to todays commercial world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Provocative","review":"Here is a good book to take along on a coffee journey and enjoy the refreshing experiences of Solomon Porch.

Sigourney Weaver stars as a parapsychology professor and professional debunker and Cillian Murphy is her grad student sidekick.

Never thought I'd see great actors say lines so stupid -\\"How'd you do that? How'd you do that? How'd you do that?\\". 2. Bad editing/continuity. Cillian gets his face graphically beat and bloodied in a restroom, and the next SECOND there is very little blood on his face? 3. Bad storytelling. Scenes go on pointlessly, nothing to do with the movie (a line of salt in Deniro's room?), and worse - using fakey newscasters and news broadcasts to tell key (yet redundant) points of the story.

In the right hands this cast could have made a great film but this script left so much to be desired that I am surprised anyone bothered to show up for filming. Skip it.

If you have a TV, you know about ghost hunters and people with their odd contraptions trying to measure phenomena to prove or disprove their ideas. In case you've never seen these people on TV, the movie had to explain that too in a jumble of scenes. The most obvious problem with the plot was supposed to be a surprise. So, if you take a weak plot, add some clips that state the obvious, try to misdirect away from the most obvious of red herrings, and then add low light and popping electronics, a bloody fight, and dreams, this is the result.

For under $8.00 this is still good insurance for handling those expensive computer components!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"When I first opened the package, I thought that the wrist band materials where pretty light and would probably not hold up. But I was wrong. They are doing great. Plus, the manufactor claims to give a life-time warranty; that will be interesting to test when the wrist band finally gives out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Good Price","review":"While you don't have to have an Anti-Static band to build a computer, the low price is more then worth the safety of not ruining a hundred or two hundred dollar component you just bought. Plus, it will never go 'out of date' so you can use it for builds in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This anti-static wrist band is worth the money.

These worked great and were comfortable to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you would expect and at a great price","review":"The velcro wristband is comfortable but could still feel the roughness scrape my wrist once in awhile nothing big but a thought if anyone has sensitive skin you might want to go with a different type of wrist strap.

Clamp looks great and seems to hold well even when i pull on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero connectivity","review":"Testing with a multimeter, there is no connectivity between the wrist strap and the clip.

Also note that the strap isn't elastic, so it would be a pain get on and off each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This anti-static wrist band makes a nice constant ground contact between my skin and my computer frame.

And my intention is to read everything she has written. So Riding Shotgun came up on the list. I was thinking that Shotgun was a horse, named so in several other books. But no. I'm not even sure what the connection is between the title and the story. In typical RMB style everything seems to be thoroughly researched and nicely written. But the problem is, its boring. I just wasn't interested. Didn't like any of the characters, didn't connect with them. Just didn't care. Sorry, RMB. Just not your best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Time Travel Story","review":"Delightful story, likeable characters and a beautiful setting left me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I have read all of the Sneaky Pie books and found this one a refreshing change. The characters are vivid as is the description of 1699. The title character, Cig, struggles to learn many of lifes lessons and get on with her life. Ms. Brown is able to tell a story with a message in a way that is engaging without being a lecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Trip","review":"Ms. Brown has written a fine, vivid novel. She opens up several different plot elements and intricately weaves them together. She does this with the most sucess in the second part of her book. However, the third part is a bit short, and Ms. Brown seems to try to tie up all the loose ends of her story rather hastily. The main character, Cig, is well developed, except why she gains an extremely forgiving nature is not well explained. The hunt scenes are executed beautifully and acurately. These are the best parts of the novel. They convey action and emotion all at once. This book is a fine read, but I wish Ms. Brown could have explained certain events and characters more clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of her best, but worth reading.","review":"I am only familiar with Brown's Mrs. Murphymystery series but I was suprised to find outhow much I enjoyed \\"Riding Shotgun\\".

I will be very careful in the future to see that I avoid such drivel"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of reading time","review":"I have found some of Rita Mae Brown's novels amusing.This wasn't one of them.The book has the heroine who has the unexplained name of Cig going on a fox hunt from which she then goes backward in time to 1690.The historical setting of the book does seem to be accurate, but the plot leaves a great deal to be desired---mainly I wish it had had one!The book prods 356 pages (paperback version) to a deadly dull finish.As Rita Mae Brown has written lesbian novels in the past, I had hopes the heroine would be lesbian, but such was not the case.>BR>>P> The only lesbian in the book is the heroine's daughter, who is an extremely minor character.If you suffer from insomnia, this book might do the trick for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant in parts, not a great as a whole","review":"The period scenes are marvelous, as are the vivid descriptions of fox hunting etc. But Cig, the title character, was thoroughly unlikeable to me. Her treatment of her daughter sent chills down my spine. This woman was so totally selfish and self absorbed that by the end of the book I found it difficult to care what happened to her! Also, while the book was excellent in parts, it definitely dragged in others mainly because (as one reviewer has already pointed out), there was a lot of prior novel plot/dialouge rehashing. Not one of Rita Mae's best....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I have been a fan of Rita Mae Brown's for a long time and I particularly enjoyed this book. Its an interesting story with very \\"real\\" and well-defined characters that seem like old friends by the time you've finished reading. I was intrigued by the storyline and could not put this book down. If Ms. Brown writes a sequel I'll buy it the minute it hits the shelves! Also, if you like horses you will really enjoy this book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"What's not to like - you have the Virginia countryside, animals, romance, and reincarnation?/past-life regression! Interesting lead character in unusual situation. Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rita Mae Brown never disappoints!","review":"I loved this book! The combination of personal growth/intraspection, Virginia history and horses is just more than I can pass up.

As a person who loves reading romance novels I was very disappointed in this author one of my favs before this book.The heroine was so silly in her belief of women independence above all things in the book I didn't know I could dislike a lead character so much.

These are from India - the ones I got in NZ were from Thailand.

We love Native forest especially the pinapple but this was a big let down. Cans were only half mango with the other half juice. They taste nothing like fresh mango. My 8 yr old son who loves mangos said they taste like baby food. Soft chunks with only mild mango flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great mp3 player","review":"I recently bought this mp3 player for myself and I could not be happier. Not only can I bring a vast collection of music with me wherever I go but I can also arrange the music in playlists that reflect my moods. One of it's best features is that I can download directly from my cd's NO COMPUTER REQUIRED. Its great and I would recommend this player to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a 0 star rating","review":"Not only is this product built to break it is plagued by middle ware and proprietery copy schemes. You have to use either musicmatch jukebox (shudder) or e.digital's music explorer to copy files to/from it. The problem is that bulk copies with music explorer reorder the tracks so the playlists on the player are scrambled.Also the buttons are constructed extremely poorly. Within 2 weeks I broke the play and stop buttons. If you press too hard they snap off and fall into the crappy plastic case. I have had to resoldier the output jack back onto the main circuit board no less than 3 times, and this requires taking the entire unit apart and working around the unremovable lcd screen.Overall DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. If you get one for free immediately throw it on the ground and stomp it to pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems great at first...","review":"I bought the Classic MP3 player because of its capacity -- others only held about an hours worth of music. Had difficuly getting the software going -- user manual doesn't help at all. Technial support is a mystery. Finally figured that out -- thought all was great. Navigation is easy, the unit is about the size of a walkman, sound quality is great, etc. Recently I've been having problem with unit freezing up. Sometimes will play 4-5 songs, sometimes only 1. Only way I can fix is to pry the battery unit off (if let run down, gets very hot). I'd strongly caution anyone else against buying this product. Too many headaches for too much money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This is a remarkable piece of junk. It freezes up after most songs and the play button popped out of mine.

It seemed like a great product: lots of memory, reasonably priced, compact size and many rave reviews. However, when I tried to set it up, I ran into numerous problems. For starters, while I was uploading music to the device, after 1 GB, it said that it was full. Then the software, Musicmatch, couldn't recognize the device, so I could not reformat its hard drive. The menu system on the mp3 player was confusing and difficult to navigate. Also, I could not find any online support for this virtually unknown company. Although I'm sure I bought a lemon, I didn't care to exchange it for another one, knowing that even if I had gotten it to work, it wouldn't have been worth it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"It says in the instructions that Windows 98 may not recognize this device. Oh, is that all? To remedy this small problem it goes on to suggest unplugging the USB, reinstalling the software, and then \\"finding\\" the drivers yourself. I assume that had I been one of the people for whom the installation went smoothly I might have a more favorable review, but I wasn't so lucky.After wasting a night getting it to work, I discovered that the software is garbage. It takes over as your primary MP3 player, not to mention every other music related program you may have. All I want is a way to transfer music between the device and my computer. This software tries to connect with the company server to gather info on you every chance it gets. Then it will give you music recommendations and offer to sell you CDs.Everything about this smells of \\"cheapness,\\" except the price tag. After a few days I decided it just wasn't worth it.

DO NOT BUY THIS BUY A IPOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mp3 player I've owned so far","review":"I've had a few mp3 players in the past, but this by far the best. The shear capacity of the player is one of the major plus points, and combined with it's cost, makes an excellent product. The OS is not the nicest to use, but with future firmware updates (there has already been one firmware release..., will only get better. The recording feature is also another bonus, not for recording from CD's, but plug in a mic and you can record from any external source. Some people have complained about the casing, and the fact that the player crashes/locks from time to time. Well, I have had no problems with the case, with a little care (as any mp3 player should be given) you should never break this player. As for the crashes, these can be escaped by rebooting the player if it crashes. Although undocumented, it is possible to do this via a combination of button presses.I would certainly recommend this product to anyone thinking of buying a hard drive based MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I loved the price and the capacity on this player, but it frequently stops working for no reason.

I got frustrated ... get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This player is a glorified mp3 if you look at just their advertising. When you buy it, it is full of stuff and has no ability to add memory or to add additional music or books. It has a sd micro slot but the cheap SOB's had it shut off so even if you put a card in it will not work, tripping over dollars for pennies. They gain nothing but loose customers by their cheapness.

Those of us who \\"got\\" Pylon felt they were a punch in the face to all the purveyors of Arena and Southern Rock being force-fed to the masses. Much of the better known music from punk and new wave poseurs of this era sounds silly and dated twenty-five years later. However, owing to Pylon's superb musicianship and originality, their music holds up well.

The edition is from Korea, so the liner notes are in Korean (not Japanese), but the movies are in English and are clearly labeled in English. They have Korean subtitles, but every DVD player has a button on the remote for turning off the subtitles. These are wonderfully satisfying movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major contribution","review":"This is a major contribution to our knowledge of film. The movies themselves probably didn't look as good when released as they do now. This Happy Breed and Madeleine are a bit weak, but this is made up for by the seven others. Everyone needs a copy of the superb Hobson's Choice.My only complaint is with the packaging. The raised centers holding a disc break off, leaving discs to roll around the box. I put CD sleeves between the double discs, and that seems to work and minimize the possible damage. The five disc packages are also fitted into the box too tightly. Quibbles.

Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.Combat - Season 3, Operation 2 ~ Vic Morrow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"It's funny how time has a way of making what was boring 45 years ago seem nostalgic today. I bought this set of DVDs because of that but the show is no more interesting now than it was when I was in the 5th grade. The shows are a really trying experience to get through because they are so simple and uninteresting. In addition, the DVD menu is so screwed up that it's sheer luck to be able to find the actual shows themselves on these discs. Don't waste your money buying these because you'll only find yourself annoyed at trying to watch them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but didn't work for me","review":"Very economic and Zonet has always worked fine for me. Unfortunately not this one. It has a weird issue of not being to handle Web traffic (didn't try other types though). With network devices connected, the basic services like Ping, DNS worked OK: no disconnect or lost packets or anything. However computers just couldn't get to websites - just trying and trying and no data. Tried all kinds of computers: Linux, Windows 7, Windows Vista, with all sorts of browsers. Nothing could get through. Frustrated, I got an old Linksys WG54L, disabled its DHCP and wireless to just use its ethernet switch, and all computers worked fine. Never seen this kind of weird problem before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Abstract. Not Much Funk.","review":"I can't say a whole lot of good things about this CD, so I'll keep it short and sweet. The songs aren't mixed, the songs make you wait for disappointingly anticlimactic breakdowns, compilations that include works of other artists sound much better mixed, and KY seems to have gotten lost in the land of Creative Exploration, forgetting the big picture in the process.

Not a huge fan of anything after [...] but I still own the albums because...well, because it's Keoki. For the longest my favorite albums were Disco Death Race 2000 and All Mixed Up. Until one day, I picked up a copy of A Superstar Journeys By DJ Keoki...Listened to the album from beginning to end then pressed rewind and listened again. This mix puts you on a journey through trance, house and even early breakbeat. I think it sounds like a wonderful rave thrown in purgatory. Definitely a darker sound than Keoki's normal stuff. This is now my all time favorite Keoki album.

The ideas it presents about the nature of light and its potential for healing and rejuvenation are startling. The main theme of the book is an amazing meditation technique that is taught over a seven day period. It involves learning how to \\"see\\" light and use it for healing, relaxation, energizing the body, etc. It's one of the best techniques I've used. Mr. Pepper writes as if he's sitting with you in your living room. He has a witty, engaging style, and he encourages readers to approach light meditation at their own pace, without the heavy esoteric tone of some other books. But he also outlines the meditation process thoroughly, and I for one found it extremely effective. I give it a definite 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for oily, mature skin","review":"I really like this foundation because it goes on smoothly & really looks natural.

Foremost throughout the book is Michael's love for his children and his concern for their welfare.This almost verbatim report of the events is peppered with philosophical thoughts revealing his inherent optimism. It is this optimism and the strength of the love for his children which give him the strength to continue the struggle. From the very first page the reader is captivated by means of a fast moving narrative making it very hard to put down. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Track #17 \\"Catch a Moment,\\"","review":"I too was going to buy this album based on Track #17 \\"Catch a Moment,\\" which I also heard online.

This cd is a boring waste of time and money.The ONLY redeeming quality of this cd is Track #17 \\"Catch a Moment,\\" which is why I bought the cd, in hopes of some of the other tracks being of similar quality -- smooth, soulful vocals, creative use of sounds and beats...

This book took the mystery out of everything from helping establish what you really can afford to finding the right mortgage.

It explains alot of concepts, has a great appendix of terms, and is a 'fun read' - i.e., humor throughout keeps it interesting. I read Tyson's Personal Finance For Dummies and loved it, and I have the same to say about this book too. It starts off with guiding you through numbers, how much you can afford, and ideas about accumulating a down-payment. It explains the looking process, how to spot good property and \\"OPT's\\" (Over Priced Turkeys!) More chapters on mortgage, closing, and most importantly, reminds you that the time to think about selling your house is when you're buying it. I keep going back to several chapters as a reference.

The book covers home inspections, escrow info, title work, etc. Every basic detail on how to safely get you into a house.

Too my surprise the book is pretty much worthless, sure it has lots of chords, but they are presented in a way that does nothing to help the student understand how chords are used. Many of the chords presented are unrealistic in as far as the demands placed on the hand(excessive stretching..ouch!).The chords that most jazz guitarist use today and yesterday have always been to make efficient use of the hands(some of the chords require that you make a 7 fret stretch in first position). I for one have never seen any of the great guitarist ever stretch beyond 5 frets and most stay at 4 frets including my self.

Victoria is a nympho anyway and soon becomes the \\"Dutchess\\" Duke's right hand woman. She gets thrown into a world of sex and craziness in Babylon.The first thing that tripped me out was Duke's workers calling him \\"Massa\\" The other thing that tripped me out was Celeste, Dutchess' private part, that talks to her. This book was a really awful. The whole book is about sex, every chapter is a detailed explanation of the freakiness .

You feel society slipping off of the face of eternity as you read just the first chapter.Poor prose, poor word choices. The only vivid descriptions are of sex scenes, and even they aren't done with class or any literary skill. This book is also riddled with typos.

I don't know whether Ms. Hart is suffering in her own personal life, but it is clouding her mysteries.

A fast pan creates a slight stutter in the image which some may not notice but its there. A much worse problem is the DVD drives well know \\"glitches\\" when playing dual layered DVDs. Layer changes are slow skip frames. The worse problem is that the drive will occasionally just stutter during a DVD when there is no layer change at all. These problems are known by the tech savvy on the web (just do a search) and plague many of the Q50 in US and abroad. I returned my first one and got a replacement. It was better but not 100%.

It reads like a first draft of \\"Bridge of Sighs.\\" Many of the same elements appear in both books: a quiet boy as a central character, delinquents who extort money from their peers, a legendary fight that puts one boy in the hospital, a popular teenager who leaves home and lives in a flat above a store, a community poisoned by the local tannery. I could go on.Everyone has to start somewhere. As a first novel, this book certainly showed promise. However, Russo has found his voice in far better novels. \\"Mohawk\\" is poorly constructed and the characters are not particularly well drawn. (Why on earth would the beautiful, intelligent Anne marry a doofus like Dallas Younger?)If I were Russo, I would insist that the publisher move this book to the out of print list. I sure would like to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Despite the hype and publicity that this book has received, I found it to be very humdrum and the characters lacking. The whole 'scene' was depressing, the people lacked any character or inspiration at all. Some characters' storylines just seemed to wander off into nowhere, while others were tied up and presented in a very neat little package. I expected more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I expeced.","review":"As a huge fan of Russo, I was disappointed with this story. In my opinion the characters were not easy to sympathize with and the whole thing just sort of bogged down in the middle. I forced myself to finish the book because I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't.Spend your money on Straight Man, Empire Falls, or Nobody's Fool. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real and honest characters","review":"Many readers are familiar with the comfort (and sometimes discomfort) that comes from recognizing oneself or a friend or relative in a story. Mohawk was full of such recognizable characters for me. And the characters who I couldn't relate to made me grateful about it. Russo has created a wonderfully real, and sometimes gritty story here full of lines that demand to be re-read to be fully appreciated. The moment when we find out what/who caused \\"Wild Bill\\" to be the way he is is very powerful. This is one of those books that you don't want to stop reading, yet you stop yourself if only to prolong the enjoyment for another day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fan disappointed","review":"I came to \\"Mohawk\\" after reading two other Russo books, \\"Straight Man\\" and \\"Nobody's Fool\\", both of which I enjoyed tremendously. I truly admire his sardonic wit, sense of the absurd and insightful prose. That said, I found this book, his first, to be a disappointment. Russo's storytelling abilities were not yet as strong, his characterizations weak. In fact, all of the people who populate the town of Mohawk seem to be more archtypes than fully realized individuals. The book is divided in two parts, with a jump in five years, leading to abrupt shifts in focus, inconsistency in character development and some hasty and murky plotting. The second half was just not as interesting to me as the first, and almost seemed like a different book. Russo's rapier-sharp wit is in short supply, as well, which is one of his strongest assets as a writer. Any Russo is better than none, but if you haven't read him, I would stick to the other two aforementioned books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From His Best Work","review":"If you liked Straight Man and Nobody's Fool (as I did) and expect more of the same out of Mohawk, you will be disappointed. These characters don't do anything and evoked nothing in me but boredom and occasionally disgust. And you don't read Russo for a screaming plot, so there is not much left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoy the author's short reads, like this one. He has an easy style, as well as well-developed story and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully developed talent","review":"This was Richard Russo's first published book.

Unlike many of the other wedding workbooks, this book is not cluttered with advertisements and pictures of items not applicable to your wedding. It simply organizes the major aspects of your wedding.Each page represents a specific feature of your wedding (ceremony, flowers, etc). It provides spaces for all the contact information of the site and/or vendor, what deposits you've made, when balances are due and so on. The best part is, each page has its own pocket to keep all your receipts and contracts in.This book does not explain traditions, or who should stand where, or anything like that. As I said, it simplifies all your plans into one little book that you can carry around and keep all the most important information with you for easy access.This book is perfect for those who are fully involved in the planning process, and really need to pull everything together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked with a little help","review":"I bought this specifically for my 2006 Focus hatchback. The video and instructions made it look easy to install. We ran into 2 problems: 1) The fuel filler vapor return tube (it's not shown in the video) was in the way and the bracket didn't quite lineup with the holes. My first reaction was to just return it.However, my brother's friend, a mechanic, looked at it. He moved the vapor line by cutting the tie downs with scissors. He then measured the hitch and showed the 2 ends were not quite parallel. He used a securing strap to bring the ends in towards each other. He was then able to drill the hole, add the bolts and secure everything.I don't want to scare anyone off, my brother and I could've done it but I was a little gun shy about moving stuff underneath my car. I love the hitch and plan to use it with a bicycle rack. The product seems solid enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but worth it in the end","review":"OK, I know $112 is alot to spend on a set of test leads, but you actually get quite a bit in this set. Item 4 in the photo is a set of fine wire very flexible probes which accept spring loaded test points used in bed of nails testers to keep contact with tiny parts in surface mount designs. With the other probes, clips, and hooks you can connect to just about anything plus the kit includes a normal set of high current leads for measuring 10 amps. Item 4 by itself sells for about $50 in stores nearby.Having the right tool for the job is important. Here you have the tools to measure fine parts without shorting fine pitch parts out and destroying expensive systems. If there is interest, email me and I can provide closeup photos of item 4 so you can see the usefulness of this probe style.

And this story lacks the depth and emotion of Ms. Siddons' past novels. I found myself at the end of the book wondering what had happened to the plot and whether one had really existed at all.

A young Jewish girl, Elli, and her family search for love and identity after being in a concentration camp. Her family now houses a life-long dream of living in America.

I don't know if the authors are one and the same.... but they appear as though they could be--- which is fine with me, as books by each(?) author are entrancing and give great satisfaction to this reader-- though they have caused me to have a terrific urge to go visit the area of the ACE BASIN and the off-shore islands, and that is giving me unrest until this is accomplished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and predictable","review":"Too much melodrama in this novel.

Now I have read Downtown and Low Country and I find it hard to believe that they were written by the same author as Up Island. While reading Low Country, and forcing myself to finish it I have come to the conclusion that Anne Rivers Siddons just cannot write. There were paragraphs that were so ridiculosly written that I would read them to my husband and we would just crack up. She introduces characters and forgets them (Lottie, Carter among others). She has another one transform while being out of the story for a few days (Sophia) and the most aggravating thing of all is the main character spends way too much darn time sleeping! This book made me crazy. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in Siddons","review":"I have read all of Anne Rivers Siddons books, so I was eagerly anticipating this newest one. However, I was very disappointed. While this book hints at the rich imagery and phrases of Siddons's earlier novels, it doesn't come close to matching them.

When you're cooking and are referring to recipes as you go along, big, bold, dark print is a lot easier to the eye especially as one gets older.Just wondering why -- this point was not taken into consideration when the print was chosen. There was even a write-up on the special print that was used, though I found it to be inappropriate and rather impractical.Also, I was about to make her pot roast recipe -- why does Marcella require us to use \\"chopped,canned,imported,plum Italian tomatoes\\" -- all 1-1/2 tablespoons of it? Why so little? Is it really worth opening up a whole can for that little amount? Why not just use the plain fresh plum tomatoes then?Just wondering -- if it was a typo or incorrect, unedited material.So far that was the only recipe I've checked.

This album, unfortunately, is too Pop and not enough R&B; sometimes. But Missy Elliott really gave this album it's wings with tracks like \\"Gotta Leave\\" & \\"Where My Girls At?\\"The main highlites on this album are the voices. Meelah's voice is so fluid, like she's snaking in and out of your ears with hery velvet vocals. And when Misha and Irish step it, then it's all over. The talent is definitely there and this album is about a quarter of the way there.The best tracks (to me) are:2. Where My Girls At? (catchy, bangin')3. You Don't Know (futuristic funk)7. Finally9.

Even the slow songs kept me interested. The beats were Hot! My friend who never buys Cd's bought it and loves is to death!! Especially the song \\"You'll Just Never Know\\". It's her favorite. Trust me anyone whose is considering to but this Cd would love it!!! I know I did, but the only problem is that I think that...........well......

I like the choppy sounding rhythms that dominate this album. Most of the album is entirely like that. Where My Girls At, Make Time, You Don't Know, Seven, that final song on the album, Gotta Leave and others are some very solid songs. And having Missy Elliott, Bag and Arnthor, Soulshock and Karlin, this Wilcher guy, Marc Kinchen, and some others produce on here made this a more excitable sounding album than the debut.

Most artists release a cut off the album that plays the radio for the week or two and lures listeners into purchasing and regreting it the week after.

This CD has atleast 6 cuts that are off the hook, the others are decent. The production is a little wack but as a Bad Boy he held his own and any hip hop or rap fan would admire the fact that he doesn't have any guest appearances except for Barrington Levy and Slim from 112. Shyne's story telling is the best part of this album and it is so simple yet tight that he'll give Nas(fallen off story teller) and Big a run for their money. Not to compare them though but he's hot. With thousands of rappers in the game somebody has to sound like somebody somewhat. ( At first Ja Rule sounded like DMX or Magoo sounding somewhat like Q-Tip) So for the ones that are screaming Shyne sounds like Big, give him a BREAK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wog is in da house","review":"A pretty dope album for all you rap fans out there.

His hard-boiled stories of hustling, killing, and women really make for some great songs. From start to finish, songs like \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\", \\"The Life\\", and \\"The Hit\\" really put Shyne out as what he's meant to look like; a gangsta. Now I can't say that he has stepped out of Biggie's shadow, but he does lace down the 16 tracks in his own, unique way. The beats also stay true to the gritty rhymes, and the special appearances from Barrington Levy and Slim (from 112) give it just the right touch by easing up the album just a bit. Rhyming hasn't been this hard-core in quite some time, so if you want a little more than hearing about cash and hoes on your CD, Shyne is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Good raw rap material, you can tell shyne's keepin it real, and the beats are good, some songs could be tighter beat wise ... but itz good hard core gangsta [rap] free shyne!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure he's feelin' REAL gangsta right now.","review":"Pure Grade-A WACKNESS!

Unlike B.I.G.(Player), 2PAC(thug), NAS(teacher), or Jay-Z(baller) Shyne doesn't really reveal anything about himself in his music. I'm not asking him 2 make a confession on the album, but after hearing the album u have no idea what shyne is all about.The production was kind of lame, like damn why puffy can't make a call 2 timberland, Rza, Or Dj premier. I was expecting more from shyne since puffy paid big buck for him but he seem pretty average 2 me, something telling me the only reason puffy sign him was really just cause he sound like B.I.G.

The rich and famous often avoid responsibility for their actions with lawyers that are more concerned about money than they are about the law and the meaning of civility in society.

This exclusive neighborhood of theirs was full of massively wealthy families with lots of teens who certainly had the freedom to party, and you have to wonder if that overall lack of parental supervision was a contributory factor in Martha's death.

My opinion is that he is an average detective and a ... when it comes to writing. A much better book on the case is \\"A Wealth of Evil\\" by Timothy Dumas also \\"The Other Mrs. Kennedy\\" is a great book if you want to learn more about the Skakel family.

This man knows absolutely nothing about Greenwich or the Martha Moxley murder. If you are interested in true facts from someone who knows the people, the town and teh story, read Greenstown. That book is actually worth it.

I should have remembered the garbage I'd read previously by Mark Fuhrman, Murder in Brentwood. But no. I went ahead and got this book, only to be dissapointed and bored to tears by another great example of bad true crime. At least it wasn't as God awful as his previous book. In this book he actually wrote about the case, not just defended himself as he did in Murder in Brentwood. I can't really blame the guy: he simply was not blessed with the gift of writing. Mark Fuhrman is just NOT A GOOD WRITER! All the facts are there, yes; all the opinions are there, including his own. But the book is assembled in such an unprofessional and boring way that the book is unenjoyable. I warn every prospective buyer of this book: spare yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting case, lousy book","review":"Perhaps Harpercollins should have called this book, \\"How Mark Fuhrman Solved the Martha Moxley Murder.\\" This narcissistic book is poorly written and presented. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read. I couldn't put it down.","review":"This guy can write! This book takes you back in time, to the crime scene, to the Kennedy power brokers and the mystique that surrounded them and still does to this day. Obviously an accurate depiction of the bumbling police and prosecutorial actions. This can be evidenced by the fact that a Grand Jury has been called after the book hit the stands and renewed interest in this senseless and most brutal killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook: Boring, answers little","review":"Refers to AUDIOBOOK: Although this is a decent enough beginning to the case, it ultimately left me with more questions than when I started. It just felt... unfinished. I do acknowledge Mr Furhman's work, so I am willing to put the lack of detail down to the Audiobook editing. But I was left feeling unsatisfied. Perhaps the book was a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent investigation about a long unsolved murder","review":"Mr Fuhrman looks at the evidence as only an ex-cop can do and gives an excellent theory as to who killed Martha Moxley and why.. The book is very well done and easy to read .The evidence he puts forth is very compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read.","review":"This was a very interesting book. It made me angry because this kid is going to get away with this murder because of who is family is. The author left out no information. All my questions were answered, except the ones that he himself could not answer. It Kinda makes you crazy because there is no answer to the question \\"Who killed Martha Moxley?\\" But it is still very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Greenwich resident responds:","review":"Any book that forces the public to re-examine the facts of the Martha Moxley murder in Greenwich, Ct. is worth any amount of controversy the author may generate. The Greenwich police's handling of Moxley's murder 25 years ago was was disgraceful, and their recent treatment of Furhman by the Greenwich police bordered on obstruction of justice. The Greenwich community still doesn't want it's \\"dirty little secret\\" published about it's behavior at the time of the murder, but thanks to Mark Furhman (and Tim Dumas, author of \\"Greentown\\"), maybe justice will finally, though belatedly, be served."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great expose on the inner workings of Greenwich","review":"As a former Greenwich reisdent and Greenwich Police officer, I truly enjoyed this book. Furhman does a great job of exposing the inner workings of the Town, especially how anyone who tries to rock the boat is treated. The unfortunate thing is that the way major investigations were being handled in 1975 by the Greenwich Police is still the way they are handled today. That is to say, very poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have we forgotten WHO Fuhrman is?","review":"I've looked at this book, as I have read other books and articles about the Moxley murder. It's an okay book. However, I've been struck by who the author is. Is he on a redemption crusade? Does anyone remember just WHO Mark Fuhrman is? He gained fame and notoriety as the Los Angeles detective whose credibility was destroyed during the O.J. Simpson case. Why? Because he lied on the witness stand, about a myriad of details relating to his investigation of the case. Some of his lies related to his own admissions and statements regarding his hate for Black and brown people. Was he not charged with perjury stemming from his untrustworthy testimony at the trial? Fuhrman can write any book he likes; I'm simply suggesting that we remember that his lies, racism and willingness to perjure himself are some of the reasons he is no longer a Los Angeles police detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent detective work - Great expose of old secrets!","review":"Very interesting book. I read it in three days. The information he uncovered is so unbelievable, you'd think it's fiction, but it's not. Well documented and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account of the case","review":"This book will definitely leave you with a thirst for more true crime of its ilk, and it will cause you to follow the Moxley case closely as well. Fuhrman should put his wits to more cases, as this book is one of the best reads on true crime you're likely to find on shelves. And as for Fuhrman, he doesn't have to go on a crusade, as one reviewer put it. The man was the victim of perhaps the worst character assasination the courts have seen in years, and not only that, was basically forced to plead no contest to perjury since one cop has no chance to defend himself in a long messy case with any kind of decent (re: expensive) legal help. No one can deny, after reading the facts, that Fuhrman would have beat the charges filed against him. OJ should be rotting in a state pen. Give Fuhrman a whole lot of credit for not disappearing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Fuhrman is On The MARK!","review":"As Mark Fuhrman established himself as a skilled investigator, he has also proven just as adept as a writer. In vivid detail, he methodically builds his case, offering every significant item, piece by piece. As the mosaic comes together, it points undeniably to the most unlikely culprit. Raised with privilege, opportunity and class, young Skakel became an arrogant and demanding, rebellious teen. When he was spurned in romance, he reacted with anger and hostility. Mark's incisive style takes you inside the head of the perpetrator and his shelterers. His vivid word pictures portray these actual events as they occurred, giving the reader a revealing perspective of privilege and corruption which is both dismaying but factual. This book is an excellent read. Once you start it, you won't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This book was a gift from my Mom and I've read it over and over throughout the years when I need to remind myself not to take life too seriously (Why should I?

I believe this is the easiest to understand book on any aspect of chess theory I have ever read.To get the most out of this book I highly recommend playing through the positions against a strong chess engine (Fritz, for example).

I found the book to be very insightful. One the most important parts I found was that it pointed out that the way a person sees love now, and the behaviors s/he accepts as being part of love are what s/he received as a young child when asking for love. It gave me some insight into the connections I have had between love and rejection, and also offered effective methods to release this.

The author admits in the book that it is wordy and repeats itself quite a bit and he defends that quite a bit in the first pages of the book. That didn't make it any less boring for me. He claims that in order for stuff to sink in to the subconscious that it has to be repeated. Well, I'm not a toddler and I was bored to tears. This book is New Age to the 10th degree.

Michael Brown,through his own healing process, takes the \\"Presence\\" material several steps further. You can't simply tell yourself to be present over and over and expect results. If it was that simple then the whole world would be functioning from higher levels of awareness. Michael Brown manages to move us beyond our distorted perceptions so that we can see clearly what causes so much discomfort in our lives AND he shows how to stop this self-defeating cycle. If you're looking for a quick fix, this isn't it but if you're serious about transforming your entire life, start nourishing yourself with this food for the SOUL. Like a gourmet meal,this book is meant to be assimilated slowly. If you want fast food, you won't be able to digest this.Ripley."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to really change themselves and their life dramatically.

The lead singer, John Grant is his name I believe, completely blew me away with his full sounding baritone and the backing music fit from his band fit him perfectly. The music is very relaxing, but never boring, with interesting electronic textures and harmonies coming in and out of the mix quite frequently.

His first album \\"Windows\\" was fresh and clearly rooted in the Deep Forest tradition - Hieroglyphes is nothing like it. It's a quite unmelodic jazz album which seems to have been put together fastly in the studio, almost like a jam session with Sanchez on his usual keyboard sound that becomes very tiresome after some time. Very few of the Deep Forest trademarks are present here, like the great melodies, terrific harmonies and modern rhythms. A great example of Sanchez/DF at their best is track one on the \\"Pacifique\\" soundtrack which shows that they still can make wonderful melodies that goes straight into your ear and stays there. \\"Hieroglyphes\\" hasn't got any of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"When I was a young business reporter and churning out an assignment I cared nothing about, the result was a lot like this book. Without discernable structure, random organization, quotes dropped in with no context. Just a big, inchoate mass of text. It's ironic that Kessler should appear so indifferent to his product, because it's actually hagiography for George Tenet, and one would presume he'd put a bit more craft into it. (Not that I have anything against Tenet, who's probably the best DCI since, well, Donovan.) If you're doing research on The Company there are a few facts you can pull out, and his sniping at Robert Baer is kind of useful as a balance to the overwrought book See No Evil. (for it's faults See No Evil was at least coherent, informative and enjoyable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"This book is amazingly shallow, even among its genre of 'instant histories' focusing on the newly energized interest in the CIA post 11 September. More a hagiography of George Tenet than a serious analysis, the author seems to take virtually everything he is told by Tenet and his supporters at face value. What might be worse is that the bulk of the book is filled with a pastiche of rather pointless -- and poorly organized -- historical anecdotes that have nothing to do with the book's purported theme. Readers with an interest in how the CIA actually works and its history should go somewhere else than this book. Even material on the CIA's website itself typically is more nuanced than the treatment here."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA at War reviewed","review":"The book was recommended by a high school colleague who worked for the CIA.

This book is very poorly done. There are many other books far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kessler's Dream World","review":"Beginning with a rather flat and boring history of the CIA, mainly recycled, sometimes word for word, from his own previous work, Kessler segues into a blindly adoring hymn to Tenet and Bush. Tenet may well be a good leader, a good manager, and the right man to regain the Company's credibility on the Hill, or (or \\"and\\") he may be a shameless smoozer,and trimmer. How can we tell, when Kessler presents only the good and cavalierly dismisses the bad ? This book is infuriating, a shining example of one-sided partisan propaganda, and a waste of good paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"CIA at War","review":"Detailed look at the workings of the Agency and the influence of its Directors on work and morale; however, the author presented an uncritically positive characterization of Tenet and an equally rosy portrayal of President Bush's handling of foreign affairs. The author ignores lingering questions and concerns (e.g. where are the weapons of mass destruction, statements by the Administration linking Hussein and al Qaeda), frequently uses partisan language and soundbites to describe President Clinton, and, overall, comes off as an apologist for the current Bush Administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush apologist","review":"This book had some interesting background info on the CIA. Unfortunately, all but the last few chapters are nearly identical to \\"Inside the CIA,\\" a book the Kessler wrote 11 years earlier. \\"The CIA at War\\" lack a central narrative--it's filled with short choppy paragraphs. It's is a sometimes-interesting information dump. In the final chapters, Kessler defends the necessity of the invasion of Iraq and the Bush administration. I lost all faith in the book after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This reads like a book rushed into print not long after war in Iraq was declared officially over by the President. As noted by others here, much of it is pastiche history of the agency seemingly slapped together rather haphazardly. The rest of it is a genuflection to Georges Tenet and Bush. What caught my eye is that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are a given in the author's view up until second to last chapter, where their absence is dismissed rather cavalierly."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much as I wanted to like it...","review":"The above reviewer had it right with the terrible production-this is more like live in studio or demo recordings than a finished recording, and the drum machine is really awful. As a big fan of JB--especially the early stuff--I hoped for some of the same clever wordplay and funny concepts of the early work (like A Scandal in Bohemia or the great stuff collected on Draining the Glass). Aside from a couple high points this really doesn't live up to that standard. Also, as the earlier reviewer mentioned, JB sounds liquored up on a few of the tracks to the detriment of the vocals--this used to be a good joke, now it's kind of sad. Good for them for getting together again and best of luck to them in putting out another record together, but I'd recommend passing on this and getting some of the classics or waiting for a full-fledged effort complete with professional prodcution."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY THIS!","review":"NEVER BUY THIS, THER WORST QUALITY EVER FOR A BLU-REY.

To top it all off, the author provides margin notes throughout with 'Take Advantage' hints and contact information of key agencies and offices, which in itself helps cut down the red tape.

For those not currently serving, I found it lackluster and loaded with information any military man could find on base with little trouble. Would I recommend this book? Not really.

I say it would be \\"equally useless\\" because I saw nothing in the book that I (or any of my shipmates) wouldn't already know. There is zero \\"inside information\\" that the average enlisted person would not be privy to.The only utility I can envision for this book would be as a use for someone considering joining the military.

Examples on how to solve are given for each type of problems, but this book does not have enough practice questions. On average it has about 3 to 6 problems for different type of problems. For teaching someone who has never taken algebra, the best method to learn, imho, is to work many problems as possible. But having 3 to 6 questions, isn't enough to drill in the techniques for young students. This book might work for people who only needs a refresher. Other problem I felt with this book is that it did not address much in the basics, such as x square + x cube type problems. (X^2 + X^3 = X^5)Previously, I taught my daughter with Key to Algebra series. It worked out really well for her.

So I do recommend this book if you are, like me, a programmer that came from another field into programming through ColdFusion and want something that gets into a little more than just connecting to a database and spitting out some data.

The people who are Patriots are yelling obscene things at the Tories, burning down their houses, even mocking them in church while the service is going on.

It holds up well through moves, and it did it's job in holding CDs. Unfortunately, there are too many problems with this CD rack to justify any price point above $15:1) It stands well on bare floors or very short carpet, but if you have medium carpets, this thing will tip over as soon as you touch it.2) If you attempt to move it, it's very easy for the metal portion to become detached from the base plate. You have to either slide it across the floor using your foot to \\"kick-slide\\" it, or waddle it to your new location. Or you can take it off the base plate and move it separately.3) Since there are sections that hold several CDs, if you attempt to take the bottom CD out of a section, you have to hold the rest of the CDs in place, as they'll also fall out due to gravity/friction. If you have this CD rack sitting on medium-thick carpet, this also causes the entire rack to tip over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Difficult to Assemble","review":"This product was impossible for me to assemble and I ended up throwing it in the trash.The connections are the kind where you need brute upper body strength to fit them together, and I'm not that strong.A frustrating experience, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I was not able to put this item together.

This recording edges out several by Sviatoslav Richter as the finest performance on record of Prokofiev's epic 6th Sonata. Pogorelich brings amazing excitement to the unique simultaneously-A-major-and-minor first movement, and great delicacy to the quiet passages throughout. The rush to the conclusion of the 4th movement rondo is like rushing water. This, along with the 5th Symphony, War and Peace, and the 8th sonata, may be Prokofiev's finest work, and deserves to be much better known. Pogorelich's Ravel is nearly as well done. I agree with Argerich's famous evaluation of this pianist: \\"a genius!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky brilliance","review":"I'll grant that the interpretations on this album aren't standard fare. It is even deeply eccentric. But this is fantastic stuff.The Gaspard is in a league of its own. It is not that the interpretation is much better than others available - such as Argerich, Franois or Michelangeli - but the interpretations are otherworldly. I think this is the Scarbo which is most likely to give you nightmares (appropriate, given the nature of the piece).The Prokofiev is very ably played, although I can't compare it to any other recordings. As for the Chopin, it is a deeply satisfying, if somewhat odd, interpretation. The liner notes even acknowledge that Pogorelich ignores some of the dynamics marked by Chopin."},{"rating":"2","title":"MA","review":"Best price I could find for this primary O2 sensor anywhere.

Not a big deal for my uses, but it can get annoying sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works For Me","review":"This inexpensive mouse pad works well. I have not had any issues with it. Would I buy it again? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious!","review":"This DVD is a total waste of money. The background music will drive you crazy -- and obscure the interviews -- and the woman doing voice-over sounds as if she failed remedial reading. She says \\"transcendent\\" for transcendental meditation, and believes that the musician Jeff Lynne is Jeff Line. This is just a money-grabbing exercise with a hodge-podge of old British TV footage, three-quarters of which doesn't show George at all. No wonder it says \\"unauthorized\\" on the cover. Olivia must be losing her mind over exploitational material like this! PS. The system makes me give it a star -- it isn't worthy of one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is an exploitation film at its worst. Seventy percent of it is a news story from British TV about George's interest in movies. And the rest seems to be from public sources also.There is very little about other aspects of George's life. The production values are horrible: volume goes up and down; they show the same 10 second clip of George walking to a court hearing three times over, the main narrator ( who is shown in these horrible eyebrow to chin closeups) is not even identified until the rolling credits at the end. I was lucky. I bought it locally and was allowed to return it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre DVD","review":"This DVD is not worth having. I watched it once and that was it. It now is at the Goodwill store. I think George Harrison is a genius too. He is the Beatle that is usually not given enough credit. And we'd like to know more about him. This DVD however doesn't do a good job. For those that truly enjoy George Harrison your money will be much better spent on \\"A Concert for George\\" DVD and CD or the last album George Harrison put out \\"Brainwashed\\". These are brilliant! And you'll enjoy them again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incongruous","review":"There are a few interesting segments of this DVD. The material comes from British sources.

BUT, the producers have added a guitar based backing track that is irritating beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!!","review":"Awful!!!It is a shame that it is available at all ....it is not worth a dime...It focuses on a very narrow aspect of Georges life.Poor image,poor contents.Don't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was given this DVD and I was VERY disappointed after watching it! There was NOTHING new, the narration was inaccurate, and it showed stock footage from other sources that I've already seen several times before."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be joking","review":"I found it impossible to take this book seriously. The reasoning is off the wall, lines of thought are often impossible to follow, and he basically just ends up in a big mess. I have seen Barre tout these ideas before, and he offers no backing for his outrageous ideas, he just says in effect, \\"That's the way it is because I say so.\\" His argumentative tone and personal attacks on anybody who disagrees with him have gotten him kicked off no less than 7 Internet email lists, by his own count, and this book continues that dubious tradition.The book is supposed to be a series of \\"essays,\\" but several of these \\"essays\\" are one sentence long. That's an essay? The blurb calls him a Bible scholar, but this book has as much in common with scholarship as a duck has with a bicycle. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. I tend to believe that the reason it's self-published is because no truly scholarly publisher would touch it with an eleven-foot pole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School house with a little twist","review":"This double mix is of old school house tunes. A few of thew are 15 years old now. So yes, to some this CD may sound cheesey or dated. But if taken for what it is, a collection of house songs flawlesly mixed back in 94, then you may truely enjoy it. It has a different energy than todays house music. And let's face it, Collins and Loria are masters at what they do. If you want house music, then give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great help in building a coaching practice","review":"\\"The New Private Practice\\" is a total overview of the coaching profession, with each chapter written by a different successful therapist-turned-coach. The book is divided into 4 sections: executive coaching, life coaching, peak performance coaching, and special niches. Each coach takes you behind the scenes into his or her business, telling the reader how to get started, what to charge, how to market for clients, what the coaching work is like on a day-to-day level. This is a unique look at what it takes to succeed as a coach today. This book is especially helpful in starting a coaching business. With an intro about the difference between therapy and coaching by Lynn Grodzki, who is an important voice in the field of business coaching. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Mighty Hercules -- with an explanation","review":"This CD is welcome for fanatics of early 60's kiddie ersatz, but apart from the art work and some track titles has very little to offer that fans of the Mighty Hercules cartoon show from Trans-Lux will remember. Those seeking some of the lushly orchestrated music used as underscoring should look to an out-of-print Intrada CD called Creature From The Black Lagoon, devoted to the music of Hans J. Salter. The horn-laden music underscoring the scenes in which Hercules put on his magic ring and held it up to the lightning, and the heroics that followed, were all lifted from the score of the 1955 movie The Black Shield of Falworth, co-written by Salter, a suite from which -- including the \\"Hercules\\" music -- is included on the \\"Creature From The Black Lagoon\\" CD from Intrada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herc should save us from the fakery!","review":"This is not the powerful and well orchestrated music of the 60's cartoon I watched on Sunday mornings. Who was allowed to put this hoowey out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"Original soundtrack from the Mighty Hercules cartoon? Not even close...what a disappointment! Fans of the popular children's cartoon will feel an urge to remove (destroy) this product as soon as they hear the opening track. If you're looking for the sweeping, powerful voice of Johnny Nash, or the full orchestration that practically defined this classic, look elsewhere. What you'll find here is a milquetoast, watered-down 40's genre mishmash that even Disney would discard. If you're a Lawrence Welk fan, then this is for you; otherwise, skip this one. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I'd listened to the clips first","review":"Can only blame myself. The audio clips and buyer reviews were all there but I leaped first. \\"Cast Recording\\"? Noooo way. This is some group re-singing the songs from the original show, but completely void of the familiar, if hokey and shrill, voices and sound effects of the cartoon. The artwork that shipped with this (seems I had to supply my own CD case) seems genuine enough. I recall that Golden Records did a lot of these cheap, brightly coloured plastic 45 RPM \\"homages\\" to TV shows back in the early 60's. I recall it because the feeling of disappointment when I played this CD was completely familiar. LISTEN TO THE AUDIO CLIPS *FIRST* and decide. It will help you avoid trying to summon the mighty Hercules to dispatch the goons who put this together. O-lympiaaaaaahhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats wrong with this picture?","review":"...That is such a rip off, like a lot of sony products. Also, it only holds 650 Megabytes, when most hold 700MB.

Overblown and excessive, without the spark that made STYX great from the beginning. The vocals are horrible. It shows that these guys will never amount to much without Dennis DeYoung.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain AWFUL","review":"I have every Styx CD, from \\"Styx I\\" to \\"Brave New World.\\" \\"BNW\\" will be the last in my collection until Dennis DeYoung is back in his band.This album is so awful that I returned it to the store.

I didn't expect much from STYNX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reo/Sticks","review":"First I have been a fan of both bands for a very long time.Reo-Why ???

Gowen is not bad but you cant replace dennis !!! FrankenYoung and Shawenstein should move on and stop using the name.This album was a total waste of plastic and should be recycled at once !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and Lovin' It","review":"This CD proves that classic rock bands still have what it takes to give a great concert. I love the music of Styx and think it's great that this isn't just a \\"Greatest Hits Live\\" CD, as it has the classics, as well as some new fan favorites. REO's CD is also very good, and I find myself liking this excellent band more and more each time I hear it. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect score, in my opinion, is the fact that the true mood of a rock concert will never be fully realized on a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid four-star CD....","review":"So I gave it five to counteract the army of one-star generals who can't get over it that Dennis is gone. People stand in line for these two bands because of the songs, and the best ones are all here - excellently performed and recorded. Many, like myself, will like Gowan's voice better than DeYoung's (I know, blasphemy) because it is less affected. And we'll probably all appreciate the jam tracks being on both CDs when we eventually settle down to playing one more than the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"STYX and REO rock, Especially STYX","review":"I saw Styx and Reo in the summer of 2000. They put on an amazing show and it shows on these 2 cd's. These 2 discs are a must for a fan of either band. Even though Styx does not have some original members, they still love to play live and put a fantastic show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx stynx without DeYoung","review":"If you want a REAL STYX live CD, then purchase Return to Paradise or Caught in The Act. They feature the real band with the real lead singer and the best Styx songs. This CD is like their live show without Dennis - pathetic. Styx wants to pretend that they never did a ballad and completely forget that part of their history. Well to many people, the ballad is what made STYX in the first place. Besides a awful version of Lady, there are no classic STYX ballads here. A weak effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARCH RIP-OFF!!!","review":"These bands have lost their minds if they think any person with half a brain is going to pay $25 to hear the same 2 songs played SIX times on this CD. UNBELIEVABLE that bands of this statute would have such contempt for their own fans that they would try to pull a stunt like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one worthless band but two","review":"I thought todays music was bad, with the likes of Brittney Spears, Christina Aguilera and such, now we get bombarded with the worst of the 80's. What's going on. Styx once again flaunts their overtly pretentious, overly produced, and in one word which sums it up Bad music. Why don't these \\"has beens\\" just go away. As for REO what can you say about them now that you couldn't 18 years ago. They were bad then and their even worse now. It's embarassing to see Kevin Cronin as a 50 year old up there on stage in his spandex pants belting out fluffy little tunes in his high helium filled voice. These 2 bands together make me think that I'm watching Spinal Tap again. The only difference is Spinal Tap's music is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dennis No Styx","review":"This does not cut it. Would you replace Mick Jagger, or Robert Plant? You cannot take the golden voice from this band and fake your way through it. Gowan sounds okay for his own music as no one can match the vocals of Dennis. Criminal Mind is the on;ly song that makes the grade. As for the rest of the band they sound okay but you can tell their is a magical part missing. An oaky cover band.. Save your money and buy Return to Paradise and listen to Dennis give an outstanding lesson on how to sound better as you get older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"As a general rule, I personally, don't like live recordings. There are a few that have made their way into my collection, and there they shall remain. This one, however, is one I did not care for at all. Too many songs are repeated, both Styx and REO. While both bands are fabulous, I don't want or need to hear Blue Collar Man done more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album!","review":"Although not their best live album (Caught In The Act wins the prize), this one rocks! REOs set is great, too. More polished than Styx 5.0, but less electrifying. The collaborations between the bands were cool. The only negatives: Gowan's voice, while a great match for Lady, isn't Grand Illusion material (too British sounding? Yes, I know he's Canadian . . .) and there was no need to have Blue Collar Man on the REO CD as it is on the STYX CD twice. I'm not slamming Gowan. He's a great addition to the band and a hell of a piano player and performer. The album was probably mixed a little heavy on the drums, but, hey, Todd is one of the best! Maybe they just wanted to show him off a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow directions","review":"I started using Dermablend foundation and concealer and couldn't figure out why it didn't last like they said it would - well, you have to buy this product to put over it to make it \\"seal\\".

Worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"set in powder","review":"This product is worth every cent. I have tried a few set in powders, but never had one with such great results.

I bought the setting powder but it never works. When I apply my concealer, I dab on a generous amount of setting powder and leave it on for 5-10 minutes before I dust it off but the concelaer still remains moist/wet and rubs off if I touch it or brush up against clothing etc. Perhaps I got a bad batch but it makes absolutely no difference to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dermablend Loose Setting Powder","review":"Dermablend Loose Setting Powder had a lot of good reviews. I just did not have a good experience with it. I bought two different colors and neither looked good. I did not really like the loose powder.

Cameras using regular batteries will cost you a fortune, and some only get 10-12 shots per set of batteries. This camera doesn't suffer from lack of power.2. The nightshot nightvision feature is fantastic. Taking shots in the dark are illuminating. :)3. The macro photography features make taking pictures very close a simple task.

We have been very happy with Sony products in the past and feel that they are worth the cost. After all the research on the internet and speaking with everyone I could find that knew anything about digital cameras, I decided on the Sony DCS-F707. It took some convincing of my husband because the price was certainly not in the budget! But after puchasing it however, I have had a tough time getting it out of my husbands hands. He loves it. It offers both automatic and manuel settings (for the more knowledgible).

The print quality has been poor despite using a great printer HP CP 1700 by Hewlett PACKARD and top of the line photopaper. I feel cheated. I get better pictures from my Kodak DC 290 camera which I bought 2yrs ago which only has 2.1 megapixels.

Standouts include the mellowed out jazz of Ultra Nate in \\"Twisted,\\" as well as Jody Watley's \\"Saturday Night Experience,\\" a welcome diversion from her dance pop of the 1980s.

I just didn't find myself thinking 'this is really true or this is really funny' as before.Since Scott Adams has been at home relying on Email from others for inspiration, his originality and insights into office life are very much less than before.

I sense that he's now using these books to simply vent and that he is going over material covered in other books. While I snorted and projectile laughed several times during the reading of this book, there were very LONG gaps between each mirthful episode.Mr. Adams writes well and is humorous.

Nick Hornby's \\"NippleJesus\\" is my favorite thing he has ever written, and Hornby is one of my favorite authors. Also good is a story by Colin Firth, an actor who really should write more often. The best story in the set is narrated by a cook in a prison's kitchen, who has the chore of preparing last meals for the condemned. But many of the rest are poor. The wonderful and brilliant Dave Eggers submits a gimmicky story narrated by a dog. It seems like he had the clever idea of such a story, but couldn't make it do anything but roll over and play dead. And Helen Fielding, who I'd never read before and don't plan to ever read again, submits a piece that proves why so many of my acquaintances find her irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of modern writers","review":"I picked up this book because I had read and liked Helen Fielding and Melissa Banks' novels.

I was pleasantly surprised when I liked it having geared myself up for disappointment. In The Department of Nothing he touchingly depicts a young boy's efforts to escape his everyday life by immersing himself in the make-believe world of his grandmother's stories. (Sexy Colin Firth is now Literary/Sexy Colin Firth) I don't read many short stories but I was caught up in this book. The variety of stories kept me quessing what was coming up next. I really liked them! I'll buy more copies as gifts for friends. They'll enjoy the book and the money will go for a good cause. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for a good cause","review":"I needed a book to read and happened to pick this up because of the cool cover. Once I looked it over I realized there were stories by Helen Fielding and Melissa Banks, other authors I have read and enjoyed. Further, due to having a lot going on right now and not being able to read as much as I'd like - I thought a book of short stories would be perfect. And it was! I could whip through a story when I had the time and if a couple weeks went by and I didn't pick the book up I didn't run the risk of falling out of step with a story. Most stories were funny, clever and intelligent reading. And I felt good that my proceeds went towards charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories for a worthy cause","review":"As a before-I-go-to-sleep type of reader, I love short story collections. What makes this one so special is that it is for a good cause.The best stories in here are from Mr. Hornby, Mr. Doyle and Mr. Firth, who gives us a completely new and hilarious use for the word \\"pants\\" that continues to make me chuckle. Between his story and his role in \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\", Mr. Firth is my new hero.Anyway, you won't be disappointed by this group of talented writers and there are a number interesting themes (art, growing old, relationships, first sexual encounters, mortality, flat-out humor)and perspectives (Mr. Eggers as a dog, Mr. Firth as an 11 year old, Mr. Hornby as a enormous bouncer, Mr. Doyle as a mid-forties/mid-life crises father) explored that are touching and hilarious. Enjoy."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-a264b263"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/50.md","filePath":"people/50.md"}'),W={name:"people/50.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
