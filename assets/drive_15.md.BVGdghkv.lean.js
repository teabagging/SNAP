It had powerful suction, and very convenient retractable wire. Trouble is it doesn't last. Maybe two months after buying it is stopped sucking in the dirt.

Worst $70 I ever spent. It honestly makes my floors look worse. It really does. It just blows the dirt out the back end. Do not waste your money on this vacuum. Please believe me. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to do this time. It picks up nothing.

We are returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back","review":"It is not fair for me to slam this vacuum, since I did not keep it for more than one day. There were several things I didn't like. The roller does not stop moving even when you are using the hose. I did not find it \\"pulling me around my house\\" like some people wrote in their reviews. I vacuumed an entire floor of my house and only a handful of dirt was sucked up. Either I got a lemon or it was crummy, so I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad vacuum","review":"I bought this vacuum a year ago, the belt already broke one time and now it can't keep the dust in the container. It looks like work fine, but it sucked at the front and blew out at the back, I checked all the part and all the hose was connected. I don't want to waste my time to use this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Red Lemon -- Where's the Suctions?","review":"I was very disappointed in this Hoover. My last vaccum was a hoover and I loved it because it was more powerful than this and lasted seven years.The suction is very light and I have to go over the entire room over and over to pick up light dust. After empting the vaccum, the suction became worse. I became so discussed that I just bought another vaccum with more power and now I am happy, however, I paid more -- so I guess you pay for what you get.I would not recommend this vaccum to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"quiet but not efficient","review":"We were trying to replace our old bagged hoover with this bagless model. The model looks cool, easy to assemble, and quiet. We were using it on the carpet and the results were far from satisfactory. Big dirt is picked up, but small dirt requires several runs on the same spot. A low-height setting will pull the carpet and make it difficult to move the vacuum cleaner. The old one which we wanted to throw away was doing a better job than this new one in swallowing small dirt particles, so we ended up returning this to the store. I am not sure if the model has less vacuum power or limited to just the piece I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this vacuum","review":"We bought the Hoover Deluxe Elite Rewind vacuum a little over a year ago. It seemed great at first but then things started to go wrong. It seemed to loses some suction a few months ago and then the suction for the hose became so bad it would barely even spin the brush, so of course wouldn't actually pick up anything from furniture. Then today it just died while I was in the middle of vacuuming. It just shut off and wouldn't turn on again right away. I tried again several minutes later and it re-started but we are now shopping around for a different vacuum. I had researched before buying this one and bought it because of it's great reviews but have not been pleased at all. I'm sorry I spent any money on it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Pickup","review":"One of the move powerful vacuums that I have had in the past and I love the rewind of the cord.

After 4 months the motor made a horrifying noise. I checked to make sure the belt was not broken and examined the vacuum for blockages. Everything looked shipshape. I contacted Hoover for service and even though I live in a major metropolitan area, the closest \\"authorized hoover repair\\" is an hour drive round trip. This was after contacting 2 other \\"authorized repair services who were no longer accepting residential repairs. I was also told I could ship it for repair but they would only pay one way for shipping. I am writing this review to spare potential purchasers the hard lesson that I learned. Moral of the story: Make sure you buy a vacuum where the warranty allows you to service the vacuum locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great until it broke!","review":"This was a great vacuum for the price, but all-of-a-sudden it stopped working :(I'm very disappointed considering it's only a year old!!

But in practice, unfortunately, it doesn't pan out - much of the dirt remains in the cup after emptying, trapped in the upper chamber by the filter. Just try to clean out the filter area without creating a mess. And after emptying, you can barely see into the cup area anymore, unless you wash it each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Hoover Product","review":"All facets of the Hoover Upright bagless vacuum met expectations.

It doesnt do it every time and overall i'd recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Elite Vacuum","review":"This vacuum is good. I like the floor/carpet option dial for cleaning because it lowers the vacuum head so that if you want to vacuum the bare floor it will pick up all the dirt. The on/off switch, lower the vacuum switch and the cord rewind switch are all accessible by foot, which is very nice. The only issue I do have with this vacuum is where the plug is located. I love the concept of having an automatic plug rewind; however, it is located towards the bottom of the vacuum that you have to make sure that you hold the cord up nhigh enough. If not, you will then constantly be vacuuming over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0 stars","review":"I hate this vacuum cleaner. After less than a year and a half, I'm throwing it away. There's a HEPA filter hidden inside the canister that clogs up and reduces the suction. It must be cleaned every couple of uses, which is a dusty, dirty 15-minute job. When you use the tools, the roller doesn't stop and it chews up the carpet it's on. The whole unit is flimsy and feels like it's going to fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum sucks (and not how it should!)","review":"I can't believe there are so many positive reviews on this vacuum. I have had a similar experience to others who disliked it--the vacuum worked fine for about six months, but now (1 1/2 yrs later) I spend more time doing maintenance on it than I do actually vacuuming! It has always been completely useless at picking anything up on wooden floors, it just spits everything back out. The carpets have been hit or miss--sometimes it does actually clean then, but mostly I'm left feeling like I haven't even vacuumed. When I contacted Hoover customer service, they were less than helpful, offering to send me a new belt (which I didn't need and also never arrived). I took it in for maintenance and was told that it was in perfect working order! So why are my floors still not clean? I wish I'd spent more money and bought a vacuum that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The retractable cord broke on the first use","review":"I followed the directions - I held the cord and guided it in while I steppeed on the retract button. The next time I tried to plug it in, the cord wouldnt stay out - it was off the track and kept retracting, making the vacuum unusable. There were stickers all over the box and brochure tht said to call Hoover if you have a problem and not to return the item. So, I called hoover - they said they would fix it, but not replace it. Well, I didnt spend $90 to get a vacuum that needed repair after the first use. Luckily, Amazon has better customer service than Hoover. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse vacuum","review":"I would give this vacuum zero stars if I could. I just spent 30 minutes to get the 5 screws out to change the belt that broke after only 2weeks of use. I'm frustrated with grease all over my hands from changing the belt.I returned my first one because the belt broke several times in a short period of time. I stupidly brought a second (thought the first was a lemon); I will be returning this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad deal","review":"I shopped around for the best vacuum deal and for the money, this is the best. It sucks. Which is a good thing. The only issue is you need to adjust the carpet level knob when going to a different length rug pile even if the change is small but this is easy enough to do. I like the fact that all switches and controls are foot operated (except the pile length knob), so there's not a lot of bending over. I read some reviews that complained about dust when emptying the hopper but that seems to be personal work habits. The trap door makes this easy and neat if you use some common sense. I paid $89 through Amazon and found the same machine at Target for &139. Now let's see if it lasts a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well... once","review":"I bought this vacuum at Sams Club, not Amazon, but wanted to share my frustration. The first time I used it it worked great-- sucked up all the substantial pet hair on the floor like magic. The canister is easy to empty and doesn't have a filter to clog like my previous Hoover. So far, so good. However, the next time I try to vacuum, I notice there is no suction... detaching the extension hose revealed that the hose was clogged. I wasn't too perturbed, cleaned it out, and kept vacuuming. I realize that this will happen occasionally with any vacuum, only since that day the hose has clogged EVERY TIME I VACUUM. That's right-- every single time. I have better things to do than clean the hair clots out of my vacuum all the time and decided to say goodbye to cheap vacuums (my previous cheapie Hoover burned out the motor after 6 months)... I just bought a Dyson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Negative Star Product Beware of Hoover products.","review":"This vacuum has to be made in China. I think Hoover is in China. I have NEVER broken a vacuum cleaner belt - I am 62. Now I have broken 3 since the beginning of April. I called Hoover at their 800# what a joke. (They never answered my email initially.) The first person I talked to attempted to send me to someone 20 miles from me - they would keep the vacuum - they had no belts either - I would have to go back. That would make 80 miles - the excuse was they had to make money. I guess warranty work doesn't make \\"money\\". Second call to the 800# I was told they would send me a belt (I've already bought 2 for $4.99) Well so far two weeks later there is no belt and stores have none either. To order from the order sheet it says parts take 4-6 weeks. This is not Amazon's problem, this is a Hoover quality problem - a \\"lack\\" of quality problem. Shame, shame, shame on HOOVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy this vacuum.","review":"I bought this vacuum a month ago and returned it today. At first I liked it for many of the reasons listed here, cord rewind, filter, good suction. But the reality is it spews dirt all over your house when you use the hose feature. I read the manual to ensure I was using the feature correctly, and still, spewing. Also, the hose is short which means you don't have a lot of range from the unit and you end up bending over most of the time. The vacuum does not work on hard floors as it just \\"pushes\\" the dirt. The profile of the vacuum makes it hard to get under furniture. And, it's not self propelled so one really has to push. I found using this vacuum a tug-o-war and a work out, and not in a good way. I have no problem exerting myself but this vacuum would have been a problem for my mother with a bad back. I'd rather get my workouts at the beach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"The belts break easily. Also after a while the thing just stopped working.

I wasted hours trying to get the thing to work again & finally just threw it in the garbage. It happened suddenly w/o warning. Now I'm looking for a new vacuum, but it seems like every other vacuum on Amazon has a lot of bad reviews too with people claiming their new vacuums died on them also.

I use the vacuum twice a month on two area rugs, and that has been probable why they always lasted so long. When i received this vacuum the first time around had to return it because it did not work. This should've been enough warning not to get the same item again, but i was sold on the vacuum being bagless, the power, the retractable cord etc.,etc,etc.Well, one year and two days after the warranty expired it died, so it figures i used it about 24 times. I went online and followed all cleaning instructions, checking for any obstructions and still will not work. Tried to contact a Hoover service center, and was told that i had to bring the unit to their place and pay for any repairs (something between $25-$100)!!!!Bottom line, i threw it in the garbage and went back to the bagged machines again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Instead of Better","review":"I ordered this from Amazon based on the good reviews and free shipping, but I've now boxed it back up to return it because it is junk.

My rug was dirtier after vacuuming than before, and when I turned it off, a pile of sand was left where it stood.Lesson learned: even if it costs a bit more, always buy something this big and heavy at a store, so you can return it if it's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"Purchased this a couple of months ago, first few times I used, the belt came off. Took bottom plate off and put belt back on. Used several more times, and each time the belt came off.

They also were going to send me replacement belts, since the belt slipping off all the time was going to cause it to wear out faster. 2 months later and still don't have the replacement belts. Called customer service again and asked what the next option was, explained I wasn't happy with this and was tired of not being able to make it through one room without the belt coming off 3 times.

First impressions are that it is built well, has good performance, and has an ergonomic design. Bagless portion of operation is great. Besides getting to have a visual assessment of all the dust and dirt you vacuum up, its extremely simple to empty the dirt cannister. I love a product where I don't need to read the instructions, and this product definitely falls in to that category --- all aspects of the vacuum's operations are intuitive. My only disappointment with this unit is that its a bit heavier than I would have expected and as such can be a bit difficult to maneuver ... especially in dense pile carpets. On the whole, good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good....","review":"Vacuum seems to be working fine so far, only had it for a month...

Dealing with Hoover's customer service was an absolute nightmare. They never sent me an email response when I submitted a request through their online form.

Also it has a tendency to grab cables which happen to be nearby.2) it's insanely noisy. If you live in a condo, all your neighbors will enjoy the sound.3) it's suction power is fairly weak4) if you need to reach high above cabinets and fridge to vacuum the dust, this vacuum cleaner is not the tool5) the power cord constantly gets under the vacuum brush; you have to hold it in your hand to avoid this.

I had read great reviews before buying this vacuum cleaner and when I brought it home I initially loved it. However, it has been 8 months now and it is broken. The suction is hit and miss. Most of the time, the vacuum shoots out dust and pet hair instead of sucking it up. I have already replaced the belt once and taken it apart multiple times to fix the suction to no avail. I would never recommend this vacuum to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good choice for pet owners","review":"I bought this one year ago and it seems to have been nothing but trouble. Broken belt, blocked hose, now not working at all. This would probably be okay for light duty, but it is not a good choice if you own a long haired dog/cat as the hair fills the bag quickly, blocks the hose etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore out fast!","review":"This vacuum was great for the first 6 months or so but after only 2 years I need a new vacuum! The carpet hieght adjuster is stripped so it is stuck on high carpet. You have to empty and clean the filter after every use and still just blows dirt around. I would have expected this vacuum to last me longer then 2 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I, like most other reviewers thought it worked great for the first week or so. Then the constant clogging began. The tubes are not designed well enough to allow the dirt and dust to get to the canister. I have to take this thing apart about once a week to unclog it. In doing so, I have snapped off a few of the cheap, flimsy pieces of plastic inside. The belt broke within a month also. This is the cheapest, worst designed vacuum I've ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewind only good quality","review":"I'm actually glad to see that this vacuum is unavailable--they should stop selling it. The only good feature is the automatic rewinding cord, which works flawlessly. Otherwise it's clunky to use, difficult to replace the cannister and hard to find the button to turn it on when you are standing over it. Ours finally died today after two years and I'm thrilled to be able to replace it with something more functional. I've truly hated this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Not Go Wrong with a Hoover","review":"The suction is quite powerful, handle very nicely, perfect for someone my size (5'2\\"). I wish the electrical cord was a bit longer. I am very happy with my Hoover (the previous vacuum had been a Dyson). It would've been nice if the vacuum had arrived sooner than the 13 days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!!","review":"I was amazed at the power of this vacuum. Upon receipt,i tried it out on what I thought were our clean carpets. I was (unpleasantly) surprised at the amount of dirt that this machine pulled up.Great price, great product!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth","review":"I am a person who trust the user reviews and blindly buy the product if it has good reviews. But that turned wrong on this product. I wonder how people gave 5 star rating for this product. It doesn't solve the purpose at all. The motor is so weak. You can hear its struggle as you move it. And obviously the suction force is very feeble. The only pros is the auto-rewind feature, which is really good. I had an Eureka prior to this, which was very powerful with self-propulsion, and a knob to switch between hose and floor. It is better to have both separate so the suction power would be great. It wasn't expensive either, I don't remember the price but it was almost close to this hoover's price. I wish I bought the Eureka again. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"It vacuumed well enough, but the cord retractor kept jamming and had to be taken apart. The little rotating brush attachment is activated only by suction and quickly gets fouled with hair. You can easily spend a half hour picking stuff out of it. We ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT...at first.","review":"I bought this vacuum at a local Costco after reading the reviews online. It was great--for a week until the belt broke after a dodgy incident with a throw rug that I'd rather not go into. I returned it and got another one and this one did an amazing job--for one and half months. Almost two months later the suction is poor, it spits back out dirt, and generally seems malevolent. We have two cats, one dog, one toddler, and one pregnant wife in this house and quite frankly I need more peace of mind in my household products."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to dust afterwards!","review":"I hate this vacuum...let me take a minute to vent. Because the extension hose is how the dirt gets into the canister when vacuuming, as soon as you take the extension hose out, dust flies everywhere. The vacuum itself is constantly covered in dust. And, the brush doesn't stop spinning when you're using the hose, so wherever the vacuum is sitting while you are using the hose is getting beat up by the constant spinning. It actually ripped through the upholstry of a chair when I had to prop the vacuum up to reach to the top of my drapes with the hose. Which leads me to the short hose. You can't reach anywhere high.I really do hate this vacuum. It is by far the worst performing vacuum I have ever had. It's full of commonsense problems! Come on Hoover, you can do better.I think I spend more time cleaning up after this vacuum than I actually do vacuuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"This is by far the worst vaccuum I've ever owned! It picks up no dirt -- just pushes it around. If you have a dog, don't even consider this vaccuum. It takes me about eight sweeps over the same section just to pick up all of the dirt. Instead of three minutes to clean a small room, it takes nearly 20. Two months after I bought this vacuum, the belt broke. Four months later, the vaccuum completely died. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price for a great item","review":"We needed a new vacuum so we were searching on the internet when we came upon this vacuum, first I thought it would be cheap, but it was a hoover, plus our old vacuum was a windtunnel thats back wheel broke off , it was 12 years old and worked fine other than that. well we got it real fast and it was easy to put together, I started to vacuum my bedroom and couldnt believe the dirt and dust this thing was sucking up, I had to dump out the container after I vacuumed this one room! Then I went on to the next room ,a 5x9 wool rug this was also dirty beyond my believe It got rid of the loose pile and made the rug look new again! every rug I did looked new again! I would recommend this vacuum , also the accessories work great. So for the price this isnt bad!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Vacuum","review":"I love this vacuum cleaner.

It's going in the trash...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaccums ok, nice and wide, died of lack of suction, spits things everywhere","review":"This started having no suction 5 days before the warranty ran out - lucky me! So I rushed to a service center (30 min drive), then the guy says that it wouldn't be covered under warranty because its probably because there is a clog somewhere. And it would cost $90 to fix - more than a new one!He said all bagless vacs will die of lack of suction after not too long.Oh well, I did my part to try and save it from a landfill...Anyways, this did a great job on carpet while it lasted. Hardwood floors it would just shoot the dust and rocks behind it. On carpeted stairs I could feel it shooting the rocks on my feet, and would always have to sweep the entryway after vaccuming the stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"***READ THIS BEFORE BUYING***","review":"This vacuum is the worst product I have ever seen. After only a week of use I started having problems with the power switch. Then another week it kept burning up belts. The brush cylinder finally worrelled out the plastic at one end and is shot. Three weeks it lasted. I will never by another Hoover vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum Cleaner ever!","review":"This is the worst product I have ever used. It doesn't pick up anything.

This product is one of if not the worst vacuum I've ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOVER","review":"Have used the Hoover Elite Rewind 3 times and it works fine so far. Strong pickup and beats the rug well. What I particularly like is the weight which if I recall was 15.5 lbs. Much lighter than my last Bissell vacuum and that makes it much easier to clean the stairs. I have tried many other methods to clean the carpeted stairs including the extension beater which hooks onto your hose but lets face it, nothing can clean as well as the vacuum itself if you can get it to each step and this Hoover is light enough to do so. I also like the fact that you do not need to replace filters which can be costly as my last Bissell vacuum needed. The cord does properly rewind easily. So far so good.Update to review. Used the unit for 3 years without any problems. Cleans well. Now my son is using it in his home and it's still working well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum does a great job but lacks any extras","review":"We have been amazed at the power of the Hoover Elite. It actually has more sucking power than the Dyson we had for 8 years prior to this one. However, we miss all of the \\"extras\\" we had become accustomed to with our Dyson. The cord is much shorter so it requires plugging in to two to three outlets before the job is finished, the hose for cleaning upholstery is also short so it is harder to reach items high up, the handle of the vacuum is shorter than we were used to so for taller people it is a little uncomfortable and although it has an allergen filter, it seems to kick up a lot of dust while vacuuming. Overall, it does the job well but it's a Camry, not a Cadillac."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clean Sweep","review":"It was amazing what this vacuum picked up. It's a little heavy but does a heck of job.There should be a place for the cord to rest while in use; I carry it in my left hand otherwise it gets caught under the vacuum.Just one feature that's a little short and that's the hose and attachment. They could be a lot longer for clearing away those ceiling cobwebs. I prefer the vacuum to a dust mop.However for the price, it's a real good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good, but I have had vacuums that with use loose suction. Time will tell with this model.","review":"So far, good suction. Broken belt the first 10 minutes, but probably faulty belt. The company sent me a replacement upon my phone call. Finding belts locally was difficult. I had to order some on line to keep on hand. I've had one hose plug-up from the great suction, but hose couldn't handle the deluge. It was easy, though, to unplug. Replacement of the belt was typically the same as all machines. I LOVE the way the bagless canister opens. My others were very messy. This one I just insert in garbage can and let her go. Virtually no raised dust from the dump. Overall, so far I'm pleased with the product. For how long, time will tell, as with all other's I've had in the past, all from various manufacturers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing totally sucks!!!","review":"The bright red plastic screams \\"pick up your #^&*$ feet! I'm trying to clean up you filthy monkey!\\" And it's the easiest 'no bag' vacuum I've ever used. I have a lot of hardwood floor and this vacuum works great on the hardwood, which was my first concern. Very sturdy and lightweight. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a vacuum cleaner!","review":"Great vacuum cleaner for the price. No expensive filters to buy, along with the pain of changing the filters. It cleans the carpet and wood flooring without spending $400 for a different brand (e.g. Dyson)."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I wanted","review":"I am very happy with this vacuum as it does everything I need it to. I have owned a Rainbow vac for 10 years, which still works like new, but it is burdensome to assemble with all its parts when I just need to clean a small area, so this Hoover just plugs in and off it goes. It was easy to put together right out of the box and I like the weight and cleaning power. It is not overly noisy. All in all, I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a vacuum that is inexpensive, but practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"REDy Steady Clean","review":"HEPA filter and auto chord rewind features are nice.

I have used it for the first time and with instruction book open. Despite emptying the bag, cleaning the filter, checking hose connection, etc., I cannot get the restricted yellow air flow indicator to go away. The only step left, according to the instruction booklet, is to disassemble the bottom and remove the agitator. This is too complicated for me--and should not be necessary the first time the product is used. It is also hard to \\"realign arrows\\" (there is only 1) and replace the filter cap. This feels cheap and probably will break fairly soon. Hoover wants me to spend on a toll call to speak to someone. This is the first time I have gotten a larger appliance through Amazon and I doubt if I can really repack it. The nearest Hoover Service Center is far away. This is one time I regret not going to a local store--I could then dump it and ask for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum, love the retractable cord!","review":"Love this bagless vacuum, love the retractable cord.

Fortunately, the vac isnt noisy and has excellent suction (of course, it has been only 2-3 months). While incredibly simple to \\"assemble\\", manuverability is not exactly its claim-to-fame. The attachments are the standard ware you'd find in any entry-level vac and they do their job. The product itself seems sturdy, until you inspect the dustbin. Each time you push the lever to get the collected dirt out, I feel as if the whole unit will fall off. Very flimsy support structures for the dustbin; best to be careful while unloading the dirt. The auto-rewind is an excellent feature (and spares me some \\"Why cant you store the vac properly on the rare times you help out?\\" speech,no, conversation). Overall, an excellent value for a sub-100$ vac. Will need to see how long it maintains its current performance, or if it is just flattering to deceive...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"Great Vacuum.

Then the suction kept getting worse and worse until finally after only FOUR months of owing this product it wont suck at all. I went in and cleaned everything out and made sure that there was no blockages etc but it still won't pick up.After struggling with this for a while my wife was talking to one of her friends who also purchased this vacuum. She also had the same problem. Their version worked for eight or nine months before it finally stoped working.It's horrible having a product stop working after you've disposed of the receipt, the box and the warranty information.I'll never buy another Hoover product again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vac but..","review":"I liked the vacuum cleaner when it arrived.

Now I can't return it to Amazon and Hoover doesn't cover the belt under warranty.I now tend to agree with the other reviews that say that it is poorly built and the customer service is poor as well.update: I bought a $5 belt and put it in and it seems to be working fine now.

My wife ordered the second one based on the first one. So we have actually two of these Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless vaccums at our house(one for each floor). Both units broke belt once within 6 months of use. No biggie. I took out 5 screws at bottom of each unit and replace belt for each unit. Now one of unit develop the suction issue. It simply won't pick up any thing anymore. I finally realized after took it apart that there is a filter inside of canister that is completely clogged up. I don't think it is washable. I will need to replace the filter for each unit. Folks. You save money on bags but this one will get you on the filters (around $5 each) and probably last you 6 months of less. I have hardwood floors/tiles at my house. I have no pet but 3 kids. I suggest look else where for a good vaccum."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"Within a week, it needed to be taken apart because the hoses were clogged.

It sucks up hairs and dust amazingly well. But it spits about 10% of it back out. The vacuum is covered with a light film of dust after using it. It doesn't pick up things larger than dust very well. It picks up pine needles and spews half of them back out.Other than being heavy and having a shorter cord than I'd like the other features are great - emptying it is a breeze.

I was impressed when my ceiling fan gathered so much dust that dust bunnies started sprinkling down one afternoon. I attached the attachment rod and went at each blade.

However, this Hoover is the worst one I have ever owned, Yes, it is powerful, but it is also very heavy and hard to push around. The canister that replaces a bag often gets plugged at the top and must be cleaned manually. Because of the power, the roller brush is very hard to direct on carpeting and it will not clean against the nap of a rug. The hook that holds the cord off the floor is not strong enough so the cord is constantly falling under the unit, and the accessories regularly fall off the handle during vacuuming. And, when it is time to clean the paper filter inside the canister, the job is very messy. I had an Oreck before purchasing this unit and now miss it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with long-haired pets","review":"This vacuum has lost of great features, but I was disappointed to discover that it's not good for people with long-haired pets.

We tried to find a replacement screw but were unsuccessful. Then it just up and stopped working in the middle of cleaning the other day. It wouldn't turn on. We've had it much less than a year. Complete bummer. I don't recommend.We give two stars for extra long hose, a good effort on suction(the noise makes you \\"feel\\" like you're driving a mustang when your suction is a pinto) and retractable cord nifty add-on thingie ---what can I say I like the sparklies ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the box it's shipped in for carpets","review":"This thing is completely useless on carpets.

Having a Border Collie and a three year old there is always dirt to pick up and this vacuum works wonderfully. It's light weight and easy to use. I especially like the separate tool used for upholstery,it has it's own rotating brush. The only downfall I see is that the retractable cord is not long enough. I find myself having to switch outlets many more times than I ever had to before.

While it goes deep enough to satisfy your intellectual appetite, it really is more focused on giving you a resource for teaching and preaching, rather than giving you ammunition for your next doctoral thesis. In other words, it is highly practical and written for the average reader. This does not mean that serious students have nothing to gain from it. Far from it. But the goal of most students is to eventually be able to better share their faith with others and this commentary could be a very useful tool in that respect.Before many sections of the book there is a \\"Preaching Focus\\", and what would normally be called exegetical notes are called \\"Notes for Preaching and Teaching.\\" There are introductions to important sections and there are also helpful notes at the end of several sections.

One man has a vision of turning the town into a tourist destination by creating a \\"Little Hawaii\\". The central plot revolves around a group of girls that decide to become the resort's \\"Hula Girls\\". It is a sweet, touching story that is reminiscent of many other movies with similar themes (\\"Full Monty\\", etc). The translation did seem a bit rough. It seems as though they may have been trying to create a tone by using slang but it did not read well for me. The movie overcame the inferior subtitles. The movie won Japan's version of the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kleenex recommended","review":"I rented this movie and will now buy it for my collection. It's listed as a comedy but it is anything but that. It's more of a tear jecker drama which is why I recommend having tissue handy since it is the true story of a group of poor school girls who face an uncertain economic future and decide to join an Hawaiian dance troupe managed by an out of town (and out of place) ex-dancer. Most of the movie covers a myriad of problems the girls must overcome to even put on the first show. However the ending is spectacular and worth watching. I highly suspect Hollywood will re-make this into an English version as was done with Masayuki Suo's \\"Shall We Dance?\\". Might as well get a head start and watch the original Japanese version now, plus Yu Aoi is beautiful to see, especially once she dresses up as the Hula troupe lead dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worth while movie, even if it is a bit of a \\"chick flick\\"","review":"I ordered this movie because I'm a fan of Jake's music (the guy who did the musical score). However I found the movie to be worth while. The story line is roughly based on a true story, and it is more understandable if you know a little of Japanese culture.In my humble opinion this was not a movie about dancing the \\"Hula\\". Being a guy, I like seeing pretty girls dance the hula, however I think it would have been a boring film if it was just about group of girls learning to dance. The story is more about a town (and in particular) a group of young ladies struggling with the changes that were being forced upon them. Change is not easy, and this movie is about the struggle, not the dance. But never fear, towards the end of the movie you will see some nice Hula dancing. I give it a \\"thumbs up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it!!! but the language is in japanese...","review":"The movie is superb! I loved it, but only drawback is that the voices are in japanese!!!!! I wanted to see the movie in english not in japanese with subtitles in english!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming","review":"This movie is in the tradition of The Full Monty, Calendar Girls, Billy Elliot- and it's worthy of the same acclaim all of those received.Set in a Japanese coal-mining town, Hula Girls recounts the story of several women who try to find a life outside the mining industry by becoming professional hula dancers.The story itself is the same coming-of-age, underdog-beating-the-odds plot that has been recounted time and again in movies. Even so, I think it's a really good one to watch on a dreary day when you're feeling self-pitying and have a huge tub of popcorn in front of you. It has a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and a lot of well-choreographed hula dancing.While I don't think I would purchase this DVD (as I don't know how many times I'd actually watch the movie), I think it's a great one to rent, and it comes loaded with a lot of extra information about hula dancing and the true story that inspired the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Motivational Writer's of our Time.","review":"Short , sweet, and to the point.\\"Developing Winner's Habits\\", is a live summary of the ideals Denis Waitley has been preaching from the beginning. If you are a first time listener to Denis Waitley, I would, however, recommend listening or reading \\"Being the Best\\", \\"The Psychology of Winning\\" first. You won't get some of the inside analogies, and the points he makes will go by too quickly.Otherwise, It is refreshing to hear him speak before a live audience to confirm that people have the same reaction to him that I have. Dennis Waitley - probably one of the greatest and thoughtful motivational speakers and writers of our time, with credentials to match - illustrates his points quickly, humorously, and aptly. This cassette sums up beautifully his major thesis: winning is attitude not altitude, and it's sparseness on commentary gives it a raw fresh one-on-one approach.

Paragraph one talks about the great news of the the 13th amendment ending slavery in 1865. Paragraph 2 and 3 talk about Dr. Carver being born in 1860 or '61, but it isn't clear that the narration has jump anti-chronologically here.I don't know what the target age is for this book.

I would just have another one handy so its not an initial disappointment if this does happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD","review":"NOT BAD..it is bright and alot bigger than i thought...(its the size of a mens basketball)....it turns but likes to stop or slow down some.... and doesnt work upsid down.....(but its not really meant to).... you can take it apart and adjust the gears yourself...overall it works well for what its designed to do....which is put cool bright disco lights all over your walls and ceiling...and is bright enough to light up a even a 30x30ft room nicely...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken, junky product","review":"It was cracked in 1/2 when it arrived. I'm surprised anyone gets it in one piece, junky product. I wouldn't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived inoperable","review":"Like a few reviewers I, too, had difficulties with the included bulb. I finally found a place that carried the bulb, screwed it in and eagerly turned on the machine to make sure it worked. The light came on in a pleasing glow then immediately popped into a cloud of smoke. When I unscrewed the bulb I noticed the socket was totally damaged. Could have saved myself a bulb had I double checked that first as the cause. Reordered a different model directly from Amazon. Hoping it arrives in time for daughter's slumber party Friday night. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I would not say too much...It is just disappointing...It is not only a bad product with low quality but it is too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"the main seam was separated","review":"after i recieved the product, the main seam was seperated on the ball, the little colored lenses were rattleing around inside the ball.. took some time to fish them out of the ball.... so yeah it was defenatly broken when i got it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Disappointed!!","review":"I read the reviews and decided to by this item anyway.... I recieved it with no instructions and no reciept inside of the box. I'm an online shopper and this stroke me as odd! Took the ball out of the box and set it on top shelf of my 20 monthe old baby's TV stand. I have cathedral ceilings so when I turned it on, I absolutely loved it its projection! However, when I returned to my baby's room in a couple of hours to check on him, I noticed the ball had stopped rotating!!!! I tried turning it off and then back on. It started rotating again but the rotation got slower by the second and shortly after, it stopped completely! It seems to me that the power generator isn't strong enough to rotate the big ball! I need a replacement and I hope the ball will be inspected before getting shipped out to me. If it wasn't for the defective malfunction, I'd give it 4.5 stars taking half a point away for the cheap quality of the item...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and small - you get what you pay for","review":"In agreement with a previous review. These spoons are reasonably sturdy, but are very small -- the picture is a bit deceiving. You get what you pay for, what can I say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waaaay over priced","review":"I buy this exact same product at my local grocery store for $2.50. That being said, I buy them because I like them. I am looking for something better though. The wood these spoons are made out of is pretty soft and sometimes hard to clean. One of them even broke on me the other day."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible value","review":"Ok, so I bought these just to get my order up so I could get free shipping. I wish I had picked something else. They feel cheap. And, I went to Wal-Mart and saw the same brand in a set of 4 for less than half the price. So disappointing. I would return them, but it's too late now. I recommend getting something else. These are not good quality utensils and you can get them cheaper elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly made, easy to use, but a bit pricey","review":"What can I say regarding these little clips? they work as intended and allow you to mount a cable in a situation, where plain grips with nails does not work (i.e. when you need to attach cable to a reinforced concrete wall, where nail simply won't go in).

I have been adding books to my library to help me in my job. I picked up Defending your Digital Assets and was pleasantly surprised. The sections on Security Verification of Systems and Networks and Cryptography were a rare read, and very enjoyable.I also found the chapter on Biometric Countermeasures one of the clearest presentations on the subject, that I have found in print.The authors clearly understand the INFOSEC field and their writing shows it. They make difficult concepts interesting. Too many books on this subject read like swiss cheese or with too much useless detail. Defending is the exception. I liked it. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too general","review":"This book does not live up to its title and subtitle. Very general material. For example, Denial of Service Attacks are in the news these days. Looking through the index, I find four references to DOS attacks. The first on page 45 tells me that DOS attacks can be costly. The second on page 85 describes some previous DOS attacks, including one that took place 12 years ago. The next reference is on page 304 and is a historical description of DOS attacks over the past three years. The last reference on page 452 tells me that I should conduct DOS testing for my web server. Most of the book's content is similar. If this is useful to you, please buy this book. For specific help in hardening your network, please look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop.","review":"I'm on page 91, and I don't think I'll finish this rambling babble.

These tapes have made the most incredible impact on my life.

I agree with other customers who said it started off well, but all of sudden there were so many U-turns and loops and twists that it seems as though the writers were still brainstorming what they wanted to do with all the information they had. It was poorly written and it takes away what probably could have been a journey worth reading. I think maybe Lula should have considered someone else to do her biography. Either these writers were inexperienced or had too many projects on their plates and just stuffed this one in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Jouney of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","review":"Interesting only to a point.

But if I will get it in a movie, I'll enjoy it all the more. This was truly a sensational tale of one of pop's legends and the unbelievable struggles of his dear mother, Lula Hardaway. It took me less than two days to read this because I couldn't put it down. I hope Love and Brown team again with perhaps a part II or another autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing,courageous,determined...AWE STRUCK","review":"Belinda Sampson,This has got to be one of the best books I have read about a child that grows into a woman with so much courage and determination in her character no matter what was put upon her shoulders. Mother to the famous Stevie Wonder or not, this woman is an inspiration within herself for all of the pain she has went through. The book speaks of a hard life, a hard childhood like that of Nightmares Echo-a memoir. It also reminds me of a couple of other books such as A Child Called It and Running With Scissors. I am just in utter amazement with this book. Pride shines in my eyes along ith the tears I shed while reading this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found Lins \\"juntos\\" really enjoyable.","review":"In writings about Elis Regina she said Lins was one of her favorite composers.

As a multimedia Bible, Compton's (now Zondervan) is probably the best moderate priced computer Bible on the market. Superlative and intuitive multimedia presentation combined with the very readable and accurate NIV Bible text plus commentary gives the average reader and excellent online Bible (sure is more fun than the standard book form)!

That, in itself, would not be terrible, but most of the selections were not well sung. I was very surprised. The reason I bought it was that I heard the song \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" on a dance show. I had never heard the song before, but I really liked it.

I would say it keeps gas from spilling out of the tank, but there's already a valve that keeps that from happening. Again, it's a GAS CAP. It screws on comfortably and is easy to screw off (hehe...I put 'screw off' in this). I would've given it four stars, but that fifth star is earned when it screws itself on and off and puts gas in the car for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"Replaced a broken fuel cap, works perfectly fine.

Got the cap quickly, but there was no packing slip or paperwork of any kind in the box. Put it on the Escape and it worked ok for a few miles. Then, the gas cap light came on and stayed on!

A pumping bassline, screeching vocals, and a wonderful break make this one a track to keep an eye on.

The Jaxx Nitedub makes the track less happy-go-lucky by stripping out the vocals except for a few select screams, while Erick Morillo & Harry Romero Dub goes a slightly cheesier route. Steve Gurley adds some broken beats to the mix with interesting results. The B-side, \\"Razocaine,\\" is a darker piece of work, all distorted bass, filtered horns, and modulated vocals, a nice counterpoint to the upbeat \\"Red Alert.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Alert (US Version)","review":"One of the best songs Basement Jaxx has made!

On both AM and FM, there was an extremely annoying \\"POP!\\" sound every five seconds. As a test for the problem, if you leave the AM antenna disconnected and turn up the volume, it's very obvious. When the AM and FM antennas are properly connected, you won't hear it so much on loud music, but during quieter passages the five second interval click is a real nuisance.The Sony support website Knowledge Article C399832 for \\"Popping or clicking noise when playing the radio\\" suggests unplugging the unit for a minute and then plugging it in again, but that didn't help. The suggestion in that case is \\"service may be required\\". I also called the Sony 800 number and spoke to a service rep who admitted that the unit needed repair.

I feel the need to express my gratitude to the author especially when I saw a review that is completely at odds with the other glowing reviews.

This one might not have the hype other Cisco books do, but it should. Just enough screen readout to illustrate what's going on.

However it was quite hard to learn from a book with such a confusing layout. During the first reading it is quite entertaining. But beware, if you have to lookup some forgotten facts. The index is poor and you have to skim through crazy cartoons and handwritten poorly organized notes. Frequently I gave up searching for some facts.

Later my spiritual path diverged and I ended up going more toward druidism. BUT I can say this abouthis books with no reservation. He is honest, considerate and (too) trusting of a teacher. He may not care whatothers say about him, but I say that all those who attack him and do not want you to read his books are falseprophets only concerned that people will call them liars if you read his books.This book tells a wonderful story of helaing and magick.

From ancient alchemy, to the crusades at the turn of the first century, witch-hunts during the 1400s to 1600s, tulip mania in 1624, and the Mississippi scheme and South Sea bubble of the 1700s, Mackay provides insights into human behavior which help explain the Great Crash of 1929, the Dot-Com bubble of the 1990s, and the recent global economic meltdown.\\"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\\", Charles Mackay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an example of a popular delusion...","review":"This was recommended by some famous people as a \\"must read\\" for serious investors. The people who rant and rave about how great this book is must have only read the inside jacket. There is 160 pages on the Alchymists alone, which like most of the book, could have been summed up in a third of the space.

Hmmmm - maybe there are more chapters to write?","review":"Keep this book within handy reach for any time that you're getting a bit too smart for your britches. How otherwise intelligent and rational folk get themselves into these troubles is truly fascinating and instructive. The writing here is, of course, rather archaic to modern sensibilities (originally published in 1841) but the stories are interesting and very readable. It's tempting to read the tales as history but when I see Goggle trading at over $400.00 I scratch my head and wonder. And when I hear the president cutting taxes, increasing spending, and still assuring me that my Social Security payments are secure, well, I think there might be a few chapters still waiting to be writing in the book.

And It's over 160 Years Old!","review":"Some fine reviews here, but my main point is how relevent this amazing book is even after 16-plus years! It's so well-written and current (up to the 1840's anyway), you could almost think it was written today! The tulip hysteria in 1640's Holland is so famous some recent novels have been written about it! But the 2 best parts are the Crusades, and the Witchhunting sections, both religious-based mass hysteria. In the author's introduction ,he states that religious hysteria and delusions are so numerous he can barely scratch the surface! And think what's happened since 1842! The book is a bit dense at times, but you'll be amazed at the mass delusions described, sometimes resulting in mass slaughter, notably in the \\"Crusades\\" chapter. But this book should be familiar to every educated person, and will always be a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"The content is interesting. However, the closely-spaced letters and lines in the typeface used for this book make it very tiring to read more than a page or two at a time.

Mackay's book consists of one anecdote after another...for more than 700 pages. It offers very little in the way of analysis and explanations. If you like that kind of book, this one is for you.I found this book boring and very overrated. I suggest that you skim a copy of this book before you buy it.

Mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. it is applicable to more current bubbles such as the Clinton DOT COM . The Housing bubble created by Messrs Franks and dodd.Other financial messes such as the power crisis caused by the state of California stepping in and forcing rules on the power pricing/Enron failure.More importantly, it is applicable to today and the printing presses running wild at the behest of our government in Washington. pushing for more and more social programs which won't be financially sustainable.All good ideas have within them tragic flaws. If it sounds too good to be true - it is.A great read and it's available in hard and soft backed editions.thanks,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholic Christians Beware!","review":"Mackay's anti-Catholic bigotry is well documented, and in this tome he leaves no opportunity to bash the \\"Romish Church\\" unexploited.

In my mind such close-mindedness has a deleterious effect on the author's credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Book","review":"The most fascinating thing about this book is how little things change.

But somewhere along the way, maybe alchemy, the author decided to make expansive listings of people conducting such activities upon a given population. Talk about dry and really not important to the overall concept of the book. Many of these sections could have continued in the telling of a story to accent the main point.While one can dig out the gems in this book, buy this book only if you have time to dig them out.

A parallel which I haven't seen in other reviews here is the current 'alien invasion/x-files' obsession with the long running belief in alchemy. The same figures play roles.. the naive believer and the swindling fraud, most prominently.Our current astrology revival is only the latest wave of belief in this ancient 'art' and homeopathy has much in common with 'animal magnetism.'I think that every young person, every person should read it to gain an appreciation of the tools we have to sort out the sense from the nonsense as well as a historical perspective on how much human nature has not changed in its eagerness to believe in the face of reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ISN'T THE BOOK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.","review":"This book is a thin, thin, flimsy 98 page excerpt of the real 778 pagesbook.

This book is synonymous and a good companion to \\"Phoenix Lights\\" where onlookers marvel at the appearance of symetrical arrangements of mysterious lights in the night sky.

Sometimes for reasons that should be left unjudged, objects or experiences that people think they are experiencing can be interpreted to be that person's reality or judgement skill. There are many other real stories behind the Nightsiege of New York. Many stories can be interpreted in ways to meet ones own goal, or maybe provide the need for that fifteen minutes of fame. People maybe saw what they think they saw. As for one of the original investigators, who also saw these objects and found them identifiable, and who also was one of the original writers and researchers I find now I that I have grown up, I am too old for fairy tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price","review":"This DVD is nice for the price.

Jordan allows the reader into many of his most intimate thoughts about his life, as well as, his baseball life and journeys. Much the same as Field of Dreams was more than a baseball movie, A Nice Tuesday is much more than a baseball novel. Feel his love for the game and his love for pitching a baseball. He depicts his life in and out of baseball with such deep passion and conviction that it is impossible to come away from this book with anything other than a strong feeling of warmth for the sport and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Jerk!","review":"This was a well-written memoir, up to a point, by a well-known jerk. The author cruelly betrays the confidences of the teenager he hires to catch him. He thinks about noone but himself.Nevertheless, the book is very readable until his emotional breakdown in the closing chapters: after exhibiting a near-complete disregard for most of the human beings he encounters, he completely falls apart at the death of his dogs, dissolving into near hysteria.What a mess. What a jerk.Stick with A False Spring, which also shows Jordan up as jerk, but remains a classic nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a baseball memoir","review":"Pat Jordan still thinks of himself as a pitcher who happens to write rather than merely a writer. But his memoir is about more than just baseball. We learn much about Jordan's private life from his two marriages, his estranged kids, his dogs, and his attempt at age 56 to retake the mound in a minor league game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hrm..","review":"Growing up, I played both Moon Patrol and Spy Hunter in the arcades, then on the Atari 2600 console and Atari 800XL computer. The Spy Hunter reminds me of the Atari 800XL version of Spy Hunter, slightly easier than the 'real thing' but still awkward to get your car moving fast enough to be effective, but slow enough to give you time to react to things coming down the road (typical Spy Hunter problem though). For a better Spy Hunter, and a faithful arcade adaptation, go to shockwave.com and play theirs. As far as Moon Patrol, the music is hard to hear, and the UFO's are hard to shoot and and dodge, but it is a faithful arcade adaptation. Unless you REALLY liked these two games in the past (to discover this about yourself, ask yourself \\"Can I hum the Moon Patrol theme?\\"), I wouldn't suggest the purchase. I feel I paid $15 too much for this $20 cartridge.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not a good version of Spy Hunter, as the maneuverablility is not good on this platform.

I am very pleased with my purchase. These games are great classics and fun to play for all ages. The smaller format of the GameBoy make them a bit harder to play than the original arcade versions, but you can't beat the charm of a classic and the portability of GameBoy. Nice for me to slip back to the past, and fun to share with my 10 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Loudon's Best!","review":"For me, Loudon's best work was on the trio of studio albums he did for Rounder: Fame and Wealth, I'm Alright and More Love Songs (the latter two co-produced by Richard Thompson). I'm Alright finds Loudon on the top of his game with several \\"wit meets pathos\\" classics, including One Man Guy (later covered - perhaps with double meaning - by his son Rufus) and the title cut. Cardboard Boxes is a great acoustic rocker about the woes of moving and Daddy Takes a Nap has a great last line. Loudon mostly avoids the sometimes too personal musings of his later work (starting, IMO, with the first post-Rounder album), but the most personal song here, Screaming Issue (about daughter Lucy Roche), manages to touch the heart without making you cringe. And a great band, too, featuring several of Thompson's collaborators and at least on Fairporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Alright, and so is Loudon","review":"As far as I'm aware this album/cd, 'I'm Alright' is a sister (or a brother) to 'More Love Songs' in that it was recorded in England and with a similar set of 'backing' musicians. On this recording there's a smattering of Fairport Convention(ers), past and present, most notably Richard Thompson, Irish singer/songwriter Paul Brady, Christine Collister (vocals) and Henry Lowther (cornet) among others. A number of the songs would appear on any 'Best Of' LWIII cd including, One Man Guy, Not John, Cardboard Boxes and Career Moves. 'One Man Guy' is the only song that I know of that Loudon's son, Rufus, performs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Loudon","review":"I am about to give up on him. He seems to be rehashing his old songs and compiling them into poorly produced albums, or his songwriting on new pieces does not break new ground. Loudon -- dig deep into that creative spot and give us something really new that knocks our socks off. An exception on this is the One Man Guy, that one is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Course/Microsoft Publisher 2000 - Don't bet on it","review":"A word of warning to those who believe the title - the authors claim it is for the 2000 version of Publisher, but many of the screens and keystrokes they portray are of an earlier version. After struggling through several pages of the intro, they thoughtfully threw in a text box on page 10, to explain that the book is based on the '98 version of the program and that \\"the appearance of your screen might not match ours...\\" Terrific. If you are a veteran of Publisher, this might not be a problem, but if you bought this thing thinking it would lead you through the 2000 edition of the program, you are left to wander through it, and getting stuck on a page with no way to go back without losing what you already have done. If you are a rookie on learning this program, don't expect this book to be your guide. Take a class instead or keep looking for a better tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique writing style; cynical view of subject; worth reading","review":"If you like Dilbert, P.J. O'Rourke, H.L. Menchken, etc., you might also enjoy this. Most of the book describes how and why organizations can't manage complexity, and there is also advice on how one can deal with that and still 'have fun at work.'The most interesting thing to me was the author's extremely convoluted style of writing. Reminds me of von Veblen and 'The theory of the leisure class.' Sometimes the prose is amazingly twisted and hard-to-follow.... but it's fun to wonder why this guy went about writing a book in this unusual style because he does seem to grasp the realities of the workplace.Memorable item from book: POSIWID (the Purpose Of a System Is What It Does.)

I definitely do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense and dull for the adverage reader","review":"I read the Perils of Prosperity for a History class. It was hard to get through, extremely dry, and at times extremely unclear. Leuchtenburg does not attempt to insert any life or interest into the stories of many interesting people, but instead blathers on in a detached style, leaving the reader bored to tears. He also assumes social knowledge of the reader, by making reference to explain points, which are completely useless and confusing to those who have not read the work he's referencing. Also, sometimes, Leuchtenburg just annoyed me. In the chapter on the Scopes Trial, the book mentions William Jennings Bryant saying that Jonah was swallowed by a fish. Leuchtenburg then haughtily points out that in the story, Jonah was ACTUALLY swallowed by a whale. The only problem? The Bible actually does say \\"fish\\". Nobody likes a know it all, and they're even less appealing when they don't do their research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little book.","review":"This little book was my favorite when I was a little girl.

Making cameo appearances: the Medici, Machiavelli, the Borgias, Castiglione, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Van Eyck, Shakespeare, Durer, Bruegel, Cervantes, Gutenberg, Henry VIII, St. Ignatius Loyola, and Galileo. Also discussed is the Reformation, although somewhat limited in scope. Beautiful color pictures.

Some of them these days are so articulated now. It's almost painful to look at them. McFarlane produces pieces that are not meant to move (at least not much.) The companies pieces are meant to look at. Perhaps bring back some very good memories of a moment in time.

The graphics suck, the gameplay reeks, the sound is pathetic, and on top of it all, the characters are given no respect whatsoever as they are designed badly and their moves don't work the way I, them, or anyone would want them to. If you like Mortal Kombat(like I do)stick to games like Deadly Alliance and Deception. I mean, Mortal Kombat Advance was crummy, but it was three times better than this piece of trash.

However the cold hard fact is that this is just not true. When I first got this game I opened it with trembling fingers and quickly slid in the game and went right for the power switch only to be stunned with disbelief. The graphics were horrendous, the sound was almost pointless, and there was no control to speak of once you started playing. The bottom line is this game isn't even worth thinking about. My suggestion to you if you must play Mortal Kombat right now is to get Mortal Kombat 3. But if I were you I'd wait till Mortal Kombat 5 comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"MK4","review":"Just give up, this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality.

It's always the same annoying style of music, regardless of the scene. Nice cars, nice chicks, and that's it. They can't even drive the cars properly, you can easily see they are doing like 15MPH and they spin out in the corners but on the next take they are straight as an arrow.

For those who don't know this, in an interesting reversal of fortunes, Jennifer Hudson beat out former American Idol winner Fantasia for the role. And now, she's nominated for a Golden Globe, and has already snagged eleven awards (see imdb). Talk about life imitating art.Translating a Broadway smash to the screen is never easy, but this seemed seamless, and the other cast members, specifically Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx, lent the film extraordinary believability.I generally don't enjoy musicals, but listening to Jennifer Hudson sing was absolutely a revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Talented Cast Held Back by a Poor Script","review":"The acting of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx supplemented with the singing of Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' - the makings of a great musical film, right? Unfortunately Dreamgirls does not deliver.The plot of Dreamgirls focuses on the struggle of a naive trio of talented young singers during the 1960's. Unfortunately the film focuses much of its attention on the root cause of all evil in the U.S. during this time period - white people. Seriously, the only time you see a caucasian or hear a reference to one during this film, it is to make the point that they racists or thieves who don't appreciate good music.In the end, I expected a lot more from this talented cast and therefore came away disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented Dreamgirls (using my awesome Tivo/Amazon Unboxed!).

I thought she was just an extra back up singer or something, I didn't realize that she was a main player. Many times during the movie, I was brought to tears with her powerful voice and great acting! Bravo, Jennifer! Not to be forgotten, was the other big talent that did not disappoint. I felt that the movie did a great job to keep your attention with the icing on top of the cake being all the wonderful talent involved with the project.

This movie has great music, wonderful performances, and tremendous energy. It's the story of a trio of young women from Detroit and how they made it to the big time. It tells of their days as backup singers for James Early (Eddie Murphy) to their promotion as a group by manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx). It chronicles them falling in and out of love with self-centered, ambitious men who are only looking out for themselves. When Jennifer Hudson sings \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" the world stands still and the viewer feels all the pain of a young woman being betrayed in her love life and her career. This is a fast-paced, totally absorbing movie and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see and own for any Supremes Fan","review":"I have watched this movie 6 times, and never get tired or bored with it.

First of all, I can see why this picture wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the best picture category. And who said Jennifer Hudson could act, she would have never gotten the role of Elfie if it wasn't for American Idol. Hudson's acting so self-righteous and wooden, please tell how she won the Academy Award. Eddie Murphy can't sing and Beyonce looks like she doesn't know what's going on half the time, this film is pretty bad. I was expecting some great Broadway tunes but they are completely awful.

There must have been about 1 full hour of song and to make matters worse most of the material ranged from forgettable to outright unmelodious or awkward. The cast certainly proved they could sing but with hardly a spoken line and without a decent storyline it made for very long and dull viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreams Associated with Sleeping & it will put you to Sleep","review":"Obviously I did not like this movie.

The story is familiar and fascinating--especially for those of us of Baby Boom vintage---and the all-star cast was wonderful. Eddie Murphy has to be the most versatile actor around; I couldn't believe it was he in the part of the fading R&B star. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson sings her heart out, and Beyonce\` is drop dead gorgeous as well as credible in the Diana Ross role. The music echoed the golden age of Motown and carried the story. The audience clapped--hard!--when it was over. Forget the press and see the movie--it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I saw this film on its' Christmas Day release. The audience was hooked from start to finish. This loosely based story about The Supremes really shed some light on Diana Ross, Berry Gordy and Florence Ballard. Facts and long rumored fiction are wonderfully spun in this by now classic time capsule of American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever","review":"I saw this movie the very first day it came out. I ended up going to two theaters just to see it. Just for the record, I love Jennifer Hudson in this movie. Her voice is so strong and she really sings from her heart. I cried when she sang \\"And I'm Telling You (I'm not Going)\\". It was hard for me to take Eddie Murphy serious in this film, but he did excellent and has a nice voice. Jamie Foxx; I love him, he is such a versatile actor. The part was perfect for him. I didn't too much care for Beyonce, although I think this is the best film she has done so far. I just recently purchased the soundtrack and as soon as it comes out on dvd, I will be purchasing that as well. I was tempted to go see it in theater again, but I'll wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"God, this movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while. I wasn't expecting it since it got like, Golden Globes and stuff. But, it was boring and the music was bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"As the story of the Supremes, I wonder why they didn't just make a bio-pic with the real music? As it stands, this is unsatisfying, and the original score is a screechfest that's not even close to Motown in style. This reminds of the awful Bette Midler 70s pic, \\"The Rose,\\" another attempt to tell a star's story without actually naming the star, in that case Janis Joplin. Eddie Murphy, as the Marvin Gayish singer, is sort of impressive here, but Jamie Foxx is expressionless as the Berry Gordy-like character. The dreamgirls themselves are forgettable. Watch it if you like ear-numbing screeching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Girls","review":"This movie was Ok. I didn't really care for it! It's not as great as the people say it was.

I like it in a sence that it talks about how black weren't treated equal in the music business or any where else. I like how it showed a white guy making a hit from a black guys song!

As the story unfolded, I kept thinking it was going to get better. Alas, I was so bored that I turned it off after an hour. If you like the actors or are big into musicals, then maybe this won't be your opinion. Yes, they are certainly a talented group of actors/actresses with wonderful vocal cords, it just seemed like a dozen other 'somebody crawled out of anonymity to fame story'.

The racial agenda was pretty blatant. I guess it should be expected.

It's a cultural motif that no adult (at least any thinking adult) buys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours of Screaming!","review":"This movie is terrible. I'm not surprised it made its way so fast to DVD - 2 hours of screaming - I don't call it singing. None of the songs had a melody, does not compare to Diana Ross and the Supremes, if this is what this story was supposed to be about. I turned it off 1 1/4 hour into the DVD - couldn't care less what happened to the characters. It seems people either hated or loved this one - I couldn't stand it.

What-ever happened to Leon, who starred in The Temptations???...just askin;.Thought he would have been better suited for the part...but I guess Murphy was a bigger draw.Beyonce's singing was good...as always,But she IS over exposed! but the REAL show stopper was Jennifer...WOW! what vibes.Jammie Fox was not strong enough and did nothing for his role.Perhaps Denzel could have flipped this movie into a powerhouse..... probably wanted too much money. I could see Morgan Freeman in the part of Danny Glover...Much more humility and prescence!...The songs were great, and the costumes were just right for that era. we should be thanking Berry Gordy and Diana Ross for this privalege..... Sandee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Movie","review":"This movie is about a group of singers (inspired by the Supremes) that start out playing in junkie competitions and how they made it to the big time. The band goes through numerous fractures and toes are stepped on. I will let you discover the plot on your own but I have a feeling this is a very realistic story of the supposed glitz and glamor of show business.I liked this movie but I felt that it got too long. It was about two hours long, not a horrible length, but some parts just seemed to drag on despite the actors' great talents (including amazing singing). If you feel like you are somewhat interested in this movie, I recommend that you rent it when you're not too tired but ready to sit down for a long time, get some pop and junk food, and relax on the couch with a friend.I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this was a pretty good movie. Nothing fantastic, but good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful singing, but movie overall is lacking","review":"Despite the hype that Dreamgirls received, both critically and at the Box Office, I still believe there's something lacking here. Without a doubt, the singing is incredible, and Jennifer Hudson is truly a wonderful singer and up-and-coming actress. What was overlooked was Anika Noni Rose's amazing performance as the third Dreamette. However, the plot itself does not develop fully until very late in the movie. The first hour is almost unbearable, in my opinion, as there is little emphasis on a central occurrence, rather the director employs montages to move the movie along.As another reviewer has noted, this movie does not hold up to Rent or Chicago. If you truly want to see it because of the movie itself, then see it. But if you're going off Hollywood's hype alone (as I did), I wouldn't recommend the movie. You really have to enjoy the original Dreamgirls Broadway concept to enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the CDs blankk?","review":"I pre-ordered this 2-disc set and couldn't wait to receive it. The family sat down to watch the movie together on a Friday night, and low and behold, the CD's were completely blank. We tried 2 different machines and they were just blank. Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy and a week later, I had a replacement set. And guess what? They are blank too! I've never had an experience like this with DVD's before. What's up with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Girls","review":"I was very disappointed. Everyone has compared this story to the Supremes, but the music was not even close to the Supremes. It was more like from the 40's. It didn't sound anything like the 60's music or even the music from the 50's. It reminded me more of Westside Story. It was a mis-representation. I am a big Beyonce Knowles fan, but the music provided for her was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM ADDICTED TO THIS MOVIE","review":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!

The story is great- and deeply moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamgirls","review":"I went to the movies with the thought that I probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised. I love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles. I am not what you call a Beyonce fan, but I found myself enjoying her in this role. I have always loved musicals and can't wait to add this one to my collection. My grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting...Great Music...Great Production","review":"I was never into musicals, but this one kept me tuned in.

A stellar magic moment in the middle of the movie by Jennifer Hudson will be remembered by this viewer for a long time to come. I wish the rest of the movie had some of that great impact, which probably is asking too much.Nice performances by Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy helped give nice credibility through most of the schmaltzy storyline and I thought Dreamgirls ran a little too long and could've cut 20 minutes (from it's 2 hours and 11 minutes) but all in all a really good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's it all about?","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, but was disappointed in finding a wandering minstrel. Who was the hero? What was the story? Where was it going, and did it ever arrive? I was so bored I fast-forwarded through many of the musical numbers, and would have fast-forwarded through the rest, but I kept hoping I'd figure it out. I never did. Of course, it is possible that I finally got so bored that I fast-forwarded to the end and totally missed the point, but I don't think so. For a film that had so much potential to be really good, this was a bummer. In my opinion. And this has nothing to do with race. I love a movie where ordinary or extraordinary blacks overcome white-supremacist obstacles and rise to heights not formerly expected of them. But this film left me feeling cheated. Sorry. I really, really wanted to be in the cheering squad, and I found myself hissing instead. What went wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my dreamgirls","review":"This movie drifts into absurdity. The scenes when it tries to slip into operatic mode are not convincing and poorly produced. From there it rapidly declines into meaningless drivel and unlike any opera I have seen, and that is many, I feel that it should make up it's mind about what it wants to be. I wish for something more than a recital of rock songs trying to blend into a plot. The plot is based on the Supreme's who were a top national act who sang some of the greatest songs of the sixties. They should sue the makers of this picture for trivializing their image. This quickly becomes the first black soap opera I have seen.

Not many movies have a price of $4.99 for new copies of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me...","review":"One of the more difficult to get through movies you'll experience in a long time. Do not be fooled by the \\"Best Picture\\" award. Most musicals feel a need to advance some hint of a plot either with - or between - the songs. Not this film. It simply enjoys its own awful songs too much to let the audience in on any sense of what is going on.And did they give Jennifer Hudson the Best Stereotype Award? In a one-dimensional role requiring exactly no range from an actress, she hit all the right notes. They give ACTING awards for being yourself in front of a camera now?Might be the worst \\"Best Picture\\" ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"This movie gets one star because for all its hype and awards this movie was boring. The story was not all that interesting, the music was even less interesting. I don't what type of singing it is that Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson sing, but it has no melody and follows no beat, I would call commercial gospel. Nevertheless, it's a real turnoff and does not do any justice to the great music produced by Motown. Beyonce is just horrible and a fake. Can she ever make you believe she is playing anyone else but herself? Yeah, compared to her, Jennifer Hudson does seem like an academy award actress. Hudson has potential but isn't quite there yet. The accolades and awards where a little premature. I am not sure what criteria was applied to this movie to make everyone think it was so good, but it's not. Save your money and buy the Supremes Greatest Hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moans","review":"Ugh! This film was awful. Beyonce cannot act her way out of a wet paper back and her singing is marginal, at best. Jennifer Hudson has a huge voice, but the songs are so bellowy it has little to no effect.

Avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatantly Rips off Motown","review":"Diana Ross,Berry Gordy,smokey Robinson,etc... should be paid for this weak Movie that just takes everything from it. Jennifer Hudson pretty much steals the whole film. Beyonce ain't got a clue at acting. Jamie foxx is trying to hard and it's mixed. as for Eddie Murphy his many takes on singers and stylings feels like One of his standups,except he is suppose to be playing One,but he can't get One fully right let alone the many he is trying to emulate. the film is too long and it jumps all over the place and it's so cliche and everybody who knows there music history knows this film is about Motown. this Film is a Insult to Motown. that Corny Broke take on the Jackson Five really took the cake. this Film was Corny and a straight up slap to the face to what Motown Records Accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Hi, i am writing this review in Guatemala but i live in california.

This book is not an in depth biography like Al Stump's \\"Cobb\\" or Robert Creamer's \\"Babe\\" (I highly recommend both for baseball and histroy buffs), but rather a light in-the-locker room, on-the-field, in-the-pub insight on baseball in the '70s and '80s from Goose's point of view. It has a poignant side as well. For example, Goose describes the sense of loss after Thurman Munson's death. And I think the Goose gives us a fair critique of some his contemporaries.

I suspect it is from the horsetail which SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED by those with circulatory problems such as Raynaud's or heart issues. This product is labeled \\"stimulant-free\\". Horsetail is used for its silicon content, but contains none other than nicotine which IS a stimulant and constricts blood vessels. Absorption is increased by the inclusion of yucca, which acts as a surfactant. I can't help but wonder if the nicotine is causing some reviewers to claim that they \\"crave\\" this product.

Before I had always thought of him as being frankly,quite a boring man. Yet when I picked up this book in my English Literature class, I was surprised when I continued to read on. His descriptons are colorful and keep you informed. He keeps it interesting and lively. He combines fact with his imagination. What the result is, is a stunning realization away from the fairytale wolf. I would recommend you read the book for he plays with your emotions as will any good author. He makes you laugh and cry and smile within almost every chapter. A fantastic example of Farley Mowats distinctive storytelling style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not humans","review":"Never Cry Wolf is not without its good points. It has many humourous moments and the setting is described almost poetically. However, Mowat's conceitedness gets old fast. His ideas, while arguably not the majority opinion, are far from original (even back when this was written). Furthermore assigning human personality characteristics to wolves does not help his case. Intelligent readers can understand that wolves are not the evil monsters some make them out to be, without having them painted with desirable human qualities. Wolves are just wolves. Nothing more. Nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling, Scientific Account","review":"Never Cry Wolf is a compelling autobiographical account of a scientist's research into wolves in the wild. The descriptive story of Farley Mowat's scientific expedition to northern Canada, including his detailed observations of wolf pack behaviour is told clearly in chronological order. The major characters in this account: the author, a wildlife biologist on his first assignment; the Innuit, an indian tribe native to northern Canada; and the wolf pack, subject of Mowat's study; are vividly brought to life. The author uses well-selected events to describe the wolfpack, the Innuit and himself in their daily lives; his first-hand descriptions of interactions with the the natives, the animals, and their environment make for interesting and informative reading.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the life of a biologist studying wolves in the wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mowat Admits All A Lie","review":"Farley Mowat has admitted publically that both the book and the movie are not based on fact. He is quoted as saying that he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. The idea that wolves eat only mice and voles should give anyone reading it pause. The wolves have had to be controlled (by helicopter, trapping, etc) to protect what is left of the caribou. And then, they put them in the US, where they are making huge strides in decimating all of the ungulate population of Idaho, Montana ,and Wyoming. The man is an admitted liar, why would anyone want to read the book, or watch the movie. He is totally unrepentant about it, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Cry Wolf","review":"This narrative is a blend of humor, misconceptions, and at times ineptness as Mowat fumbles through misunderstond beliefs of wolf behavior, hunting practices, social hierarchies and parenting. Mowat is befriended by two Eskimos, one named Mike and the other Ootek. It is with his relationship with Ootek that helps Mowat understand the wolf. Through his conversations and with first hand observations Mowat is able to conclude, that the wolf is anything but a carnivore that kills indiscriminately. The wolf has a higher social order; has a distinctive language and is a caring parent. I would recommend this book, it is light reading, it is humorous, it expresses ones coming of age as a young biologist, thrusted into the wilds of the Canadian frontier, learns life's lessons of what is perceive is not necessarily true.The wolf is one with its environment and it is man that is the plague of mother nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for all wolf lovers.","review":"This book is one of the many books on wolves that I have read.

I would recamend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farley Mowat","review":"The book is well written and quite entertaining. I read it twenty-five years ago, bought this copy for my grand-daughter, age 13. However, when I mentioned my enjoyment of the book to my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, who lived in the area where the story takes place, they had a very healthy dislike for Farley Mowat. They didn't like the way he treated the Inuit and leached off everyone he was in contact with. People in Nunavent don't hold him in high regard. They also question his accuracy about how wolves live. In spite of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Story","review":"In the introduction Farley Mowat writes that his intent was to write about the bureaucracy and misinformation which Mowat felt was pushing the Canadian government in the wrong enviromental direction. Granted, there is parts of the book dedicated to that but Mowat becomes so obsessed with the wolves he is studing that they soon become the stars of his own story.Never Cry Wolf is an adventure story about a scientist relocated to the Canadian wilderness to study the effects that wolves have on the depleating numbers of carabao. Mowat not only links the decline in carabao to man but he also ends up taking some fasinating notes on wolf behavior.The only problem with the book is that it is around 40 years old. From this book today, there is no way of knowing how accurate and relevant Mowat information still is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mowat Cried Wolf","review":"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under \\"Comedy\\" if not \\"Fiction\\".

Mowat has never provided evidence to refute the investigations in Canada that uncovered the fictional nature of \\"Never Cry Wolf\\". For an accurate description of wolf biology, read the works of respected wolf biologists such as L. David Mech. As Mech says in his book \\"The Wolf\\", Mowat's \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" is a good counterbalance to the \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" portrayal of wolves as vicious man eaters... yet neither story is grounded in fact. Among the gross errors in Mowat's book was his contention that wolf packs can subsist on a diet of small rodents. No wolf biologist has found such a wolf population.

But if you like that kind of stuff go ahead and get the book.I recommend this book to anyone over 40 with a lot of time on their hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baloney","review":"This book is NOT the true story of life among arctic wolves-- Mr. Mowat spent much, much less time with wolves than he pretends he has in this book, and simply fabricates most of his observations. It takes a special sort of person to endure the frozen wilderness to study arctic wolf behavior at length, and to accept that these beautiful animals are intelligent and amazing killing machines that don't need to fulfill people's desires to view them as non-threatening mouse-eaters. Apparently Mr. Mowat just isn't that special sort of person-- but he is a liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I got the book hoping to learn the human experience of such an amazing challenge. An experience like that must have such a profound impact on a man's psyche, but I felt he masked all of this with shallow quips and wordsmithing. Way too much salesmanship and way too little reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Wolf Juice~","review":"The book Never Cry Wolf is an excellent book. The characters are great. I think my favorite character would have to be Angeline, she's a smart and beautiful wolf. One of my favorite parts in the book though, is when Farely drinks the wolf juice. You'll have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about, but I would definitely recomend this book for everyone. It is absolutely hilarious and once you get going, you'll never want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome natural history narrative","review":"I read this book because I liked the movie. Luckily this was one of those rare movies that was made pretty true to the spirit of the book.

I absolutely can't stand fiction being sold as \\"an absolutely true account\\" -- this crossed a line. And now that it has been revealed as fictionalized, it is truly astounding that it is still fooling people and is still being classes as nonfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Cry Wolf : Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves","review":"To put it very simply, how can a fictional work be considered \\"Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves\\"?

Read to enjoy a fictional world drawn up by Mowat, but if looking for a true life story stick to non-fiction writings as this is certainly not among those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially for Animal Lovers","review":"This book is a good introduction to Mowat.

This is a desolate place and there are no other people living in that area for miles around. The man finds out where the wolves den is and when the wolves are not there he hikes over to the den and looks around. He learns a lot about the wolves and how they live and love him.Mowatt tells in the story how the wolves communicate to each other and hunt together. Mowatt does a lot of research on the way wolves live. Mowatt explains all the details in the story, such as when the wolves leave to hunt and what they are hunting. Wolves hunt deer and caribou, but when there were no caribou they will eat mice. Wolves will generally hunt in packs so there are more of them if they have to bring down a large animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for kids and adults alike","review":"Farley Mowat's 'Never Cry Wolf' is a funny book composed of descriptive, smooth storyline that details Mowat's year living among the Artic wolves and northern Inuits.

Personally, I didn't like the book very much. It was very slow moving with very little action and not many interesting events. The book said it was based on a true story, but really it never happened and that upset me. So I guess this book is realistic fiction based on facts. It is a short book that is based on facts about the interaction between wolves and other animals. If this sounds interesting, then read the book. But if you prefer sci-fi's and fantasies with action and adventure, then stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think they would print what I would like to say","review":"I read this ...how do you say \\"NOVEL\\" pretending to be non-fiction when in grade school years ago.Since then I have learned that Sir Mowatt doesn't let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.I will never read any book by him again. ...I give it a negative 5 stars.save your money and buy a comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Its was a great book for kids but a long one\\"","review":"This book is about a guy who near peru somewhere and lives with this eskimo guy named mike.

It seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the book, or anything, for that matter. After that, it was simply too slow and too boring. Nothing ever really happens. I was still waiting for the excitement to begin when I reached the last page. No excitement ever came.I would really like to warn anyone off who is thinking of reading this book for pleasure.

All you do is start the game, choose your monster, and start destroying. You do the same thing every time. You walk around and punch a building holes form on it and you grad the stuff and eat it.

We had to watch this film in one of my film classes. One word: junk. This movie had nothing redeeming about it; I do not care what people say. The lighting was bad; cinematography was shoddy at best, and the acting atrocious. Maybe I am a cynic and am slightly biased towards modernist films. I usually find foreign films to be some of my favorites including Run, Lola Run and The Color trilogy: Red, White, and Blue, but this movie did nothing for me except annoy me and infect me.

Except that I take it for what it is; months and months stuck in a sand pit. Some metaphors aren't meant to be; neither simile, metaphor, analogy, or like anything else, its just about a naked lady in the sand, which is what I thought when I saw it when I was a kid.

It introduced a new technology in a very simple and accessible way as only O'Reilly and Associates can.

Duddy is not a good guy but the reader loves him because he is a human being and if he turns out sour and crazy it is only becasue those more fortunate than he have taken advantage of him. Duddy responds to the cards that society hands out by playing them as best he can. Richler is an incredible writer. His characters and dialogue have so much richness, so much reality. This is a book about Montreal and all the politics and culture-clash that occur between its upper-class Jews and Gentile and the lower class Jews and Gentiles. The old Jews and the young Jews, the college kids and the working kids. The French canadians and the anglo-phones, etc. There are very few women in this book, but Duddy has a very small field of vision when it comes to women, so the POV is true to the character.

I feel the language in the book is unreal and some of the situations in the book are just plan undescribable and obscene. In my opinion I feel this book should be banned from being read in highschools. There are some students that I know who stated for a fact that they've never seen a piece of garbage as worse as this book and I fully agree with them. The use of language is uncontrolable and plan disgusting. There are people who don't use the kind of language that's use in this book and when they see it they immediately skip over the word because they don't feel right reading such language and they've grown up not using or thinking of using it.

I wanted to get a better feeling of debugging before going into other VBA books that reports indicate to be full of bugs. The book is nice in that it briefly touches on subjects like ADO. It seems like it will make a good reference. I really can't complain much since I paid one buck for the book. The only negative criticism that I can say to the authors is that the word open in Spanish is not abir, but abrir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased at all!","review":"The singing is not really exciting.

Their live show is absolutly amazing, and I worried about how the live show would transfer onto a CD. When they play, they play, and play, and then play some more. Twenty minute songs are not unheard of, and this can be hard to tranfer to a cd. But they did it, and did it right. The CD is a great listen all the way through, and it can keep repeating and never get old. I have accumulated almost 20 hours of their live shows, and the cd really does them and their music justice. It really does not matter what kind of music you like, you will like this, because it is just great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great new sounds for all","review":"If you want to try to describe this band to a friend by saying things like they sound a lot like _____ don't even try. Last Free Exit has a sound all its own. It's new and its about time a band came along and put some jams on a CD that take you places you haven't been before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good solo debut from the former Soundgarden frontman","review":"On Euphoria Morning, Chris Cornell shows us the vocal sylings he's hinted at, but never had the chance to fully explore as the lead singer for the now-defunct Soundgarden. His debut solo effort is a great one - filled with lilting melodies, unique chord arrangements, and a few radio-worthy tunes to make this a commercial as well as a critical success. Standouts include 'Can't Change Me', 'Preaching the End of the World', and 'Pillow of Your Bones'. The album gets a bit weak towards the middle (as most seem to), but comes to a strong finish with 'Pillow' having you sing along and the eerie 'Steel Rain', which you can envision Chris singing somewhere in a dark, desolate place. If the album were a bit more consistent throughout, and his earlier hit, 'Sunshower' were included, I'd give it 5 stars. But again, it is a solid effort as it stands, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in Philly at the Tower Theater!--Sean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Addictive, Highly Recommended","review":"I listened to this CD exclusively for two or more weeks because it is just that good. The only problem I have with Euphoria Morning is that it's Chris Cornell's only solo effort, which is a real shame because the lyrics and music seem to evoke more emotion that the songs he produced while in Soundgarden or Audioslave."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite cds","review":"Every single one of the tracks on this album is brilliant. Even being a Soundgarden fan myself, I would have to say that this album tops any of the Soundgarden albums. Sure, this isn't a full-thrash rocker album, but the emotional depth and detail is astounding. Chris Cornell is a musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"The envelope containing Sound Garden has been opened...","review":"It now appears obvious as to why Sound Garden decided to call it quits. Cornell was taking his music to new levels which didn't fit within the scope of Sound Gardens proprietary sound. Don't get me wrong, I hope SG gets back together, but I must admit that Euphoria Morning is musical art. I can't wait to see wait the future brings."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best from the illest singer ever","review":"this cd is pure genious, it's better than anything thing by Soundgarden or Audioslave. Almost every song gets five stars except \\"mission\\", and \\"when im down\\" which aren't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better everytime you listen to it","review":"Don't buy this CD expecting Badmotorfinger or SuperUnknown. This is nothing like Soundgarden, and thats what makes it great. Chris Cornell spreading his wings and making great, different, music. I am a big fan of Soundgarden and the whole Seattle/Grunge scene, but I also have a wide range of other music tastes. Chris Cornell pulls a more folk and soft approach to this CD. He favors vocals and his guitar over loud, headbanging, blarring music. The single \\"Can't Change Me\\" doesn't appeal to me that much, but the rest of the CD is just extrordinary. Another plus to this CD is looking at the credits and see such musicians as Josh Freese, and Matt Cameron(ex- drummer for Soundgarden, current drummer for Pearl Jam) on drums.--- 3 Favorite tracks ---Sweet EuphoriaDisappearing OneWave Goodbye"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't buy it for so long....","review":"I have loved soundgarden since '95 so when they broke up I was just sad because I would never get to hear that beautiful noise again. When I heard Chris Cornell was going solo, I didn't rush to my local record store and buy it. shame on me. I heard the song Can't Change Me on the radio, and it was a good song, but frankly it just sounded like a modern rock radio hit to me. I suggest: listen to this album as a whole, don't give up after one song. I got to see Chris live, which was one of the coolest things ever. I'm waiting till i get to see him again. If you can catch him on his tour, you won't regret it. My favorite song is 'Preaching the End of the World', with lyrics like \\"I'm 24/and i've got everything to live for\\". 'Wave Goodbye' is also excelent, it kinda reminds me of Billy Joel. Flutter Girl has a cool intro and and is just an awsome song. This Cd is bliss, get it, somewhere, somehow...."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I was afraid rock couldn't turn me on like it used to","review":"Chris has broken through my crusty heart and pulled the strings. If I could find new music like this once or twice a year, I would be satisfied. These days unfortunately, it is usually every few years that an artist affects me like this. I'm an old SG/CC fan, and always thought that Kim T was the heart of that group, but Chris has soared to new heights without the heavy-handed SG sound. I didn't know he had so much soul. The ONLY criticism I have is the clicky digital sound, although the recording is fabulous other than that. Next time around I hope he records to analog/tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic album!!","review":"Fans of Chris Cornell have been given a masterpiece with this album. Pure music filled with creativity and originality and one of the sweetest yet scariest voices known to mankind. This album is so good on so many levels. It has a wide variety of musical textures and colours but Cornell sings so beautifully and with so much passion on each and every song. The music is very dark for the most part and Cornell uses alot of dark imagery throughout his lyrics. He has also captured great performances from a super band worthy of following up the musical muscle of Cornell's previous band Soundgarden. This is a classic album that will be talked about and listened to for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out with the old, In with the new","review":"Chris Cornell has just set the standard for real rock in the future. This recording goes from crooning to rocking in no time flat. And dare I say, it has shades of great Soundgarden riffs. He didn't depart from his successful formula, he just adapted it and made it fresh. A must have for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Very good album!

Has he become mellow and been diluted by a love interest. Most of the songs reflect this. I was a massive fan of Soundgarden and bought the CD because of this. I cant say enough how dissapointed I am at this poor attempt at an album. Soundgarden R.I.P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Soundgarden since the release of Louder then Love, and I absolutely loved Cornell's work in Temple of the Dog, but this CD doesn't compare to his previous work.This CD lacks the passion and intensity of all of his earlier work. There is not a single song on this CD that even resmbles something other then a ballad. And while the CD is slow and melodic, it lacks any real hook or feel that I have come to expect from Cornell.Unfortunately, this CD is just flat out boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"salt in the wound","review":"This CD has no remnant of what Soundgarden was. Any fan that's mourning the breakup should listen to the old albums and spare themselves this souless pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Spectacular","review":"Well. I came in with an unbiased view. The only Soundgarden song I've ever heard has been \\"Black Hole Sun\\" and though I liked it, I never bothered to pick up a SG cd. When I heard the first single \\"She's Going to Change the World\\"(I think that's right..) off Euphoria Morning, I was entranced. However, when I bought the cd and listened to it, I realized that this cd was more of a one-hit (actually, 2 and a half) album for me. The other song that I actually had the desire to listen to again was \\"Mission\\", which was one of the very few songs that had a melody that could be memorable. \\"Preaching the End of the World\\" was decent, but not extraordinary. I found Cornell's lyrics very interesting, but the music that went with them just left me bored. I would much rather have seen Cornell put out a Jewel-like poetry book then this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste your money on something else more worthwhile","review":"Yes, I am a big fan of Soundgarden. I was mad that they broke up. I was happy to find out chris cornell was coming out with a solo cd. This cd has only one good song on it, can't change me, but that;s just my opinion. I just got it today, and i wish i spent my money on something better. Oh well, maybe i'll learn to like it. I just want to say, i was horribly disappointed, and i'm happy for all you people who love this new cd, it's just that......i don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a disappointing debut by one of rock's best voices.","review":"As an avid Cornell fan, I found this CD to be somewhat bland and very disappointing. Cornell proved to be one of the decade's premiere songwriters and I expected so much more from this release. The music wasn't as ambitious as I had anticipated and some great lyrics were done in by suspect music. No song on here lives up to his earlier solo songs, nor do they have the inventiveness of his Temple of the Dog songs. I really can't remember when I've been more let down by a CD and only take heart in the fact that his next release can only be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"SORRY FANS OF CHRIS CORNELL.

What was wrong with me. I just popped in this cd while I was typing a paper, and for some reason it just touched me. Wow....this is just great music. The songs seem more like seventies rock, r&b, and some are even kind of funky(referring to \\"wave goodbye\\"). But it has something new to it. It's like he's bringing something back from the dead, and making it ten times better and with a new ring to it. In this era of egotistical rock stars who don't really care about their music, or are just talentless. This is just a relief. It reassures me that despite all of the Limp Bizkit fanaticism, there is still a spark that keeps good music alive. Thank you Chris for your musical genius. WOW.....keep it coming"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mature face of Chris Cornell","review":"This album is simply amazing. This is an album that should be definitely heard by the ambiguous musician or music lover. Every track has its own unique style while at the same time retaining all of Chris's splendor and talent. From the bluesy ballads of \\"When I'm Down\\" to the Temple of the Dog-esque \\"Mission\\", every song packs a punch. It has no dull points, and the raw soul that Cornell exhibits in this album is simply awe-inspiring. Much lighter than his Soundgarden days I will admit, but somehow the emotion and heart in both his vocals and his playing make it better than any Soundgarden piece. Perfect album, it could not have been done any better, unless maybe it had \\"Sunshower\\" on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Temple of the Dog than Soundgarden","review":"Good solid solo debut from one of the great voices of rock. However, I disagree with some reviews that compare this album to his previous efforts with Soundgarden. The musical style is more similar to the Temple of the Dog album that Chris sang the majority of the songs on. I love that album more than any of his Soundgarden albums and as a result, I found this album refreshing. He lets his vocal talents take center stage and relies less on the guitar work behind him. A good buy for a fan of Chris Cornell himself and maybe not so much for Soundgarden fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work.","review":"Not sure if I can pigenhole this. A little rock, a little blues, maybe a little folk. It is reminiscent of Jeff Buckley. Cornell still knows how to write a gripping chorus. Even if some of the lyrics don't make sense, Cornell sings them so well, you can feel what he's saying. Standouts include the title track and \\"Wave Goodbye.\\" My only gripe is that there is little variation in mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I was a Soundgarden fan. I was a Temple of the Dog Fan. Now Im a Cornell fan. Im glad he decided to pursue his music after Soungarden's breakup, and I love the change his music has taken. This is a great album that I will be listening to and playing along with for a long time to come. Im looking forward to hearing more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year?","review":"I don't think this album will have enough commercial value for most people to accept it, but I believe this may be the best album I've heard all year. It proves that Cornell is pretty damn versatile. Listen to it about three or four times and you won't be able to get the tunes out of your head. They are great, especially Flutter Girl and Moonchild. While I'd have liked to see Soundgarden stay together, this is a great alternative. The only album I anticipate competing with it this year is a possible TOOL album. But that might not happen so right now Euphoria Morning is my pick for album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent summary to this decade's works of rock music","review":"Just a moment before the turn of the century, Chris Cornell has managed to sneak in this gem of rock music and to contribute his stellar voicing in a new truly amazing effort. The album takes diverse angles in rock music and proves Cornell has refined his musical directions and has established a concrete, mature style which shows a vivid promise to thrive on. The dazzling \\"Follow my way\\" and blues/progressive \\"When I'm down\\" will refuse to escape your minds, and the wonderful \\"Preaching to the End of the World\\" and tantilizing \\"Pillow Of Your Bones\\" and \\"Steel Rain\\" only prove this is a valuable purchase from one of the most gifted and promising forces in rock music industry today."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"it seems as though chris is missing help from a external producer on this album. he doesnt just let it flow. it becomes blah after the first 5 songs. it might be worth buying, but it certainly won't make anybodies top ten list."},{"rating":"2","title":"album of the year","review":"Most people who didnt' like this album where expecting a Soundgarden album. Which this is not, this album in my opinion is a natural progression in maturity for Cornell. He proves that he is and always was much more than the sum of all the past Soundgarden albums. With emotionally powerful songs like: Follow My Way, When I'm Down, and Wave Goodbye Euphoria Morning is nothing like and much more than Cornell's past work and is in my opinon a must have. There is nothing else in popular music today at this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euphoria Morning","review":"I have been a fan of Chris Cornell since he was in SG. I knew that this album would be different when I first heard \\"Can't Change Me\\", but I love it. CC's voice is absolutly amazing it is so powerful!

It is very listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"TODAY'S MOST REMARKABLE Singer-Singwriters","review":"I bought this new CD because I liked the Single \\"Can't Change Me\\" When I Heard it, I was Completely Blown Away!!!!!

I Highly recommended Chris Cornell as one of today's most remarkable singer-singwriters"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"As a non-Soundgarden fan, Euphoria Morning takes me in a big way. It's intense, emotional, and has great musical landscape. I can't wait to see where he goes from here... the \\"finale\\" lacks a certain disclosure, however, and more lateral musical diversity would make this even more amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornell hasn't lost it","review":"Soundgarden was Chris Cornell. Not that the other bandmates didn't contribute, but anyone who listened to Temple of the Dog and looked at the liner notes understood that Cornell contributed more than a voice. He was an arranger and a brilliant lyricist.He extends that further with Euphoria Morning. He still has the musical sensibilities that made Soundgarden a household name in the 90s. Looking forward to more of his musical offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy has a great voice","review":"I'm a \\"Superunknown\\" fan and I also really enjoy the \\"A - Sides\\" CD. Soundgarden was a great band, and if you listen to this guy's voice, you become aware of the large part he played in Soundgarden's success. Cornell, like Layne Staley of Alice In Chains, has a unique and charismatic voice. You marvel not so in the words, but how they are expressed. Most of the songs on this CD are very good. It is slower and more introspective than most of his Soundgarden recordings. If you liked Soundgarden, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 3","review":"I ordered 3 different books for my trip to Cape Town and this was by far the best, and the one I constantly came back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar!","review":"I'm a beginner guitar player, and this guitar is just perfect!

Unfortunately, those of us who have widescreen TVs will be forced to watch it in 4:3 ratio (which means that the picture is tiny - in the centre of the screen). The reason for this is that fairly large amounts of the film are (rightly so) in German and French, consequently, any attempt to blow the image up causes the subtitles for those languages to dissapear off the screen.If Fox had bothered to produce an anamorphic version of the film, then this would probably not be the case.Incidentally, Fox in their great and utter wisdom, for the Australian (Region 4) release of this film, although producing an anamorphic version, decided not to have any subtitles at all!Anyone watching this version for the first time must surely be totally mystified as to what was actually going on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Longest Day","review":"Very good DVD movie about the WWII with Classic stellar international cast.

By giving a perspective of both sides of the battle the viewer is able to receive the complete picture of the event. The black & white format used in this film is like the news-reels of the forties which makes for greater realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is definitely one of the best war movies ever made. I watch it every now and then when I think about the good old days when I used to play with my little Army men.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Top 100 Movies All Time","review":"I'm astounded by this movie. It has everything- action, grit, charm, humor, tension, drama- prepare to yell, gasp, laugh, and drop your jaw.I can't believe it was made 42 years ago. Aside from being black and white, its script, action, filmography, and direction are better than most action films today.If the Longest Day came out new today in 2004, it would be major news for weeks, top the box office, and win academy awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF EXTRA STUFF","review":"I am a fan of WWII movies. I was looking forward to the arrival of this two disk set. The Film is of course magnificent. I was looking forware to the addition stuff that now comes with DVDs, commentary, interviews, making of films, featurettes, etc. Afterall, there are lots of historians and others who will add to the filmit self.

The other matterial was also very poorly done as commpared to what is available on the History Chan and other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent for its time","review":"The Normandy battle looks like it was shot on some little beach in NJ and the comedy is just pointless.

He finally sat down to watch it tonight and I wish he hadn't. The DVD cuts out just before the final chapter and freezes the playback.

But watching this movie today is a really act of courage. It drags and drags, the three hours seem to never end. Also, even if they tried to give a view of the global situation, they failed miserably.The movie is an endless sequence of shell and fire sounds, a really pain.

Why? Because the movie is essentially a theaterical depiction of the invasion with virtually no character development ,no story line and no military stragey to show how planning was developed. John Wayne left me realing against his over-blown personality and silly manner.Others were just as bad.

You could actually compare this (and many other Past War Movies [Hollywoods recent fare notwithstanding]) to a History book, and see the dead on accuracy in the storytelling.Not only does it tell of each sides quest to stop each other, it has it's finer moments, with \\"Rupert\\" and his role in the attacks, the 5 cent toy that helped (or \\"killed\\") many GI's, and \\"personal\\" incidents, such as the Frenchmen at the beach, or even the fearless Nurse-Nuns...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Normandy Portrayed in Stark Detail","review":"I hold a B.A. in History, am a soldier, and have been to Normandy. I find that this movie, as much as it can in the time given, portrays the locations as actions of D-Day as well as any movie ever made. One can go to St. Mere Eglise today and see the replica 82nd Airborne Paratrooper hanging from the bell tower as illustrated in the film. One can visit Point du Hoc, and see the bombed out bunkers that the Rangers attacked, and one can see the results of the carnage of the beach fronts, Sword, Gold, Juno, Omaha, and Utah in the many grave above Omaha beach, and throughout the Normandy region. In my opinion, this classic film portrays the greatest military feat in history with dignity and accuracy in so much as was possible at the time it was made. Being shot in Black and White gives it a documentary feel. Each nationality represented speak their native language, adding to the realism. A wonderful movie for action fan and history buff alike! A definate keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, excellent, most excellent epic War Movie.","review":"The Longest Day has been made to an accurate scale. The all star cast is unbeatable, the battle scenes are utterly, fantastic! The invasion scenes were very accuratly done, the action is: Wow!. I think that this is an excellent film also because it does NOT treat all Germans as criminals, and portrays them as human beings, that can celebrate birthdays, play cards, joke around, as we all do. This film did NOT have to have the blood and guts, and the foul language, as Saving Private Ryan needed, in order to portray the film as was wanted. This film has merits all its own, and conveys the essence that is meant, while maintaining the position as being a movie for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Longest Day","review":"I am buying this dvd for the grandson for Christmas, so it is hard to say is it ok.

Moreover,based upon my reading of the history, the movie itself is, overall, a very true to fact rendition of the events of that day. And though not as grimly realistic as subsequent cinematic depictions of the events, it does capture the angst.For me the only disconcerting flaw in the rendition is the typical 1960's cinematic tendency to \\"cuteness\\". There are numerous examples, but the scene showing the two opposing files of Germans and American troops along a low wall was just too egregiously precious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Longest Day","review":"This is one of the best movies I own, fantastic actors, great scenes action straight through, and believe it or not the black & white is better, sharper than color.

My favorite actor in this movie was Roddy Mcdowall (Private Morris) he is the BEST actor ever, he did not apear in this movie alot, but the little bit that he was there, he made that small part seem so large, and it just capyures the eye of the beholder, although he is not with us anymore, he is entertaining angels in heaven, we will all miss him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Film , But...","review":"I adore this movie...LOVE it... easily one of the Greatest World War 2 movies ever. Full of great actors and memorable scenes..my favorite being Red Skelton as the unlucky Para caught by his parachute on the church steeple, helplessly watching as all his buddies get picked off...an awesome scene. My only gripe about this movie is the lack of recognition of all the Canadians who played such a significant part in D-Day, especially on Juno Beach. Bizarrely, the Free-French forces get their own sub-plot in the movie...but where the bloody hell were the Candians in this otherwise fantastic film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"D Day Invasion of Europe","review":"A well told story of the events leading to the Invasion of Europe in June of 1944. Acting, for the most part, is excellent. Even in black and white background scenes appear authentic. Some of the acting, such as John Wayne and Richard Burton's, is a little iffy in places. They both look tired and a little out of place. Overall, an excellent film that dramatizes the complexities of one of the most massiveinvasions in 20th century warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best war film I have ever seen","review":"My wife and I have watched this series about twice a year for the past 3 years. The characters seem like old friends. When ever we see a cast member in another role we comment on it.It is superbly done and is a credit to Tom Hanks, Stephen Spielberg, and to HBO.

No wonder it never received any publicity when it was released last year!First of all, they should have called this movie \\"New Jersey\\" because most of the movie was filmed there! Secondly, this movie just validates the fact that Staten Island is filled with gangsters, gangster wannabes, white trash, and morons.Vincent D'Onofrio (who's most famous movie role was Private Leonard \\"Gomer Pyle\\" Lawrence in Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\") was especially awful in his role as a mentally unbalanced gangster. Ethan Hawke's performance as a septic tank cleaner was ok, but it was a far cry from his performance with Denzel Washington in \\"Training Day\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not worth even a rental let alone a buy.","review":"This has to be one of the most poorly written and poorly shot movies I have ever seen in my whole life.

This book has *nothing* to do with Linux, and nothing to do with distributed applications. All the ideas are java web applications such as an online catalog, web based bug tracking, and an XML database backup utility. Why would you need to do *ANY* of those things, are they distributed, and what do they have to do with Linux? The answer is of course: You don't, they aren't, and they've got nothing to do with Linux. There aren't words strong enough to describe how strongly I recommend against this book.

This lineup features big names Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter, and also well-regarded Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, and Jymie Merritt. The lineup's promising, and the songs are very solid. They seem pretty even to me, I don't want to name the best and worst songs, because my opinion is hardly set into stone. There are also bonus versions of four of the six songs. The original album at 40 minutes is a decent length. The thing that makes this a 4-star CD is that there aren't any GREAT songs, they're merely all good.

I'd like to know where she is! I have been doing it for a couple of weeks now on a regular basis and my spine feels great, flexible and stronger. I highly recommend it.

It works because her yoga is so good...she truly has her own style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"The poses and stretches in this video are great for someone who is just starting out. The instructor does a good job of displaying the poses and she gives alternate poses for people who might have difficulty with some aspect of a certain pose. The music is also very nice. The only gripes I have are really just a matter preference. Her accent is quite noticeable, and although it is not difficult to understand what she is saying, it is distracting to me at times. Also, her outfit changes about every 8 or nine minutes and that is a little distracting too.I would definitely recommend it though, especially since the price is manageable."},{"rating":"2","title":"calming","review":"This dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing. Her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange, takes some getting use to. It kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time I put it in! This is the dvd I like to use before I go to my yoga class for some reason. I guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up.

Beautiful scenery also."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be difficult for some beginners","review":"Wai Lana's Yoga: Beginner's Workout, much like her Relaxation Workout, is very calming; however, some of the stretches and asanas that require balancing on one leg may be difficult for some beginners (like me).

The quality anthropology aspects that Mr wa Thiong'o builts in his books (like many other African writers too) makes the reader come into the setting and be part of it. The book managed to win my sympathy for the 'oppresed' Kikukyu and reminded me of the many evils done to the colonised people all over the world. Christianity seems not able to escape blame in the whole operation because of its readiness to inflict suffering to the people so that they could join the religion.Today the book is still relevant, though the position of the whites has been taken by the ruling class and the rich.The book is worth reading in any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River Between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo (available from Amazon)","review":"The River Between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo is a very interesting novel.

As a rapper, I'm very appalled to see this cd in the stores and i'd be very embarrassed to rap over any of these low-rent knock-offs.

The--ahem--imaginative impressions of period Regency costume look almost laughably colorful and polyester compared to the more historically accurate period films that have come out in recent years, but overall, I still enjoy this movie. The DVD unfortunately has no special features, but it's hard to complain when a practically forgotten musical finally gets re-released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra collection","review":"Loved this movie for the fantastic wardrobe!!!

I could get past the horrid 70s fashion and Barbra Streisand not being one of my favorites and the interspersed music throughout - again, that is until 30 minutes from the end. I could get pass the hokey plot, the hokey past-life scenes, the bad love choices, but the end was unnecessary and unnecessarily drawn out. And then, to add insult to injury, they go their separate ways? What kinda unhappy ending to a musical is that? Aren't musicals supposed to be uplifting and inspiring? This musical was DEPRESSING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Thoughtful","review":"This was a very fun and thoughtful movie.

Even uninterested boyfriends walking through the flat stopped to say \\"wow, look at that picture.\\" And the film itself is actually much more charming and fun than I had remembered. Streisand, especially in the astonishing Cecil Beaton costumed scenes, looks, well, gorgeous too. I don't know much about the history of the shooting of this film, but it feels as if there must be tons of the contemporary day Daisy footage left on the cutting room floor -- e.g, Jack Nicholson just drifts in and out of the film with no purpose at all of being there. Unfortunately, there are no extras at all on this disc. But again, what a transfer. Let's hope Paramount does as good a job with Julie Andrews' DARLING LILI in April 2005 (with extras!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the power back","review":"I'd be pretty happy for the rest of my life if I never had to see this movie again. I hated everything about it. Barbara's hair in it was a real drag. The whole story was just stupid. Every time they would start to sing I would get this sinking feeling and it really put me one step closer to the edge. I can take a musical I sapose if the lyrics are at least cleaver and up beat, but this movie didn't have any of that. The songs are long and lame. this movie was really bad. Big truck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babs looks great","review":"While the film was edited from its original form, just the sight of Babs in those Cecil Beaton gowns is worth the 5 star rating.

Some of the best footage of Babs ever filmed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Streisand","review":"If I could give this movie 10 stars, I would. This is definitive Streisand. The story is so innovative and well written, the performances are wonderful and the songs, well, they're just so classic and so superbly performed by Barbra.

Her success is credited to aggressive hype, product positioning, and a talented marketing team. The songs have no regard for originality, depth, or innovation, and they're cleverly packaged for ignorant, ghetto children who gaze at the television watching \\"106 & Park.\\" Her singles, like this one, are played to [much] on the radio, and they blare out of towering, life-size speakers at these trendy hip hop clubs. She accepts awards named after well-established divas, even though she hasn't established herself as an artist and doesn't even possess any real stage presence... People, the madness must stop, and we have the power to control the fate of popular music.

Apart from a strong start this movie couldn't overcome its premise of a man awaking to discover the world he lives in is his own (or so it seems). After the initial wow factor has passed this movie plods along with corny acting and some silly plot twists before culminating in an unsatisfying finale. Not a total writeoff but nowhere near as good as On the Beach or some of the other New Zealand films I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quiet Earth","review":"Interesting premise in which a worldwide electronic network kills off almost all of the population, leaving only a few persons who had been involved in unique circumstances (no spoiler data here, so the viewer must wait until near the end of the film to discover why these few were spared).Not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but it passed the time on a rainy afternoon. The plot is fairly well defined but none of the three characters elicited much empathy--there seemed to be little chemistry between them. Still, the twists held our interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential but","review":"I love the concept of being the last or almost last person on earth. This was just not my type of movie.

It was excellent, and I spent years trying to track it down on videotape, then more years waiting for the DVD. I always wondered if the similarity of the experiment in the movie to the present day, secrecy shrouded, Tesla based HAARP experiment by the US government was one of the reasons it was so hard to find, but then I do love my conspiracy theories. I think the US does have a HAARP array in Australia, they do have a bunch of antennas that may or may not be connected to HAARP there.It can't be that it was hard to find because of the quality, it's a great movie, and based on the ebay bids when I bought it on tape, lots of people think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet Earth","review":"I wasn't expecting much for a low budget New Zealand movie but was pleasantly surprised.

Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Over-Dramatic","review":"While many people seem to have fond memories of this 1985 film (based on the high ratings), I am baffled as to why.Watching for the first time this year (2008), Quiet Earth comes off as campy, over-dramatic, and just flat out cheesy. The special effects seem like something out of a 60's movie, the actors do things relational-wise that are on a whim, without showing motivation. And the ending is muddled and doesn't explain the last 90 minutes. As the credits role, we are presented with an image that leaves us completely baffled as to what happened. Is the actor in Heaven, or an alternate reality?Who knows? ...but better yet, who cares.Frankly, the best part of the movie was Alison Routledge revealing her perfect backside in scene 10.

The inspector of the title is interesting in how dated he now appears; consistently polite and apologetic in his work, and lord of the manor at home. He is embroiled in what seems like a fairly straightforward murder which turns out to be devilishly confusing--but, alas not that interesting for the reader. Matsumoto switches back and forth between the investigation and a group of young, new intellectuals who are darlings of Tokyo's media. Obviously the twain shall meet, but it's not very satisfying when they do. Matsumoto relies altogether too much on coincidences and unlikely convenient relationships to bring things to a solution. Not a book that will make me seek out others by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even women may enjoy this movie","review":"Crossfire Trail is a film that even women will enjoy; it's a return to the old days of cowboys with honor and a great shootout at the end. The cast is excellent, with Mark Harmon adding another outstanding job as a villain to his resume. But to me the primary reason to see it is the up-and-coming young actor Christian Kane, who plays J.T. Langston, one of Tom's sidekicks. Girls, watch for the woodchopping scene!!!

This unit is grossly underpowered in comparison to the 4.8v model. Perhaps due to the blade/gear configuration necessary to accommodate both attachments. The shrub trimmer attachment is virtually useless as well, due to its size. Plus it's a bit dangerous - the handle was not designed to be used with this type of attachment. Given the proximity of the blade to the guard-less handle, one slip, or mistakenly grabbing the handle with 2 hands (as one normally holds a shrub trimmer), could lead to a serious injury.

I assumed that Cynthia Rothrock would be one of the main characters throughout the whole movie, instead she had a small part. I was very disappointed because I am a Cynthia Rothrock fan. Otherwise, since I am a martial artist and I like martial art movies I recommend this movie. It contains good fighting scenes as well as a good plot, and an interesting kung fu style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiger Claws 3","review":"For anyone hoping to see Cynthia Rothrock reprise her roles in Tiger Claws One and Two, this movie will be disappointing. Ms. Rothrock makes only a cameo appearance in this film. One gets the definite impression that her appearance was more about box office than about improving the film. The movie itself is not the worst of its genre. Although there is some woefully sad acting in the non-fighting segments. The action is pretty good with Jalal Merhi serving as the protagonist. Cynthia fans would only want this video to complete their collection, not for the pitiful amount of time she appears in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a CR movie !!!!!!","review":"Well if you're looking for Cynthia Rothrock action in this movie, there is none.

I was a senior management student and after reading this book, I understood that during the past four years; I was not introduced to Ken Blanchard, and this masterpiece book.I will keep it short. This book is actually not a book, it is an advisor when you need one, it is a friend who approves or shows you what to do in some common, but real life situations in business life. This book, I suggest, should be read by everybody (not necessarily only by managers or supervisors or employees but everyone who lives a social life) because it teaches you how to communicate with people. It is so easy to read, and one should read after and after so that the principles and ways are embedded and implemented by the readers. Thank you Ken Blanchard and his co-authors for writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for new managers","review":"I bought this book for my husband and he found it very useful.

Managers will take three precepts from this book: Efficient Goal Setting with employees, Praise, and Reprimands. In other words, make sure your people know precisely what they are to do, and then give them feedback whether they meet those expectations or not. That's it. Simple and effective.

This is not one of them.Managers who follow the guidelines in the book will be far removed from the goings on of the business. They'll be disconnected. They won't form true relationships with the people working for them.This book teaches a crippling minimalist approach to dealing with people. But dealing with people is the most important thing a manager does. It shouldn't be minimized or marginalized.To be fair, the book isn't all bad. It's just mostly bad. The few gems it has are very basic and covered in more much detail by other, better books.If you want something better, look at something along the lines of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Crucial Conversations, or Good to Great. These are all examples of good management books, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Minute Manager, One lifetime of benefits.....","review":"Wonderful book.

My store manager recommended that I read this book, because it was helpful to him when dealing with people. When the book arrived, I thought I'd start reading it before bed. Not the case. I layed down for bed and read the whole book, cover to cover. I didn't know it was going to be in \\"story\\" form - which was kind of cheesy - it almost turned into the Wizard of Oz at one point. I was expecting a non-fiction book. But I must say, it was semi-helpful. I use the \\"One minute reprimands\\" and \\"One minute appraisal\\" techniques alot now, and have been complimented by other managers who overhear them, which makes me think reading this book was not a mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that Dilbert warned you about...","review":"I once worked for a boss who swore by this book, although I think he quoted it more as a justification to constantly issue \\"reprimands\\" to his subordinates (turnover rates in his office were quite high).The book has a very oversimplified and condescending tone, and attempts inflate the \\"veteran manager\\" into some sort of sage-like fountain of knowledge (I have yet to meet such a seemingly wise, all-knowing manager like the one in this book).Dilbert owes much of his popularity to fed-up employees working under the thumb of managers who mindlessly latch onto management fads such as this book.If you really want to expand your mind, read *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad and *The Dilbert Principle* by Scott Adams after reading this book.

People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people. However, I'm not one of them. At the time of reading I had no management experience at all, so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something.

A couple of common sense ideas, nothing new.

I can not understand how this book has so much hype. A couple of days after reading nothing new remained in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it is short","review":"\\"The One Minute Manager\\" purports to give the reader instructions on managing work and life. It does that, but the advise is so obvious and the instruction so superficial as to make reading even this short volume a waste of time.The advice is to give employees clear instructions, then praise them when they do well, and reprimand them when they do not. That is nearly the whole book. Now you don't have to read it.While this advise seems correct to me, it is also very obvious. I would think that any manager who does not already know this needs more help then this book can provide.In any case the book can not do much harm since it is short."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE BOOK, BUY ONE FOR YOUR BOSS","review":"THIS IS THE BOOK I WISH MY PAST LEADERS HAD READ.

Actually, \\"The One Minute Manager\\" IS as easy to read as \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\". I love the \\"story book\\" format that is used to tell the tale of this enigmatic character who calls himself a one-minute-manager. The other character, a young man on a quest to learn what makes a good manager, who subsequently encounters the one-minute-manager, reminds me of Columbo who asks questions and investigates tirelessly until he finds answers.

I tried to pull some value from it, but it just wasn't in there. During the 30 minutes it took to read this (yes, it's that short), I found myself starting to feel bad for the authors. Kind of in the way you feel bad for a child that does something totally incorrectly, but her parents don't want to hurt her feelings, so they give unwarranted praise instead.

He showed he is as dedicated an employee as there ever was and worked like crazy to get better at his job. After all his dedication he ends up with very little self confidence. And even worse, his boss replies, \\"I can't afford to fire you.\\" She jokes about how much they have invested in his training.

It is the highlight of the film.There is a nothing story about three guys into Internet porn, making music, eating, and hanging around looking beautiful in Speedos. There is a murder subplot, which is laughably filmed, like the rest of the movie. All of it is poorly done, poorly pieced together, and totally unsatisfying.It might be worth a rental to check it out. I would suggest you keep your finger on the fast forward button.

The author, month-by-month, lists typical discomforts alongside extremely rare complications thus alarming the pregnant woman that this could likely be her fate. He does not inform her that the likelihood of having one of these problems is very rare. I would have rather have seen a listing somewhere else in the book of such possibilities and the symptoms to watch for. Rather than have this book at all, I recommend Gentle Birth Choices, Birthing From Within or anything by Sheila Kitzinger. All were written by women with the approach that birth is a normal, natural physiologic state for the pregnant woman.

Reviews spoke of decent graphics and great transition of the puzzles for which p'n'c-ers are notorious. Sadly, it just didn't seem so. The graphics and entire gameplay reminded me of a text adventure and the first real puzzle didn't come about until I was halfway into the game. The only real similarity seemed to be in the use of items in conjunction with the environment. Gameplay wasn't intuitive as one was given multiple clues at a time, yet expected to follow only a specific one-- Both Spain and Syria are mentioned at one point; however, if you decide to hoof it to Spain, the game's over for you. Syria doesn't appear on the map, you lose without even the dignity of a \\"Game Over\\" screen.Essentially, \\"Broken Sword\\" seems to hold a lot of promise in terms of plot and adventure; but, as a hasty transition to the GBA system, it's just lost all its glitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adventure game","review":"This game is very excellent.I say this because the graphics come out very good and you in Paris on a mission.You have to visit places and talk to people.Some people will give you true information,and some will give false leading you to traps and trouble.One other good reason is that the game is probaly be the most popular game for the GBA.This is also the way most GBA games should be made instead of very short levels that will get you trapped.The two problems with this game is that some places are too colorful and if you dont go to Syria and go to spain you will find yourself stuck,so you might want to go to Syria before you go to Spain.This game is very cool so you might want to get this game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game sucks!!!","review":"This game is way to hard!You dont get to fight at all.But there is this one part were this man will give you one of those things when you ask someone to shake your hand and they get shocked by the hand buzzer thats in your hand.Nobody shakes your hand when you ask them to on the game!!!It only works once on this man named Khan yhat wants to shake your hand before shooting you with his gun(He doesnt know you have a hand buzzer).Doent by this game!!!It really sucks!!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"have not seen it. would not play here in NC or in Indiana","review":"I bought this movie along with several others.

The acting is great and the action is fast paced.I'm amused at some of the negative reviews which object to the implausibility of the plot (actually it's preposterous, an agent selected for her cooking of apple strudel and compote) and the relative absence of the violent destruction of the war. Hey, it's not an historical documentary, it's entertainment!Since it was made in 1992, it mercifully isn't tainted with gratuitous politically correct pandering to liberals' self-adulatory conceits.

Modern viewers not interested in the 'Old School' films will appreciate these contemporary actors in their roles. Melanie Griffith actually ACTS as more than a squeaky voiced, collagen lipped piece of fluff. Michael Douglas' credentials should have made this movie more well known but still, no one knows about it. Well, surprise...! It's a really good film. Part espionage, part suspense, part adventure, part love story (chick-flick) and every bit of it is well done. I defy anyone to watch it and not have praise for it after.

Can the same close-knit group of spies be on different sides without any one of them noticing or having it cause any of them problems except the heroine?

I wasn't very interested in the individual acting performances, as much as I was in the story itself. I haven't been able to find many movies that were done in the WWII setting as this one was, so that was a unique, refreshing perspective in and of itself.The \\"Romance\\" element is essential to any war story, so putting it up front in the movie set the tone for everything else, to me. Even the conflict caused by Liam Neeson's character, which showed some humanity within the borders of 1940's Germany, was a nice change from the expected ruthlessness that's typical in these settings.I'm obviously not a professional critic. Not even close. I'm a typical guy that likes good movies and good stories. I didn't even know that this movie was based on a novel. I don't wanna know. All I know is that the movie works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrorwork","review":"The book was practically in mint condition--the only sign it had been used was a slight crease in the cover.

Oz Shy is a wonderful example of someone I consider a Rock Star even though he is less recognizable than Tirole and others. The reason for this comes from his ability to write clearly for both undergraduates and graduates and distill the key features of seminal models into accessible chunks of intuition, with no more math than necessary. I also recommend his book on Network Economics for all undergraduate and graduate students in Industrial Economics. If you get bogged down in Tirole, you'll feel like Oz Shy is breath of fresh air - these book can be read cover to cover or as a tool box of models. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Reading","review":"I have had this book going on my third year and I've enjoyed it from day one. I was browsing through the bookstore one day and came across One Year with Jesus. I thought it was a neat concept to be able to get a dose of the gospels each day. I think this is one of the most important parts of the Bible and this book has presented it very well. Each day contains a small reading from the Gospel, a paragraph of more indepth study of that particular reading, and a \\"make you think\\" section, with inspiring words to make you really incorporate the lesson into your life. I continue to read it each day and have not gotten tired of it even after almost three years. The writing is clear and understandable, for any mature age. It makes a great gift for anyone looking to help someone take that step into faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"Anyone seeking a daily spiritual reading would be very pleased.

It has certainly helped me center each day in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chronology","review":"The Gospels are where we learn the most about the life of Jesus. The Gospels each present a different view with different emphasis. This devotional allows us to proceed through the life of Jesus in a one year daily reading and study.

It was discovered in a can right after SNDN 1 was made, and what luck. Oh, the luck. The flashbacks were an exact fit with the 1984 \\"prequel\\" and the modernistic cars they used in '67 just happened to have been manufactured and sold, providing a seamless mesh with the prequel. The original purpose of this movie was two-fold: First, it was of course produced by the California Teachers Association in an effort to inspire children to make greater efforts to complete their homework assignments while at home, instead of watching movies. Second, it was to presell SNDN 3 through the use of Sister Mary. Whoa! We hope SHE will be back. Her 5-star scream at the end of this 1-star movie is all that kept the censors from killing this product due to X-rated dreariness. LATE_BREAKING GOOD NEWS!

Then he talks about his deadly obsessive lifestyle. After that he decides to wear the santa suit and goes on a killing spree. Where do the people get the cash to make trashy movies like this?? Trying to borrow seasonal traditions of such slasher films as \\"Halloween\\",\\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"My Bloody Valentine\\", and even \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\", this movie is the pits and deserves to get burned.

While Jensen's prose style is immensely readable, the substance of Language Older Than Words is challenging stuff! It becomes necessary for the reader to abandon judgement and trust in Jensen's sincerity if she hopes to wrap her mind around what are oftentimes strange concepts and horrifying experiences. I found it impossible to read this work without stopping every other page to evaluate the world and my own life and compare that experience with the world Jensen describes. What I found is that Jensen, when he is not wandering away in emotional diatribe, is dead-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Language Older than Words","review":"This was the most affirming book I've ever read. It provided ammunition for what the Earth and our bodies already know and unfortunately struggle to be known. I bought it only so I could loan it to as many people as possible. This book comes to us while Jensen still identifies with pacifism, which we see wane necessarily as he writes more books. I consider this a must-read, no matter one's politics. Utterly insightful and vital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book buries good ideas","review":"This work reads like a transcript of a conversation with a stoned guy sitting on the couch who's worried about the environment. I wanted to like this; I thought Jensen was supposed to be a dangerous, radical thinker who strikes at the bedrock of civilization. The book might as well have been two sentences: \\"We're destroying the planet because we can't recognize it as a living thing that communicates with us and of which we are a part. Let me tell you about this really cool thing that happened with me and some animals one day.\\" Jensen's critique might posture as radical, but his largely humorless tone never rises above mild concern and his language is lackluster. I suspect that might be the point: the book's mediocrity is intentional, seeking the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who cares about our collective future","review":"If I could afford it, I would GIVE copies of this book away. I believe it is that important. If polls are to be believed, the majority of Americans say they are concerned about the environment, but few of us manage to live up to our convictions. Jensen's book is so compelling that has the power to push readers from complacency to activism in a quiet, but forceful manner.What is truly unique about this book is the manner in which Jensen discusses his own journey to personal activism. He spent years numbing himself to the sexual abuse inflicted upon him by father. He sees the same processes at work in our destructive relationship to the environment. Learning to treat each othe with greater respect and learning to appreciate the natural living environment, he argues, are irrevocably linked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing...","review":"There were times when reading \\"A Language Older Than Words\\" when I wanted to shout passages from Derrick Jensen's book as loudly as I could. Surely everyone needs to hear this message: we are destroying the planet. We must stop. But beyond this \\"message\\" also lies another revelation, one that has changed my life forever: all living things have something to say, we just don't do a very good job of listening. Everyone knows that talking to plants helps them to grow, right? Well, then it should be no great leap of understanding to realize that plants can help us grow, too, and not just by producing oxygen...

I unfortunately waited too long (> 30 days) to return the bent one, so I guess I'm stuck with it. You pretty much get what you pay for here: a cheap way to pretty accurately measure stuff.

When I received the calipers the quality was even worse than I was expecting. Many of the measurement surfaces were rough machined with poor surface finish and flatness. The tolerances were so loose you easily move the measuring surfaces out of parallel and even out of allignment with each other. The sliding action was very jerky and prone to binding. Any one of these issues would cause a problem with accuracy and repeatability - together they make the calipers worthless to me. Furthermore, none of the machined edges were broken (polished) so there were some very sharp edges that would most likely cut your hands as you use the calipers.When I decided to purchase this caliper I figured even if they were poorly made I would keep them as a backup.

Handy size for legnth/width and depth measurements. The jaw allows internal/external measurments of round objects like pipe and tubing. The projecting rod allows depth and height measurements like setting a circular saw blade. For the price, repetitive accuracy is excellent per zero set for the reloader checking case legnth. Most precision measurements don't require beyond six inches so this tool is pocketable (IF you don't drop it.)

Certainly the worst tool. Don't waste your time with this poorly designed and cheaply made tool.Pro: Seems to be accurate when it works.Cons:- Throw the case away immediately. It'll hit your \\"on\\" button and run down your battery.- It doesn't take much for it to stop working. Flashing random numbers, according to the manual, means the battery is getting low. Well it must get low pretty quickly. On the 2nd battery it lasted 3 weeks, with zero use."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap version","review":"this thing is effective but it is cheap as reflected in the price.

The item I received was nicked, scratched, and even slightly bent. The whole unit was dirty and did not slide smoothly.

Its nice that it has an on/off switch as well as measuring in inches or mm's. My husband has used it also without complaint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these calipers. I just needed something to give me some measurements since all I had was rulers to measure by. The calipers soome to be accurate enough. I haven't had them calibrated (and they are not calibrated by the manufacturer), but by all accounts, if it is off, it couldn't be by more than a couple thousandths. They're not real smooth to use, but I have been able to look past that.The extra battery was a nice plus, but the case is impressive. In my opinion, the $11 I paid for this set was worth it just to get the case. It's a hard plastic case and I feel secure luggin my calipers around inside them.All-in-all, I have no problems using these calipers. For the price, I would recommend them to anyone that needed a pair, unless you need one for engineering that is calibrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The not accurate at all, constantly resets itself randomly, and it grinds when moving because the part is bent. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap! You get what you pay for!","review":"I am pretty upset that the first person who reviewed this item is the person who convinced me to buy it. The calipers are not smooth and they don't come with a certificate of calibration, which pretty much renders these completely useless unless you are using this for your own hobby at home and don't need them to be calibrated. Do not use these if you are an engineer who needs verification that these are calibrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, but no fraction support","review":"The build quality on this caliper is quite good (especially at the price). Mine has no discernible play in the mechanism, came with an extra battery and a reasonably beefy plastic case, and zeros out steadily without any display jumpiness. The unit I received is branded \\"Maxwell\\".Note that this caliper does *not* have fraction support in the display, and is therefore somewhat annoying to use compared to units that are only slightly more expensive.If you're completely strapped or buying these in bulk for basic uses, you won't be unhappy with your purchase. If you're a hobbyist looking for a single inexpensive but high-functionality unit, do yourself a favor and spend the extra few dollars to get one with fraction support."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality caliper","review":"This item arrived with an extra piece of broken plastic inside the box, the item itself wasn't broken but the rolling piece that is use to move the caliper is loose and very low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very accurate","review":"I am sorry to say that this caliper is not very accurate. I know for a fact that some of the beads I buy may vary slightly however not to the point this caliper says and trust me Swarovski Crystals are pretty darn accurate in size when they say 8mm it is 8mm so on these other beads I do not know if I should go up or down in number and I need the number for my program in the computer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not but this Caliper!!!! zero points jumps off by 0.2 inch in and out!!","review":"If I can, I will put in 0 star for this caliper. It has no stable zero point, every time I zero it in and measure something and come back to zero, it jumps off by either 0.2 inch, 0.4 inch, or 0.6 inch. It's accuracy is worse than a 30-feet tape.I do not believe that Amazon allows this kind of product to be sold on its website.What a shame!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap and accuarate!!!","review":"For the price this unit was exactly what I needed. Both batteries that came with it were in fine shape and the carrying case is a nice touch. I bought this for my reloading set but have found many more uses for it. Cheap and accurate what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"For the cost, it's a good product that does what I need it to do at the needed accuracy level. That said, the quality and build is not stellar. The finger wheel slider was extremely loose to the point that it would not move the caliper unless an undue amount of pressure was applied, which was going to annoy me to the point of not wanting to use it. I solved the problem by taking it apart and placing a small piece of rubber (cut from a grommet) underneath the wheel, which is kept firmly in place when the calipers were re-assembled. Now it works and feels almost as good as the expensive ones I use in the shop at work. Definitely worth 12 bucks if you're willing to give it some extra attention. If not, spend the extra money and get a more expensive one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well after you replace the batteries","review":"All the batteries supplied with this was too low in charge (it came with a set of spare one and a set installed). It took me a while to figure out why i kept getting inaccurate readings, different even when measuring the same item. After replacing the batteries the measurement readings were much more stable. I compared this to a mm ruler I have and it seemed to be accurate. It measures in millimeters and inches. This is a great unit, for the price it cannot be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pit Bull 6\\" LCD Digital Caliper","review":"This Caliper works, but it is not as smooth on the sliding surfacesas I'm used to.

The precision probably isn't top notch, but you'd use a micrometer for that anyway. They're durable enough when kept in their case that I have no problem throwing them into a backpack. They won't compare to a nice pair of Browne & Sharpe Calipers or something on that caliper but they're good for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have if your going to reload","review":"I used it to check my rounds.

With a bit of Teflon lubrication it slides better. I had to re-zero it fairly often before.Being a new tool, I felt the need to check it very often. In doing so, discovered it was not reliable after 1 minute. Maybe the batteries? It came with 1 extra (thank you), tried it, same results...I have changed the battery type to a silver oxide battery, and have way better results. And consistency.Overall, I got a cheap digital caliper. Which is what I was looking for. But it really ended up being a pretty good instrument after some tweaks. Changed my previous rating to a 4 now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I'm not certain if some people received products from a different manufacturer or lot, but my product is excellent. It is very sturdy, strong construction and has tested as being accurate in it's measuring ability. My original battery arrived working as well. I've had no issues with it at all.

When I received the product the display randomly changing numbers, but I thought it might be because it was cold from being left out side by the delivery person. After leaving it at room temperature for a few hours it started to work better. I was able to turn it on and zero it out without the numberschanging. After about a minute though the display starts flashing and then the numbers will start randomly changing again. This is the worst caliper I have ever seen and I don't know how they could have done such a terrible job in building it. I would not recommend this product to any one even if they needed a caliper for just a one time use. If you plan to use a caliper often or need a quality one then I would recommend spending the money towards a good $40 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great value","review":"I just got this today as an Xmas present. I also got a feeler guage set too.First impression was that the caliper seemed well built. Not cheap feeling or looking at all. Doesn't look or feel like a $10 caliper. I tested its accuarcy using the feeler guage set..025-.010 was perfect..008-.005 was off by .001Past that, the caliper was unusable, but that level of performance still far exceeds my needs and expectations. Anyone that needs a caliper to measure something smaller than .005 needs to spend more than $10. I use mine primarily to measure brake components, set up guitars, and calibrate power tools. This caliper is MORE than capable of these functions. I'm 100% satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy, even for ~$10 shipped","review":"My 'copy' came from a bearing place.

The text is from 1820 and with that the writing style and vocabulary is different than that of today and takes some getting used to. However, if anyone remembers the 1949 Disney adaptation of this story, the film is very true to the book.

The archaic language was difficult to follow in places, and there wasn't much actual story. Irving very much liked to go off on tangents, describing things in detail when it wasn't needed (not to say the descriptions were poorly done, simply that they shouldn't have been there). To put the actual story on paper, it would probably fill half a page.That being said, it's nice to sometimes read older works- it's a way to 'cleanse the palette', as it were.As for the actual Kindle edition- there were a number of glitches in the type (letters replaced by random symbols).

I have the movie version by Tim Burton but had never read the original tale by Washington Irving so I thought it would be fun to see how close to the original it was. The names are the same but there is definitely some poetic license taken in writing the movie. The book leaves more for the imagination and allows you to make up your mind whether there was something supernatural at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting? Not at all.","review":"Ugly. That's one word that describes Sleepy Hallow. Set in a unbelievably fake place of Tarry Town (sounds a lot like Toon Town), Irving parallels the events in Sleepy Hollow with those after the American Revolution.Expressing his views of knowledge in a world of open frontier, Irving repeatedly allows Brom Bones' to get the best of Icabod Crane. Bones' a burly and muscular man often wins the heart of Katrina, a woman who Crane, a scrawny intellect, is in love with. More than often, Crane is ridiculed while Bones' is idolized. Ivring strongly comments on the unimportance of intelligence in a world that is in its early stages of evolving from nature.The plot is basic and the characters are static. Little change is found within the characters, and the plot is more than predictable. So save yourself some time, and get some sleep instead of reading Sleepy Hallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Spooky Story, Beautiful Art","review":"The story is an adaptation of the original, more or less a hybrid of the old Disney cartoon and the Sleepy Hollow movie starring Johnny Depp, but Gris Grimly's art brings this tale to life. The format borders on graphic novel and the hardcover edition is absolutely beautiful. This book is perfect for Halloween, rearing Gothic children or unusual fairy tale collectors like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now a Drama","review":"This season really took the show from a comedy to a drama. I was a huge fan of HIMYM, however this last season left me feeling sad after nearly every episode. I rarely laughed, far different from the first few seasons that had me laughing out loud nearly the entire time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have been wondering where this show was going....","review":"This season will give you insight. The show grows up a little with this season. There are many twists and turns, and it has been my absolute favorite season of the show. The show was starting to get dull with the same outcome, until mid season 6, and season 7 continues the greatness. It is fresh and taking a direction that is needed to keep the show going for another season or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"How I Met Your Mother season 7","review":"The product arrived in a timely manor and ran I had no problems running it.

Why? Because they did what 95% of other shows don't: they tied up nearly every loose end from every season. While at times I felt like this season was disjointed, and some of the characters didn't grow, or even regressed, they have prepared for the end... IN my opinion next season could be the final hurrah. I love this show to the bottom of my heart, but I don't want this show to turn into the last seasons of ER... They need to end on a high note, and soon. I don't want to lose one of my favorite shows to the demons of poor writing, and lack of ideas.

It's much smaller than it looks in the picture. The vinegar is supposed to go in the middle but in reality I use more vinegar than oil when I am dressing a salad so this portioning did not work for me.The vinegar kept needing to be refilled. It is hard to get clean. I first put it in the dishwasher but it came out with oil residue on the inside. Then I soaked it in soapy water but still there was oil residue on the inside.

She was horrified to see Honey Pie and the other ponies locked up in a cage, despite the ponies ultimate escape. Needless to say, my daughter took an active dislike to this video and insisted that the DVD be banished from our home. Moms beware. This release does not hold true to the sweet stories typical in the first three Strawberry Shortcake VHS/DVD titles. I don't know what DiC Enterprises was thinking when they tinkered with the format. If future releases continue in this fashion, we will not be buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Child Of the 80's","review":"Strawberry Shortcake was my Favorite thing when I was little. So, naturally, I started looking for some of the old movies for my little girl. I really don't like the new look of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, but bought this DVD for my daughter anyway. I love the smell of the DVD case, it smells just like my SSC doll that blows kisses that I got when I was 5. But the stories are really stupid, and the songs are painfully done. I don't know why they had to dumb it down so much. I personally miss the cuteness of the classic, as well as Sour Grapes and the Purple Pie Man. The villain in this is just rediculous. My daughter does like the first story, but won't watch the second one,(She's 3) the bad guy really bugs her. So, I am back to searching for the classics.

The dunks are cool and all, but it seems like thats all it is. I would say rent the game (or buy if you really want to) and play the game with your friends. I got sick of the game after a few hours. The game mode is limited to just playing 'games'. No specials like practice mode, making plays, or duck contests (oddly enough is what this game is mostly about 'The dunks').

If your listening through headphones, don't bother using the left earcup, there's nothing there. The right cup is filled with overpowering analog hiss. I could barely hear the dialog. It's not letterboxed or widescreened, it's full screened, or rather left hand justified. If there is any action where the camera has to move quickly to follow it (and there is), the pixils rudely take over. What a mess. If you're a hardcore Caan fan, perhaps you'll suffer through this. The majority of the movie is narrated by some 35 year old woman attempting an 89 yr. old voice. How does it end? I don't know. At around 23 minutes, my DVD crapped out and my player was audibly struggling to find a track. The only difference between this DVD and my DVD of \\"Boy in the plastic bubble\\" is \\"Bubble\\" at least played till the end. I just started a new catagory on my DVD shelf.

I don't even remember the title. In searching for that I stumbled on this and was refreshed to know how this fits in with my faith. I truly believe God creates us all beautifully and understanding each persons core way of thinking (through the enneagram) helps me to view others through Jesus eyes with a more caring spirit. There were a few areas were I felt it wasn't truly biblically based but they were few and far between. Overall, a VERY enlightening read, one that I will reread and reuse many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a true Christian/Catholic","review":"The Enneagram is still popular even after decades of debunking its basis. Fr. Mitch Pacwa learned about the Enneagram when he was in seminary in the 1970's. He says he was involved in every kind of New Age thinking, but later realized what a waste of time all this was. The Enneagram has occult roots, if one cares to dig into its origins. There are so many great Christian Catholic resources for deepening our relationship with God who is \\"crazy about us,\\" we don't need to waste time on occult and inauthentic sources. Spend your money wisely, Start with Fr. Thomas Dubay, Holy Father Benedict XVI, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Therese of Lisieux, Fr. Benedict Groeschel. You will never be led astray.

As good of a set as this is, and as \\"on\\" as Hargrove is, it is too relaxed for me to get overly excited.

Although we read to escape into another's fantasy, in this novel the inner workings on this outing are slim. Cdr. Lenson barely explores his inner self, although we're given hints that he may freeze with a panic reaction at the wrong time - then that line gets dropped. The ending is almost like \\"I've written my contract length, cut it off somehow.\\" To save the ending, at the very least I think Cobie should get the Navy Cross.

I can understand why Kelly Brock and Juan Pablo would take this job (who are they?) but was surprised at Billy Zane. He's a pretty good actor and surely, he must get better scripts than this.

Billy Zane and Kelly Brook play a wealthy couple who are cast asea when their rented yacht catches fire, due to the temper of the hunky shipmate, Juan Pablo di Pace. First Kelly arrives on a deserted island, followed by DiPace. They initially spar and flirt, and then build a little hut and all is well until hubby Zane washes up too. The romantic triangle is pretty predictable and Zane's performance is typically lifeless and wooden; Brook and DiPace look good but the storyline is spread out to meet the ninety minute timeframe without any real novelties, only a small surprise twist ending. And what in the world does the voodoo shmoodoo have to do with anything? The ocean looks beautiful, too, but the movie's not that noteworthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"VERY SLOW AND BORING. NOT A FAMILY MOVIE AT ALL.

A Robinson Crusoe shipwreck it is not. Can a cigarette lighter's fluid really last a year when it is the only source of fire to cook with? A well endowed Kelly Brook shows a lot of skin and not much acting ability. Competing for Ms. Brook is the other hunk, Juan Pablo Di Pace. As the flimsy plot develops he is actually under the spell of a spurned lover who is into voodoo rituals. Got that? If you want to see an entertaining adventure film, check out \\"The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak\\" (also available from Amazon.com).

For me it could've been more but I guess they decided to keep it more on the tasteful side than downright exploitation.Billy Zane gives a very interesting performance that is reminicent of Dead Calm at points for sure. It's almost the same formula except there were actually people to root FOR in Dead Calm.

It is made of a very strong plastic, and unlike metal crushers, the pivot point on this contraption is rock solid. I've had it for almost two months now. It's easy to install, quick and fun to use, and it crushes standard size cans down to a fraction of the size. It's great. Instead of buying the collection can, I place a big plastic tote underneath the crusher - the cans automatically discharge into it.For a moderate workout, collect a good amount of cans and then bring them to the crusher and start crushing away! It's a fun, rhythmic process that leaves you with a sense of accomplishment after you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Can Crusher","review":"This can crusher is one of the easiest to use.

When I put them up, the smell was horrible. Some sort of chemical smell. They had to be taken down and moved off of the screened porch areas. So, I decided to wait for a week or so and hopefully the odor would subside. After about 3 weeks I put the can crusher back up and it was used for about 8 cans and the whole base broke. I am not happy with these crushers at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 years old and still going strong","review":"Sad to say, but after 5 years, my Easy Pull can crusher finally gave up the ghost. However, this was only after a can drive resulting in 100s if not 1000s of cans per week for the last 6 months. I have tried every other type of can crusher on the market, and none lasted like this one. Pivot points on the other brands wear out within 6 months at most. This one just kept on going, and when it finally failed, guess what, I find that because it was one of the earliest models the problem has been corrected in the newer ones. The manufacturer was extremely helpful, and because mine was one of the earlier models (before upgrades) they replaced it. I couldn't be more satisfied with this product. It restored my faith in American made products."},{"rating":"1","title":"bent as in other reviews","review":"This crusher worked well at first then bent like other reviewers said.

Auto ejection makes it really easy to develop a rhythm and crush cans very quickly.I put a plastic tub on the floor below and cans drop out automatically. A few (like 3 or 4 out of 100) cans will hang, but a quick tap and they'll come free.Construction feels very solid.

I went to the hardware store and bought a long bolt with large washers to put through the handle. Now it still works fine and I expect it will last a very long time. We've perhaps crushed about 1,500 cans with it in a year.UPDATE 12/21/2012Here is something that pleased me. The manufacturer of the Easy Pull saw my note above, contacted me, and after a few exchanges sent me a new handle component. That is good customer service. I am a sucker for this kind of service. I am likely to check Easy PUll again if I need another can crusher.Today I removed the bolt and snapped in the replacement part. Works fine!We and the crusher in the garage just outside the door to the house. We have a kitchen type trash bin right under the can crusher. Cans fall into it without fail.

It seemed that every time I turned around I had mountains of cans to get to them. This crusher works like magic and is addictive to use. Four times as many cans fit into my recycling bin as previously did. The crusher is designed to mount to a wall with long wood screws, but I had no wall available in my garage due to having wall to wall metal shelving. I utilized two of the slots in the metal shelf uprights and changed to long bolts and nuts for mounting. It worked like a charm. One of the best features is that the crushed can jumps out of the crusher right into the bin placed on the floor below it. I don't think there could be a better functioning or easier unit made. Even my husband who never moved a can from the house to the bin previously is hooked on crushing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Pull Can Crusher","review":"I collect aluminum cans for my sons' Boy Scout Troop.

It broke the FIRST time I used it. The screws snapped cleanly out of the base when the handle was pulled down. Not very much force was used.

It does a great job with little effort. If there is something on the other side of the wall from where you hang it, it's a little noisy in that room.The collection bin that goes with this item is a great added convenience.Overall, I'm quite happy with the combination of the crusher and collection bin. It makes a previously annoying and/or painful job into a convenient one.This purchase was my second of this pairing. I bought it for a friend. So, I not only recommended it to a friend, I bought him one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Can Smasher EVER!","review":"I am astonished at how well this can smasher works, zero complaints at all. I would buy another one if one wasnt enough for me. The rotating mechanism as the cans get crushed seems to work much better than the can crushers that I have used that just crush straight down. It doesn't squeak, creak, or make any noise other than the sound of an aluminum can getting smashed.The plastic feels very very solid and sturdy, I have no worries that it may break at all.Where I mounted mine on my closet wall I was not able to use the included screws to screw it into a stud. Instead I had to buy two E-Z Anchor Toggle Bolt Hollow Wall Anchors, they are rated at 100lb each, and used little washers with the wall anchor screws to keep the can crusher held snug against the wall. The thing is rock solid, and I have no worries that it will tear loose from the sheetrock wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Mountain Dew Can Crusher","review":"I was sick and tired of stomping Mountain Dew cans and having them fly all over the place, so I spent my husbands hard earned cash on this can crusher.

I am looking forward to using it and expect to enjoy using it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone CAN use it!","review":"I researched the web for a dependable, easy to use can crusher and discovered the Easy Pull for our charity can collections. It really lives up to it's reputation of being \\"easy\\" since young children as well as elderly can use it with very little effort. The unit is well made, and doesn't require the operator to put their fingers in and pull out the crushed can like some models, therefore preventing possible finger/hand cuts. An optional, matching attachable bin can be added to store the crushed cans that simply fall into the bin after the lever is pulled. Ours has a artistic, swirled patriotic flag on the bin. There's virtually no maintainance required except an annual light coating of petroleum jelly on the easy-to-get-to visible steel rod. Help save the environment and save some $$$. This item can pay for itself very quickly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well built, crushes the competition","review":"Fantastic, high quality, solid feel. Interesting design makes it easy to crush the can without making a mess or even have to touch it after it is crushed. Is currently installed in our workshop and crushes anywhere between 10-20 cans a day- still holding strong. Only down side is that it does not crush larger cans like Monster Energy cans as the opening is only tall enough for the standard soda can. Worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Crusher","review":"This crusher is outstanding. The material with which it is made is the same type of plastic from which my two wheel hand truck is made. It has been handling 400 pound loads for many years with no trouble. The neat thing about this crusher is that you can crush the cans one handed. It ejects the crushed can without your having to use your other hand. You can hold a few cans, or a case of empties in one hand and load and crush with the other. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This can crusher is awesome. It is built from from highly durable plastic material that is evidently wear resistant.

In point of fact, this band was originally booked as John Gilmore's band. Ra appeared and performed on electric keyboard, adding effects, but the piano playing that is central on these pieces is played by another young man (whose name escapes me) who does sound pretty much exactly like Sun Ra on the instrument. To me the pieces here form a nice little triad of quality recordings from the late 80's/early 90's with \\"Blue Delight\\" and \\"Purple Night\\"; the music flows and the music speaks its piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"5-Stars as a comedy album","review":"Can these guys even play? It sounds like amateur hour at the local open mike night. Sloppy playing and thoughtless arrangements of a few standards and a couple of originals. It's basically a straight-ahead quintet with Sun Ra noodling above it all on synthesizer apparently whenever the spirit moves him. I laughed out loud several times at his absurd interjections. None of the soloists generate much excitement and the occasional interesting idea is never explored or developed. Gilmore especially sounds tired and bored.

The CD is VERY good, but there is a DEFINITE difference between the songs on offer for the first 10 trax and the 4 bonus selections. It is worth having because the vocalist has a phenomenal voice, the songs are up beat, and the bonus trax are exceptional. Persoanl favorite?? How about Let it Ride which smokes!! The whole cd is very well done and presents John Lawton's talents in a totally different light than the Rebel/Zar release (metal/hard Rock) or Still Paying my dues which is blues rock ala Free or Bad Company. John's own material with Steve Dunning is my own favorite but they all are worth owning and this gem is a must if you can find it!!!

Talk about bad framing of the picture that appears on your TV screen. Come on, Alpha, you can do better than this.There are lots of B-movie and Poverty Row movie fans who depend on Alpha for its vast catalog of quirky, obscure, and mostly public domain titles in many different genres.

A love story set amidst \\"class issues,\\" this story may seem slow to a reader who expects fireworks or major excitement, but if you allow the story and characters to unfold before you, you will be taken in and carried along for a delightful, romantic, charming tale. This book contains several of my favorite characters in all of British literature.

Its not often that the film is as good as the book, but in this it was, so faithfully adapted. When I got the book after seeing the film, I felt I was seeing the film again while reading, the film was sooo faithful to all the key plot and character points in the book and many of the minor ones too. Whether you've seen the film or not, definitely read the book as well. There are one or two typos but its very readable. This is one of my favorite romantic novels, and whats so great about it is that its not a stereotypical \\"romance novel\\", its for guys as well. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More sharp-tongued social commentary from a master","review":"Having greatly enjoyed A Passage to India, I was expecting another quality effort from Mr. Forster, and was not disappointed. I found this book a fine mix of period portrayal and timeless observation (a characteristic, I suppose, of all good art), and after finishing it, one of my biggest reactions was to be grateful that I wasn't living in the choking society of Victorian England. The acuteness of the author's evaluation of human relationships reminded me his literary forebear, Jane Austen, yet with a keener, more biting edge. Our contemporary culture surely has its problems, but A Room with a View will give you perspective--with many artfully-turned phrases along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Rip-Off Sub-Quality Printing","review":"This is one of the great English Novels.

Don't buy the version with the steeple on the cover and the big Helvetica typeface."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view of the book","review":"A Room With A View takes place in England and Italy. The scenery is beautiful and the characters are very well developed. The book shows a lot about people and how they interact with each other and their surroundings. The main plot is about a girl falling in love and not always understanding or knowing how to follow her heart, but the real importance lies within the characters and their surroundings. Mr. Emerson and his son George are amazing people with wonderful ideas of the world, but they are frond down upon because they are different from the norm. I found the book very enjoyable although the first part was quite slow. The middle and the end of the book went quickly and had me hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old ways of courting","review":"The romance of this book was beautiful...you can't really describe it. Young Emerson being unexperienced falling in love with Lucy was hinted a bit with every chapter, it was never really bluntly spoke of that he loved her...Forster didn't take the easy road, but beated around the bush which made Lucy and George's relationship much more interesting and fascinating to look at.From the scene where Lucy wakes up and finds herself in the arms of George is probably the biggest hint of his love for her...even though all he really did was hold her. In the end their struggles to get ignore their parents and society itself gives them the reins to control their own lives.I'm not sure but there was just something about this book that makes me just aghasted...I can't describe it...I feel so overcomed with emotions, just like when I read Tess of the Durbervilles. But in this case, there's a happy ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"For lovers and those of 'Romantic' Italian sensibility","review":"'Everyone' has seen the movie (possibly several times) and enjoyed the beauty of the Tuscan landscape. This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time. It's not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries. This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just enjoyable.Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted. It will help you to understand about other places and times. All that is important for helping to understand where we are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"Without a doubt A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the most charming classics out in print.

After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her. It then goes on to become steamy when he kisses her the moment after her fiance goes off to find his hat.Forster recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kindle version","review":"After having read some of the reviews of the free version of the book, I was willing to spend a little for a well-edited version.

Boy meets girl, they fall in love, she's in denial, she gets engaged to the wrong guy, conflict ensues, they finally happily ever after.

The woman falls in love with one man then gets torn apart from him. Months later she meets a new guy and sadly accepts his proposal to marry him even though she has feelings for the other man but knows she will never see him again. Then to throw in the climax he comes back they fall in love again, she breaks off the engagement with the other man and they go off and live happily ever after. I think this story is a little too corny for me. You can tell what is going to happen in the novel before it ever does. There aren't very many surprises in the novel and I think that is where I lost interest in the book. It is full of love, adventure and drama. Overall it has a good plot line and if you love traveling and Italy you will love this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie is better","review":"this reads just like the movie. you really don't get anything more by reading it. boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Wouldn't Be Published Today","review":"This is another one of those so called \\"classics\\" that continue to be overrated based on the fact that they are \\"classics.\\" Not to be confused with more deserving titles that make one wonder how a body of work can sound so fresh and accomplished after 50, 100, 200 + years, this particular work should be put on the bookshelf along with Count of Monte Cristo, Tarzan, The Lost World, etc. that are written by famous and gifted writers but in their off days, or off years for that matter.This book is difficult to get into and that is the beginning and the end of it.

It has fixed line lengths which wrap awkwardly on the Kindle, making it very difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A touch of class","review":"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. \\"A Room with a View\\" is what you could have called \\"Proletarian literature\\" in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British \\"proper\\" society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's \\"Remains of the Day\\" almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated Plot That Goes Nowhere","review":"I hate to be the one to write a bad review about this book, however I feel there is a lot of hype surrounding this classic that is not deserved. The plot is fairly simple, and very similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The girl loves a rogue, but her parents want her to marry the spectacular man they like. Etc. Some scenes in this Edwardian book I agree or slightly amusing, but it is not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENTIRELY UNORIGINAL","review":"A Room With a View is hardly what you could consider fine, classic literature. The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The stories are the same: a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends. The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing: change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.Holly Burke, PhD.Georgetown U."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Sappy Book!","review":"If you like Dirty Harry, Terminator or Rocky, don't read this book!!!

The sweet romance between Lucy and George sprouts from the restrictions of Edwardian society, all the while highlighting the gentle and sometimes fierce passion hidden by petticoats and waistcoats.

Exquisite and beautiful all the way through; Almeida-penned cuts like \\"Winter Moon\\" and \\"Maracatu-Too\\" really stand out.It's puzzling why this one is so often missed by fans - though the fact that the title and cover art are so distinct from the other Bossa Nova albums might figure into it, as is that it came at the end (1966) of Getz's work in the style.

Dr. Feynman pulls physics from the stuffy closet of academia, shakes off the dust and holds it up to the light so all can see what fools the 'experts' are. Dr. Feynman demonstrates none of the ego of others of his genre. His desire is clearly to convey physics to the best of his knowledge without trying to impress you with how smart he is.

I mean, I am a Gen X RAWKER about the same age, and with every page comes a new delight. When he mentioned \\"All For Leyna\\", a track on Billy Joel's Glass Houses I about Busted A Gut...it was my first vinyl at age 9. Chuck and I are soulmates. If you don't like his stuff, you just don't get it, and you weren't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Full of One Self is to be...","review":"What a load. This book of essays is simply a series of complaints about things that the author has spent way too much time thinking about. If you want to read a book about the whiny complaints of someone that watches television too much, and thinks he's better than you for it, this book is for you. Otherwise, you're better off hanging out at the local pub with a pint (or other choice beverage) arguing/complaining about how Puck tried to change the face of reality TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring would be an understatement","review":"There were only three essays I found interesting in this waste of paper (or e-ink, I should say).Other than the saved by the bell, marilyn monroe/pam anderson, and cover band essays, I found this book unreadable.I got so bored reading it I started skipping chapters, hoping to find something that I could stand to read, until I found myself at the end.How so many people rated this book 4 and 5 stars I'll never understand.Don't waste your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insightful but, repetitive","review":"While this book offers much insight into human nature, it offers very little pop culture analysis. The stories Klosterman uses are laced with his nostalgia and contain very little relateable knowledge; it is much like a personal diary. Finally, Klosterman uses many of the techniques he comments on in the book and thusly tries to avoid, making the book very hypocritical. Nevertheless, he employs some very interesting views points, which ultimately led me to read the book with a highlighter to remember them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed but not what I'd call a classic","review":"Does this book live up to it's hype. In a word no, but it was still an enjoyable read. Some chapters were right on, others didn't work for me. It's an interesting view, one I'd dare say I could see myself writing after a few shots of tequilla. The references are hip and often amusing. Hey, it's short...what do you have to lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth skimming","review":"I recommend borrowing this book from your hip literary friend, who already owns it. It has some very funny chapters, and some of the interludes between chapters are truly great. However, it's really unsatisfying in large doses; after finishing a lot of the chapters, I just felt that I had wasted my time. Klosterman has a nice dry wit, and he's good at BSing about quirky topics. But that's really not enough for me to buy a book. Skim it at the bookstore or get it from the library; this is not a book that you'll ever want to reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex, Drugs, and Five Stars","review":"This was my first introduction to Chuck Klosterman, but it sure wasn't my last. After all, now I have all his books. From the opening essay about Coldplay producing more fake love than the motor companies to a more in depth analysis of Saved By The Bell than you thought was possible, Klosterman is like a pop culture philosopher. Download the sample and I guarantee you'll buy the whole book. There's a piece of zeitgeist skewering for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun read","review":"If you enjoy pop culture, thoughtful commentary on social behavior, and the a witty author that can uniquely link the two, then you'll enjoy this book.

He needs to get over himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cover!","review":"The cover and the title are the only things this book has going for it.I was not even able to finish this book.Couldn't get through the first three chapters.I was hoping for something interesting and funny- but it was mundane and boring- seemed like the author is jaded by what he sees in the world, and it definitely shows on the pages.There was nothing to the book but mindless pop culture references that went on and on and on- but no real STORY. It felt like I was reading a script to an E! Entertainment episode, but without the corny banter by the co-hosts.I love pop culture, but I also love a good plot and at least some semblance of a storyline.Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even worth my 83 cents","review":"worst piece of hipster garbage i have ever read. it doesn't even deserve the one star i was obligated to give it. i thought it would be more of a story but instead you get the opinions of some old man on crap no one cares about. thought this book would be much different since it was a suggestion based on other books i bought, but i wish i would have saved the 83 cents i paid for this and spent it at taco bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is age sensitive","review":"If you are in your late forties or older you will probably not understand 80% of the references made in the book. It is probably a great book for younger people who understand what the author is referring to. If you didn't watch 'Real World' on HBO or if you don't know who Billy Sim is you probably won't like this book. On the other hand if you are a Generation X person it is probably very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average and plain.","review":"This Book is boring not funny and defenitely no worth to read. Don't waste your time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep yet superficial?","review":"Although I have a penchant for fiction, this book is very high on my list of works to recommend to other avid readers. Nobody can make a point quite like Chuck Klosterman. Granted, he sometimes supports his opinion by saying (in essence), \\"I believe this, therefore it must be so\\" -- but even then, he's so damn believable. (More often than not, though, he provides more than enough evidence to support his claims and opinions.) Chuck's essays in this compilation are easy to read, thought-provoking, humorous, insightful, and just plain fun. I'm a sucker for pop culture, and this book helps me feel better about that, in a way. It gives me proof that my intellectual side can somehow coincide with my lighter, more bubble-gum (read: guilty-pleasure) side. Thanks for that, Chuck -- and also for making me laugh and think at the same time. In my experience, that's rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Gen X take on modern culture","review":"There are two reasons to read this book and two reasons to not read this book. Firstly, the style of writing. The writing is wonderful. I enjoy the style. You really get the feeling that a highly intelligent Gen X journalist is sitting there in your living room in his jeans ant T-shirt and telling you his observations. If that style drives you crazy (in a bad way), you will know it from the sample and can save your money. If that styles drives you crazy (in a good way), you will know it from the sample and safely give B&N your money. Secondly, the wise observations of our modern world. His observations of the absurdity and ridiculousness of current culture is astute. Yes, he over-analyzes, but he does so in an entertaining way. If you think modern mainstream media and culture is awesome, then avoid this like a zombie plague. If you think modern mainstream media and culture are absurd, then this will be a very entertaining and enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something that you can relate to","review":"This was the first Chuck Klosterman book that I have read and i can promise you that it will not be my last, and if you read this also then it will not be your last either. As you read this you discover that Chuck Klosterman has an amazing way of putting things that we would never think of ourselves. From Pamela Anderson to The Sims Chcuk Klosterman talks about it all in this very up-beat and self-fulfilling book. I will not explain much about this one because i do not want to ruin any of it for anyone, and with that being said i do promise you it is an amazing book that you must read. I plan on reading all other books written by Chuck Klosterman and writing (better) reviews about them. Thank you and please read this book, you will not regret it. Also check out his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Nick Hornby were from North Dakota...","review":"If you're into pop culture then this is something you really want to put on your must read list. Klosterman writes on everything from the effect of Woody Allen and John Cusack movies on his relationship troubles to whether or not your stance on the Lakers-Celtics rivalry is a sign that you might be a racist. One caveat, be prepared to have Klosterman's fantastic wit probably skewer something you hold near and dear. But if you're ready to roll with the occasional jab to the things you like you realize that Klosterman is punching away with kid gloves--I mean the man admits his love for the TV classic \\"Saved by the Bell\\" (and rightly so!)--so how mean can he really be?Short chapters interspersed with even shorter interludes help make this a light and easy read, and most likely a great conversation starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"An oxymoron for Gen Xers","review":"I decided to read this book after considering the many positive reviews along with the accolades of several independent book sellers. I shouldn't have. I'm not going to say this book is bad, but its certainly not anywhere near being good either.This book is a self-described manifesto, which it is not. It is the inane ramblings of someone who does not suffer from lycantrophy. It is dysfunctional, poorly written, and is essentially about nothing at all. I liken it to a Seinfeld episode, in print form, but without the distraction that comes from actual humor or entertainment value. In hind site, I'm starting to wish Klosterman did suffer from lycantrophy.If you don't believe me, I will let a Chuck Klosterman quote from the book serve as a one line synopsis:\\"Do you not see what I am no longer not saying to you? If so-congratulations!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"It was impossible to read these essays and not imagine that they were typed as spouted, realtime, by a smart, overcaffeinated english major sitting on a couch in a dormitory. You can almost see the (cheap, industrial) carpeting and hear the 'k-cchunk' of the vending machine in the background.This can be fun, but what we all learned in college is that it's important not to take couch-speaker-guy's opinions as seriously as he takes them. That's the case here, too. Klosterman guesses at things when ninety seconds of googling would have given him the facts; he makes assertions and then, rather than backing them up, goes on to further assertions, possibly in hopes that you'll be too busy trying to keep up to start poking holes in his argument; and every now and then, despite his open contempt for people who use words without understanding their meanings, he does this himself (e.g. describing this collection as a 'manifesto')."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock is funny","review":"If you love Rock n' Roll and you like to laugh and be entertained this is a great book for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"A better use of your time would be hari kari","review":"I heard rave reviews about this book from a large number of people and my roommate had it sitting on his desk so I picked it up and read it. Upon finishing I put it down and thought, \\"wow, that was the most abysmal piece of literature I have ever read.\\" Klosterman is like a 40 year old kid who, quite obviously has no semblence of a life, because not only has seen every episode of every \\"Real World\\" ever not once, but 3 times, and then decided it was worth his time to write an essay on how it has skewed the views of our society. WHAT??!?!!?!? In short Klosterman wastes 253 pages of good trees to tell us his revalatory findings after trying to get laid in the SIMS after sitting in his basement for over a weeks worth of hours playing it and other completely-irrelevent-to-life topics. And then he wonders why he can't get a girlfriend...Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Chuck!","review":"I love to read anything Chuck Klosterman writes, even if he can sometimes be inconsistent. That being said, this book is frickin' great and is not the reason I find his writings occassionally inconsistent. I always recommend this to people who enjoy anything about pop culture and or just generally funny reads. So far everyone I have recommended it to has become Chuck fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Diversion","review":"As the subtitle implies, Klosterman has spent more time and energy thinking deeply about \\"low culture\\" than most academics have spent studying the so-called \\"important\\" things.This is not an indictment: Pondering things that aren't terribly important -- like what it's like to be in a Guns-N-Roses Tribute Band (for example) -- can be quite refreshing. In fact, I found it to be a welcome diversion from my normal diet of political books.Granted, as a fellow Gen Xer who spent some time in North Dakota, I probably identified with Klosterman more than, say, a 50-year old from New York might. But I figure if every Gen Xer in North Dakota were to purchase this book -- that's at least 250 copies, right there!In all seriousness, I think this book would resonate best with people born between 1968 and 1978."},{"rating":"1","title":"sex drugs and bollox","review":"not funny chuck....i want my money back. oh...and your cusak poll is assinine. i am sure jc would agree. i will make sure to read your stuff first before being suckered in on kindle. and sims? shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a a history text","review":"The book appears to be comprehensive, but it is written in a pedantic and boring way, very much like so many history books I had to read in school. That made it difficult to retain my interest. Don't get me wrong; I love to read, but I'm not a scholar, researching to write about the plantation life, but just an ordinary person who found the title interesting, so was curious enough to buy it.

The people that inhabit it are REAL people who happen to be famous. And their determination to make this show work (some still say it didn't) makes for fascinating reading.It is like traveling back in time...and being there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Follies","review":"What I like the most about this book is that although Follies is an over-the-top piece of musical theater, Chapin takes a journalistic \\"just the facts, Ma'm\\" approach. In other hands, the book could have been a scandal sheet of unsubstantiated gossip, screaming arguements, and backstage back-biting. Instead, Chapin gives a fair, neutral, even-handed version of his experience as someone who was there. The disparity of the Amazon reviews is not surprising, as Follies itself divides audiences, usally into camps (pun not intended) who adore the glitzy pastiche numbers and abhor the bad marriage blather, and those who try to accept the work as a whole. If you really love the history of musical theatre and appreciate the indelible influence of Prince, Bennett, and Sondheim, then this book is for you. If you are looking for dish, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplemente Lo Mejor de los Enanos!","review":"Este es solamente uno de sus mejores albums y una vez mas como siempre Marciano y el resto de la Banda nos deleitan con el mas fino Rock en Español que pueda existir.

Still, there are only about five memorable songs; the rest of the album sounds about the same, with that folk-rock/heavy metal sound that Marciano and his buddies are known for. If you're expecting latin music, this isn't the best choice, but if you enjoy heavy metal, this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and Sturdy Scholarship","review":"This book seems somewhat dated, but that may be because it has inspired so much research on the importance of marriage and ceremony that the ideas appear familiar. One easily forgets that this is the book that opened the way to new approaches to Shakespeare's plays. When my students want to write about the importance of ceremony or about women or about marriage in Shakespeare's plays, I first send them to *Broken Nuptials*. It's nicely written with no twisted inane jargon to trip up even a novice reader. Most readers, in fact, may end the book thinking \\"I knew that!\\" (although they probably didn't know it when they started the book). The insights appear to be so self-evident (and so colored by work done after the book's publication) that I believe readers and scholars, while recognizing the book's importance, have underrated its quality.

It's more reflective than usual, but the mystery is tight and succinct. The contrasts between Maigret and his wife with the toy salesman and his wife are poignant and revealing. The setup is unusually good - a slow day at the office produces a fine problem. The toy salesman thinks his wife wants to do him in. The wife insists that he's crazy and is trying to harm her. Who to believe?The resulting death I shall let the book reveal, but with such a small cast of suspects, Simenon produces a clever twist that is psychologically and dramatically satisfying.

The dress is made of cheap, poorly sewn fabric and poor Belle's chignon didn't last 15 minutes because the crown is attached to the hair. As soon as my daughter tried to pull off the crown (because that is what little girls do), the hair came out of the bun and now looks like a rat's nest. But my daughter seems not to care because she just adores Belle, even if she's barefoot.Beware of the \\"free\\" ring for your girl: The ring is actually the end of the scepter, so if you snap off the ring for wearing, the scepter is reduced to just a plain plastic stick -- not very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Well Made.","review":"Within a week the box was cracked, now the solder points have come apart.

Additionally, the chapters are divided into sections that are 'bite size' with exercises at the end of each, which has made it well suited for regular daily study. I would highly recommend it to any student with some mathematical maturity who wishes to get a good foundation in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing most of the time","review":"I dislike the book for two main reason:1)the author hides information in essay-style paragraphs which usually end in phrases like, \\"thus, we have proved...\\". If you are lucky, he will somewhere state the theorem.2) because of 1) it serves as a poor reference book, which is the main subsequent value of a text after you have taken the course with it.I do share some of the enthusiasm that Richard has for the book, but only for those parts of the book that I already understood from previous work. We actually took the class together at UC Santa Barbara. And from what I remember, Richard was one of the few students who had anything good to say about the book. I think a better graduate text is Hungerford's or Grove's (\\"Algebra\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average book by a good mathematician","review":"This is one of the worst undergraduate algebra texts I've ever seen. Although everything Jacobson says in his book is true, his writing style makes the material seem more difficult than it really is. Many results in the book are not numbered or highlighted from the rest of the book, and this makes it virtually impossible to retrieve information when needed. In order to find the result you want you probably need to read the entire section to find it. This book is a counter example to the following conjecture: If a person is a good mathematician, then he writes good mathematics textbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man is great, the book is not","review":"This is not an easy book to learn from. The material is there but organized in a very poor way. Important results and theorems are often hidden in the middle of page long paragraphs. The index is so bad they might as well not have included it. The information is all there, but unless you read every word in the text from beginning to end, you just won't be able to get to it. I used Hungerford to get through my first graduate classes in algebra, which is too brief but definitely a step up from this. This is a poorly organized text written by a truly great mathematician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose and poorly organized compared to similar texts.","review":"Basic Algebra is not well written. The material here is the same as covered in many other books, such as Hungerford, but Hungerford covers the material in a concise organized manner. Jacobson might be a little more accessible to beginning readers, but is more confusing as well. It hides definitions and important theorems in the middle of paragraphs. The index is horrendous. The examples are mixed in with everything else in a manner which makes it hard to pick anything apart in a chapter. Stick with another graduate Algebra text if you want to learn from the book, as it takes a good professor to make this book work. Jacobson is certainly a great Mathematician, but I do not recommend him as an author for this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pedagogically unsound.","review":"I have recently had the unpleasant experience of finishing a higher course in Algebra which used Jacobson's book. To make a long story short, I never once found myself using this book to solve any problems listed in Jacobson, it is the most unorganized and unconnected book (in terms of it's theorems and results and how they came about) that I have ever attempted to learn from. This book is certainly NOT self-contained, nor does Jacobson explicitely list or even sometimes give results which may help solve his exercises. The material is presented either more confusingly than it has to be, or in such a way that one wonders why it was presented in the first place. I don't understand why any mathematician would recommend this book to use as a primary text in a course."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is stupid!","review":"I rented this game an couple of weeks ago, and was EXTREMELY dissapointed.

The training missions are fast, smooth and fun. I have to assume that all the high reviews are from people who've just started playing it.The problem is, once you start the actual missions, the frame rate seems to drop noticably, presumably because of all the extra objects the game has to draw. Not only that, but the frame rate becomes uneven, which makes targeting anything while on the move rather annoying. The pixelated graphics don't help, and the faux-3D is rather obvious.When you compare it to (say) \\"Burnout 2\\", it's clear that very little effort was spent to get the game running acceptably on the GameCube. I've seen smoother graphics on PS2 games (I own both systems). Definitely one to steer clear of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad graphics and poor game play","review":"When I went to pick up my copy of Agent Under Fire the salesperson talked me into buying Spy Hunter.

After playing this game, I am so happy that I bought 007 instead. As you know both are ports of ps2 games, with one major difference- james bond has actually been improved on, and spy hunter has been cut up. It is an extremely sloppy port from the ps2 version. Graphics just plain stink, pretty much no real damage to anything at all, and it gets boring faster than the levels can load. There are driving levels on james bond, and, sad to say, they are better than this whole game! And you get to shoot suff and have multiplayer.

Washing with freshwater and then oiling resulted in only superficial rust appearing. Unfortunately when I left that job I had to hand the knife in.

Apparently, it is easy to miss the point of the Jefferson Bible. It is not a treatise on religious dogma or analysis, but a personal spiritual guide for those unable to stomach all the hocus pocus usually associated with the teachings of Jesus. Whatever one's feeling about the Bible, it is difficult to see how anyone could consider the purified teachings of Jesus as \\"tripe.\\" Jefferson merely selected passages that spoke to his heart and put them all together in a single collection for his own use.

With something like the Bible, even Jefferson's version, this is a requirement.Second, and even more vexing, it's quite clear this text was scanned directly from a book and that causes massive formatting issues, along with displaying page numbers in the text. There's also a message that basically reads like an ad every few pages showing the title and the fact that it's from the sacred-texts website.All in all, I really wanted to enjoy this read, but can't.

On the other hand, imagine how objective a thinker he must have been to fashion, straight from the Bible, the world's first ever bible of morals, ethics, and character. That is one of his little known, most important contributions to humanity. No less than that, my dear fellow Americans, is the true enormity of his Biblical analysis and editing. The only other book I have ever found that recognizes Jefferson as the first to \\"write\\" a book on morals, ethics, and character, and in that sense a pioneer itself, is \\"West Point\\" by Norman Thomas Remick.

Jefferson was a deist who emphasized only the moral teachings of Jesus, and excluded the miracles, the resurrection, the letters of Paul the Apostle, and the Book of Revelation. So this is a highly simplified version of Jesus' Gospel. This edition is adequate, having a good introductory letter that spells out some context for Jefferson's edition of this Bible. The page numbering is sparse and sporadic, and some typos are evident. You may wish to find a different edition, but certainly I recommend this book to bring one's focus squarely on the moral teachings of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be looking for Tolstoy's version instead","review":"I really looked forward to reading this given all the great reviews and the wonderful idea behind the writing of this book. However, I was confused by the inaccurate historical representation (or I guess Jefferson's beliefs) about Jesus' views towards Jews. Further parts of the New Testament with comments about the Jews made no sense in such a book about Jesus' morals. Another review here speaks to this in more depth. It's nice that it is cheap, but I wish I hadn't purchased it.

Jefferson worked on this editing of the bible while in the White House and shortly before his death. Never intended for public view (Jefferson - unlike many politicians these days considered religion a private - VERY private domain) this work was done to satisfy a private need at the urging of some of his neigbors/friends.Jefferson's work consisted on removing any miraculous references in the New Testiment as well as any stries which Jefferson did not believe held up to rational thought.It thus contains the moral precepts and teachings that Jefferson valued so highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Author, Brilliant Book","review":"I am reading this book because as a young man I was always trying to understand what the exact teachings of Jesus and the chronological order were- this book does that and entails the story of how Thomas Jefferson found himself writing this book; with the help of others who didn't even agree with all his theories, ethics or morals, but with the respect of men searching for truth like he."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting viewpoint!","review":"This book can be used with bible study groups as an opposing viewpoint- Jesus is viewed by Thomas Jefferson as a person who had high morals.

He deleted the miracles, resurrection and any strange theological statements he felt was placed in Jesus's mouth at a later date. He was like the Jesus Seminar of the 1800's. I have nothing but respect for Jefferson on having the guts in his time to think for himself and see the logical fallacies in believing in the super natural aspects of the gospels. In reading this I see a lot of similarities to the Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in 1946. Jefferson would have been pleased. He searched the Gospels for the \\"GEMS\\" the real Jesus spoke and found them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book quality","review":"The content of this book is very good. I can't say how close it is to the original Jefferson Bible (as this is a reprint) , but I can only assume it is entirely intact.The only things keeping this from 5 stars is that the layout looks like a printed and bound ebook -- which it is -- it's got tiny clipart by the page numbers, the font is Helvetica or Verdana (kinda screams ebook to me), a few typos here and there, and it has a quote cited from Wikipedia in the preface. In the publisher's defense, it is a good quote, but...Wikipedia? Really? The quote could not be found somewhere else?I admit these issues are very small in relation to the book in its entirety. This is an excellent reading copy, but I would urge any book collector to spend the extra money and buy this book from another publisher.Bottom line: Great content, but layout could look a little more professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jefferson Bible - Gospels for the Thinking Christian","review":"This was just a great little book.

I got it on clearance for $...and I still felt like I had paid too much. This is NOT comparible to Star Fox for the SNES. If it was, this would be one of the biggest titles for the GBA. For a shooter, the aim is one of the worst programming jobs I've ever experienced. You can't aim because your cross hairs are constantly drifting to the middle of the screen. I got so frustrated that thoughts of pounding my GBA repeatedly against a sidewalk was seeming like a resonable plan of action.

Struggling in Ahearn's clan to find her position after Nolwynn, her best human friend, dies, Ahearn, the chieftain, remarries, and his new wife lies cruelly about her, Tanith's only wish is to return to the wolves where she has a sense of belonging. However, soon Tanith sees that there is, for the first time since Nolwynn died, someone in the human clan who wants her - the youth Gibran.

Tanith is an unusual story set in ancient times combining the feelings of love,hate, betrayal, and the animal kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanith is a very emotional book","review":"Tanith is an enjoyable book with sad, happy and emotional parts. Sherryl writes enthusiastically with a lot expression. When I read the book in my head I could feel what the characters felt, I could see what the characters saw and what the characters did. I could picture the story clearly in my head.Tanith lived with Aherns people for 13 summers but still had memories of the wolves. I like the book because of the wolves.

And then when you go to dance it does all this stuff in the backround like wavy pink lines and blue polka dots. There is nothing one there face it's just a face! No eyes no mouth, no nose! Nothing!

Jami Gertz who plays Kat is absolutely stunning and gives a knock out performance as the wild friend from college (to put it mildly). Sybil Temchen plays the well to do and very put together Allison Cole. Kat is a nymphomaniac and Allie is too scared to entirely act on her impulses. The movie has hints of comedy, drama, and suspense but I'm not sure exactly which category it should be put in. All in all, it is a great movie with a few unexpected twists. I highly recommend this movie to everyone (over the age of 17)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This convoluted and tepid WWII thriller takes place in 1942 after the D-Day landings at Normandy but before the Allied breakout. There are actually multiple plots, one is by a group of German army officers seeking to blow up Hitler and install Rommel as the president of a Germany that would then come to terms with the Allies and concentrate on fighting Stalin. The main plot however, concentrates on a British spy who comes up with a workable plan for assassinating Rommel as he partakes of his weekly hunting session. Although he never gets the go-ahead, he decides to pursue the plan while on the run. Two killers are dispatched from England to stop him, and they work with the French to track him down. There are far too many players, none of whom rises beyond cardboard characterization. The ending culminates in a series of silly predictable (especially if you know how Rommel really died) ironic reversals.

I thought Oust was supposed to get rid of odor. The citrus fragrance in the solution smells too much like one those cheap bathroom deodorizers - it's too synthetic it's nauseating. I don't really know if the Oust product actually gets rid of odor or if the strong fragrance in the solution is just MASKING the odor.

This movie is only based on the last 67 days of Van Gogh's life. Perhaps, I would have enjoyed it more if we could have watched how Van Gogh evolved. What was he like during the ten years before his death? I'd like to see a movie that can depict more of the essence of Van Gogh, and not only focus on \\"the worst days of his life\\". There is a huge misconception in the world, of who Van Gogh \\"is\\", and this movie only feeds it. Read \\"Dear Theo\\": Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo. The book is far much better than this movie. At least, we can get the truth through Van Gogh's eyes, not Maurice Pialat's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distorted and pointless Van Gogh biography","review":"This film--which could have been quite good because of its narrow focus on the last two months of Van Gogh's life--is, in the end, a disaster. The film is grossly inaccurate in its portrayals of Vincent, his brother Theo, Dr. Paul Gachet and Gachet's daughter, Marguerite. Director Maurice Pialat seems to have thrown virtually every known fact about Van Gogh out the window and has rewritten history according his own distorted (and actually extremely boring) vision.A far better movie would be Robert Altman's \\"Vincent and Theo\\" starring Tim Roth.

Anyone who understands the life of this artist will be taken aback by this film's completely insensitive portrayal of Vincent's relationship with his brother. In one scene, Theo actually discount's Vincent's entire output, wishing he had painted more like the impressionists! This film would have you believe that despite a forbidden, sexual relationship with his physician's daughter (who is about half his age), Vincent is driven to commit suicide. First of all, there is no evidence that such a relationship ever occured. Further, the film offers no insite into the true character of the artist and the real reasons that he took his own life. I gave it one star because I can't go any lower... for an accurate account of this artist's life, see \\"Vincent & Theo\\" or \\"Lust for Life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"for an experienced readership","review":"Edwards claims that his book is the first on using open source software to build robotic systems.

To address the issue of whether linux is up to the demands of real time running. The ideal reader should be proficient both in linux device drivers and in constructing robots.

Blood Omen and Soul Reaver's graphics are pretty much the same, but in Blood Omen there is sometimes problems where it will slow down or freeze which has never happened before with my Soul Reaver game. Despite some problems Blood Omen is still a great game but you should definatly rent this game before purchasing it you might just be able to beat it because it's kind of short but then again so is Soul Reaver.

When the game starts you get your @$$ handed to you by some dude named the Sarafan Lord. Kain makes an alliance with Uma I think her name was. He goes across Norrath kills Sarafan, Hyldan, and a bunch of other things along the way. You get weapons, your weapons wear down, you throw it into the next body...repeat. The world of Nosgoth is actually beautifully done, and you could truly get lost in it. The sounds, the way people go about their business, it was a new and much needed facelift to Nosgoth.

But, don't believe the hype. This game has more bugs than any other game I've played on the PS2. It runs choppy every time more than 3 people are on screen at the same time. Also there are glitches during cinematic scenes which make the voices go about 2 seconds before the animation, leading towards a VERY annoying experience. Although not total trash,(especially if you have followed the series from Blood Omen) gamers who are fans of the Kain series will enjoy this game slightly. I myself have followed the series since the very first Blood Omen so the technical issues on this game are almost tolerable, however the story has many pacing problems. Not to mention that there are plot holes. I wont comment on the ending to prevent any mishaps. Fans deserve to learn the facts.

It is available used on this site for only a few bucks, so anyone who likes Roy, or big band horns from that era, ought to consider buying this. Here you get an hour's worth of entertainment, with varied tempos but mostly cheerful offerings. My first exposure to Mr. Eldridge came on the \\"Let Me Off Uptown\\" CD, which highlights some of Anita O'Day's singing with the Gene Krupa Orchestra of the early '40's.

To my surprise, its not even a tenth as good. This game is five on five with only street players (i had a feeling that was coming, with no NBA endorsement on the cover) and boring backdrops. There is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves. I also think the arial attack could be made more interesting. It plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves, which is a big step down from NBA Street, which was more like the Arcade NBA Jam style of ballin'.

At least I can punch gayrod now."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAYED!","review":"Now, Im not saying I hate Streetball, but this game makes Streetball look like Sesame-Ball.

I was the Knights and I crushed Baltimore and they had Lil Romeo, all my players were at 50 just to give a challenge and I won 51-0! Its impossible to block but so easy to steal. The movies are pretty good. After a while though, the music in the back gets dumb. I used to be addicted to \\"Roll-out\\" but now im not. Seriously, you can bet on games on how many points you can win, but its dumb. Some features I like for example: buying your clothes and bling bling. Haircuts look so fake, doesn't even sway one bit.

The last time I seen moves like this I was playing ball myself. the game has some sick moves, ill crossover, wicked passes, and hard fouls. So if you can't take it don't buy it. Its just too real. If you don't play streetball for real you my not understand how serious it really is, to have a game that you can play when you can't get to the park and cross some young dude over for tryin' to shine on ya. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Basketball Game","review":"Im a 13 year old girl, this game is not only for boys but for girls too. This game is the best b-ball game that i have played. The controls take time to learn but so does the moves in real life. Once you learn the moves its so cool. Ive almost beaten the world tournament((that just shows that its not imposible like some people say))The games are very relistic, people yelling,no blood no foul,anouncers,and where the games take place are very much like the the real thing. The music sound tracks are not stupid songs, they have people like DMX,Ludacris,Master P and many more. You can bet,buy cloths,chains,tatoos,get a new hair cut. This is the best basketball game its really worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definately worth it","review":"This is more than a game it comes with 3 and1 mixtapes aswell as about 4 video clips the music sets the mood and the gameplay is easy to get the hang of and once you unlock the and1 ballers you can do their special moves you can also create your own ballers and then pay for them to get better. over all this game is definately worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun!","review":"I just got it about a couple of hours ago. Its a great game. I like the cool juke moves. The dunks are great too. And you even get to play with girls on the team.Overall It deserves a four.

I sure hope not."},{"rating":"2","title":"this games is off the scale","review":"I have played it as yet so I can't really judge. But from the commercials that game is of the fasizy.

The text by Elizabeth Partridge is complemented by Aki Sogabe's colorful illustrations.\\"Oranges\\" tells the story of Jo Lee, a Chinese boy who emigrates to California, where he works as a fisherman with his uncle. He misses his mother, who is still in China, but he plants orange branches that she gave him to take on his journey.This is a realistic immigrant story with some fantastic/supernatural touches that evoke traditional Chinese beliefs. Illustrator Aki Sogabe creates many memorable scenes: a letter writer engaged in Chinese calligraphy, the Dragon King flying over a stormy ocean, Jo Lee tending his orange saplings, and more. To sum up: this is an excellent book for children of all cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is It!","review":"Probably my favorite of the McManus books!

I've seen a lot of black movies dealing with relationships and this one has a little twist to it. This movie gives different views from the male and female perspective on how they look at relationships. I must admit that I believe that a lot of what they say is true. This is a movie to keep in your black cinema collection along with \\"Love Jones\\", \\"How You Like Me Now\\" and those other moves related to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One star reviews..HUH?","review":"I read the reviews on this one and the two people that said this was an awful movie that didn't make since either fell asleep during the movie, or they have never been in a bad relationship, or they are walking around with HATE GOGGLES on...LOL. The movie chronicles two friends that are bouncing their relationship issues off of each other. Its rare to see a movie show that side of African American men without putting forth a demeaning point of view about all women. But this movie was very well put together, and even for a low budget with a cast that was not well known, this was a very good movie!!! It gets much rotation in my DVD.Don't believe me rent it for yourself and you make the decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a \\"Been there, done that\\" wanna be \\"Artsy black film\\".

His Indiana cohort, the under-rated James Spaulding, is on hand to provide Hub the push on tunes like \\"D-minor Mint\\", Chambers' classic ballad, \\"Mirrors\\", and the title tune, a study in modality plus tinges of Latin/Caribbean soul. This is the same group I saw in San Francisco at the now defunct Both/And and it cooked then--and it does on this record. Though his chops are practically gone nowadays, one should relish this great classic album as one of Hubbards finest, if not the finest!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute, but very hard to steer","review":"This is an adorable lil' fire engine, and my twin sons love the look of the toy, and enjoy playing with the bell and the horn.

However, if, like me, you regard Bruce Hornsby as one of the finest composers and performers in any idiom of the past 25 years, you will enjoy this DVD for what it is: a record of a great band at the peak of its powers. The concert was recorded in Koln, Germany sometime after the release of \\"A Night on the Town\\". The majority of the songs are taken from that recording. Koln, of course, was the setting for a famous Keith Jarrett release on ECM. Horsnby dedicates \\"Another Day\\" to Leon Russell. And that about sums things up: a cross between \\"Leon Live\\" and \\"The Sun Bear Concerts\\", with a dash of bluegrass and country for good measure. Forget the audio quality (which is tolerable rather than execrable) and enjoy 90 minutes of superb music, beautifully crafted and flawlessly played."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible quality","review":"I can't believe they released this on DVD. I bought it at a local store, and luckily was able to return it.The only person who would really like this is a HardCore Hornsby fan who is obsessed and needs to own everything he/she can that is Hornsby related.Mainly, it's the sound quality. There are times where it actually fades out, like you're listening to an old beat up cassette that is on it's last legs.The picture quality isn't any better. It was very poorly filmed and recorded.Musically, it is a decent performance for the most part, although early in the group's history. I've heard them play much better. Maybe I was just too distracted by the quality to really enjoy it.I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is mostly terrible","review":"For a concert DVD, I can accept average video, but the audio still has to be listenable. I watched this with headphones on and it gets painful on many of the songs - it sounds like someone left the master tape sitting in the rain before they transfered this to DVD.

No; he doesn't have the best quality voice - but - he has an astonishing feel and his timing & phrasing is beyond critisism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Having never truly considered Astaire a great singer, I was very pleasantly surprised by this album. The sound quality is great and it has some of the best songs from his movies on it. Thrilled I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"movies\\" Fred","review":"This is Fred Astaire, with hired studio musicians, doing songs from his movies. He's not a great singer, but such a great consummate performer, that in his movies, he brings across these songs perfectly, because the moment calls for it, and he's too great a performer not to deliver at the highest level.But here, he's just singing the songs for fun. He obviously likes the songs, and had the money and/or influence to make this collection, but it lacks the charm of the movie performances.Still, he's a pro, and so is the band, so it's a professional effort. But it lacks the old Fred Astaire magic.Bottom line, if you're looking for the movie versions, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there something wrong with me?","review":"I am amazed at all these positive reviews. True the songs are great and the arrangements terrific, but Astaire is speaking these songs half the time, as if his voice had gone. And the acoustic is such that he sounds as if he was recorded separately and added on to the band. Can someone tell me what I am missing and why I am the only one disappointed before I toss this in the trash??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred can dance AND sing!","review":"When you listen to this CD, you feel Fred Astaire is right there in the room with you.

And the precise, elegant, and intelligent piano playing of Oscar Peterson -- and the work of the other sidemen as well -- perfectly matches Astaire's stylish performances.Though I expected -- and would have accepted -- recording quality well below today's standards, I was amazed that these recordings could not only stand alongside most of today's recordings but, in many ways, rises above them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious help for figuring out the hidden linkage between faith and secular experience","review":"This is a tremendous book, very easy reading, but could be very deep, and could provide life changing experience.

I enjoyed the book but it is so outrageously over-hyped I have to wonder what a spoiled pack of brats the people who consider this book to be life changing are.Quick summation of the book. Life is not fair. People with power and control will find a rationalization for their power and hence an excuse to demean you. If you don't have something outside of your immediate circumstances to look forward to you will be broken.Enjoyable read, ridiculously over-hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"This book has changed my life. He speaks of the mindset it took him to get through what he had seen, and at the same time relates these mindsets to our simple \\"meaningless\\" life. He does not give you a meaning. He forces you to find it yourself. It is a nice change of pace to hear someone speak in a spiritual nature, without involving a god. If you feel your life is lacking, this book is a must. It will dpress you at times, but it will change you forever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment","review":"Reading this book was largely a waste of my time. Frankel does not set forth a literary experiment in an attempt to prove a hypothesis. Rather, he gives the hypothesis and then assumes the hypothesis to prove his beliefs. Frankel commits the cardinal sin of writing a persuasive work: he assumes his theory is correct instead of proving it. He never even attempts to prove it. This man needs to learn the scientific method. As a persuasive work, this volume is woefully inadequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"A Man's Search for Meaning is definitely worth reading.

I would especially recommend it to anyone interested in psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book tops my all-time favorite list","review":"\\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is probably the most inspiring book I've ever read, and I've actually re-read it at least five times since first purchasing it a few years ago. If you ever wondered how to find a meaningful life, then this is the book for you. It's important to read the first part which details how Dr. Frankel was able to find meaning in the most difficult of all circumstances, as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.However, the real impact is the modern day applications of his theory of Logotherapy, and he brilliantly outlines how his timeless principles are applicable even in 2010! Every time I read the book I find a different way of interpreting his philosophy to a current life situation, and I can highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"This book is genius. I have chronic depression, and this book has helped immensely with things medicine can't quite do for me. I'd say it has been the most influential book I have read.

Through his experience, Frankl used a psychotherapeutic method as a way to survive. This method later became existential therapy. The benefits of Man's Search for Meaning are twofold: creating an additional therapy for man to survive extraordinary situations and the exposing the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. Man's Search for Meaning should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit Lifting Masterpiece","review":"This is one of those books that once you start reading you don't want to put it down. It is inspirational from cover to cover. The descriptions of events will paint a clear picture for anyone. This book will really get you thinking about all aspects of your life. Frankl does a marvelous job providing specific examples for every important point of \\"logotherapy\\" he wants his readers to fully comprehend.Frankl talks about his experience in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. The description of the dichotomy of man is amazing yet simplistic. To understand that MAN created such an evil thing like a gas chamber, yet no matter how horrible the situation is, MAN always has the freedom to choose how he will react. This freedom can never be taken away, even in the darkest of places...Frankl lived to tell about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"rec0mmeneded","review":"this book was recommended to me by my professor in grad school...she said EVERYONE should read this book in their lifetime...i gave it to my mom to read first"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a \\"must read\\" for all conscious human beings.","review":"Frankl's experiences and the wisdom he gained from them changed the way I see life and the world, at first reading, several decades ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"I gaged my rating because of the number of passages I highlighted.

You are responsible for life's chooses."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought my life was hard - shhheeeessshhhhh !!!","review":"Hands down the best book I've read in over a year. I bought this book because I was void of hope. I felt my painful experiences far exceeded anybody else's. Who could relate with me? I'll tell you who. This man here: Viktor Frankl. He invented logotherapy which is far more effective than psychotherapy. It deals with the meaning in our Lives rather than the problems with our brains. I thought that I had lived a hard one until I read this book. A concentration camp during the holocaust was no joke, the epitomy of suffering. Yet, there is meaning behind everything in Life, even times of great distress. This book awoke me from my slumber!! If you think that your Life is hopeless and not worth living .... please READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Text","review":"Frankl reprises a remarkable circumstance, his experience in German Work/Death Camps during WWII and his inspiring quest to find meaning amid daunting nearly unimaginable oppression. Functions better as a critique of Frankl's psychotherapy predecessors (Freud) than as a tract promoting the unique virtues of logotherapy. Worthy book for those of \\"greatest generation.\\" For \\"boomers,\\" my coming of age, I would suggest Ernest Becker's \\"The Denial of Death\\" serves as a more cogent testament and comprehensive critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"obligatory reading","review":"Good source of wisdom, knowledge about the human psychology and nature tested in the most extreme environment of the nazi death camps"},{"rating":"2","title":"A testimony to mankind's potential","review":"I had heard of Victor Frankl years ago, but never had the opportunity to read his work, and I'm grateful to finally get the chance to \\"hear\\" the voice of a concentration camp survivor. His observations on the ability of men and women to be more than just the victims of life's suffering are well worth reading and gives much food for thought. His ideas are as relevant today as when they were written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I thought","review":"It was a little too esoteric for me, high on philosophy and not enough down to earth summary or thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally thought provoking","review":"This book offers a very insightful look into the human mind through circumstances so dire its almost difficult to contemplate. Fortunately, most of us will never likely come within reach of such dreadful circumstances; however, by means of this book we are able to ascertain meaning by vicariously viewing the experiences of Dr. Frankl and learning from his own thoughts and perceptions about the matter.This book rates high in its ability to help the reader search for meaning, define purpose, and gain an incredible sense of relativity. I give four stars only as a result of its propensity to read like a psychology text book. I admit, however, that may speak more to my weaknesses and lack of pursuit on such subjects than the quality of the writing. As such, this is certainly not meant as a major detriment as the substance presented is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Great read about a psychologists view from behind the walls of a concentration camp. At least the first part is; in the second part, he explains his theory of logotherapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets progressively better","review":"I bought this book mainly to read Frankl\`s accounts of his time in the concentration camps.

I have been telling all my friends about this book and quoting passages for weeks now.It should be a must read for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel facts and mental health","review":"This book is divided in two parts. In the first one you will read about the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, written by a person that was there, in the very place, not by a history teacher or a researcher. Some details are omitted, but nonetheless the text shows much of the life (if we can use such word) of the prisioners.In the second part you will know about the psicology theory of the author. Even though the two parts of the book could be considered independent, after reading the first one you will understand how the theory introduced in the second part is developed.You would agree or not with the theory itself, you could even say there is some advertisement, but this book will make you think on the subject anyway, on both such cruel facts and mental health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have read this book (but in translation to Thai language).

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how page after page of descriptions of life under the nazis is supposed to help anyone with anything. I was already aware that many people have had to go through even worse things than watching a beloved spouse die of cancer, awful as that is. Certainly Mr. Frankel's experience and response to it is a tribute to the human spirit -- proof that we are more resillient than we think. But uplifting? No, I don't think so. Depressing, with no new information, is my synopsis. More power to those who can comfort themselves with some \\"meaning\\" in suffering and get something out of this book. But if you don't, you won't be the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychology in layman's terms","review":"Frankl has touched so many readers with \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" because of the simple, yet beautiful prose style that he used in his writing.Straightforward, honest reporting of his concentration camp experiences, followed by an analysis of the psychological impact he and his fellow prisoners endured. No heavy jargon. No dogmatic credos. I felt it to be the most humanistic approach to \\"finding meaning\\" that I have ever read. Today there is a trend towards 'biological psychiatry'....everything can be explained organically. Frankl holds out the hope that humans still have the ultimate freedom to \\"choose how we react to the most barbaric conditions with dignity and self-respect\\".. That is what sets us apart from our fellow Earth creatures.

Sans the detailed horror and gore of other WWII stories, Frankl gives a compassionate telling of his experiences and examines man's choice in how he reacts to life's many diffulties. He also introduces the reader to logotherapy, which he developed as a result of his WWII years. Logotherapy states that the root of depression and discontent is the person's lack of meaning in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing book","review":"Man's Search for Meaning changed my life for better by giving a compassionate view of our shared struggles to understand and overcome the evil we are willing to do to each other.The first part of the book is a straight forward narrative of Viktor Frankl's years in various concentration camps of Nazi Germany.

In the case of \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" we must forget classification. It stands as the single most impressive book I have ever read. Imagine enduring three years of a consentration camp as a jew in Nazi Germany and then writing a book six months after your liberation with the words \\"we owe World War II a great debt . . . \\" Not many people could find anything positive to say about what happened. Mr. Frankl does. I recommend this book to every one who is important to me. It contains the my three favorite quotes. One is above, the others you must find for yourself. A meaningful experience, Victor Frankl's \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\". Review by Ken Ashe MBBB42A@prodigy.co"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankl uses concentration camp experiences to develop theory","review":"How did anyone survive the tortuous conditions in the concentration camps in Germany? As a survivor, Viktor Frankl discusses how he observed himself and other survivors find meaning in the terrible suffering they endured. Frankly sites many examples of human courage and endurance that occurred, but he does not go into graphic detail of actual events. He explains how these experiences helped him to build upon his psychological theory which he termed Logotherapy. The book is divided into two parts, the first part describes his experiences and the second part consists of an explanation of his theory. I was emotionally moved to tears many times while reading this book and will never think about life the same way again. I have told everyone I know that they must read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas present","review":"I did not read the book as it was given as a Christmas gift.

The ability to constrain your options for something greater than this moment comes from having a meaningful purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaning Is My Responsibility","review":"Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Helpful for Self and Others","review":"The author's combination of horrid personal experience and \\"forced\\" inhumane behavior forma a valid hearing for his practice of helping others see themselves and all of life in a new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankl's search for meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's voice enraptures clairvoyance. The story is penetrating as well as moving. In his direst moments he maintains a strong voice and shares his introspective meditations. This is a Holocaust book unlike others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The High Price of Wisdom","review":"Half the book is about Dr. Frankl's experience in WWII concentration camps. It is gripping without being gory. His perspective as a scientist on what was happening to people mentally is most profound. The second half of the book describes his logotheraphy theory. It is neither too technical or dull, nor too dynamic. A nice even ground of a theory that makes complete sense. Bottom line, what this man went through to learn the eternal truth demands that we listen to what he says and search for our own meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking book","review":"It must be at least 25 years since I first read \\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" and I still refer to it. Frankl spends about half the book describing his experiences in Nazi concentration camps, and the rest of the book discussing how he tried to make sense of it and teach others how to handle adversity. One of the most important books around, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I own this book in paperback. I had to read it in college. I still remember the first time I read it. I sat in a chair and read it cover-to-cover. That's how good it is. It's amazing. This is one of those books you have to read in your lifetime. I'm writing this review because I saw it's a Kindle deal today for $1.99. That's awesome. Get it. Read it. It'll knock your socks off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to Read","review":"The first part of the book is a look into life at a German concentration camp. This book is based on the author's own life experiences, so it makes you have a more empathetic view of the story he is telling. This is an actual account of his time in the camps. His story moved me through a variety of emotions: anger, sadness. It really brought to light some of the horrible things that were done in the camps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be the most important book you ever read.","review":"If you were assigned to read this book in school years ago, maybe you can't remember what all the fuss is about. At last count, 152 Amazon reviewers gave this book an average of 5 stars. It is undoubtably on the short list for \\"Books that Changed My Live\\" for countless people. I suggest that the real wisdom to be found in this book comes not on the first reading, but upon re-reading (luckily, the book is short and moves quickly, too). All of the self-help books out there, from Deepak Chopra to Stephen Covey to Dr. Phil, are mere twaddle compared to this book. There is more truth and wisdom in one sentence of Frankl than in many volumes of other books. Do yourself a favor and buy this book (and pass a copy on to a friend afterward). You will immediately see positive changes in your life. And don't be dissuaded by the context, believe it or not, this is a life-affirming book that happens to take place in a concentration camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must book for making a meaningful life","review":"This book is very insightful in helping one find meaning in one's life as formulated in the methods of logotherapy which was developed by a Viktor Frankl, a survivor of one of the worst possible existences in the modern era, the Nazi concentration camps. The first part of the book Viktor recalls his experiences at the camps and all that he learned and gained from them to develop his concepts. The remaining part analyses in more detail logotherapy. This book is a must for all of who find emptiness in our lives or are hurt by anxiety or other concerns. The book is easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does life have a meaning?","review":"Yes is the testament of Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and neurologist who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and endured years of brutality under the shadow of the gas chamber.So what is the meaning of life?You are, according to Frankl.Neither joy nor suffering can give a man's life any meaning. It is the man who gives suffering, joy, or whatever his life contains a meaning, the way he accepts his fate and all that it entails.Regardless of external circumstances, there is a spark of freedom which enables man to fight or despair. To choose to be a demon or a saint.Agree or disagree, this book has power because it is written by someone who has been to hell and back. Who has seen it all with his own eyes. It's an antidote to the 'bumper sticker' feel-good juvenile slush that passes for philosophy nowdays.Whatever this book is, it's not superficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Was referred to this book-using all three I ordered for help in understanding the minds and lives of our encarcerated brothers and sisters.

My time is spent mostly \\"doing\\", as opposed to reading about doing. That said, I selected this book to read as one that I thought would be useful and enlightening. While it did provide some insights to the inner workings of the mind, it fell short of my expectations.To me, the content did not represent that which was implied by the title. Furthermore, the first half of the book relating to the authors experiences in a concentration camp, was severely disconnected with the second part of the book, which was basically, a self help phychoanalysis book. Both parts were interesting to a degree, but I did not think that they complimented each other. Like I said, disjointed at best.I know one reviewer stated that this is the best book he has in his entire (and massive) book collection. I'm sorry but, that's sad.Just one man's opinion....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspiration read!","review":"The meaning for your life can only make living better! Frankl's story of survival is inspiring for the psyche. Find your meaning to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conquering the Camps!","review":"Viktor Frankl has done the what no other book about the Holocaust has accomplished. Rather than dwelling on the atrocities of the guards and the evils of Nazism, he has shown us what the strength of the human spirit can accomplish.He describes a new way of looking at human interaction called Logotherapy, which explains why some people survived the camps with their spirits intact, while other who were even in better condition gave up and died.I loved the way he explains a difficult concept, and found myself re-reading several passages. He is a great philosopher and writer who understands humanity at a level few of us ever appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspiring and Uplifting","review":"This is the exoperience of a great man and Psychologist Vicktor Frankl and how he developed his theory of Existential Psychology. He spent 3 years in various concentration camps in Poland and developed a way to live each day and survive. He also delves into the psychology of his fellow prisoners and the camp guards and camp structure. This is his and unltimately our search for meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"Frankl underwent incredible horrors while living in the Nazi concentration camps of World War 2 Germany; yet he managed to maintain his focus on his own humanity while thoughtfully observing the behaviors of those around him who were also suffering. Frankl's logotherapy approach shows great insight into man's struggle to find purpose while giving hope and enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"this was an incredible book that was thoughtfully written. the author gave personal accounts and feelings that make you examine your own life. so often we sit back and ask what' s in this for me, the author encourages the reader to look outside of that and think of those around you.

I applaud Viktor Frankl for his inner strength to survive such an ordeal and come away with such dignity and inner peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, heavy and important and peaceful......","review":"I was given this book by a psych. that knew Dr. Frankl's son. It was so 'heavy' that I read it over and over and over. Not ony were the quotes so deep that I still quote them to others in 'need' to this day. I keep my old book in my emergency kit - it's very important to me in times of crisis - including our annual wildfire evacuations. Perhaps it's because I AM Jewish, but, I really understood, found depth in life and understanding. It also calmed my anxieties on death to a certain extent as well, something I have a hard time dealing with, mortality. What a brillant man, to not only survive a true living hell, but to rise above and become such a great person, author, doctor!! May heaven have that special place for him where he can now find all his loved ones.amber, 41Colorado"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to be Worthy of One's Suffering","review":"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very excellent book! It shows the reader that the mind/body can overcome and adapt to extreme trauma and pain be it phyiscal, mental, and spiritual. Great book if you are down and out because after reading it your life is nothing compared to the authors experience in the camps during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applicable to any life situation","review":"When I sat down to read this book, the last thing I expected was a lesson in how to manage people; that's what I got though! I had just left an assignment whose management I had difficulties with, but couldn't really understand why. This book put in perspective for me everything that went wrong. It was also meaningful to my experience as an elementary school teacher, a daughter and sister, and every other role I have in life. I will read this book every few years at least, and expect it to apply to whatever situation I'm in. I didn't read the second part about logotherapy, though. The change was too abrubt for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifelong Keeper for your library!","review":"I first read this book in college, as a psychology major. A few years later I loaned the book to a friend going through a tough time in his life. He loved the book and said it helped put things into prospective. He never returned the book. So when I had some difficulties come up in my own life, I went looking for the book to read again. I've recommended this over the years to many friends and family members. The basic concept of having a purpose in your life gives you strength to get through the tough times in life, is really the kernel of this entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"This book is moving, exciting, sad and insightful.

Unfortunately, evil exists in this world. Sometimes it's self imposed and sometimes we are just victims.

I also want to say that I was a big fan of Soul Reaver 1 . But I like my games to be (FUN!!!!!!!!!) NOT FRUSTRATING!!!)I was having fun playing this game until I got to the first boss Vampire (FAUSTUS). This boss has an energy bar that is about ten times larger that yours , He blocks every blow you throw at him, Many of his blows you can\`t block and some will drop you in about two hits!You are lucky if you get in two or three hits!! I have fought FAUSTUS about thirty times and still have yet to beat him ! the control is part of it . It is rather clunky. This will be my LAST Eidos game . They all seem to be like this (frustrating). I may take this game back or trade it for store credit. I think HALO really spoiled me!! Parts of HALO can be rather hard to get through but it is still fun! Thats what playing games is all about, Right? The game should not make you want to pull the disc out and smash it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Dark and Captivating","review":"I can't put this game down. The Whole Concept of the Dark Gifts is faboulous. THe battle scenes are great and you actually have to contemplate your next move in battle.

NOW, WHEN IS EIDOS GOING TO BRING TOMB RAIDER TO THE XBOX?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as Halo","review":"I have played Halo legendary mode for most levels including Truth and Reconciliation. Saying that, I absolutely love Blood Omen II. The backgrounds and environments are phenomenal, even if the some of characters aren't as remarkable(a little crude in some cases). Without spoiling it, the special abilities that you acquire are extremely cool. Some of the bosses are difficult and require a little research or you get frustrated. But, hey, the whole Flood portion of Halo is frustratingly mind numbing and I still like it. I think you'll agree, this game is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible addition to the franchise","review":"I started the SR series with Legacy of Kain (SR2). I was sadly disappointed in Blood Omen 2, which has none of the ingenuity or artistry of the SR series. So I settled in for an action game, and was disappointed in the fighting engine (very tricky, and often results in your character getting killed from behind). Halfway through the game, emphasis seems to switch from action to lever-pulling, as you have a series of nonsensical puzzles to solve. Definitely the most depressing part of the game is the cut-scenes. Everyone in the game talks like they're fresh out of a vampire soap opera (kind of like an Anne Rice rip-off but without the sex). Plus, if your character gets killed after listening to a 3-minute dialogue segment, you have to watch the whole thing over again. And again. And again, until you get to the next save point. Very frustrating. I would NOT reccommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Having never played a horror game I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunatley, I was disappointed. The gameplay soon became very boring as the only type of action is to run around drinking the blood of unsuspecting townfolk. Interspersed along the way is the occassional bad guy, treasure chest (I have no clue as to what benefit it gives) and the requirement of having to find a switch at different points in order to open gates. I found the controls to be slow and clumsy and the graphics are so-so. I guess I just expected more from an x-box game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Lovin From The Soundtrack Queer As Folk","review":"This is a great song and the video to Some lovin was awsome!

On the contrary, Kristine W's \\"Lovin You\\" cd maxi single of earlier talent is a much better choice with track number four(Johnny Vicious Club Mix) probably being the best remix.

It shouldn't be allowed for a book to be called 'Halliwell's...' unless it's written by him alone. The fact is that Halliwell is NOT a brand name. It's the name of an author who died in 1989. He wrote the entire books himself - He wasn't just the curator of a collection - he was an author in his own right. To start adding further reviews by John Walker means it is no longer Halliwell's guide. Simple as that...Why isn't there a Walker's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker?

That's comedy for me because I enjoy laughing. Candy and Belushi made me laugh at their gambling addictions. The French police made me laugh as they handled their rich American quarry.

THe book has received very good reviews in Publisher's Weekly, Library Journal and elsewhere. It's objective, it's not promotional, and it criticizes Gurdjieff, evenhandedly, as well as setting out his very important teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction and a great read!","review":"Author John Shirley has written a clear and compelling overview of the life, ideas and teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff. Shirley clarifies that this book is just an introductory piece, and points to other works, including Ouspensky's <i>In Search of the Miraculous</i>, which Shirley describes as the authoritative explanation of the Gurdjieff Work, insofar as a book can do justice to Gurdjieff's teachings, which are said to be experiential rather than intellectual. However I think he's too modest; he's clearly devoted subtantial careful research and consideration to his complex subject. I highly recommend this book - even if you've never heard of Gurdjieff, it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic, but not a truthful one.","review":"Mr. Boyington wrote a great book, but to really know about his squadron, VMF-214, I suggest one to read \\" Black Sheep-The Definitive Account of Marine Fighting Squadron 214\\", by Bruce Gamble. The facts quoted by Boyington are often misleading, with incorrect dates or which never took place at all. Much more time is expensed talking about his life as a prisoner in Japanese camps than eith his fellow Squadron mates. Boyington was a compulsive liar and a lousy Squadron commander on the ground, and his book reflects this. It is incoherent and inconsistent from beggining to end. I don't really know how someone may think it is \\"the best book on air wair in the Pacific\\" ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok book, not enough info on things around him","review":"I found myself rather disapointed because boyington spent most of the book describing his thoughts and fellings and life and not enough of what was going on around him. It was as if he was trying to make everyone feel sorry for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A CLASSIC AT ALL !!!","review":"Totally obtrusive as a writer, Boyington's book is plain horrible. It really doesn't deserve the attention it got. BOyington was a real air hero ( as all the men who served in WW II ), a master in the Corsair fighter, but a poor leader to his squadron in general ( I mean the ground echelon, etc ). The book is full of lies ( intended or not, I don't know ) and almost a half of it is plain boring, in the hands of the Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping first person account of those desperate times","review":"Boyington was definitely not your Tom Cruz type of pilot, he was an unorthodox risk taking, erm, a Black Sheep, which goes a long way to describe his style. In a time when so many people played it by the book, he took men destined for hard jail time and turned them into one of the most feared squadrons of the South Pacific.The book is a description of the days with his squadron, as recounted by him so expect this not a dry and exacting account written by someone in USMC public relations.This is among my favorite books of all time, and a recomended read for anyone interested in aviation, WWII, or just a great (and true) action story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a womens point of view..","review":"I'm not a big military/plane history book reader but I found Pappy's book interesting enough to make it through within a few days of buying it.I enjoyed hearing his view on things that were happening and of not reading so much the technical aspects of the war/planes.There were times when I felt it needed something. Like a kick in the rear to get it going but decided that this was written by Pappy not Tom Clancy. This was his life, it was not \\"entertainment\\" to him.He put himself down alot about his drinking which, to me seemed like he was trying to make amends with the reader about his problem. I ignored this and concentrated on the story.

Lt. Col. Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington, a multiple Marine Ace and Congressional Medal of Honor Winner, wrote this book about his experiences just prior to, during and just after WWII. His adventures and misadventures make a good read. Some of what he describes may have been embelished, but I defy anyone to tell me which parts are true and which parts aren't.

Don't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for preschoolers, unlike Disney's scary movies","review":"My 4-year-old, a Little Bear fan, really enjoyed this movie. Little Bear meets a bear named Cub in the wilderness, who is similar to Little Bear yet very different. Cub plays rough and eats differently. Yet, they soon become friends, and they search for Cub's parents who got separated from him during a storm. There are only a couple of slightly \\"scary\\" parts, the brief scene with the storm, and their encounter with a not-so-friendly mountain lion. We especially liked the scene where Little Bear, Father Bear and Cub are making pancakes and taking turns flipping them into the air. The movie was very entertaining for my daughter. It is hard to find appropriate videos for pre-schoolers. She finds most Disney movies to be very scary and won't watch them.

Actually, the whole family has been watching it. It is such a cute story. The boys stay glued to the screen while it's on.It's nice to find a DVD with Little Bear because the younger boy had been crying to watch him all day long. He simply didn't understand why it couldn't be on TV all the time.We thought and thought on a special gift to buy for his 3rd birthday. At the last minute (literally the day before), we found the Little Bear DVDs at Amazon. Lucky for us, Amazon has amazing shipping and we were able to receive them the next day before the party. We're extremely pleased with the quality of the movie and service from Amazon.Little Bear saved the day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Wholesome","review":"My kids, 5 and 2 love this movie.

The family values and messages with Little Beear are WONDERFUL! I am not going to say that things have not come up with my very literal minded 2 year old that I wish hadn't (Like making a mark on the wall for your height), but all in all the messages are good ones. Also, unlike Lazytown, which is pumped up music all the time, I can listen to Little Bear in the background and NOT get a headache.

He remembers childhood holidays in rural Georgia where his young African-American neighbors might get an orange and some raisins. He recalls the four Christmases he spent as President. A very religious and family-oriented man, Carter has alsways treasured the birth of Christ as one of the highlights of his year. Easily read in one night this is a charming little book. To better understand this complicated and important man, a fuller read is last year's \\"An Hour Before Daylight\\" which is a more thorough memoir of his childhood years. But \\"Christmas in Plains\\" stands on its own: a charming, sometimes heartwarming account of a good man and his 70+ Christmases. This deserves to become a minor holiday classic--unlike, say, Grisham's new \\"Skipping Christmas\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same Christmas Memories For All","review":"Just sit back and enjoy.

This is why p2p networks keep going, becuase corporate America just can't get it right. Why can I buy the song from Gilligan's Island, but I can't buy the Queer Eye theme as it sounds on the show..... that's all I want.... was it asking too much?

The title track by remixers Wide Life is pretty good but should have come in a fuller version. The remixes stated here are all single radio remixes for Kylie,Sting,Duran Duran and the mix up mix for Fischerspooner vs. Billy Squier that is quite good. This also serves as an intro to newer Capitol/EMI acts like the incredible Jamelia from the UK,Ok Go(great song) and long time artist Liz Phair who offers the better single \\"Extraordinary\\". Dance tracks from Ingrid,Basement Jaxx,Junior Senior and the classic Elton John \\"Are You Ready for Love\\" round out the cd. I wish the remixes would have been full length but I am giving it the 4 stars for Jamelia- she is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the remix","review":"The theme song from the show has been remixed for the CD, unfortunately; the rhythm track is annoying and robs the song of its original appeal.

But my expectations focused on the Queer Eye theme song, which has left my disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Original Here","review":"This book is just a rehashing of The Oathbound Wizard. Nearly all of the major scenes are identical. The only difference is that they are told from Saul's POV.

I listened through in the car with the usual trepidation one feels buying a CD by an unfamiliar artist and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the music - innovative arrangements and a captivating voice; great pitch, range, tonal colour, feel and a precise ear for languages (the French version of Michel Legrand's \\"You Must Believe in Spring\\" is to die for). There's so much musical variety on the album, I can't imagine ever getting bored with it. Then I got time to sit and read the liner notes. Carol accompanies herself on piano - and she's great! I agree - Karrin Allyson and Diana Krall had better watch their backs. I don't know where Carol's been hiding, but it's time the world recognised a great talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Surprise Find","review":"I was in an Apple retail store checking on iPods and \\"You Take Me Away\\" is a sample song I select.

Also, the covers of \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" and \\"Every Breath You Take\\" made me hit the skip button. If you like this album though, you will be blown away by her first two albums \\"LUCKY TO BE ME\\" and \\"INCLINED\\". I bought \\"The Language of Love\\" on the blind, and while there are a few good tracks, I wish now I would have listened to it in the store first.To be sure, I played \\"INCLINED\\" right after listening to this album, and there is NO comparison.My advice, listen to it first before you buy it.....but in all fairness to Carol, the aforementioned two other albums are incredible, and I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a music fan - of Carol's","review":"DITTO what 'A Music Fan' said.

I can't believe we're listening to the same album. All I heard was an overly breathy, average singer whose range isnt great [but like the advice in the Sondheim song she \\"modulates\\"] and who lacks all a real singer's talents when it comes to interpreting and playing with the melody.To compare, I think Connie Evingson has a similar kind of voice, but is a MUCH better singer and interpreter of jazz music. And if you want to listen to REAL jazz greats, I suggest Carmen Lundy and Paula West.Maybe it's just my taste, because the other reviewers had quite a different impression of this singer.

The falconess special character is missing as is permanent anti-death at the end of the game. I emailed Midway and they confirmed these bugs and said there are no plans to fix them. This was especially disappointing because I lost the ability to play as the Valkyrie as soon as I used a special character. This spoiled the game for me. I have also played the arcade game and the N64 versions and both are better than the Playstation. Save your money and play it in the arcade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience would have paid off","review":"Very, very disappointing. The main problem with this game is the fact that while the arcade version was a challenging, sweaty-palm action game, this has virtually no challenge at all. In fact, I beat the game in two weeks with all four characters at level 99 as the secret characters. This was put out six months after the game broke into arcades, and apparently more time should have been given it. Midway should have learned something from the previous editions of gauntlet on the nintendo, which actually kept some of the thrill of the arcade versions. Recommended only to diehard fans or inexperienced players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as the arcade...but still not tooo bad","review":"While the arcade game is completely awesome and addicting, the Play station version isn't half bad. Really, who ever thinks that a game made for the arcade will be as great at home as it was in the arcade has some serious problems. As far as i've noticed (with out beating the whole game, which should happen later today) there are only a few problems. One is that of course you only can have 2 players instead of 4, and another is that it seems to easy. Where in the arcade you'd be sweating and grabbing more quarters, in this game you may think \\"well i dunno\\" and then still end up winning. it lacks any serious competition for the player. but if you want a way to numb your mind for a few hours, and aren't to picky about perfect graphics or brain beating competition, this game isn't a bad way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"This game is an insult to the arcade. They changed way too many things like increasing your stats with gold and traps were missing throughout the levels. They were in too big of a hurry to get this on the market for the PSX. The graphics could have been better, and the limit of two players is a joke. If you really like Gaunlet Legends in the arcade, buy it for the N64. It was a lot better all around.

I played it on the N64 and not much has changed since it came out on the GC. There are a few new characters and enemies and other small changes but overall the game is the same. The graphics don't look much better than Gauntlet Legends and the sound effects are annoying (you know the thumping foot steps). It seems to me that Midway wanted to get a game out on the GC quickly and inexpensively and this is what they came up with. What was Nintendo thinking? They should never had allowed this game to be released on their console. What's the point in having a next-gen. console without a next-gen. game?

The video also seems to have been filmed with a time delay effect making glenn's vocals and the also the drummer's playing out of time with what we are seeing on the screen.During darker moments we are subjected to a unacceptable amount of pixelation all over the image.Glenn Hughes as an artist should never have permitted such a shoddy (Grab The Money And Run) release to have ever hit the shelves.Shame On Him!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"originality, not quality","review":"If you don't know about the symponic suite (the one with the music you actually hear in the game itself) you may want to seriously reconsider your purchase of this soundtrack. In Dragon Quest VIII, nearly every peice of music is fully orchestrated, giving the music more depth and ability to set a mood than most other games could ever dream of. HOWEVER, this is not the case as far as this soundtrack is concerned. By \\"original\\", they mean the synthesized, spiritless tunes that were originally composed for the game that were eventually replaced. Needless to say, they pale in comparison to their orchestrated counterparts. A soundtrack is a movie or game with nothing other than the music, yet it still costs more than the game or movie itself... that being said, why would you want the music to be of a lower quality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hits of Jim Croce","review":"I love this cd.

It proved to be an invaluable quick reference guide to wildlife we saw during the day, as well as an encyclopedic work on each species, including countries where they're found, coloration, mating habits, foods, and myriad other details. You can take a cursury view of an animal or a deep dive into each one. I recommend spending a little time learning the cross-referencing system to get the most out of the book.

Although it is Haden's album, this is really a group effort. Each individual shines in their respective role. I am constantly amazed by the subtlety and melodic quality of Ed Blackwell's drumming. As a music professor, specifically a jazz instructor, I have made all of my drum students study this album. Nor can enough be said about Haden's playing at this concert. He builds his lines with an authority that is assured and vibrant. The musical logic in his ideas are breathtaking. You can hear where he is taking his line and when he gets there, it's nirvana. One highlight of this album is Don Cherry's Art Deco, there's a certain wistfulness in the playing that compelled me to keep turning to this performnace over and over again after I learned of his passing. Okay, so I like this recording. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and discordant","review":"After hearing the exquisite playing on Charlie Haden's Nocturne,I thought for sure this album would be enjoyable ,too. Not so! Either I am not \\"hip\\" or progressive enough or this album stinks. Every cut seems to drift into loud dissonant passages, and the more so the longer the cut seems to get and the louder the recording engineer seems to mix it. Afraid we'll miss some of it I guess. I have heard this album compared to Bill Evans music. I don't see this at all, and I've collected Bill Evans for many years. I have nearly a dozen Haden albums and this ranks just about at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Performance","review":"I've had this scale for a few years now and I've just come to expect to see a different reading each time I step on the scale. I have to take a few readings and average them. Sometimes the difference between one weighing and the next is as much as four pounds.Also, the scale supposedly has a \\"fat analyzer\\" feature, but I was just looking at it a moment ago, and I have no idea how to activate this feature. I can set up to 10 separate users, entering age, height, sex, and \\"fit level\\" for each, but there's no mechanism I see for having the scale analyze anything except my weight (which it does poorly, as I mentioned).The last straw for this scale was my recent visit to my doctor's office. They had just installed a new digital scale, and according to it, my Salter was registering 15 pounds under the actual weight. Considering that there's no obvious way to adjust this digital scale, that's just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull dull dull","review":"It's hard to believe a boring book could be made from the life of this buffalo hunter, marshal, politician and businessman but Metz' managed it.

The Casting was comical (I felt bad for the actors), the Acting, Direction and Overall look of the film was Terrible; it all came off as a really BAD Bisexual Porn with a Perverse Plot. TERRIBLE!!!!!

Now I am a business man (owner of a dive bar) from a largely populated area somewhere in the U.S. I know classic movies like I know Star Trek, and I know a whole lot about Star Trek, but this is just another case of hooligans trying to tear down the thriller movie biz. Now you wouldn't hire a clown to fix a leak in the jon, so why are you allowing garbage like this to penetrate our TVs. Even chichona (that is big honkers in spanish) didn't like it.

The actual pizza recipes are divided roughly by geographic region. The variety is fantastic. Recipes use beef, chicken, pork, seafood, tofu, beans, or just vegetables. Fresh herbs are often included in the ingredients, as well as a wide variety of cheeses. The author includes a glossary of ingredients in case you come across one that you are unfamiliar with. If you are looking for an unusual and impressive pizza recipe, then you will find it in this cookbook.

While it has some good info, if you already know anything about camping/hiking/backpacking, then you will get nothing new from it.

Otherwise, pass on it, or get a more in depth book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"The cover and description of this book did not do justice describing how elementary and basic this book is. Copyrighted in 1996, much of this book is out of date. The \\"tips\\" were remedial. For example: \\"Be cautious, bears can be dangerous.\\" Really? Are you sure?

The author is primarily concerned with the development of memorialization, and how the community processed an infamous tragedy. The information on the actual bombing (perpetrators, procedure, etc.) is minimal, and the author's approach is distinctly academic. The academic tone of the book is nicely balanced with personal anecdotes of survivors and family members, saving the book from being overly dry. Personally, I enjoyed the unique focus of the text, and believe that it would be useful for interpreting any memorial process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Rudimentary","review":"This dvd is mediocre at best (in my opinion)The narrator does an effective job demonstrating each rudiment, starting slow and then increasing in speed.

The port to PSX simply provides a poor quality game. The graphics rot compared to other fighting games, the difficulty levels are all out of whack, and the controls...forget about it.

(For those who don't know, sorry folks that you are, MK4 was originally an arcade game using truly awesome proprietary 3D hardware.)In this case, it was the polygon count. Close up, some of these characters are just UGLY. The characters' polygons often clip and sometimes just disappear; fortunately, this only affects the look, not the feel, of the game.The standard \\"home version\\" additions are here -- endurance mode (harkening back to MK1), practice modes with move lists, and Reiko finally has a \\"real\\" ending to his storyline.

I am use to African American Authors who give a more realistic approach to writing. When I'm reading the situations seems real and even the ending seems real. This did not happen with this book.

Mary B. Morrison did it once more! I loved the success of the charicters and the friendships in this story. I wasn't thrilled that the book went 20 years or so into the charicters lives but by the end I was o.k. with that. This story evoked much emotion and I found myself cheering for the charicters to stop waisting time and get together already. The most compelling was the ability of Jada to deal with adverse situations and with true friends at her side she was able to overcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"aiiight!!!!","review":"i agree with mrs robinson....i wasnt to fond of jada by the end of the book ....after 20 years or 15 married to lawrence she didnt have to talk to him in such rude ways.....yes we agree there is such thing as a soul mate but to wait 20 years and practically destroy(im glad he bounced back) a man who worshipped you he did absolutley nothing wrong to her ....that was fow!!! then wellington has the nerve to hit it one last time with his ex!!! the son was a mess!!! it was good but i wished she had been nicer to lawrence in the end.....it wasnt his fault!!!i wish the author had delved into getting with your soul mate in a more subtle way than to start cussing her present husband out(I REALLY NEEDE TO KNOW THAT!!) but i sure would'nt consider jada's way."},{"rating":"2","title":"never again once more","review":"I've read her books in the past but not in order so I decided to order then in twos & read them.I really enjoyed it & can't wait til my next two arrive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This sexy and provoctive novel is by far the best you will read this year. You explore the joys of love, success and great personal pleasures. You come face to face with your inner self and the pain that mistakes of the past may cause. We learn how to be true to ourself no matter what the cost. Love is only to be given if it is without conditions or stipulations. You will fall in love once again with Jada and Wellington and their passion for life, love, honesty and trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Again Once More... Left Me Wanting More!!","review":"She's done it again! Mary B. Morrison is one of the most TALENED WRITERS I've read in years! This book is a continuation to Soulmates Dissipate, and I can not say enough about it.. I was mad when I finished it because I didn't want the story to end. She addressed so many different things in this book finding true love, to love or let it go, faith, family, health, promiscuity, and deceit.... A Must READ I promise, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"?!?!?! not bad....but definitely not 'great'","review":"This book, while being nice because it was a sequel, I found to be rather lacking and not really based in reality. I don't think there was enough character development...seems to me that all the character developing was done in 'they did this, they did that' instead of actual behaviors from the characters themselves. When reading a book, I'm not very interested in the name brand clothing and material possessions they have, I like characters that I can related to on a personal level - get into sort of. I don't know any guys that would behave as \\"lawrence\\" in respect to the main character \\"jada diamond\\", but if you're into materialistic writing and the like, this book might be for you. The plot was good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Again ,but she did Once More","review":"Never Again Once More proved you never say Never.Jada said Never again but her heart proved she would once more.I just could not understand why she would take so long to come to grip with her feeling.This was certainly a spicy and steamy read that I throughly enjoyed . Sometimes I had to put the book down just to cool off .I also found this novel a great read for a bookclub.I will have to suggest it to the two the bclubs I am a member of. So many questions and hearing the answers would make for a great discussion.Having read Soulmate Dissipate I am sure they will agree to select it.I rate Never Again Once More was 4.5* ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Lame!","review":"Labeling vigilantes' use of a windmill as a hanging platform as \\"technology\\" is a real stretch. Similarly, ear cropping and branding to clearly ID robbers, use of a bullwhip to punish others, and a mountain howitzer to blow down a wanted man's cabin. Sorry - there really isn't any technology involved here - just raw justice, and sometimes abuse of justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Almost a brief linguistic course","review":"The author introduces and describes the grammar from a very scholar,analytical and logical stand of view. The book is like a compact mini course of grammar. The author emphasizes the logic behind the words formations, i.e. clauses, phrases, verbs formations that makes some old fashion /ambiguous grammar terminology and rules more clear and straightforward.Although the length of the book could be a little issue, it is very readeable.I don't know if it is going to improve my gmat score (the only reason because I purchased it) but it definitely has improved my knowledge of grammar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. Morenberg assumes that the reader knows the basic rules, when in deed, this is meant to be a basic grammar book. He fails to mention the well used exceptions when doing a sub-par job of explaining grammar. This book may be called \\"Doing Grammar\\" but most of it is impermeable even for those who have been studying the subject for years.His persistent use of differing lexical categories -- he often makes up his own -- which don't harmonize with contemporary categories just makes matter more complicated.A excellent Grammar Book is \\" A Student's Introduction to English Grammar\\" by Huddleston and Pullum. I bought this book a year before buying Doing Grammar and it's great. Very comprehensive and with multiple examples and in-depth definitions and application!I would not recommend Doing Grammar to anyone and would have given it 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing if you don't think like Morenberg.","review":"This grammar book appeals to a certain type of people. If you are capable of thinking exactly like the author, then this book will meet your needs. He is very abstract in his structure, which makes it difficult for me to follow, as I prefer learning in a sequential and logical order. A difficult text to use as a reference, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get From Flab to Fab! xoxoxo","review":"I think Lebron James just looked angrily into the camera. He's a star.

For those with an academic interest in psychedelic drugs, it's almost a mandatory purchase, containing dozens of novel new tryptamine-based psychoactives (including several LSD derivatives), many of which are now available through the so-called \\"research chemical\\" trade. For better or worse, Shulgin's two books are landmark works in the developing relationship between the public, the government, and a dizzying array of new psychoactive drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"yet another gem","review":"This is a fine contribution although 'The Continuation' might lead one to believe that both Pihkal and Tihkal are of the same sphere. I suppose they are, if one isn't well-read regarding the metabolism and synthesis of these two very different families of compounds. As a synthetic organic chemist, I appreciated not only the autobiographical sketch but also the synthesis/observation section. Some of his methods are a bit dated. However, they are indeed valid if you don't mind sacrificing yield and purity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for persons without previous knowledge of this subject","review":"I am a professor of Spanish Linguistics. I used this book one semester in an undergraduate applied linguistics course and received very negative feedback from the students. In spite of the fact that the back cover claims that the book is for those with no previous knowledge of L2 acquisition research, it was definitely not accessible to my students. It lacks a clearly organized approach in explaining the history of the discipline, existing L2 acquisition theory, what motivates researchers to conduct the studies that they do, and the terminology of the discipline. I have since found that a better choice for real begginers in this area is \\"Principles of Language Learning and TEaching\\" by H.D. Brown (1994). Its scope includes more than L2 acquisition theory, as the title suggests, but it provides the basic understanding necessary to then begin to talk about current research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PERFECT way to organize a filing project gone out of control.","review":"I had ignored filing for about six months.

I need a book that can help me understand how to cook anything. I'm desperate here. My skills are beyond bad. Burning chocolate pudding was bad enough two weeks ago, but now I'm burning spaghetti sauce. Last night I had to walk through the dark and throw my meal in the winter wheat field beside my house as a result. Maybe I could have salvaged the noodles by rinsing them off, but it wasn't a chance worth taking. If you've ever had burnt spaghetti sauce, you will understand how disgusting and vile it tastes. Funny how the juicy meatballs tasted fine, heh.Anyway this book does a remarkable job opening up more cooking opportunities for all the aspiring cooks out there willing and ready to learn another recipe. It's really good. I just wish I had the talent to make my meals as deliciously accurate as presented in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating collection of airwar experience","review":"Personal testimonies of fighters are always very interesting, each tale gives a touch of human dimension in wars coolly and distantly narrated by freelancers or reporters. In this book there is a vivid picture of the burden to wage aerial war in Vietnam, a scar still painful in memories of those who fought it. Their stories are well worth a careful reading since they reveal the psychological attitude of the airmen and their lifestyle under the strain of action. This portrait is accurate and gripping, giving many details of how tactics, training and hardware worked under real condition (contrary to the flawless operations of a peacetime simulation). Clearly some stories are edifying experience of servicemen that went beyond the call of duty, but largely most of them resound of day to day life and of behaviour of common soldiers towards the harshness of fight.

It also made me thankful that I have a mom. This is a must buy for any Rugrats fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and touching","review":"Fans of the last Rugrats movie won't be dissapointed. Rugrats in Paris is a entertaining movie with jokes for everyone in the family, and slapstick humor from the begining to the end. But underneath it all is a touching story about how important family really is. It all starts when Chuckie finds the need for a new Mommie at Grampa Lu and Lulu's wedding. Everything then gets thrown into chaos when Stu's called to Paris when it Reptar Robot goes crazy. Brining along the family, and the rest of the crew they find themselves in EuroReptar World, a Japanesse theme park in the middle of Paris.

Only 1 or 2 songs really stand out, most of them sound very much alike (same background music style and rhythm).

I cried, I smiled, I closed my eyes,I went along for the Elliott ride of my life! He took me there.

Yamin's tone is, as always, perfect. The album's tracks, if a bit stilted toward the \\"girl-you-are-amazing\\" subject, are just as engaging in the 50th listen as in the first. The only track that bothers me is \\"Alright\\". It has a fun dance rhythm and downbeat and then... \\"we can indiscreetly dip out of sight.\\" Really? Indiscreetly? That lyric drives me nuts every time I hear it, every single time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good R&B debut that improves with each listen","review":"Very strong debut for Elliott. Most everyone is familiar with his voice, which comes through on the album clear, sonorous, and without muddying his wonderfully slight rasp.The songs are ok, but not stellar. There are a handful of strong numbers, but even the mediocre tunes are interesting due to Elliott's earnest and soulful singing. The arrangements are tasteful and the album sequence is well balanced. The producers knew when to pour it on, and when to pull back.Overall, unless you are allergic to R&B;, get this CD. It is a nice music package that won't sound like anything else in your collection, and though I have heard better songs, this one will improve with repeated listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented guy, but these songs don't show it.","review":"Yamin has a wonderful voice, there is no denying that. Unfortunately, this album does little more than to showcase it in songs that are forgotten almost as soon as they end. And unless his next effort is head and shoulders above this one, I'm afraid his career will follow suit.As stated, Elliott can definitely sing. What he really needs, however, is a REAL band, playing well-crafted songs with hooks-a-plenty and then and only then, will he truly be on to something.Here's hoping that happens as he, and his loyal fans, deserve much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut album for Elliott","review":"While I've read a number of the reviews here on Amazon, some mixed, but mostly positive, I feel compelled to add my two cents. Like many of Elliott's fans, I have waited a long long time for this debut cd. I think the compilation of songs and Elliott's delivery of them superb. His voice is strong, pure, rich and soulful. I would recognize his distinctive voice on the radio in an instant. I am overjoyed to finally have more music by Elliott Yamin. I think there are many gems on this cd, and I have fallen in love with each and every one of them, just as I have fallen in love with Elliott all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"Elliott Yamin was the class of Season 5. Having said that, he does not fit the mold and I am glad that he did not win. On his own, with strong management, he will have the opportunity to give his current and all those who will become fans much pleasure for many years to come.My personal favorite on this CD is \\"I'm The Man\\".

Like Elliot doing more Bob Dylan/Van Morisson style with more soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I expected a lot more from Elliott on this CD. The production quality is very low on almost every song and the only ones likely to be played on the radio sound like songs the Backstreet Boys threw away 10 years ago. He should have just stuck with soul and not tried to be mainstream because it doesn't work for me. I'm looking forward to his next record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag","review":"Elliott's singing is excellent as always and it is the reason that I bought this CD. The melodies are mostly mediocre and the arrangements are low-budget cheesy grooves like from a Casio electronic keyboard. The fake clapping mixed up so high just drives me nuts. Luckily there are a few songs that don't fit this description.The production and melody quality are what kill this CD. It's certainly not Elliott as he really sang his heart out on every track. Hopefully the next time he can get better support, better production, etc. and then he can have a real winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Surprise","review":"I had no idea this CD was in the works, it has been a while since AI was on...but holy cow!

This CD will cross generations and be pleasing to everyone. His master class voice resonates throughout the CD. There is not one bad track. Want a great CD that is not overproduced pop and will have you singing along with each song? This is the one! It cuts to the soul! Well done Elliott!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible voice, but songs lacking","review":"My mind was made up, the moment I fell in love with Elliot on the show, that no matter how bad this album was going to be, I was going to own it. The reason was simple: A voice like that cannot be allowed to disappear into obscurity, as have been the fate of many idols.That being said, Elliot's voice is gorgeous and restrained, making mediocre songs sound halfway interesting. The lack of imaginative, diverse, and real instrument (would love to have heard some serious horn section) is one reason why this album sounds thin and abrupt. The other just boils down to unoriginal songwriting. Some songs have the potential to be winners, but the production side was repetitive, making some of the few-note melodies even more monotonous.Granted, Elliot doesn't have the clout yet to choose giants of the industry to work with, but let's give him some time. So fans, buy the cd, nurture this incredible talent so he gets to pick better producers next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Elliott","review":"What an amazing CD. I have played it over and over again and love it more each time. My favorite songs are Waiting For You and I'm The Man, but each cut is great.

I anxiously anticipated the release of this CD, but now wonder what happened ... Most all of the songs sound the same and they are somewhat boring. There is very little life to any of these songs.I think Elliott is an amazing singer, but this CD doesn't showcase his tremendous talents at all. Nothing would make me happier than to tell you this music is wonderful -- but it simply isn't. Maybe the CD will grow on me -- I can only hope.Compare this with Chris Daughtry's first CD and you will see the difference (The Daughtry CD is amazing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I agree with some of the reviews that this Elliott's debut is a disappointment.

Just my opinon."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, So, Soulful!!","review":"I purchased this cd as soon as it came out. It is one of the best cds I've heard lately.

He was my AI favorite that season, because of his unique style. Loved the blue-eyed soul!These song styles are NOT what he does best.

However, upon further listening, I realized what a truly excellent collection this is. Songs I had overlooked before, became my new favorites. There is only one song I skip each time, due more to the genre than his performance, and while \\"Song for You\\" is my all-time favorite Idol performance, the recording seems to be a bit oversung. Still, Elliott has given us what is probably the best CD to come out of American Idol. He is the most naturally gifted singer of all, and I look forward to his next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best male vocalists","review":"Great CD. Although he didn't work with a huge record company and the song writing isn't the greatest, it doesn't matter because this man can truly sing his heart out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!!","review":"I rarely use the word perfect but Elliott's CD is perfection. I only started listening to him the last few weeks on AI because I was in to Taylor's performances and Katherine's voice. But Elliott's voice grabbed my soul. He is an amazing talent. I don't listen to R&B but Elliott's CD changed my mind. There are easily 7-8 #1 hits on this CD, although all the song's are brilliant. Even if you've never heard of Elliott Yamin, you will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE his CD. It is the BEST debut CD to come out of any idol in AI. That proves you don't have to win to be a winner. Thanks to AI for giving Elliott a forum to sing and for giving him to us. LOVE YOU ELLIOTT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG..i luv this game","review":"OK...

The songs are very catchy and most of them are very upbeat. The whole album creates a mood ideal for imagining sci-fi universes and maintains great energy throughout. I managed to get my hands on the special edition copy with remixes of all the songs and the remixes (except the Caustic remix) blew me away even harder than the Harsh Generation album! This is an all-time favorite for me, and after months of listening to it with other artists I still find myself enjoying every song on this album. It'll get old after you've listened to it for a week straight, but then it'll keep coming back like a drug addiction throughout the many months ahead. Grendel's creativity and musical genius is worth every last penny spent on this album! Truly amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Grendel's previous album, \\"Prescription:Medicide,\\" sounded like an overly-distorted Embryodead-era Wumpscut (if you don't believe me, go back and listen to track 1, \\"Construct Constriction,\\" and then go and listen to the title track of Embryodead. Hear it now? Good). After the noteworthy \\"Soilbleed\\" EP, they have now progressed to...bland, uninteresting harsh EBM. It's not that anything about the album is particularly bad, but rather that it doesn't really stand out with any sound of its own. The synth lines are reminiscent of a dozen bands and just about every recent club-friendly release. The vocals are also the stereotypical distorted scream/sing/speak that gets tiresome by track 2. The programming is just varied enough to guarantee that a human being was involved in the creative aspect at some point, but not interesting enough to merit any serious attention. Great filler music but otherwise wholly unremarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"pre-review?","review":"Am buying this on the strength of \\"Tiger Rose\\" being included on a double CD; 'Essential Southern Rock'.

I have a lot of these intro books. Russian is a very deep subject. The classes tend to hang up on a few items forever, and this book moves you along to new areas. The more compressed dense type is Oxford Russian Grammar and Verbs which is maybe too much for the pure beginner. This book also tries to show pronunciation and now has CD of some use. Author has done a service to the beginner. The book is not a large set of tables of endings which might be in a reference book. It is unlikely that one would speak much Russian after reading one book. I think the critics here are too narrow. The book is a good overview of basics. I would buy also an Intermediate next book in Russian in this Idiot Series if it is ever done (such exists in Spanish)."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOW","review":"I tried to read this book... and guess what?

The characters and scenes become part of your memory. There is a non-cliche understanding of the South that can only come from a person that is truly in touch with that place and history. Watson taps into all the dimensions of the human condition, with a comic edge like a razor blade. It is quite rare that I read a book that literally leaves me breathless.

It is one of those books that tries so hard to be special that you can see through the attempt, and the effort ends up looking sad ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed \\"writer's workshop\\" prose","review":"I bought this book expecting to like it. I'd read Watson's previous book--the short stories about the dogs--and never really saw what others saw in it, despite its fair to middling notices, and frankly I found Watson a bit of a bigot. This new novel was heralded so I picked it up, and found it--to my continuing surprise at the pre-reviewer's praise-- a hackneyed collection of over-cute colloquialisms, sentimental trash, and a plot-line that lacks drive and is instead anecdotal and spotty. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and even if I did I'd recommend that you wait a few weeks to avoid paying full price, as the book will surely be remaindered soon and available on Ebay for a couple bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great prose, but where's the story?","review":"This guy can write -- if only he could learn the rules of novel writing: conflict, climax, resolution. There's none of that here. What we get instead is a sequence of gorgeously written character studies, with no real story tying them together. Finus, the main character, is an utterly dull and plodding creature, in love with a woman Birdie Wells, who herself isn't very strongly developed. What's so great about her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell on earth is trying to get through this book.","review":"I can not remember being MORE disappointed with a novel. Mr. Watson's run-on approach to describing events did not pull me in but bored me. The main character, Finus, spends his whole life desiring from afar a woman (Birdie) for no other given reason than he saw her naked in the woods when he was 13 years old. There is only a passing reference to her being pretty- and none to her being particularly kind or fun.Mr. Watson's interpretation of a relationship between a black domestic and her white employer was embarrassingly lacking. No nuisances, no subtleties.My last example of the degree to which this novel is pathetic is that the undertaker in this novel has a thing for having sex with dead people, or people who act dead.

This is the first book he actually refers to by name. Each little poem on each page is beautiful in its own way. The mushy (cuddle, hug) is balanced by the practical (make me clean). I disagree with the reviewer who thought the Papa Papa side was not as good.What I especially love is the image and words that refer to breastfeeding. The lovely words (Give me warmth and give me milk) are accompanied by a beautiful illustration of a cheetah nursing. Most baby books refer to bottles, as in Katz' \\"What Does Baby Say?\\" (What does the hungry baby say? Ba-Ba.)

Tower of Power without a doubt is the hardest working group or musicians that you will find today. This latest CD is a prime example of their work and talent.A blend of songs from recent years and vintage years are represented here. They are have that classic tower groove to it.

This CD doesn't dissapoint as Tower was always much better live than on records although they have made some fine recordings.

Words really do not describe the feelings I had hearing this CD for the first time. I was crying and laughing at the same time. This is a true gift from a group that has gotten better and better throughout the years. The quality of recording is unparalleled; the musicianship is first rate - I could go on and on. Its the best TOP CD of its kind. One of the other reviewers mentioned playing this CD on a good system. I found that to be true. The bass runs alone will shake the foundation of your house down.

Tower of Power is a band meant to be heard live. This CD has practically eliminated that gap.

The book, \\"Daivd Harum,\\"introduces a very interesting country banker with crackerbarrel philosophy which became a wonderful character for Will Rogers in the movie of the same name. There are some terrific vignettes in this book, the Christmas one alone would make a wonderful annual TV special. Conversations between the principals sparkle with good humor and much heart. The only problem I had with the book is the two unlikely coincidences at the end of the tale. It's like the author didn't know how to resolve the issue, so he created impossible chance meetings. Not one, but two of them. However, up until this point, the book is as good as any I have read.

I was left with the feeling that I too could be a player wherever I hung my hat.

The vast majority of Bird fans out there seem to really like this album. But there are a few that look at this album as a cop-out on Bird's part because it is not in the fast-paced bebop style for which he is most well-known. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though Bird is playing with a string section, everything he plays on here is in his own style. He plays a large selection of all standard tunes and plays every one of them with great feeling. I highly recommend this album to all fans of Bird's music. I also recomend this to fans of classical music as well. Everytime I meet a person who tells me they are into classical music I tell them to get this album and 80% of the time they tell me they already have it and how much they love it.

Finally, I said to heck with it and went to IMDB which directed me to Amazon.com and I ordered it. I am a fan of Lou Diamond Phillips and I enjoy watching this movie often. It's a worthwhile addition to any movie collection, especially if you're a Lou Diamond Phillips fan.I'm not much of a movie reviewer, I see a movie, I like the movie, and I buy it-plain and simple. Also, as an after-thought, the price on this movie was very reasonable; in fact, I was shocked at how low the price was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good but lost it fast","review":"Yikes... what can I say.I am a fan for any thing resembling Zombies.That is why the premise of this movie sounded good... But YIKES... after a good beginning this thing went downhill fast !!Choppy film work really detracted from the film.Perhaps it was intended to add some sort of tension or uneasiness, but instead it was simply annoying.Editing !!!!Where was the editing for this movie.Even though they are supposedly stranded far from any help or civilazation, there are two scenes where you can see cars passing by in the nearby background.For you bloopers seekers, the worst example of this is when the mystery phone booth rings. Watch the scene where they are all standing together staring at the phonebooth; you will see a white car in the very near distance drive by the screen behind them from left to right. A good hand tossed rock would hit the car!Not something that will be added to the collection, that is for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection","review":"I had never purchased a book of poetry before but this was recommended to me and I am very glad I bought it. The collection is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard plastic with bad adhesive","review":"I used these feet on the bottom of a PC to raise it off the floor a bit. I was expecting soft rubber but the plastic that these feet are made of is really hard. As a result the vibration from the computer was transferred to the floor and would occasionally cause an audible vibration against the floor. The adhesive on the feet was horrible. I cleaned the area on the case before I attached the feet but within 3 weeks the feet had become detached and the adhesive was completely dry. Be careful what you use these feet for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Feet Do The Job","review":"There's not a lot to get excited about to describe Little Rubber Feet. In my case, I was in need of something relatively small & firm to raise the front legs of a bedroom dresser that had sunken into the carpet.These little guys were a perfect fit & raised the dresser just enough to prevent the drawers from sliding out on their own. They even have adhesive, if needed for slick surfaces. Since only two were required, I'm already prepared for the next feat of engineering that needs their help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little feet, they work, what else do you need?","review":"I used these rubber feet to put on the bottom of my E3000 router so it would have a bit better cooling.

They stuck to the bottom well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated with this book","review":"I am teaching myself to play guitar and thought this book looked like a good one to use, along with others.My problems with this book (and some other books in the Progressive series) are:- Emphasis on techniques isolated from their use in specific songs. At the end of the day, we practice in order to learn to play songs, and that's the context in which techniques should be presented.- Many of the exercises are harder than they have to be in order to develop the technique. The songs at the end of the book require fingerings that are just beyong what a beginner is going to be able to do. Not that the fingerings are the point of the exercise---they are not. They just get in the way. Guitar students need to crawl before they walk, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"haven't read it, but it was refered to me by my guitar teach","review":"I haven't read this book, but it was refered to me by a good guitar teacher who has played with Joan Biaz.

I reccomend a rental only."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING GAME!!","review":"I was reading these bad reviews for this game yesterday and knew I had to take action. This is one of the best games for Playstation I've ever played! Some people might not like GEX's commentary, but, you can turn off the commentary. Unlike the original GEX where each world has a different theme, each individual level in this game has a different theme - from a demented cartoon land to inside a TV! My dad and I were laughing our heads off at GEX's hysterical comments. I highly recommend this game for people of all ages!Yours truly, CT900"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Gex Enter the Gecko","review":"It's a very long and hard game.

It finally quit working and I searched high and low for the same one. Found it and was quite excited to finally get it. After only about 3-4 months the screen got real light and the script was not solid but missed a lot of the pixels and was unable to be read. Unless I got a bad one, these Seiko spell checkers have really become a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good artwork...","review":"but that's all. The stories are not even close to realistic. In fact, some are not even stories, just short scenes. Some humor, group sex, a couple of cases of rape and a few people even seem to die. Oh, bananas, cheerleaders and panties. Think porn in manga form, with little or no plot. If you like that kind of thing, good for you, but I was looking for something more. Kind of costed a lot for something so thin. I would suggest Yuuki Ryoh's mangas.But, still, good artwork. Maybe even GREAT artwork. And funny bonus comments at the end of the book. For adults ONLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...","review":"I'd heard this was terrific, but it's so much more than that. My husband, son and I were mesmerized watching it, it was just so good. To see these three great, music-defining guitarists together, to see them riff together and enjoy each OTHER's contributions to music, to hear their own philosophy on music and where the music comes from for them (and it's totally different for each of them!) was an incredibly pleasurable experience. I loved watching one of them take off on a piece of music, and you could see the other two intently watching what he was doing, copying it and then twisting it in their own style, and yet - they harmonized so beautifully together! We loved it, absolutely loved it. I'm glad we own it, we will be watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about the Passion","review":"It's not about the drugs, the bands, the gossip or the groupies. It's about the music. Or, rather, the passion for the creation of the sound. The filmmakers have taken us on magical tour of three guys who show us if you love what you do chances are you will succeed. Like other viewers have mentioned, we didn't want it to end. Bravo, Davis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoping for a sequel with other great guitarist!","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Edge, I was really mostly interested in only his part of the film. But I have to say, I never really got into much of Jack White's music. But after watching this, I truly appreciate his musical talent and his raw ingenuity. I also now have a whole new appreciation for Led Zeppelin. I mean, Jimmy Page blew my mind! I have Led Zeppelin's box set, but now knowing how Jimmy and the rest of the band created their music was really inspiring.The film is pretty fitting considering the 3 differences in generation gap between the guitarists and history. It's like the film has something for anyone who's into rock and roll.I would like to see a sequel with some other guitarist like, BB King, Clapton, and Slash. (There are some many greats!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"guitar greats","review":"Gives you the background of three different generations of guitar heroes. Would have liked a little more of all three jamming together. But still worth the cost if you are a rock music person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great rock and roll film!","review":"I love this film!After watching it I wish I had learned how to play guitar!As a huge u2 fan I enjoyed the insight into thier music that this film provided.The only negative is that the film is too short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh....","review":"First off, Jack White doesn't deserve a place in this film. Everything about his \\"persona\\" is irritating to me.I like a few White Stripes and Ranconteurs songs... but overall, he's too over-rated for my tastes.The whole child version of himself watching him play, dressed in similar clothes.... meh... Seems way too contrived.When they finally get to meeting each other, it is cool to see them play their riffs in a group setting. Page playing Ramble On solo is a highlight for sure.Edge is cool... he goes back through his demo tapes of riffs from Joshua Tree, but really nothing new if you have seen the Classic Albums JT dvd.Overall a good rental I guess, but I wouldn't buy this for $20. Rent it first and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY is Jack White in this...?","review":"Presenting fantastic interviews with guitar god Jimmy Page, sound pioneer The Edge, and.... some guy who plays derivative blues-rock of about the caliber you could find by waltzing into any guitar store in the Western World.Never having heard of Jack White, I watched some videos of his bands on YouTube. Okay, standard mediocre white kid doing electric blues... WHY is he in this...? White's presence was not made more tolerable by his unbroken posture of condescension.P.s. - Yes, I'm a self-identified old fuddy-duddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites to date","review":"This is a gem of a film. To see the creative process of these men was remarkable! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ode to creativity","review":"I have watched this movie several times, and still look forward to seeing it again. While it is of course about guitarists, there is a very strong, positive message (not even concealed) behind the story, which is very much about creativity, passion and professionalism. I recommend this to anyone working in a creative field who is sometimes in need of an energy boost. Even those who definitely do not like rock music should at least consider this, since it is not just about the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooooo Great","review":"Anyone who loves music should see this. From the opening scene where Jack builds a guitar to Jimmy Page (the best!) and his smooth as silk movements to The Edge and his passion for a better world. See it. Buy it. Pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative insight","review":"I enjoyed this, mainly for the insight into the musical creative process and the different approaches taken by each of these musicians. Watching and listening to them discuss this process was fascinating, and really opens up their music a bit. I wish there was more footage of the three of them together, as that interaction was the highlight of the film for me, though watching Jimmy Page air jam to Link Wray's Rumble was certainly a magic moment. This film makes for some nice entertainment for fans of these musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditation on the creative process x 3","review":"Always fascinating to eavesdrop on artists' creative influences and process. The movie could have been longer and I wouldn't have minded a bit. I guess Davis Guggenheim took a page from the guitarists' book---always leave 'em wanting more. A must see for those who love music and / or these guitarists."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"U2 is my favorite band, and The Edge is one of the reasons. I saw a brief clip of this movie on Utube, profiling him..I thought, boy, a whole DVD profiling him and the other two musicians should really be awesome. Watched it, and wished I could have got my $ back"},{"rating":"2","title":"That one scene says it all...","review":"You know the one I mean. Edge and White are sitting there -- one a bonafide superstar guitar hero in his own right, and the other a new kid on the rise, representing the newest wave. But both, regardless of their obvious age differences, are once again 15-year-old kids, listening to music way past their bedtime, sitting in mesmerized awe, thinking \\"I never thought I'd ever get to see THIS, 2 feet in front of my face\\" -- as Mr. James Page, in whose presence they both suddenly, terrifyingly realize they are MOST unworthy, lets loose with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". At that moment, Edge, White, you, and I are equals -- mere mortals in the presence of a god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-The Edge was the only interesting part","review":"A bit disappointed in this documentary-Got bored and shut it off after an hour. Jack White was boring and wierd, but Jimmy Page and The Edge from U2 were OK. It was worth a try:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed. Should have been called \\"It Might get Boring\\". If you like Jack White then by all means buy it but if you are a life long Jimmy Page fan you are better off with The Song Remains the Same. Would have rather just seen Jimmy playing in his living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was promised","review":"Three amazing musicians of different backgrounds get together to share ideas and approaches. Great concept! This is how this movie was marketed.Unfortunately it is not what is delivered. 90% of it is looking back with voice overs of the individuals talking about their history and only 10% of it they are actuallytogether playing and interacting. It's okay but not what was promised in the trailers. Many of the things they express I've seen on youtube and magazinesover the years. Nothing new. I was excited to see the dynamic of them together and was disappointed in how little there was of it. Sony Pictures should beashamed of marketing this the way they have. A great idea unrealized and then deceptively presented to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great disappointment","review":"I'll make this short and sweet.I followed the hype on-line for a year until the film was finally release and made its way to a theater 60 miles away. I made the drive and was incredibly underwhelmed by what I saw and heard.I didn't care for the pacing or organization of the film... slow and disjointed. The selection of The Edge and Jack White must have been purely convenience motivated as there is a long list of more interesting electric guitarists whose inclusion would have made much more sense. The only shared performance was \\"The Weight\\" and I might add, they couldn't even get the chords right. Utterly embarrassing.I've seen the process of how a bad film gets made in spite of the best intentions of those involved. My only guess is that this film went down that same road.If it weren't for the scene of Jimmy Page in his music room listening to Link Wray's 1958 innovative bombshell \\"The Rumble\\", I couldn't even give this film 1 star.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring as hell","review":"I honestly don't know how a film maker could make such a boring piece of dribble with a) the budget, b) the time spent on the film c) three guitarists of this caliber.Anyone hoping for insights on the craft, technique, gear, or anything of depth for that matter might be disappointed. So much of this film was staged or scripted, it barely feels like a documentary.On the other hand if you're the type that can listen to droll guitar playing for an hour and a half, and gets excited seeing stock footage of U2 and Led Zepplin, then this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgotten but not gone","review":"If Jimmy Page, the \\"Edge,\\" and Jack White all linked arms and jumped off the Empire State Bldg, which one would hit the ground first?

I watched it with my husband and daughter and we were mesmerized, could easily have set through a couple more hours of hearing them talk about their roots and their music. My daughter is a huge Zep fan so she loved the parts with Jimmy Page, but what surprised us was how much all of us enjoyed the Edge's part. None of us were very familiar with Jack White, and except for the fact he was definitely channeling Johhny Depp, found him interesting too. Have ordered the dvd from Amazon because I know this is one we'll want to watch more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seller, good movie","review":"Unless you happen to be a super fan of The Edge, Jack White, or Jimmy Page, I do not recommend getting this. If you are, like me, a super fan, then I strongly suggest watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"More a documentary than a music show","review":"I bought It Might Get Loud expecting to watch a jam session of great guitar players.It Mightg Get Loud fulfills this partly, but it has a lot of interviews in a documentary style.So that's why I gave ot 4 stars.Good enough but not spetacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack White might love himself","review":"I think this was all about Jack White and how great he thinks he is. There was about 10 seconds spent on The Edge's sound, and Jimmy Page wondering around some old castle. Way too much time spent on silly Jack White montages. If you were hoping for some good jams, you will be severely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The extras on this DVD are worthwhile","review":"Some of my initial reactions to the movie are similar to what others have noted (unusual pacing, unusual selection of guitarists, unusual presentation of the \\"summit\\", etc.), but after listening to the commentary track and looking at the extras, my appreciation of the movie increased.Yes, the structure and pacing was a deliberate choice (remarkable how much \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" has influenced both rock musicians, and rock documentary makers). Yes there was a bigger list of guitarists that the movie producers had considered. And Yes, there was a lot of music at the summit that never made it to theatrical release.It might get Loud may not be the definitive rock documentary, but it is a good film about the relationship between the electric guitar and the artists who play it. A film that deliberately stays away from the \\"rock critic\\" and \\"rock historian\\" view of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Video","review":"I have watched this a couple times and will watch it again.

What a great idea to have three great guitarists share their insights with us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So far so good...whoops i spoke too soon.","review":"I bought this memory card recently, and it worked great for a while. I rented Pikmin and saved it with this card, which worked fine for the whole game (which is why i give this memory card 2 stars instead of 1). But then i tried to save 007: Agent Under Fire and i got some message about corrupt data and had to format the memory card (erase everything on it) in order to get it to work again. I suppose the card glitches out and loses data every now and then, which is completely unacceptable in my book. I guess i should have figured this 3rd party card wouldn't be all that reliable, but it was the only GameCube memory card the store had at the time so i bought it.

Now that I've reviewed it, it's not that good; meaning... It doesn't benefit from additional viewings. Perhaps if you're new to it, you'll like it.At no point in the movie does Lena Stolze look anything like the cover art. So when your DVD arrives, it's shouldn't be too disappointing that it has a different cover; the main element being a large red dot, and the young pig-tailed Lena in the lower right corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy and hard to follow","review":"The best aspect of this movie was that it is ill titled; the result of an unfortunate misstranslation. The themes and ideas presented in the movie are thought provoking, however the cinimatography was difficult to watch, and harder to follow.The PG13 rating stems from a couple of crude jokes, and one totally unneeded and unexpected nude scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was trash.

It is pitched at a high-school comprehension level, but the ending is both philosophically and practically tidy - a way forward even for we who never suffered through the horrors of a nuclear war. But maybe we will have to rediscover an Edwardian political simplicity to find that path, as Arakal and his cabinet do in this book. Certainly the justification for the enforced stasis of the Soviets in this book is sound if only on an Earthly level.By the way, I never buy into those books that project so complete a breakdown after a nuclear war that books and libraries don't survive. I read the studies - while a complete war would kill billions, most of the deaths would be due to systems breakdowns and not fallout or nuclear winter. People might fall ill and starve, but things would survive better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos make book worthless","review":"Even though this is cheap, it is worthless. Many equations are missing and other characters are mistranslated (e.g., 2 times pi is translated as \\"2ir\\"; lower-case delta, I guess, is an italic \\"6\\"). I found perhaps 10 typos in the first couple of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equations were not printed correctly","review":"The book itself is very good. However, the printed version was made using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which did not translate the equations correctly. In fact, most of the math is completely unreadable which significantly reduces the value of a mathematical book! You can also find this version of the book on the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"Sadly, not useful. No formulas, but trivial ones, can be read. The preview is of a different (useful) version, though there isn't a proper warning; it does mention that it is a different book you view, but for a math/physics book it would only be fair to inform that formulas were demolished by the OCR handling. The claim in the book that most of their books are freely available as digital copies does not fare much better. You have to pay $9.99 for the \\"free digital copy\\".

One thing that is particularly nice about this 2006 MLB video game is that it's the only game I have played that NEVER locks up. Most other games will lock up if you press buttons at the wrong times, often during loading.

They have created a near-perfect sound with their use of ultra-heavy, but not overly complex guitars, haunting keyboards, and searing vocals. This is one of those bands that seems to get better and more refined with every release. I own their previous two releases: \\"Gone\\" and \\"Time of Despair\\". I thought Gone was good, and T.O.D. was twice as good, and i was wondering if they could ever top that album. my doubts were quickly silenced with one listen of Dieversity. it is a great travesty that they are not headlining US tours right now.

They are in the vain of Paradise Lost or Flowing Tears. Their lead singer, Mika Tauriainan, sounds a lot like Ville Vallo of the popular band H.I.M. The difference is, that H.I.M.'s material is predominately Hard Rock, and Entwine's music is crunchier and heavier. It sounds like a combination between other Gothic Metal acts and a band like H.I.M. The lyrics may be a bit sappy, but this band is moving and fun to listen to. If you like Heavy Metal with clean vocals, or if you are a fan of Goth Metal, check this band out. All of their albums are different. None of them sound alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entwine, just part of the bandwagon...","review":"Entwine-diEversity1By: Clifford NewstedSeems like since Century Media began to sell a few records with Lacuna Coil all sorts of bands that mesh their goth and metal influences have been popping up in record bins in North America. You've seen this happen in all the genres in the last 20 years, most of the better or higher quality bands have surfaced and are the blue print for the c company versions.Entwine is just such a band, they are recycling all that has come before them. They should have listed in the liners the band that they haven't ripped off from the last 4-5 years. It's amazing, I hear stuff on diEversity that I have heard on HIM, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Therion records! And what's up with the title of the record? Looks like something Prince would have come up with?! 1988 called and it wants that title back!!! Whether or not Prince had a hand in helping with the title, his career is done just like Entiwne's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Memphis band.","review":"First of all, this album should not be listed in the Country section. Secondly, this album should be listed when speaking of the best roots rock albums released in the last few years. Since there are no songs to listen to yet, my best discription of this band is a mix of Blue Mountain, Anodyne era Uncle Tupelo, and a touch of Allman Brothers (with Warren Haynes). The songwriting is very strong, unlike many of the new \\"americana\\" bands coming out these days. I can not urge you strongly enough to give this album a listen- you will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"often imitated, but never duplicated--no1 can phase nkotb!","review":"This video takes ya back to where it ALL started... a time when we wore the tour jackets, big ol' buttons, t-shirts n hats; when we'd camp out at the ticket booths, tv stations and hotels; when we'd learn all their dance routines and songs--and perform them shamelessly in front of anyone who'd look; when we'd say stuff like, \\"word,\\" or \\"that's dope;\\" when we'd rage against the non-believers; and when we didn't know the pain of a broken heart--til we found out that our fave nk was dating someone...

The rich characters, complex plot, and imaginative creatures are starting to annoy my sense of adventure. Characters learn nothing from their experiences and keep making the same stereotypical mistakes they have made in the past six books. They also must be somewhat dull to miss the obvious connections and clues planted by the author.I was RJ's biggest fan for this series. Unfortunately, it has turned into a dull and predictible plot. My only hope is that as he begins to wrap this series up, it will regain its former luster.My personal plea Mr. Jordan: You have proven you can build a new imaganitive series from your success with the Wheel of Time. Isn't it time to move on and create a new plot and set of characters?I'm begining to doubt my ability to continue reading the next book in this series, but I'll probably give you one more chance (but this time in paperback!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Robert Jordan is the best! I never thought that I could read fantacy books, but my friend forced me. Now I am hooked. I love the way A Crown of Swords only covered about a weeks time. It gave me a chance to watch the characters a little closer. They are wonderful. It seems like I know them. I really like the way girls play a big part of the series, and even though my friends all think I'm crazy Nynaeve is the best. I didn't think that this book was a dissapointment at all.

There were times when the hair on my neck stood up with excitement. I have read this series 6 times. I remember everything that has happened and recommend the series to every I speak to about these types of books. I read it so often because I love to be submerged into that world.

Each book of the series I have read in a day, and re-read after that, such is the talent of the author for writing compelling reading. But, the wait is a killer, and each new book is regarded with much less enthusiasm by myself, and my friends who read them. I STRONGLY suggest, if you are thinking of reading these books, that you wait until the series is complete, as it is REALLY depressing wondering for YEARS between books whether or not someone is going to live or die. The wait is a really good way for an author to lose a faithful audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"OK, it all started out fine.

I just skip ahead until I find something to hold my interest. I mostly read/skim each of these books just looking for whole paragraphs, and sometimes even chapters, that could have been edited out to make the story move along. I used to recommend this series to everyone, but no longer. I can't bring myself to get someone else sucked into this 10 (15?) (20?) book series. I'll keep reading though, with the hope that the next book moves along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treading Water","review":"This series has steadily declined since Book 3 (by far the best in the series). Sometimes I think RJ is treading water, and adds needless subplots just to occupy some characters while something else is happening. I think he's found that he's killing off too many of the forsaken, and has been replacing them with new bad guys who, unfortunately, have no personality. This book didn't end as climactically as the rest. This may be the weakest book of the series, except for perhaps the one where some characters joined the circus (and we spent 300 pages hearing about it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly going...

I'm so tired of the bad guys slipping out the back door, or \\"maybe\\" being killed... just kill one, so we can feel that the 900 page lead in was worth it.Give up on all the Jr. High behavior between the Aes Sedai and Mattrim... tired...Liven up the action, strengthen the cause and DO SOMETHING!Okay, I'm off to read the next version of Jordan's Dictionary (words in random order, simulating sentences)...

But recently I heard that another fantasy writer had finished the series. So I decided to pick back up, but only on a book whose synopsis I remembered a little. I decided to start back at this book because I had read it before, & remembered a great deal of it, but not all of it. It was a great read. The Game of Thrones series reminds me of this series, in that there are a multitude of characters & subplots, & it is extremely difficult to keep track of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once more, the same review because words are not enough to tell how much I adore this series.","review":"I have bought most of this series on Amazon because of how please I have been with price, availability, perfect product description, and fast delivery.If you want to start a series that will take a year to read since every book is over 2\\" thick, this the one. R.J. did a great job until near the end of his life and once he passed those who cared about the series did a good job finishing them for him.

Tolkien was the best - and he actually cut through all of his clutter to get to the point quickly. Can hardly wait for the next book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Jordan is gifted!","review":"Robert Jordan is the most gifted writer I have ever read. I rated this book a 10 because I believe even Robert Jordan at his worst is still the best. Yes, I agree with most of the negative comments about this volume. It is long and not as good as the earlier ones, but in a way that is good because although I want to know how it will all work itself out, I am reluctant to end the best series ever produced. It is so rich and teeming with life. How could you not have anybody to root for. Even a character who shows up to open the door for the major characters is a real person with a life and background. I say so what if it takes Jordan 13 volumes to wrap up his story. I'll stick with it to the end and enjoy it every step of the way, and when I finish the last volume, I'll say to myself how unfortunate it is that he finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is The Writing On the Wall, will he give up?","review":"The first four books were excelent, even better than Tolkein. In the 'Wheel Of Time' series Jordan shows that he is the master of creating a fantasy 'universe'. Unfortunately the weath of absorbing detail means that the plot starts to grind to a halt, especially so in 'aCoS' (the timespan of the book is only two weeks). If he continues his trend it seems that it will be another 3-4 books before he can even contemplate finishing. The crunch point is that the story showed that Jordan has no idea how to end his epic series and even more important is the fact that aCoS was published in 1996 and the release date for the 8th book is pencilled in at 3rd Q. 1998. Does this mean that Jordan will give up the series as a project to difficult to bother to complete?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot? We don't need no stinkin' plot!","review":"Reading \\"A Crown of Swords\\" has convinced me to give up on \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series. Indeed, I feel like a fool for sticking with it this long. I had hoped that Jordan would finally start moving on the underlying story line of this series -- namely, the final confrontation between Rand and the forces of darkness. However, it looks like this isn't going to happen any time soon. Character and plot development (or even subplot development!) are negligible. Instead, \\"ACOS\\" contains a great deal of irrelevant description that does not advance the story. By the time the final climactic battle occurs (in book 35 at the current pace), who will care? More to the point, how could it possibly live up to this kind of buildup?Maybe I should stick to short novels like \\"War and Peace\\" from now on"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interseting and intreaging tale","review":"As a reader of this series I have to say that I for one loved this book.ACOS has been a long time in coming and I am glad that I had the opertunity to read it.The return of my favorite character (Lan Mandragoran) was a definate surprise since his name was not among those listed in the glossery. I was jumping off the walls when he showed up out of the blue. Maybe that is why his name wasn't mentioned and I thank Jorden for making it so.I have to agree however with some of the numerous people saying that the series has been going on a little long. A few major things happened in this book but over all the battle is still hanging out there somewhere.After hooking two of my friends on the series after I myself picked up the first at a second hand book store about three years ago I have to admit that I can't put them down.Were all waiting Jorden, make the last book something to talk about for decades to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"Con Job","review":"Jordan is progressively getting worse. The first 3 books of the series started very well-tightly written, well-paced with page-ripping suspense. Since then, the story just deteriorated, culminating with this bomb of a book. Jordan is ripping the readers off. His 640-page book could have been at least halved. Book 7 has made no significant progress in the storyline. At the rate he's going, Jordan will need Book 20 to finish if off. What is he doing? Filling in the blanks? I'm beginning to suspect he's trying to get bigger bang for his bucks.It's a shame. He really has many original ideas. I felt cheated"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, was enriching but not as much detail.","review":"Personally I liked it, but Jordan could have added more detail to this volume.

Action is slowing down, there are barely any powerful, or interesting scenes, and there is little to no progress except in the last chapter.Most of the people who read this novel, read it because of the previous six books and not because of the novel by itself. Jordan should get back on track in the 8th book though, with the Seanchan coming, and Mat having to fufill the prophecy of marring the Daughter of Nine Moons and all.I'm still looking forward to the next book though, but I hope that Jordan cranks up the action and suspense, and kills off a few more Forsaken"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh.","review":"All of the Wheel of Time books (in paperback; I'm poor) are sitting on my shelf in a tidy row. So why, when I'm looking for something familiar to read in bed or in the tub, do I reach instead for Tepper, Cherryh, Le Guin, Zelazny, Moorcock?The answer is that this series is getting tired. Jordan has severely lost the focus that made the first three books so good, and I wonder how he's ever going to tie up all these loose ends. Or will he take the sloppy way out and leave them hanging? Certainly that happens in real life, but it makes for sloppy fiction.This book has some funny moments and interesting plot twists, but that's about it. Jordan has also lost his grasp of his female characters, who are in severe danger of being reduced to one-dimensional bitches. Although I did rather enjoy Elayne's triumph in, what was it, chapter 30? These books need more moments like that, and fewer throwaway characters, mysterious plots and petty squabbling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan milks \\"Wheel of Time\\"","review":"What began as one of the best series i've readhas turned in to a long, drawn out affair. \\"Crown of Swords\\" could be left out of the series and nobody would notice.Mat,Perrin,andRand are all very interesting characters as wellas Elaine and the others.

Plods along, though, denotes movement forward, and like a sinking ship in calm water, this storyline really hasn't progressed as much as begun to sink. Jordan has way too much time on his hands if he can't condense his 700 pages into a more meaningful, active and concise storyline. I have a feeling he gets paid by the word from his publishers.

In the beginning I was interested and couldn't wait to get to the next book in the series. However, I was unable to finish Path of Daggers...since as the series developed, the author seemed to be dragging out every event so that the series has now become boring and repetitive. He doesn't mention some of the older characters while intoducing newer ones.

Instead of the \\"The Wheel of Time\\", I think it should be called \\"The Never Ending Story\\". The first 4 books were truly outstanding. Robert Jordan was one of the few authors I could justify buying in hardback edition. Books 5 and 6 were still fairly good, but the story was beginning to get bogged down. This book is the first in the series I didn't like at all. Out of habit, I bought book 8 but the idea of reading another of those 40+ page, boring, and in most cases irrelevant prologues was enough to give me a headache. I'm not reading any more of this series. Sometime in the distant future, if I live so long, this series may come to an end. I'll read the last book just to se how things end up.

When reading his books one gets the opinion that he sits at his computer for a year and prints everything that he types in during that time. One of the other reviews of this book suggests that Jordans character development is superior to Tolkein, Tolkein had a thing called subtlty, by the end of the Lord of the Rings one had an intimate knowledge of the characters, Robert Jordan has spent Buddha knows how many pages shoving so much information down our throats that if you didn't know what sort of characteristics the characters had you would have to be a blind monk living in some outer province of Mongolia.

It seems more and more as if he intends to follow his circular mode(Wheel of Time.)

The action is constant, and characters that one thoughtlong gone, return with determination in a theatric fashion.He is one of the few male fanatsy writers that put power andimportance behind female characters.

I gave it more stars than it perhaps deserves, if only because book 6 was so terrible.Things actually kind of happen in this book. Kinda. I'm now going to try to get through book 8, and hope that Jordan keeps the \\"Mat knows women, Perrin knows women, but I'm a clueless Messiah foretold in the Age of Legends as the defeater of the Dark One. . .but even I am powerless against feminine wiles of my strong-willed co-protagonists!\\" to a minimum.(PS. Lan is too cool for that annoying, stubborn to the point of being mentally retarded pony-tailed woman. Seriously, their relationship makes no sense. Grin and bear it, I guess.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth your time","review":"I thought this book was wonderful, and although it's not quite as good as the earlier installments, (books 1 and 2 were my favorite)it is a lot better than books 4 and 5, which were kind of slow. I'll have to admit that Rand is getting too arrogant to be likable, which is a shame since he seemed to be a nice guy in the beginning. The thing that bothers me most is that the women characters seem so shallow. I mean, they are always bickering and worrying about their clothes and the like. It gets tiresome after a while. Although it has its flaws, this book is still as good as its predesessors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Great Series","review":"Jordon seems to be wandering through much of this book. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists are further developed. As slow as the build up is, the end comes abruptly just when you thought it should climax, leaving the reader hanging. I imagine Jordon's original draft was too long and the book publisher said cut it in two and sell two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also Very Good","review":"Robert Jordan's series carries on nicely through the seven books. You need a lot of spare time in order to read the series but it is very very good. It does get a little wordy through the books but they tend to keep my intrest. I don't really know how to explains these but they're a must read for fantasy readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crown of Swords won't Dissapoint...","review":"This book is a very refreshing addition to the series. Book 5 was good, book six could have been better, but this one definitly delivers. It's up there with the first 3. I've read over half in under 3 weeks, and I hope to finish in another 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many loose ends, vague references and missing characters","review":"Just when things were starting to get really good Jordan writes a mediocre book (Crown of Swords). It almost seems as if he's gotten bored with the series, and such a great series deserves more attention, and respect to its readers. I am definitely interested in the coming book but will not run out to buy the hard cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I can't wait for the next book to come out. I wish this series would move faster though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series with a sad end...","review":"What made the experience of listening to A Crown of Swords the most enjoyable?Very good story with a good narrator.What did you like best about this story?The story it self.Any additional comments?Very sad the series was unfinished by the Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"A must have book for the Robert Jordan fan!

No complaints here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the wheel of time drags on","review":"Once again robert jordan shows us that you can write volumesand not say anything at all. Little progress is made again inRand's quest to beat the dark one. Also more charactersare introduced! I would think rj would try to resolve issues withthe ones we know about first. Oh yea, Egwene's little band travels a total 10 milesduring the whole of book 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fall of a great series","review":"This has to be the most disappointing book that I have ever read. Why? Because after waiting so long for this book to be published it was so badly written that I found myself actually angry at the author. He ignores his own rules, eliminates major characters with barely a sentence worth of explanation, and spends much of the book simply covering ground we've already covered in the previous book. Before this book I would have said Jordan was one of the greats in fantasy but now I am convinced that he simply doesn't know where he is going with his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridgment is hard to follow","review":"If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped in the tower...","review":"...of about 6,000 pages that never ends. My suggestion is that if you must read this series you check it out from the library. Sure you'll have to wait longer, but you'll be relieved when you're done that you didn't shell out your hard earned cash for a wheel that seems as if it will never stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's It - I (Finally) Gave Up","review":"The series seems to have been slowing down since about book # 3 - but I have kept it up just because I really wanted to know what happened to all of the characters (especially Perrin, who has been neglected). After struggling through this book, I swore not to read any more, to stop wasting my time and to read something with a moving story. A friend of mine bought \\"Path of Daggers\\", I looked at it and thought \\"Why not?\\", then decided I just couldn't waste another 3 or 4 or 5 months reading a book I just didn't care about any more. I am one fan he has lost. People like me and other fans got him to where he is. How can he do this to us? But that's ok, I don't even care any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series but is the author losing touch?","review":"I love this series. The possibilities of the plot is endless and it does keep the reader guessing about how its going to end. Also there are too many sub-plots in the book that often leave the reader haning and wondering when will this all work out. I believe that this is a great series and I'm looking and looking and looking forward to book 8. Whenever the time will be I do not know........"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT (Weighty or Tedious) or (Way off Target)","review":"This started out as a great series. Good plot, great characters etc.. Somewhere along the way (to the bank) Robert Jordan lost the way. The series plods along and no progress is made. The characters become more annoying (why is it that all female characters are spoiled, petulant and annoying)? In Crown of Swords Robert Jordan bores us to tears with over 700 pages of drivel to what end. All this will continue while they nail Jordans coffin shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you spell SLOW","review":"I'm sorry but even though I love this series TOLKIEN does better than the book that is advertised above.

Pick up the Pace!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if books were pizzas this would be a mushroom and olive","review":"I must say that I was dissapointed at the dull storyline of this book. I have read the other books in the series 3 time each, but the path of daggers I couldn't even get to the second to last chapter. I just hope for the sake of Robert Jordan's readers that the next one can pick up where Crown of Swords left off. It focused too much on Rand, and the 3 Aes Sadai wannabes. The only reason this book was interesting was because of the mentions of the forsaken, and the brief references to Perrin, Mat, and of course, The Aiel. Sorry Mr. Jordan, better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the other ones of the series.","review":"my opinion of this book was that it lacked the detail and spirit that could be found in other Wheel Of Time books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extrordianary journey that captivates the imagination","review":"This book is classic Jordan. It keeps the reader clinging to the book until the very last sentence. He is in my oppinion as good and thorough as Tolkien was. The only problem is that he cannnot write the books as fast as I read them. I highly reccomend the wheel of time series to anyone that is interested in fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"LETS GET ON WITH IT!","review":"I have enjoyed this series and, I still do. The problem is simply the flow of the story. Like most of you, I have been reading this series for years now. EVEN A STORY OF EPIC PROPORTIONS HAS TO END!! I am starting to feel like I'm watching old re-runs of Giligans Island or Lost in Space. Rand just can't seem to make it to the last battle. The sad thing is that I will finish this series because I'm hooked. Do you realize, if you have purchased all of the books so far, your into this over $70!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a new low for the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series","review":"I had a very hard time reading this novel. After the third try I did a quick read.(I skipped paragraphs I thought weren't necessary.) The problem is the three know it all witchs (Aes Sedai). I don't like any of them.When are the characters in this series going to grow-up. The only one I give a hoot about is Perrin, and he is not in the series enough.I'm sorry, but A Crown of Swords was just to slow.I realize it's a tie to the next book in the series,but couldn't it have been a little more interesting.Your starting to lose me Mr. Jordan.......Tom Shalifoe"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incrediable, suspensful and interesting continuation","review":"This book continues Jordan's \\"Wheel of time\\" Series terrificly, while developing the characters further, as well as adding new plot twists to his epic tale of good and evil. I really cared about the characters, was held in suspense, and am totally in awe of Jordans incredible authorship. Jordan's wheel of time series is truly a \\"Must read\\" of epic proportions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the series","review":"I'm sorry, but I could have just as well skipped this edition. It didn't contain anything new or interesting. I was very shocked by the lack of action, having been so taken away by the earlier novels. I will certainly wait and read the reviews of the next novel, before purchasing it. Wish I had checked this page earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was so good that I just could not stop reading.","review":"Some people complains and say that this book is a 'burn out' in the serie of the Wheel of time, but I say that it is not. I think that it's a very good book, at least as good as the other six before it. The magic is still flowing through the series, through this book.In some of the books before the 'a Crown of Swords' a hole lot, to much, of the magic disepared, but now it's coming back again, as strong as ever, if not stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Verbose and Hardly Plotted","review":"Jordan never writes a paragraph when a chapter will do. Although there is enough plot in A Crown of Swords for a novel, there isn't enough for four, although it has enough pages. I've found myself plodding through Jordan's work before, and normally he includes enough of a plot to keep me entertained, but this book can only be seen as adequate in the context of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop criticizing and enjoy the book!","review":"I personally would like to say that I am truly enjoying this series. I think Jordan should take his time in writing his books, and I eagerly wait just like the rest of you. The Wheel of Time series has been one of the best that I have read in a long time. This series was filled of suspense and great detail...despite what some think I hope the series is 20 or so books long....it becomes a temporary part of my day...not something that I read and move on to the next.........your superb jordan! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words to where this series is going > BURN OUT!","review":"Between the constant whining and ramblings of the main characters to the cheap filler in the pages....this book has trully brought what was a great series...to its knees. I hope Mr. Jordan can turn it around and do the last books like the first books....or this series will end with a \\"whimper\\" and not with a \\"Bang\\" as it should. Get the story moving again Robert! And lets get on with the show!!! I only hope great authors like George R. R. Martin and others' works don't begin to take a TOO much of a toll on the fall from grace Jordan is taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"RED ALERT - THIS SERIES IS GOING FOR RECORD....LONGEST!!!!!!","review":"A very good read, but...the author is going for a record. That is the one set by the unmentionable author/ creator of dianutics. I love the series but, \\"Robert, please put the pedal to floor and finish it, before I die of old age\\". REMEMBER, he started this at least 8 years ago!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, need more action","review":"I've read all the WoT books, and I just love this series. Nevertheless, I only gave this book 9 because of the previous ones. Though it has few good developments (such as Lan's return!), it's generally filled with over-streched descriptions. The only reason I can think of is that we're going to have a great surprise in the 8th book. I still think Jordan's the best fantasy writer in the world. I hope he doesn't take too long with the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand Puts On His Pants And Defeats The Bad Guy","review":"... and it took 10 pages for him to get out of bed and put on his pants and 5 pages to kill another woman while (almost) killing the bad guy, thus acquiring more paralyzing angst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparisons","review":"Sufice it to say that I love the book and all the books so far, but I have to say the going has been quite slow. Although you cannot say that it has been boring!I have recently read the second book of the Belegriad by David Eddings and guess what, the characters seem very similar in the two story lines. There is the rescal/thief who loves gambling, a mysterious sorceress with dark hair and regal/queenly bearing, a very big (physically) individual that has an animal aspect to him, a girl or two thrown in who is either a princess or aot so ordinary girl and of course the understated hero. I found the similarities very startaling, and wondered if anyone else had seen the comparison?I still enjoy these books and have bought all of them so far and can't wait to get the 9th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr. Jordan","review":"I figure I'm about 5,600 pages into this series and while I've been entertained, I must agree with the other 553 reviewers who range from \\"I love it but it's a bit wordy\\" to \\"For the Love of God move the story!\\" I'm begining to feel taken advantage of. I've never read a series that has both entertained and annoyed me so much, which is a testament to Mr. Jordan's emotional connection with the reader. But everyone has a breaking point. After this much time and effort with relatively little payoff, I must encourage all new readers who are thinking of getting into this series to avoid it at all costs. And for those of us who are just too hooked to let go. Here's hoping we all get to the promised land some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times can you read the same thing?","review":"Unfortunately, things seem to be going downhill for RJ, after the horrid release of COS. There was so little substance, with events reoccuring to almost every character, and describied in monstrously long detail each and every time. Min all of the sudden wants Rand's \\"warm flesh?\\" When the hell did this appear, and why in Light's name is it RJs style now? Elayne and Nynaeve get a good laugh at Mat being relentlessly raped by Tylin, and I find that disturbing. No doubt I'll read the next one, but there needs to be less pointless rape and more substance. This pattern of 900 pages of describing minor characters and then finishing with 20 pages of quick Chosen killing has to end. I pray to the Creator that it gets better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I apologize","review":"I started this series kind of like wow this must actually tell what happens at the end! I was sooooo wrong. I've always been kind of mad at the end of fatasy books because i want to know what else happens to the characters. Now I know why they don't tell you. I started this series with a shorter story about Lan and Moiraine in a compilation called Legends. So I thought this is absolutely a great series. And i kept up that optimistic attitude for the first 3,000,000 pages but it got old. i realized that I was hanging on for Lan and Moiraine's sake and that this plot really blows! I really don't care about Rand (maybe Mat) And if I wanted a bunch of guy vs girl remarks I'd be happy with the typical life of the American teen.So i apologize to authors(like Tamora Pierce) I got mad at for ending where they did and to them i say thanks you make books worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"still plodding through it all...","review":"Admittedly I have not read the entire book, but it is probably one of the more difficult books I have read in a while. I do not like books that come with their own dictionary of terms, people, places and events. If I read a book, I want to become absorbed in its words and imagery to fully enjoy the story, I do not want to have to flip to the back every other page to learn a new vocabulary word that is part of the fictional culture I'm reading about. I have read some wonderful books that did not require the reader to learn a new culture or language, the authors were able to create an intriguing fantasy world with the language they have at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantastic Journey","review":"Another edition in the Wheel of Time series. Well worth the read. Robert Jordan has picked up where the Lord of the Rings left off. If you like reading a series this one will keep you busy enjoying the creative and fantastic world woven by Robert Jordan for quite some time.

Bye!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"The Wheel of Time series is \\"New Age\\" fantasy. Channeling, a new age technique, is the only form of magic in this series. The series GARBAGE! I've read much better fantasy than Robert Jordan. For example, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is 100 times BETTER than the Wheel of Time!

Not only has he written an epic adventure in the first 6 books of the 'wheel of time series', but he has managed to write rubbish for the seventh book and make a lot more MONEY. That in itself maybe admirable, but what a painful read. The first half of this book recounts the last chapter in book 6. Eight might be my last book if the pace doesnt pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick a fork in it.","review":"With the Crown of Swords, this series has hit rock bottom. It's completely out of steam. Mr. Jordan's prose is repetitive, his women characters are interchangeable and one-dimensional, same as his villains. The sexual timidity/coyness/insecurity of the \\"couples\\" grows tiresome after seven volumes. The plot here is badly constructed, more annoyance than suspense. Too many Deux ex Machinas. The payoff was hardly worth 800+ pages. I am done with this series. And so it seems is Mr. Jordan. He had a good thing going for a while there."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and then there were seven!","review":"Well anyone who has stuck it this far is obviously someone who goes for long plot lines, and the fact that this book covers probably less than a week of time gives us all hope for an infinite extension of the series beyond the expected 10 books (didn't book one cover almost a year?). This is an unbelievably happy book - just about everything goes right for anyone we care about, or sucky for the bad guys. The one omission is the much expected reappearance of Moiraine. A couple of new threads and connections keep the plot developing but generally there seemed to be a completing of tasks allowing for a union of pro-Rand characters. I just hope either Jordan or I don't die before he finally winds up this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wheel of time","review":"Robert Jordon is a excellent writer!

Jordan and his Editor need to go on a long retreat together and get the series back on track.I truly don't mind waiting for a good book. The series can recover from one lousy bookIt can not recover from multiple bad books.Tor has got to be willing to make Jordan rewrite--not just write--his books. And then they have to have an editor who's willing to work to get the series on track, and finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Below average book compared to rest of the series","review":"I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy. I have read the rest of the series, and the books were excellent, especially the first couple of books. However, ACOS is mediocre for Jordan's high standards. It is still a 'good' book which is why I gave it 4 stars. This book seems to be too long for what happens in the plot. It acts like a connector book, one which just links the last book to the next one, but where nothing monumental occurs. Jordan has been compared to Tolkien, but I think this is unfair to both. While I prefer Tolkien, they are different writers, writing in different eras, with different types of fantasy styles. My favorite fantasy/scifi authors are Roger Zelazny and c.s. lewis. I think Zelazny's Amber novels and c.s. lewis's Chronicles of Narnia are superior to Jordan's because they show just as much imagination in a couple hundred pages (average book size) as he shows in a thousand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will this ever end....?","review":"I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.

A Crown of Swords is just the same as Vol. II thru Vol. VI - Rand and friends wander aimlessly for three-fourth of the book, and fulfill another miniscule part of the prophecy!

On the bright side, at least Lan is back into the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so long???????","review":"First, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. And next, too many twisting subplots to follow. He writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. Ironic, isn't it. At the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the Dark One. I certainly won't. The story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. The first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two cents","review":"Enough joys in life are too soon over, don't let's rush another.The WoT series may be long, but it is well worth the time RJ has taken to write it. It is one of the few great series I've had the good fortune to encounter. Each return to RJ's WoT series reveals more skillfully interwoven depths, whether made via a new release or revisiting a previous book.As for those who seem to want it over already, I say: stop dwelling! RJ's chosen style for WoT series was made crystal clear in book 1 and remians consistant through book 7. Minimalist it will never be.A small guess at the future: the Daughter of the 9 Moons is the Heiress-Apparent to the Seanchan Empire. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...why won't it end?!?!?! let the hurting stop!!!","review":"It is a good series, but I would like him to wrap it up now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop the Tolkien Comparisons, Please!!!!!!","review":"Robert Jordan is an author of unparralled quality, but please stop comparing him to Tolkien. His stories are not even close to J.R.R. yet every time I read a book cover, or even one of the more mundane reviews here on this page, I here yet another idiot saying how Jordan is the \\"new\\" Tolkien.Do you ever here people today comparing Barry Bonds or Ken Griffey Jr. to the likes of Babe Ruth or Mel Ott? Of course not! They have nothing in common except the fact that they are and were the best in their times; respective times that is. If published today, I have no doubt that you would never even hear of Tolkien's LORs. The same goes for Jordans books if published in the 40's.So get a grip! Enjoy the books seperately, not comparitively! And if any of you send out even one more Tolkien/Jordan comaparitive review, make sure you leave your e-mail account so that I can contact you personally and thrash your views of literature in a whole new sense of the meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific series, but 1-6 were better.","review":"I truly love this series but found this latest one not up to the standards of the first 6.

However, as I plod through book seven, I have grown tired of the endless description of the clothing worn by the characters. The game of thrones intrigues me and I anticipate the coming of Tarmon Gai'Don, but, Mr. Jordan seems forget to focus on advancing the plotlines of his work to review regional fashions. I always eagerly anticipate the next installment of WoT, but this timeI have been let down by a lack of focus on plot development. It seems nothing is ever resolved, only prolonged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, like the others, but stalling the story.","review":"I did like it, like i enjoyed the others, but robert jordan is taking too long to get to the point, a whole book just for each scenario, for each character. it needs to move faster and not tip toe around the events until the end of the book. looking forward to the nedt one which is out, but im waiting for the paperback, incase its more of the usual waiting. i do like the series though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Watered Down.","review":"I have read the whole series so far and I loved the first three books. Most, up to this one, have been good. This installment lacks any substance. The ending seemed like it was thrown together to meet a deadline. Very disappointing. I enjoy a long book, but I feel it should at least capture my attention for some of it. I have talked to a few friends who have also read and enjoyed the series. Most feel, as I, that Robert Jordan has started dragging this out without much thought. I feel the reviews I have read are giving a review of the series, not this book. The series is good, but not this one. One could probably skip this one, and not miss a beat in the series. I'll probably wait for two more books to be written in the series before I start reading again. The books are getting shorter in pages and much shorter in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book goes ever on and on...","review":"Jordan's seventh book adds nothing to this endless stream of mass-market drivel. Most of the people who I know that started the series gave up long ago, as I now have. Jordan's works are written in a manner remniscent of something my D&D buddies would have concocted after an all-night session back in eighth grade - which is appropriate, considering the target audience. Just think, the approximately four-star average review of this book was created from the opinions of those who liked Jordan's previous works enough to drudge through the first six books. Factor in the large number of people who gave up on the series, and the average score would be far, far lower.And please quit comparing Jordan with Tolkien. Comparing those to is similar to comparing the Spice Girls with Mozart, Stephen King with Edgar Allen Poe, or 'Independance Day' with 'Casablanca'.In each case, the former is good clean fun, and a reflection of our time. The later are eternal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse...","review":"A Crown of Swords is a wonderful prelude to where this series is going (and has been headed for about 1,000 pages or so)...nowhere.While not as utterly boring as Path of Daggers, Crown does not do much moving, save in the later parts of the novel. The character descriptions are the same as the ones you have read before - the females are all still annoying, braids are still tugged, ears are still boxed, and on and on.Just make believe that this is the last book in a tiring, stale series and drop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, seems to be losing the plot though","review":"The Wheel of time series seems to be losing the plot. I love the series but not even David Eddings decided to have any more than five books in the belgariod. after finishing lord of chaos, i started on crown of swords, and found Rand no closer to Tarmon'gaidon than when he left the aiel waste in book 5. I agree character growth and elaboration plays a big part but this seems to be getting a tad repetitive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I'm not the only one...","review":"I glad I'm not the only one with criticisms of these books. I feel a bit cheated by Jordan, I've come too far now not to go to the end with this but the story has really become interminable. Leaving aside the repition (if you took out the word 'stout' this series would be three books shorter!!), infantile breast obessession, utterly inconsistant characters (e.g. strong women characters who suddenly decide they want to be dandled on some man's knee and what the hell is 'dandled anyway')... the thing that irks me most is why does virtually every character insist on jumping to conclusions about the others without a moments thought?I read thiat things getter better from about book 10. I really hope so!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of Tone in the Series","review":"Jordan doesn't try to outdo Lord of Chaos instead he changes the tone and writes a more light-hearted volume. This is all to the good, but as we'll see in Path of Daggers, Mat's character is more necessary to the story than you'd think.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jinkins, The Shannara series by Terry Brooks, The Saga of Darren Shan series by Darren Shan, and the Remnatns series by K.A. Applegate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of an O.K. series","review":"The plot was pretty well non-existant. The Character development was low and well, it was a basic waste of time. The rest of the series is okay however, and Path of Daggers makes some improvement"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but feels stretched.","review":"I love the series as much as the next person, but RJ adds toomany new plot twists and then answers the most burningquestions from the previous books in a half a page. It makes mefeel like he's grasping at straws to make this whole sagafinally \\"click\\". Also, he didn't write as much as theother books, which makes me think he's run out of steam.He has written himself \\"into a corner\\" andis trying to get himself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert's multi-volme epic is a feast for fantasy aficionados","review":"Jordan's done it again, adding this new fantastic chapterinto the the Wheel of time series. Jordan's talent forsustaining the difficult combinationn of suspense and resolution, so necessary in a multi-volume series such as this one, is nothing short of remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is a good editor when you need one?","review":"After repeated delays and months of speculation, Robert Jordan'snewest WoT book, \\"Crown of Swords,\\" only goes to prove that everygood author needs a better editor The first six books of the series wereall lengthy, but tightly written. The seventh has suffered, and sadly couldhave used a great deal of blue pencil. \\"Crown of Swords\\" raises thenumber of plot twists one would expect, but integration has suffered somewhat,and each subplot seems a little too shallow. The success of each precedingvolume was largely due to Jordan's ability to enmesh readers with new plotlines as old questions are answered. \\"Crown of Swords\\" put few questionsto bed, and does not capture the reader's interest as previous books had.If this were the first WoT book that I had read, I might consider stopping here.Of course it is the seventh, so I will await the next volume, hoping it resemblesthe earlier volume"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he tolkien reborn or a thief?","review":"Reading all the reviews already entered for this book made me itch to put my two cents in. Every reviewer either loved the book or was tired of the whole adventure. I am very firmly in the latter camp. This story is endless! He's seven books into this story and he's still introducing new characters, he has plot lines that have been open since the first book (Padan Fain for one) and half the characters he's killed may re-appear...ENOUGH! end it already..And for those of you who compare this guy to tolkien I suggest you re-read tolkien and remember that he did it first (And in about 1/10 of the pages"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets you wonder into a whole new level of dreaming!","review":"This book is wonderfully written with fun characters that stayrealistically the same. Jordan doesn't try to excite you by having anunreliable charracter. Everything that is in this book could happen in the world. The foundation of the book keeps you on the same path. You do not jump plots, or twist in FUNKY ways. Once you pick it up you'll will not put it down until you finish. Then you'll bug the Author and Publisher until the next one comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book, but behind the first six.","review":"With the seventh installment in the Wheel of Time series,Robert Jordan once again brings us into his incredibly detailed worldwith its amazing plots. I was a little disappointed with the anticlimatic ending because it was so short and ho-hum after a one and a half book build up. It seems that Jordan is spending less time on his books or is being huried. In earlier books the plots were more intricate and the surprises greater. The book is great but it does not compare to \\"The Lord of Chaos\\" or \\"The Shadow Rising\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Blood and Bloody Ashes', he has done it again!","review":"Seven down, another thirteen to go?? Hey, who's counting. Write on Mr. Jordan, that's what you do best. The Light shine on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"RJ could have done better.","review":"After reading this book, I feel as if something has been left out and that I was cheated. I think this comes from reading the other 6 books in the series which make book 7 pale in comparison to them. This book does drag on a bit and could use more excitement like Rand battleling a forsaken, aiel fighting aiel, etc, etc. I by no means want to see a book cover to cover filled with battles but those types of things do break up the monotony of the long drawn out plots that RJ seems so fond of. In conclusion.. while not as great as any of the others this book is still a must buy for any WoT or Jordan fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Read it then?","review":"I'm surprised at complaints as to the length of the series, considering those that complain have also read all seven books. If it's too long, stop reading! (as others have said as well) Personally, I enjoy Jordan's drawn out style (get my money's worth). If you're the kind of person that likes to pay twenty-five dollars for a two hundred page book, fine. I'd rather pay the same twenty-five and get 600 to 800 pages of complex dramatic, humourous, engaging reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of gas.","review":"With any lengthy series you must expect some form of deterioration in regards to quality. As is the case with Jordan's \\"A Crown of Swords.\\" But I didn't expect it to fall so dramatically. The editing was dreadful and the plot had little to be desired. Jordan seems to have lost interest in finishing this series or he hasn't been spending the time on this series that he should be because of other obligations. The first couple of books in this series were so good that I literally couldn't put them down. This book was just the opposite. I read it just to pass some time. The only thing that saved this book from getting a zero on my chart was Jordan's ability to make the words jump right out and give me a vivid picture in my mind. Unfortunately I have this need (more like a curse in this case) to finish reading a series to the end. The way things look it seems I am going to be living through a slow death. I was truly disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book to be good.","review":"I think that this book is a great book. You must read it if you want to read the 8th. Jordan is one of my favorite authors. I found it to be exciting and leading ever closer to the end. I get caught up in the story worring how long Rand can keep his sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!!","review":"I did, really. Sure it didnt have T'armon Gaidon in it but thats reserved for the last book(I hope), and CoS is not I repeat NOT the last book. And yes Rand didnt kill Sammael yet but its infinitely superior this way. And it had lots of Mat chapters and enough Rand chapters to work it in perfectly.Mats adventures in Ebou Dar were perfect(except maybe the parts with Tylin) and how his medallion worked in relation to the fight with the Gholam was suprising at the least. However it wasnt a suprise on how he acted on those occasions.Returning to Rand there is no way Jordan could have it better(other than adding Aviendha and Elayne to the whole mess in Carhein) and how he dealt with the rebellion in (where else)Carhein was ingenius.It is the GREAT! Anyways enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book?","review":"The first six were excellent. This volume is a MAJOR disappointment. The next one looks to be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Here?","review":"I love Robert Jordan. I read and re-read his books on a regular basis. I got book eight. I cleared a weekend for uninterrupted reading. I opened the book, I thought \\"Why did he do THIS?\\" I was disappointed that the book did not cover its usual panoramic view of the world where the epic story is taking place. Several of the major storylines were not addressed. (How can you leave us hanging, Mr. Jordan?) The book was short. (I know it is the around the same number of pages, but if you increase the font size and increase the margin width it hardly counts, does it?) I have heard some odd rationalizations for this book. I was told that Robert Jordan was paid almost nothing for the first eight books, but that contract is over and now he is in it for the money. I am not sure what to think. I will buy book nine the day it comes out (I have to know what is happening). But I hope that it is a better book than this one was. It would be an unfortunate end to a truly stellar series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--can't wait for more!","review":"This book was just as interesting as the rest of them. I can't wait for the next one! (And I'm so glad about what developed between Lan & Nynaeve in this one. It's about time!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"I have been a huge WOT fam for a long time, but I feel that this book did not live up to the standards that his other books have set. With the eigth book coming out soon (we hope)I have decided that I should reread the series, and have just finished all 7. The last few books have been slowly slipping, and this last one was a rush job. I only hope that this book we have been waiting for for over 2 years will be back to his origianal standards that made me stick with this series for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molasses moves faster","review":"I have enjoyed reading the series so far, but the last 3 books have moved so slow it is hard to keep up interest. Details of people and places are repeated so many times I find myself skimming over paragraphs. Character behavior also is frequently inconsistent, with people learning lessons but not responding to similar situations based on the lessons learned. Examples are beyond this simple review, but Nynaeve, Egween, and Mat are the biggest dissappointments. I would like to see more consistency in actions and more realistic human reaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is one of the best out there!","review":"The whole \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is simply an epic saga everyone has to read. It follows the rise of a simple farmer to a near god-like status. Just pray Robert Jordan doesn't die before he finishes this great series. I have read hundreds of fantasy books (and I mean that literally) and not one comes close!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was great but needed the end of it finished","review":"I am a hard core fan of RJ. I have read the whole series through 23 times and still find new things every time. What I had trouble with in this book was, how much stuff was left hanging. I can understand leaving some things open but to much can put you off. I am eagerly awating the 8th book . I feel that it will take well over 6 more books to finish the series. Aside from what RJ left hanging at the end I think the book was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book and series (Deserves a rating of 11 actually)","review":"This is simply an amazing book. There are those that complain about it being boring and non focused but that's not true. Think about it this way : The whole series is expected to be at LEAST 13 books long. The plot can be summerized as this, characters set out on adventure/quest (to defeat the \\"bad guy\\", the Dark One) , they get ready and there is a final battle. Right now some readers seem to feel that the book has no focus. That is because the character are getting ready for the last battle now. The characters themselves are trying to unify the world.Let there be no doubt that Robert Jordan has created the best fantasy series ever (O.K. , then there's Tolkein)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS ROBERT JORDAN'S PROBLEM?!?","review":"After having read the past 6 books just like any other Jordan fan I rushed to buy the seventh book even though it was still in hard book form when I bought it. Hey, I thought, atleast I can finally find out some more of the storyline. Well apparently plot wasn't a priority in A Crown of Swords and neither was following up on the loose ends left over from the last novel. This book seemed to be more focused on pointless descriptions that have literally no place in this book and the more and more frequent sexual escepades. The story has sunk down to some awful soap opera, that like soap operas never seems to end. Well atleast the soaps have some intresting turns, but this book goes absolutely nowhere except for the last few pages where Rand just up and fights a Forsaken. Is Rand ever going to fight the Final Battle or is Jordan going to kick the bucket first? Seriously if you want a really big disappointment then don't hesitate to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot that goes no where","review":"I used to love this series. I loved the length and the depth of the characters. I am not complaing about how long the books are or that the story will go on for a long time. I am complaining becuase this book could be removed from the series and I don't think anyone would miss it. This is not Jordan's usual work. In previous books he seemed to dwell too long on some details but the story moved. My plan is to wait for book 8 to come out and then give it to my brother who just started the series without ever giving him Crwon of Swords. I am willing to bet with anyone that he won't even notice that it is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"women are annoying","review":"Iwould like to say that first of all I am a rather strong woman who considers herself a feminist. If anyone would like Robert Jordan's attempts at creating intelligent, tough women it would be me. Unfortunately, I find his female characters annoying. Women are much more complicated and we don't always gang up against men. I find all the women rather nasty bitches who are constantly engaged in other people's bussiness. Also, if these girls are really country girls they wouldn't be so hung up on sex. My family, until this generatioin, all worked on farms, or owned their own farms. I know from my grandmother and her sisters stories that most people of her era where surprisingly down to earth and realistic about sex. Maybe, probably not likely, Robert Jordan will add some varity to these women in the next book, and make them a little less narrow minded and judgemental."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"This was by far the worst book of the series. I first read The Eye of the World way back in 1990, I was 10 YEARS OLD!!! Now as we enter into 1998 I wonder if Jordan will ever finish this series before the year 2000. I have had to re-read the series each time a new book comes out to stay on top of things since Jordan writes so damn slow. I think I will just skip this book when I reeread the series. Does anyone know when book #8 will appear in the stores? If it isn't better I quit! I have learned I valuable lesson from this series, wait till the author decide to finish before reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crown of Swords","review":"Ah the classic Robert Jordan book...build up the suspense with all the loose ends.

Absolutely boring. I had to read this book inbetween my purchases of other books to even finnish it. The author needs to quit stalling to make a few bucks and finnish this series. I for one will not buy anymore in this series till it is finnished, and only then when there arent any of my other favorites out there to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - but where is the NEXT book???","review":"I, my husband, and my son are all reading this series and I have finished first! WHAT am I going to do while I wait for the next one? I cannot even think about starting on something else while not knowing what happens with the Last Battle; how does Elaida \\"get hers\\" - when will (or WILL they) the Aes Sedai ever realize that true power lies in balance??? Does Elayne's mother ever get free of the Children of the Light? What happens when they use the bowl Elayne and Nynaeve have been looking for? Does Rand ever get Elayne on the throne???

It's been very dissapointing to see the decline of this once-promising series.I recommend trying George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series if you want to see what a talented writer can do with a large group of complex, interesting characters.-Cal"},{"rating":"1","title":"800 pages?

Oh, I'll read the next book, because by this time I have invested a buch of time in reading the series. I'm motivated to see how it ends. Lets just hope the books and stories get better. If that next in the series is as pointless at this one I may just give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"\\"A crown of swords\\" is the worst book in the series by far. It lacks adventure, action, and drama. And on top of it all the ending sucked! If you've read this far in the series and you've really liked all the previous books you will probably like this book, but if Robert Jorden has barely been keepin up your interest in the series this book is going to end up in one place and one place only: The GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In this installment, Mat gets laid.","review":"Thrill as Mat is pursued by a woman old enough to have birthed him! Marvel as Elayne, Egwene & Aviendha (or whoever the hell) look for a bowl! Gape in wonder as Elayne finds some old broads who can weild the Power! Gasp in astonishment as Nynaeve and Mat argue with each other! Could it possibly get any more exciting (I shudder to think)?...To be fair, there is a climactic moment (maybe 2) in this book (which is why I grudgingly give it 2 stars) but it happens so fast with no significant development to any major character, it may as well have been a hiccough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"Many people have said that Jordan's series has continued on for too long. I strongly disagree. After reading the seventh book, I am still deeply satisfied with his writing. Jordan's character interaction is the strongest I have ever read in any book. His characters, especially Lan, have continued to develop in such a way to keep the series fresh and entertaining. The later books may get a little chaotic, and some people may not like that, but I believe it strengthens the novels. I look forward to the eighth and last book of the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan Milking a Dry Cow","review":"Compared with the rest, 'Crown of Swords' was an unmitigated disappointment.

Though not as widely accessible as \\"Culture Swing\\", it has some of the most beautiful songs. It is rare for me to like every song on an album but I come very close with this one. Dejame llorar does make me weep, Las Golondrinas as well. About the only song I regularly skip on my CD is \\"Fronterriesteral\\"--a little gimmicky for me.This song really helps me stay in touch with my own Tejana \\"rootos\\" :-) and has inspired me to learn and sing the lyrics--good practice for my Spanish.

(This Norteno standard is by Puerto Rican composer Bobby Capo.) I'm less fond of her own compositions with their sometimes mangled Spanish, although this CD contains some exceptions--\\"Con su pluma en su mano,\\" and \\"Otro vasito\\" are great songs. \\"Polka Terrestrial\\" mangles Spanish and English--on purpose--but it's so joyous that it's great fun.

I really love \\"Numbers\\", \\"Rodeo Clowns\\", \\"Dreamin'\\", and \\"Relax\\". There are plenty of other good tracks on this album too.

I have all three systems,(ps2,xbox,and gamecube)and I enjoy using this controller the most. I like to play about twenty feet away from my t.v. and it is a pain to connect extension cords to the xbox and the ps2. This wavebird works as well as the wired controllers and is wireless.

For all those things, it gets two solid stars[ 3 for the benefits, losing one for the sensitivity thing]. Yet, I can't ignore the biggest fault. It encourages people to cast aside one of the most comfortable, intuitive controllers ever designed in favor of the most awkward controller I've ever used( admittedly, I've never even tried an Xbox).

On the other hand, this is an invaluable source for information on the thinking, the history and the lives of the Ancients, which is why I like it. It is no more biased than other primary sources.About this translation, it starts out with the heavyhandedness of 19th Century polemics, However, it soon turns to a more readable, less wordy style more in line with the 21st Century.

However when you find out his mom's a professional jazz guitarist and he heard the Beatles before they hit big in america, skipping school at thirteen to listen to their records all during the first great psychedelic era (second one coming soon) it's actually plausable. \\"Fly\\" is the first track you will LOVE (reverse tape stuff, mind numbing lyrics) but actually the whole album is a conceptual piece spanning from birth to death, you'll really dig the whole thing....

I was wrong, your neopet needs to be fairly powerful to start with, which is hard to due, since you can't get much money to upgrade. When you do get enough money, you're stuck in the harder levels, which makes getting pass or even getting to the boss very hard. But overall, it's a fairly decent game.

It later came out as a very early Capitol 12\\" LP and I'd love to see it in a CD. Pete's recordings are recognized as clean and imaginative, often using Pud Brown on clarinet or on this LP Stan Story, with Warren Smith of the Bob Crosby Bobcats on trombone and George Defebaugh on drums. Songs like \\"Sensation Rag\\"(using a ragtime piano),\\"Original Dixieland One Step\\", \\"At the Georgia Camp Meeting\\", and \\"Put On Your Old Grey Bonnet\\" are catchy and represent some excellent arrangements. Pete Daily is recognized by Bob Scobey as one of the bands instrumental in the revival of traditional jazz on the west coast in the l950's, hence the low numbers on his LPs--This one was Capitol l83, I believe.

And without the handlebars, Paperboy feels like a muddled mess.Gauntlet is a faithful translation, but ten years removed from the arcade, the game seemed a little, well, repetitive.

It dates from 1964 and sounds infinitely better than this cd, even after the rough handling of my college days. Because I have an original recording in the old format, I can tell you the sound on this digital recording is atrocious. By comparison to the original this cd sounds horribly garbled and the beauty of the music and the voices is lost. I wish I had bought a used version and spent less. This is fit only for the trash can, I would not inflict it on some innocent person by reselling it used.

The best window on the theme is Tierney's statement. Everyone does deals, gives and takes favors. That's not a lamentable fact of urban life. It's the reality for social creatures.

It picked up pretty good from Pitch Black, this movie was long so if they walked you through the entire \\"5 years\\" since Pitch Black it would've been a 6 hour movie, instead they picked up in a good spot.Chronicles Of Riddick has a much better story than Pitch Black, TONS of special effects and eye candy that anyone will enjoy watching, the acting was better, etc. You can tell the budget was a lot bigger for this sequel and it shows. I enjoyed this movie a lot and would recommend it to anyone that likes lots of action and that sci-fi futuristic twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Director's version butchers the movie","review":"The Theatrical version is actually better than the director's version. The story is told in a much better manner.Even the director's version is missing some material.

It was edgy and had a tight narrative. Director's cut or theatrical cut: Chronicles of Riddick was bloated, slow, and just flat out mediocre. Not a bad movie but average all-round.

The graphics were pretty decent, and there was a lot of action.....however, the plot, if you could call it that was weak. Necromongers? Underverse? You have got to be kidding me. I put this in the category of sequels that should never have been made, alongside Speed 2, and Mad Max:beyond the thunderdome. All three of these were movies I enjoyed, followed by sequels that were a real letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the director's cut...","review":"There are very few directors like James Cameron who can actually give you a better version of a motion picture by showing you their personal vision in a director's cut. David Twohy is no James Cameron, and I found the theatrical version to be tighter, faster paced and missing a lot of the new Riddick-u-lous additions that Twohy found necessary to add. In my opinion, this is one film where the studios got it right. Stick to the theatrical version. It's far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the theater release!!!!","review":"I enjoyed the theater release of this movie.

This unfortunately, is not one of his better acting efforts. The story has a lot of action though and some of the fight scenes are good. Diesal's character is has a smug attitude that sometimes makes it difficult to root for him. He does have an intimidating pressence that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.The special effects are not high tech but they seem good for what they are. There is some narration at the beginning that is important not to miss because, without it, you will have a hard time following the story. Overall I would give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Speech Impaired Child Writes Better Dialogue","review":"I am giving this two stars instead of one beacuse Judi Dench is in this. She can belch with dignity and class, which is what she practically did in this movie.Thandie Newton is a beautful woman but she should never be allowed to open her mouth to speak when the writers are so inept. The movie is full of contrived cleverness and weak attemts at wit. It is cliche and my teenagers were laughing at it, mocking scenes. \\"Oh, here's the sexy prisoner! She can't fight, but she can sure talk tuff and hide blades on her body!\\"As much as I hated the movie, the director's note and additional information made it interesting in how they shot it and how they created affects.

If you prefer a human connection to the character, however, as well as a story that's believable, with memorable scenes and likable supporting characters, stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"This movie had a LOT of useless BORING scenes that were too long. I didn't see the Theatrical version so I don't know if that would have made a difference in what I thought of the film. I don't think I would have liked it much better anyway. There was some cool moves from Riddick and a few nice action scenes, and I do mean a few. The story just seemed scattered. The way they (the bad guys) talked made me so disinterested in the story that I found myself fast fowarding through most of the beginning (which is mostly talking) and other parts that had losts of talking. But don't think Im one of those guys that can't sit still during a movie that has more then just explosions and girls- I definitely have a better attention span than that. This movie was filled with Too much Useless chatter...with little payoff (action, effects, kung fu, SOMETHING). IF YOUR GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE THOUGH, GET THE THEATRICAL VERSION. BTW Pitch Black was an awesome movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Reccommend!","review":"This movie is the best sci-fi movie to come along in awhile. I would say better than Star Wars and LOTR.

There isn't too much dialogue, but I guess there really isn't much to chat about. Vin (Riddick) knocks off cheesy one liners and is pretty much be all and end all hero. Go figure.Nothing will or should surprise you in this film. It is as straight forward as a film can get. Vin should've died multiple times in this flick, but with plot holes and unrealistic actions, the man walks away with maybe a kitten's scratch.I paid $3.20 for the rental and I feel a little cheated. For an action film with not much script, it is amazing how it can drag along. Anyway, if you don't mind paint by the numbers movies, then by all means, Chronicles of Riddick should suit your fancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Listen to Critics","review":"This film got poor reviews, but I enjoyed \\"Pitch Black\\" and I am a Science Fiction fan so I went anyway. This film was excellent from the very start and is one of those rare examples of pure science fiction. The main gripe of the critics centered around the fact that \\"nothing was explained\\" a general complaint from critics who are not used to reviewing science fiction, as most science fiction (and this one is no different) supposes a universe that the reader or watcher buys into. The special effects were incredible and the bad guys sufficiently evil. Of course, I don't want to give anything away but one hopes from the ending and the credits that Vin Diesel and David Twohy have at least one Riddick left in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore Sci-Fi At It's Best!!!","review":"It's been a long time since I've seen a sci-fi movie that stays true to the genre. I loved Pitch Black and when I heard they were making a sequel I couldn't wait. I saw Riddick when it was in the theaters, 5 times and even that wasn't enough to apperciate the scope of the special F/X. They were increddible. Vin Deisel did a great job as well as the rest of the cast. I was suprised that the story was carried off so well. The actors were perfect in their roles. No one was overwhellmed by the large sets or F/X. Everyone held their own and thats what really makes this movie fly...I can't wait for the next Riddick movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a painful movie","review":"I saw Pitch Black in the theaters when it came out, and was blown away by the character development and story, I thought it was the best sci-fi movie since Alien. Intelligent and engaging, two words that can never describe this mess.This movie is so painful to watch in light of the superior Pitch Black. A clunky storyline, with some of the most embarrassing lines ever to stain a movie. The FX is very good most of the time, but good FX does not make for a good movie.The \\"plot\\" has been rehashed over and over so I will spare you. Riddick was a very interesting character before this movie. In this movie, he is turned into a shallow superhero with a bad attitude. Yeah, I know he changed at the end of Pitch Black because of \\"the captain\\", but this is not the same character at all.If you are in the mood for a mindless action flick, this will probably serve you well. If you want a well written, interesting movie, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"This film was much better than I expected it to be, it was an allegory if I ever saw one.

Vin learns about his mysterious origins (he's the last of his breed) and faces off against the leader of the Necromongers with the future of all beings hanging in the balance. Whatever!!

A confusing story, a dreadful script and a ridiculous lack of action combined to bore me, which is too bad because this film could have been so much better with a little more directorial effort. After Diesel's action-packed \\"XXX\\" I really expected a high intensity shoot-em-up, blow-em-up sci-fi extravaganza, and yes some of the special effects are quite impressive, but the film as a whole just falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chronicles of Riddick-Unrated","review":"Although this movie has been out a while, I never saw it until I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire.I thoroughly enjoyed the action and futuristic cinamatography.

This unrated directors cut reveals too much to soon, and reveals the obvious too late. If you haven't figured out who caused the massacre on Furrian by the time this version \\"reveals\\" it then you've been napping. The scenes showing the decimated planet Furrian and the accompying explanations by the \\"ghost\\" weren't only irrevelant but annoying and detracting from the original story. I'll be returning this movie and buying the original theatrical release. Hopefully I'll be able to forget the dreadful added 15 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"If you've seen Pitch Black, this is the sequel that you must see.

Go with the theatrical.","review":"I liked the movie...when I saw it in the theater. I was incredibly disappointed with the Unrated Edition. I might have liked it better if I hadn't seen the original.The unrated Edition changes the movie too much. Some of the new footage makes some things make more sense, but it also changes the story too much in my mind. Some new footage makes the scenes too long and extremely dull. It's like listening to someone talk a lot and say nothing.They may have added footage, but they have taken a lot out as well. They have taken out some of the great one-liners. They have rearraged some of the dialogue. Once again changing the movie too much.If you really enjoyed the theatrical version, don't get the unrated version. If you haven't seen the original, this one might be enjoyable for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Pitch Black But Still Enjoyable","review":"True this movie is nothing like Pitch Black and the director might have gotten carried away with the whole idea of making this an epic movie on the scale of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but who can't help but love the character Riddick. For me the character alone is able to carry the movie with his rough-smooth voice and his kick butt action. Yes this is not a GREAT movie but it is very good and deserved better attention than it received. Perhaps it would of done better had they released the directors cut, which makes things more understandable. *shrugs* What do I know? Just my own opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the summer's best","review":"Okay what I don't get about this movie is this: 'high minded\\" critics give thumbs up to crapola like the day after tomorrow and troy and then trash this?

Vin Diesel and Karl Urban from the lst two LOTR movies are good enough to smooth over the rough patches in the script (hence no 5 star rating) and the action is top notch. I watched this film pleasantly reminded of the first two Conan movies. I even have to admit that I wasn't expecting the surprise ending and he[[ yeah I hope there will be a sequel.

Dame Judy Dench was somehow talked into taking part as well. Huge scenes with lots of action and inventive CGI effects are meaningless when the plot (and I use the word loosely) is undecipherable, the characters unbelievable and the set-ups are often not paid off.A waste of good pixels."},{"rating":"1","title":"strong visuals, weak everything else","review":"In this top-heavy and bloated sequel to \\"Pitch Black,\\" Vin Deisel plays a top-heavy and bloated antihero whose job it is to defeat an army of half-dead warriors bent on taking over the universe.At 135 minutes, \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\" is an interminable mélange of derivative mythology, mind-numbing dialogue and uniformly wooden acting, made bearable only by the breathtaking design and look of the film. Diesel sleepwalks through the part of Riddick, barely managing to sputter out even the few paltry lines of dialogue the screenwriter has seen fit to assign to him. About the only point of interest in the otherwise dull and tedious enterprise is why the classy Judi Dench chose this particular neighborhood to go slumming in."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star only because I like Vin Diesel.","review":"Can talented people make bad movies?Yes, they can and here they prove it.Can good action stars make lousy science fiction movies?I wish it was not so, but Vin, oh Vin, how COULD you?Can great sets, fantastic special effects and marvelous actors create a dead-dog of a movie?Unfortunatelly, here they can and they do.After the first 10 minutes of this thing I was ready to go to sleep. It did not get much better afterwards. I guess making good movies is not that easy.Perhaps the main problem here is the fact that special effects do not constitute a motion picture.

Rescuers are Russell Crowe and his posse which includes David Caruso. Morse is decent guy but his character is overlooked in the rush to emphasize the machismo of Crowe,Caruso, et al, and their daring rescue deeds. Ryan is all nervous gestures, fiddling with cigarettes instead of acting (I think she's turning into a latter-day Diane Keaton),she has brief but hysterical outbursts every so often, and for two people who so famously had an affair, there are no virtually no sparks between Ryan and Crowe. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old Fashioned Entertainment! Intense!","review":"This movie was engrossing and fun to watch! The characters were totally believable and intense to watch - and I was ready to disbelieve it, and them, at each turn because of the wrong-headed critics. Very entertaining! If you're an average movie buff, you won't be disappointed by this flick. It's got believable bad guys, entertaining and flawed heros, gorgeous locales, and an interesting, multi-layered story.The love story isn't so much a love story as it is a character study of two people going through an intense and emotional period. It is completely believable how the situation dictates not love but, and I'll use the word again, very intense feelings.

Meg Ryan does a fine job as the wife trying desperately to rescue her kidnapped husband, as does the actor who plays her husband. Really, the whole cast works well together to tell a thrilling story. This is one of the few movies that I could watch over and over.Don't skip the credits at the end, as the aerial camera circles the winged Virgin of Quito,pans across Quito cityscapes and rugged Andean scenes, and finally flies right inside the smoking crater of Pichincha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time viewing","review":"Excellent story with a good Australian actorBased on actual events that can occur in countries less fortunate than our own"},{"rating":"1","title":"proof that pouty lips go a long way","review":"Didn't like her hair.

He doesn't have much to work with here: the script is lousy (seems to think a provocative relationship = penetrating stares). But he holds the screen hostage as usual when he's on it. Unfortunately for us, that doesn't happen often enough.Not a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"It it wern't for Russell Crowe, this would have been a complete failure. The plot takes place in a fictional country in Latin America. The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan's husband gets kidnapped by gorillas. Throughout the movie he is abused, denied of a shave or a shower, and is put to rotten work. Russell Crowe is the man in charge of working out a deal with the gorillas to free Ryan's husband. At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. In my opinion, it is pretty pathetic that Meg Ryan would show interest in another man while her husband is in captivity by hostile gorillas. The whole movie is really bad, Meg Ryan is a just terrible, the only good part is the action seen at the end, but it doesn't quite save the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof of boredom","review":"I don't know what people see in Russel Crowe. \\"Gladiator\\" might have made him popular, but he won't become another Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford... to my opinion. This \\"Proof of Live\\" has proved how boring Crowe can be, portraying a boring character in one of the most boring movie ever. I had to walk out in the middle of it, realizing the story is going to drag until the end.Meg Ryan is one of my favorite stars, but I think it's a waste for her to be in this movie, which died out of the box office in no time. I'm also disapointed that she'd find this guy attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked because Meg Ryan was in it - no more explanation needed","review":"But if you must know. It's the usual pathetic acting job by Meg Ryan that really brings down this movie. Little wonder most of her movies in the past 8 years have sucked. I can't believe she's cast in serious roles. Never works.

The ending was little bit of a standard action movie \\"happy-go-lucky with a bang\\" but the rest was well made, engaging and thought provoking. To my surprise, Meg Ryan gave a terrific performance but Russell Crow was stiff and colorless (as always). The disk has a nice \\"Making of\\" documentary also.

Proof of Life is a much better film than I anticipated. And the love story that appears in the ads and trailers isn't really there, so it's not so sappy as it appears. It is extremely interesting and informative as to what happens when someone is kidnapped and held for ransom. I would recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"I can't believe other reviewers even consider this a movie. I didn't care about any of the characters and I actually hoped that her kidnapped husband would just die so that the film would end. How another reviewer considered Crowe's \\"acting\\" worth an oscar I have no idea. He simply grew a beard and failed to bath for a few weeks. This is not acting. The worst was the contrived nemisis captor, who he OF COURSE shot at the end. Didn't see that one coming!Russel crowe looked bored. Meg ryan...well all she really did was complain. Great, thanks for subjecting us to two hours of straight agony. THere is a reason this movie bombed at the box office; no one wants to sit in the theater for two hours and watch uninspired, hackneyed [...] Even Russel crowe and Meg ryan looked bored throughout the whole film. If you cared about this film, you need help."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!","review":"I actually have \\"THE SCREENING PURPOSE\\" VHS of this movie, I got it when the movie was in theaters. I was disapointed to see that the \\"Love Scene\\" between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe was cut out in the movie. (maybe it was cut for the best) Over rall I thought the movie was great, Meg Ryan's acting was Wonderful (she wasn't the usual PERKY, Loud, Funny Meg) David Caruso was the best.... Russell Crowe is himself with his Aussie accent. In Tayor's interview he states why the love scene was cut, there is the trailer of the movie on the DVD. One of the best action films I have seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst \\"movie\\" I have ever seen","review":"This \\"movie\\" is barely a movie at all. Movies have a plot, acting, and compelling characters, none of which you will find in this horrendous mess that Crowe and Ryan were either under contract to do or horribly desperate for money. There is no reason to care about any of the characters whatsoever, and I actually found myself hoping that the kidnapped husband would just get killed so the movie would end. Some characters showed up for no apparent reason and then left with a similar nonimportance. How other reviewers gave this more than a single star I will NEVER understand.

From the slow pace of the film during the negotiating, that helps to add to the atmosphere of frustration among the cast, to the bullet thumping, down towning realism of the rescue at the end. If you like Bravo two zero realism and dual speed action movies you will love Proof of life. Movie makers watch and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expecting better","review":"Whei I heard about proof of life, I set my expectations high because of russell crowe who was really good in the gladiator.

The movie never quite takes off the ground"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof of Life","review":"The story begins when an American engineer working in a South American country is kidnapped and held for ransom. His wife finds herself abandoned by his employer, and on her own trying to get him back alive. In the process, she has to reevaluate the nature of her committment to her marriage, in the face of temptation under extraordinary circumstances.What intrigues me in particular is how the relationship develops between the ransom negotiator and the victim's wife, over the course of several months. There is little to suggest that things are less than proper. The subtlties of an expression, a look, a few words, unconscious gestures and actions, altogether create a decidedly romantic tension between the two.The setting, scenery and location are exotic and beautiful. And yes, Russell Crowe is compelling. It amazes me how he can convey so much just by the way he moves, his tone of voice, facial expressions, and gestures. This one left me saying, \\"whoa, what else has this guy done?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowe's finest performance","review":"LOVED this movie!

The story is almost as thin as leading lady Meg Ryan. This movie is a waste of your time. It's not terrible but there are dozens of similar movies that are much better.

Taylor Hackford directs Meg Ryan and Russel Crowe in a trite hostage rescue story that flirts heavily with the \\"Casablanca\\" plot and fails miserably. The only reason I watched the DVD was in the hopes that the infamous love scene between Crowe and Ryan would be included in the deleted material. But it is not. Hackford's insipid commentary track is a moronic description of the action on screen. (Or maybe it's meant for the hard-of-seeing?) He modestly admits he omitted the \\"best love scene ... ever shot\\" at the request of Ryan. What was he thinking?

Unfortunately this is not it. Graphics and audio are good. Player characteristics are neat. Venues are very good. But just try beating Andre Agassi in the Semi Finals or even Martina Hingis for that matter. The action bears little resemblence to real tennis. The computer player pops winners down the line or cross court before you can blink. It's virtually impossible to maintain a rally of any kind. And believe me I've tried. Not only is the computer player on speed but the human player's character is conversely on sleeping pills. They should rename this game Frustration Court Tennis Pro Tournament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated Game","review":"This game was anticiated by Tennis fans greatly, but instead we get another \\"wanna-be\\" tennis game.

Small selection of Players, no Real Long Tournament, no Grand Slams, you cannot create your own player, very limited animation while hitting the ball. This is just another arcade Tennis game, like Sega Sports Tennis2k2, but not nearly as good. I found this game very dissappointing after minutes in playing it. I would not waste your Money on this game at all.

You can also choose from some of the top names on the tour (though there only 8 to choose from) and two player mode is fairly enjoyable.The minuses of this game are the character graphics which are a little blocky and there are only 4 tournaments to choose from; but the biggest minus is the computer controlled opponents in tournament mode. When you get to the semis or finals, the opponent is virtually unbeatable. I've played as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi numerous times and have never hit an ace along with hitting serves wide and up the middle at 120+ MPH and having them consistently hit back for clean winners. Along with not being realistic, it is very frustrating.I'd suggest waiting for Sega Sports Tennis (aka Tennis 2K2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This game is really bad.

The \\"humanness\\" of Superman comes through as well as his capacity to protect all mankind.I was pleasantly surprised to find myself rooting for Lex Luthor at the end. Throughout the book you get a keen sense of his intellect that rarely shines when he is bent on world domination.

Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a miss for me","review":"I own almost two dozen Miranda Lee books and generally like her books.

The true definition of a masterpiece. Redux? Well it's clear, after watching Redux, why they cut scenes from films. Sure they are interesting (it's nice to see the original version), but most of the cut scenes make Cpt Willard (Martin Sheen) seem like a buddy to the boat crew. From stealing the surfboard to getting playmates for the boys inside the helicopter. Cpt Willard (sheen) is better in the original when he seems distant from the crew. The French plantation scene is a total waste (but nice to see in comparison). I recommend you get both(too bad they don't have it on one DVD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"On DVD November 9, 1999","review":"If you're going to watch this film, watch it in widescreen. Or even better, Netflix lists the DVD as being released on November 9, 1999. DVDExpress list extras including the theatrical trailer and additional footage. Hopefully this includes the cut French Plantation scene which currently only exists on the barely viewable 5 hour workprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this edition at all costs!","review":"It is incomprehensible what Coppola has done to Apocalypse Now in this new edition. Being a two disc set, one would think that the 1979 version would be on one disc, and the 2001 version on the other. This is not the case. Coppola has SPLIT the film into two halves, \\"Part One\\" of the '79 and '01 versions being on the first disc, and \\"Part Two\\" on the other. This cutting of the film completely ruins the dramatic momentum of either version. It must be noted that this cutting of the film was not referred to in promotional materials; one only discovers this after purchasing the reissue. So, save your money and buy the single disc edition of whichever version you prefer. Boycott this abortion of a reissue and force it out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incomplete Dossier","review":"This is my favourite movie of all time and I was really looking forward to the release of this box set. I was truly dissappointed that the two versions of the movie were split in half over two discs. This really spoils the enjoyment of watching the movies and I have never come across this on any other DVD. Also, the lack of the \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary or ANY decent documentary about the film (s) in the package is a huge wasted opportunity. The deleted scenes should definitely have been cleaned up for the fans too. Most of the other extra features were largely uninteresting and criminally short or dated. I asume \\"The Ultimate Dossier\\" will be out at some future point but I'm baffled why this wasn't so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Masterpiece Defaced","review":"I HATE war movies.Apocalypse Now, as it was originally released, was not a war movie; it was a work of art, a nightmare captured on film. The first time I saw it, I walked out of the theater stunned and speechless, and I am still left in that same state every time I watch the DVD.Unfortunately, Apocalypse Now Redux has been Redu-ced to nothing more than a war movie, the nightmare subsiding and reality taking over. Once a masterpiece of film, every frame worthy of a spot in the Louvre, is now just another... war movie. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalypse Now Bluray","review":"The movie looks incredible on bluray, and the sound is much clearer. It's much easier to appreciate this movie now that I can see what's going on in the shot. Documentary materials interesting and refreshingly honest, special features and behind the scenes were entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn how to retain last image while changing dics.","review":"Short and simple. You have to change dics in the middle of the movies. Each starts out on dics one and finish on dics two. There is new stuff, but they did leave out the destruction of Kirk's camp. Poor show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only to be surpassed by the integral version","review":"An absolute must - can't wait to have the new uncut \\"Apocalypse now\\" DVD. Beautiful. Even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trolling For Dollars - Redux","review":"There is only one reason to have released this version of the modern classic Apocalypse Now -- $$$$. The scenes brought back from the cutting room floor should have stayed there. The stolen surfboard scene breaks the somber, single minded intensity that is the Willard character. The French plantation scene drags and drags (though the funeral portion IS good). The additional bunny encounter is pure drivel.If you have a copy of original, don't waste your money on this one. If you don't, don't waste your money on this one - find the original.It's too bad that all re-released \\"Director's Cut\\" editions aren't required to contain a copy of the original as a part of the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best damn movie ever!","review":"As a child, I was switching channels and found Apocalypse Now on TV. I was blown away. No other movie has so many layers and different ideas that blend togther coherently. The images are beuatiful and I like the expanded version even better. The extra scenes flesh out the characters even more and you learn more about them. I like the french plantation scene as well. It gave me more to think about and put the whole war over there in more of a perspective. Having the doors song \\"the end\\", which is one of my favorites, also adds to the mystical atmosphere of the film. Buy this movie. this is filmmaking at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redux-Not sure if necessary","review":"I believe the original film as a whole deserves 5 stars, but it is very hard for me to understand the importance of the added footage. Now, I am surely not one to critize Mr. Coppola; both he and his film are brillant. But, my question is, \\"Do the added minutes really make the story much better?\\". The absurdity of the situation is already apparent, and the characters have been treated with due attention. After watching Apocalypse Now-Redux I once again came away from this film astonished, but no more then when I had first experienced it. Though, if you have never seen this film I compel you to do so as quickly as possible, no matter the version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger is not always better","review":"I have been a movie enthusiast all my life, but when i saw this movie (on its original release) I was blown away.I could not believe that sound, image and story could be mixed in such a magnificent way... The movie was a trip for me.Years latter comes the Redux... Apocalypse is still as powerful as ever but some of the added scenes break the frenetic rythm of the original.Some of the scenes help us to see Captian Willard as the auto-destructive S.O.B. is only hinted in the original, but others not only break with his image, but also put the character out of context.I would have loved to give this one a 5 stars review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break !!! :-(","review":"Sorry, but how can this be \\"complete\\" when it does not include \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" ??? Get a life. Coppola's wife directed it, and he produced it (as far as I know), so where are the rights problems ??? One thing that really annoys me about these 60s-70s directors, who went on about \\"changing the world\\", when they were younger, but who are now more money-grabbing than the worst studio system. Hey, I've bought two DVD versions of Apocalypse Now already, how many more do you want me to buy??? Maybe I'll just transfer my \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\" VHS to video, as I'm not so well-of I can afford it all. Thanks, Coppola. ps, your wine stinks too."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the Original First","review":"Before i knew that the redux was to be released I saw the original Apocalypse Now and regretted not seeing the redux first instead. But after seeing the redux I was glad that I had seen the original first. The original is long enough as it is. The slower pace of the redux version, coupled with the longer play time, may turn hurt first time viewers opinion of the movie as it did for my friend.The redux is at least a must see for Apocalypse Now fans; I own it, but it is not for the first time viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Film","review":"This is a wonderful movie! The cinematography, acting, and script are wonderful. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes movies about Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"holds up well in time","review":"When I was young, I watched this movie a couple of times. I never really got it. I didn't realize that then, but after watching it again now, I know that I was ignorant to the brilliance of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange Movie for a Strange Place","review":"This movie has the look and feel (sometimes) of the juxtiposition we experienced in Viet Nam. We could move for days to our pickup point with absolute noise security to find a riverboat with their radios blaring (as in the movie). Scenes as this were very disturbing and real and brought back memories I have buried for years.During these moments I could almost feel the intense heat and smell the jungle. I have yet to be able to finish the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Pan and Scan mess","review":"While the original film was 2.1:1 aspect ratio, Paramount has butchered this film by pan and scanning down to fit a 16:9 widescreen TV. Of course they don't bother to tell you that on the package. So much for the director's vision. Paramount, you should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Yeah - it's a bummer that they didn't include Hearts of Darkness, but putting Redux and the original together was irresistable (although I much prefer the original).I was ENRAGED that some idiot decided to put half of each movie on 1 disc, instead of the original on one and Redux on the other.All I can say is - WTF!!!If you prefer to sit back to enjoy films in their entirety, do yourself a favor and don't buy The Complete Dossier.It's such a shame too, the packaging was insanely cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"This version of Apocalypse Now--Redux--is the one to see, at least as an instant video on Amazon. The picture is brighter, the sound clearer and the pauses fewer than with the original. The original film as seen on instant video is visually dark and murky and both the original and Redux have some instances where the movie stops briefly, but these pauses occur more often with the original. A couple of scenes have been added to Redux and their value can be debated, but this is surely one of the two or three classic Viet Nam films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Value For The Price","review":"Despite the absence of \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\" (which I suspect is still tied up in the legal morass that has kept it out-of-print for the last decade), \\"The Complete Dossier\\" is a great value for the price. Coppola's commentary is entertaining and filled with little insights you won't hear elsewhere. The extras are not hugely in-depth, but you get more than you usually would with a nearly 30-year-old film. I found the behind-the-scenes montage used to accompany Brando's 17-minute reading of \\"The Hollow Men\\" to be quite creatively done. Finally, there is another plus to both films being split over two discs apart from the quality image issue: it's an easy way to compare the subtle editing differences in specific scenes between the 1979 and 2001 releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie, even the ending","review":"Ok...almost everyone agrees the first 2 hours of this movie are amazing. It is not a war movie, it is a movie about a journey (both physical and symbolic) in which one man finds that man's true existence is the heart of darkness. As for the ending...it is certainly unconventional. But it is extremely successful, from the books on Kurtz's table (two precursors to Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\") to the omnipresent orange light (hell??). If you got nothing out of the ending, perhaps you should read Heart of Darkness. If you're still unimpressed, read Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" for Kurtz is the argument against the Nietzschian superman. A powerful story, in both movie and novella form."},{"rating":"2","title":"original version Apocalypse Now","review":"this is the original theater version as shown back in 1979 [not REDUX] the picture quality was excellent!

In other words, not even close. Directed by someone who had never been there, starred in by actors who had never been there, with results like they had never been there, BUT THEY ARE AGAINST WAR. DUH!!!We all know war is hell. Many have said that many times many long years ago.

The only flaw is that there were many un-necessary scenes and the movie could have been much better without them. There was only one major battle, and that was near the beginning of the movie. The action in the battle was fantastic. But where's the rest of the action? Some parts in the movie were really boring, I kept waiting for something to happen, and it eventually did. In my opinion, this is just an average, or slighty above average War movie.Score - B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalypse Now is pretentious rubbish !!","review":"Apocalypse Now is utterly pretentious. Coppola is a good director but this is a bad film. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is not much better with both endings being silly and tedious.

Apparently the aspect has been played with and no DTS Master or Dolby True HD. Just a cash in, in addition it is a mix of two editions Re-Dux and the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalypse, No!","review":"Although many films from the 1970s have aged well--Coppola's two \\"Godfather\\" pictures come to mind--this movie is too much a product of its time to hold much appeal for contemporary viewers. Coppola attempts to retell Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" in the Vietnamese jungle. Instead of creating a surreal journey from civilization to savagery, however, Coppola creates a confusing, didactic muddle of disconnected scenes. Add to the mix several mannered performances, heavy-handed dialogue, and a soundtrack that underscores all of Coppola's main ideas in broad, obvious strokes, and the result is an uninvolving movie about the corrosive effects of war. (The final 45 minutes are especially incoherent.) \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" does a far superior job of capturing the horror and moral ambivalence of the Viet Nam soldier's experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made but too much","review":"This film appeard to me that it was just written by a person that did not like Viet Nam and just wanted to make it look as bad as possible. As they travel down the river there is one chance after another to do that. Most of it I just found wierd. The acting and screenplay was absolutely superb but nonetheless I just did not connect with anyone in the film. Sorry to those die-hard that find this movie one of the greatest ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sominex Now!","review":"What happens when you mix a good director with a good cast and a boring, half-baked plot? You get \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"AN's plot is too bizarre to have even a modicum of credibility and having seen this film a few times, I still don't get the point of it. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's a perfect fit for Marlon Brando mainly because the characters are dull and one-dimensional--much like Brando himself! Moreover, AN also suffers from bad directing and editing which makes it a rather difficult movie to follow.For all its potential, AN never lives up to its hype and I fail to see why it received so much acclaim. For a war movie, AN doesn't have a lot of action so if you're a war movie buff, chances are it won't hold your interest. If anything, AN is about as interesting as watching dust settle on your VCR. Avoid it with extreme prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Heck","review":"I purchased this to show my students in connection with our unit on Heart of Darkness. I chose this version because it was significantly cheaper than the original. Bad choice. The scenes that were added include gratuitous sex and violence. They add nothing to the story line.

Advice is to spend a few extra dollars and get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why spend $50 when you can get it for $20 with Hearts of Darkness?","review":"Owning this boxed set makes me feel like an idiot--the Blu Ray with Hearts of Darkness goes for $20.

I wouldn't necessarily say in the bottom 10 but it's close. The overall acting was so substandard and transparent. I had expected much more from Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen. Both acted like they had something to prove to the world, which they don't. Both are great actors in their own respective ways but this movie did not do them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better whole than perfect","review":"Now that the film is more complete, it is probably less perfect, which may be why I like it better.The completed version, the original of which provided the symbols for my nightmares (I was draft age during Vietnam), is less univocal in its grim assessment of life as a war with self. The notable additions are the comical and sexy material that was deleted. Some of the additions, notably the love scene, are monumentally bad ideas (i.e., the wheezy music and cheesy sentiments). At times Sheen, who seems made of angst in the original, shows a face that is out of character, as if he were suddenly grinning at the camera, Tom Jones style.Coppola's additions have brought life to this film, which makes it seem shorter though he added almost an hour to an already long movie.I watched it last night and will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diminished classic","review":"It's been about twenty years since I saw the original cut of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" so I didn't know the film well enough to recognize the added scenes in the \\"Redux\\" version. Watching it, though, I felt that it was too long and there were some sequences that just didn't seem to work. It was also my impression that the overall film lacked the impact that my first viewing of it had, but I didn't know whether to blame that on changes in the film or changes in myself. Reading the reviews here, I find that the scenes I didn't like were all among the additions. The theft of Kilgore's board and meeting the Playboy Bunnies took situations that had just the right degree of absurdity and pushed them over the line into farce. The French plantation scene was just plain slow, dull, and pedantic. This remains an important and rewarding film, but next time I think I'll watch the original cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy theory","review":"I owned the previous versions and I am disappointed that the movies were split into 2 discs on this complete dossier set.

All it involves is a boat going up a river and stopping to blow stuff up. There is this guy called Killgore who Sheen (forget the characters name) meets along the way. Sheen needs the support of his air forces but Killgore balks because there is a VC village at the river's mouth. But then, wait for it, he changes his mind when one of the boat crewmen tells him of the great surfing available there. Thats right, soldiers in this film go surfing....And it looks fake as well, you never get the feeling there is a real war going on partly because the acting is rubbish by all involved except for Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.

Some inconsistencies of the original are \\"fixed\\" by Redux but I agree that some of the extra footage was superfluous, particularly the Playboy bunny scene at the Medevac hospital. However, the plantation scene serves to divorce the viewer from reality and adds to Conrad's vision of a world gone mad through imperialism in \\"Heart of Darkness\\". Don't forget Conrad based his novel on his experiences in the Belgian Congo over 100 years ago.PS I would have loved more extras with the Redux release and it would have been great if Paramount had included Mrs. Coppola's ground-breaking documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" about the making of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" with location shots and the pure hell of putting a masterpiece together. Perhaps there were copyright issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this, buy the original","review":"Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the most memorable and powerful films ever made. However, the \\"Redux\\" version is completely unnecessary, with the extra footage greatly harming the finished product. As expected, the sound and video quality of the DVD is superb, but as for the movie itself, the original version is far superior. If you are looking for a much better companion to Apocalypse Now, try \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse\\", which is basically a \\"making-of\\" documentary of Apocalypse Now.

When I first saw it, i was blown away by how excellent it is. Other reviewers seem to think that this version is worse than the original, but come on, thius is a frickin good film. Probably my favorite war film, in fact, even though by conventional standards its not really a war film...more of a psychological tour de force. Favorite scenes; the beggining, the air raid, the part where willard reads kurtzs final letter from his outpost, the bizzar 'carnival' scene (thats the best way i can describe it) and the scene in which willard actually kills kurtz (intercut with the natives killing a wild boar. Yes, perhaps the frecnh plantation scene does go on a little to long, but as I say, there is no perfect film. Great performances, especially from robert duvall, expertly staged battle scenes and a very atmospheric tone make this one of my all time favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch This Movie","review":"While Apocalypse Now is nto the greatest \\"war\\" movie, it is one of the greatest thought-provoking films ever made. You sit in awe as spine-chilling scenes unfold before your eyes and you sit and ponder as to what is the signigicance of waht you are seeing.

No where else have I encountered a work this powerful. Coppalla drwas from everywhere; some of his sources are obvious, as he tells us (The Doors, Jessis Weston's \\"From Ritual to Romance,\\" Fraser's \\"The Golden Bough,\\" T.S. Elliot) to those buried (Twain's \\"Huckleberry Fin,\\" Bergman's \\"The Seventh Seal\\"). The end result is superior to anyother film and much of the world's great literature.

I won't waste my time or yours writing a lengthy description on the plot, actors, or directing style of the movie...bottom line is, if you don't own this movie or have not seen it, go get it. This one ranks up in my top 5 all time favorites. Few know that this movie is actually based on the \\"Heart of Darkness\\", a novel by Joseph Conrad.The redux version contains extra footage that long time Apocalypse fans should appreciate, but it can confuse the core story line and drag the movie out for those seeing it for the first time. A must have for any war movie or Francis Ford Coppola fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good viewing as Apocalypse Now Redux","review":"This original version of Apocalypse Now is rougher viewing than the Apocalypse Now Redux version, at least as an instant video on Amazon. This version is visually dark and murky and both the original and Redux have some instances where the movie stops briefly, but these pauses occur more often with the original. A couple of scenes have been added to Redux and their value can be debated, but either way this is surely one of the two or three classic Viet Nam films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Sight and Sound","review":"Director Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979) endures as a surreal, mesmerizing journey through the chaos of the Vietnam War. The passion and gamble of Coppola's masterpiece is a rarity in today's cinema. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" remains a textbook example of accomplished filmmaking with its innovative use of stereophonic sound, location cinematography and stream-of-consciousness narrative. Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper deliver classic portrayals, while Marlon Brando's iconic, shadowy presence evokes the tortured madness of Col. Kurtz. Coppola's \\"unfinished\\" ending has been the subject of much debate, yet the final images remain haunting and provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best films of all time!!!","review":"Just to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of war movies. I checked out this classic film for the very first time and I was totally mesmerized with the dark character study of a war film.

AN also suffers from dull and one-dimensional characters.

However the ending was completely changed. I understand that the ending would be changed in the \\"Redux\\" version, but even the \\"Original\\" version was altered. I bought this disk thinking I would get a new version and if I didn't like it I could go back to the classic, but no such luck. The new version has a few interesting points, but I think highly dilutes the original film's power. It \\"humanizes\\" Captain Willard (Sheen's character), but I think that was one of the critical elements of the original film, he is meant to be distant, inscrutable and harsh. The added footage in the \\"Redux\\" version ruins the character development of Captain Willard.The altering of the ending in the \\"Original\\" version is just unforgivable in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it is bigger...","review":"...APOCALYPSE NOW was a long rambling film, that should have been edited to a much shorter length. Coppola was simply too ambitious and let the film get away from him. Now, the REDUX attempts to improve the original by adding instead of subtracting. While REDUX does explain some things, such as why the Playboy Bunnies were in the movie, the movie would have been much better, certainly easier to digest, if it had been less ambitious in it's scope and more concise in it's message.It's still a great movie though. Most males who see it for the first time, become obessed with it and watch it over and over until they walk around quoting lines from it, and you begin to worry about their sanity. (Some Vietnam War vets tend to see it as campy though, despite the horror it contains.) But it's worth the price just having a DVD for no other reason than to watch the helicopter attack scene, which is one of the best action sequences ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD gives us a way to judge movie editing like never before.","review":"The original Apocalypse Now stands as a great movie that I'd give 5 stars. Redux served as a way for me to critique the editing of the original. Coppola for years lambasted the edited original many have thought that the original was somehow lacking and that additional footage would have improved the flick. Francis was wrong Redux is enjoyable but it gives us too much Captain Willard. Willard was great in the original because he was not a likable character.The added footage of the surfing sequence was good the helicopter playing a recording of Duvall on a loop imploring Lance to return his surfboard is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!!","review":"This is one of the best movies i've ever seen!

All in all i'd say this is a perfect product. However it must be noted that since the movie is very lengthy especially the Redux version, the movie is split with the first half on disc 1 then the second half switching to disc 2. Not a real annoyance or problem its just something you should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, the real version is here","review":"Validates the whole idea of DVD, as the true expression of the Director's vision.The added footage further explains the idea of the American mistake, as we see the French plantation and it's lost inhabitants, almost hazy and shimmery in the jungle. I still think that Sheen is unconvincing as a commando, he looks ragged and unhealthy, and devoid of any muscle mass. perhaps his willingness to do the dirty work made him the candidate, as far as the generals were concerned. The movie itself has an ending that is a bit flaky, reminiscent of tying up loose ends, but it does not detract too much from the scene-that of a lost group of Americans, who find themselves in the nightmare of a lifetime, doing the best job they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artistic rendering of the Viet Nam war.","review":"Apocalypse is defined as a \\"revelation.\\" The film reveals the ugliness of war.

I'm not much on Vietnam War films, but Apocalypse Now was a great one, and Redux was even better. The sound and the picture is excellent. I was surprised, the first time I saw it, about how many people were in it. Marlon Brando WAS Col. Kurtz, but Robert DuVall steals the show as Bill Kilgore. The fact that the movie took over two years to make is unbelievable, but what came out was also unbelievable.If I have any objections, there are two. One: Why can't the movie be in a wider aspect ratio? It says on the Amazon DVD info that it's 2.35:1, but its actually 1.85:1. And two: When will \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" and the underground \\"Rough Cut\\" of Apocalypse Now be available? The \\"rough cut\\" is almost six hours long, but it wouldn't be bad to view it at least once. I guess we'll just have to wait.

It grabs you as soon as it starts, and you get this weird feeling that you just can't seem to shut the thing off. You're just paralyzed because of it's INCREDIBLE images. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it starts to drag off when they get to Brando's island. But his speech about horror will get you right back into the movie again; too bad there's only 10 minutes left afterwards. A great buy for movie buffs, especially if war is your genre.P.S. The music in this movie is reaaaally freaky. It almost turns the movie into a bonified horror flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"another special edition ?","review":"I am a big fan of Apocalypse Now, and watched it when it first came to the theaters back in the late 70's. There are many films endings and variations of this film, which makes it the more interesting, I also got the Redux version with the additional scenes, which makes the movie even more stranger, but I have to say, this special edition is excellent due in part to the commentary by Francis Ford Coppola. I know the movie by heart, but it is nice to know the inner workings and stories that come straight from the Director himself. So far this will be the fourth DVD added to my collection. If your a fan of this movie, it is worth getting this edition. 5 stars !"},{"rating":"1","title":"my god... the humanity...","review":"What was once a perfect film in every aspect has been butchered by it's own makers... It's so painful to see and sit through pointless scenes when there is so much texture that was once there in the tight editing, brutal violence, and depictions of war.

But then again, I saw it when I was young. Everyone says the movie is adapted from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but that is only partially true. In college George Lucas(yes, the George Lucas) and John Milius wrote the story, but when Coppola wanted to proceed with it Lucas was busy with Star Wars. Coppola, who owned the rights to the movie through Zoethrope, rewrote the story with Milius and went ahead and directed it anyway despite Lucas. Lucas had wanted to direct the movie which he felt was at least half his and it put a strain in his and Coppola's friendship. Lucas felt that Coppola had wrecked his and Milius' original story.

It was interesting for a while, but by the time the 3 hour mark hit, I was bored. The last scenes just dragged on. The additional footage added very little to the movie. It may be worth having this movie, but if they offer the original on the DVD, watch it instead of the Redux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh get real!...","review":"What on earth was this??? This is one of those movies which makes you wanna bang your head on the wall. First of all, there are no opening credits! What's the point of that? Secondly, the movie seems like it's taking place on a totally different world. The beginning and end of the film is really dull. The only good parts are the extremely well made war scenes, which only last a few minutes. Other than that, don't waster ur time watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as good as The Thin Red Line","review":"This movie is too slow paced, and has basically no charater development; might as well see it, so you know what kind of trash people praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Garbage","review":"I've tried so hard to like this movie, even going so far as to watch the damn thing twice.

The dialouge is inane and the movie has enough filler for a 90 min. sequel. The movie starts well and gets the viewer interested and then brings your hopes to rock bottom. I found this to be an insult of viewing time so if you want a good war movie with good appeal, see Platoon or Full Metal Jacket and leave this where you saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5 most played songs on my playlist","review":"This is an awesome albumn, you will L-L-love it (okay i promise not to be corny anymore).

The SACD version reminds me a lot of the sound quality from a very good LP setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's the Way of the World- EW&F","review":"Decent piece of work. The title track was a single, and the self-esteem bolstering \\"Shining Star\\" went to #1 on Pop and R&B charts. It's one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time according to Rolling Stone with its ranking of 493. \\"Happy Feelin'\\" is a fast track with nice guitar and drums with spectacular vocal work. \\"Reasons\\" is definitely worth listening to. \\"Africano\\" is a nice instrumental. Also, That's the Way of the World is classified by Robert Dimery as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and Soultracks.com ranked it as the Greatest Soul Album of the 1970's. Much critical acclaim went along with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Recording.","review":"In this case I will not be talking about the music as such.

One thing that gets to me though is that in the beginning we were told that this was the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, it even says so on the album. I was so fired up and ready to see this movie and the album just kept making me more anxious and hype. I never got to see this movie which I found out later was titled \\"Shining Star\\" and that the group was not the stars of the movie. EWF is my most favorite group in the world and I have been blessed to meet and greet Phillip, Verdine, and Ralph. Two things have not been fulfilled, I have not yet met Maurice nor have I seen this Movie, I would appreciate any help with either. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Henderson with the classic Miles rhythm section","review":"This CD presents a live recording from Baltimore in 1968 of Joe Henderson playing with the classic rhythm section from Miles Davis' Kind of Blue years. Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb and Wynton Kelly swing hard and play more aggressively than they had in 1959 when Kind of Blue was recorded, most likely due to the surrounding electric energy coersive influences and freedoms paved by Ornette Coleman and his followers. At times during Joe's sax solos, it sounds as if John Coltrane is playing with Tony Williams, due to the approach of the rhythm section under Joe's sheets of sound. When it settles down for Wynton's piano solos it again feels like classic Miles early 60's swing. Joe is really going for it on the CD, which strangely is out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice surprise","review":"I happened upon this cd as I was browsing the amazon music site.

One of the first of my 40+ origami books, the old, battered, early 70s hardcover still holds a place of honor on my shelf. This is one of the best origami books EVER published. For the beginner, it opens the door to a wonderful array of simple to complex models, for the advanced folder, it provides a survey of the best Western folding from that formative period of 1960s. Fred Rohm, Adolfo Cerceda, Ligia Montoya - these are names that must NEVER fade from the annals of origami. Buy this book. Use this book. Treasure this book. Very few like this have been printed before or since."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is back","review":"My Great-Aunt introduced me to many things - astronomy, biology, and origami. This was in her personal library and when I'd visit we would always pull it out and make at least one of the figures in the book. She had already managed to do nearly every figure but she was patient and I would try my best to keep up. When she died, I looked for the book but it had mysteriously disappeared. I saw that it was back in print and I snatched a copy up right away. This is the best folding book that I have ever run across. It has models that range from the very simple to the VERY difficult. You can fold out of this book for a lifetime and never fail to learn something or see something new.

I had to use a locking clip, which isn't a big deal. I had to do this with our old infant carrier base. But even though the seatbelt was so tight I couldn't get a fingernail under it, I could move the base 4-6 inches in each direction and I could actually flip the base up so that it rested against the seat back. I put our old infant carrier base in and it was very snug...could barely move it in any direction.

Then, after my brother tried and gave up, my sister-in-law, a nurse, kept saying how important it was to the baby's safety. She and I working together finally got it fastened in and cinched up tight. As a new grandparent I felt compelled to order a second carrier seat base for our van. This installation took much less time and effort. And I did this one alone.

Because her dad works at a funeral parlor, Veta is withdead people day in and day out. Everyday she goes to thedoctor's office and complains about how she is dying. The doctorexamines her but she is alright. This story reflects upon agirl who is dealing with death and her father's newgirlfriend. I give this movie a five star. It is SOOOO good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie?! Get a life!","review":"Who the heck wants to see a comedy with a sad ending?! I felt worse than disappointed when i went to see it. If you ask me, I think either whoever wrote the ending lost his mind or some dumbstupidin focus group for studio executives made it that way. I definitely agree with George Lucas's resentment about Hollywood and the way most movies are written these days. Studio executives who give more of a darn about ratings than art just don't know what the stupid they're doing. Save your money for happier endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents be forewarned! This is a troubling film.","review":"Be forewarned!.....This is a sad movie. I don't agree that this movie is a comedy nor is it a family film. I lost my best friend who was a girl unexpectedly at the age of 7. My parents in their wisdom thought it best that I didn't go to the funeral home and see her lying in a coffin. I feel the producers of this film should have included a warning. I felt violated by this film. Although death is a natural event, this young girl lacks any spiritual understanding of death. Like so many films today that call themselves \\"Family Entertainment\\", there is no God and consequently, no hope. I'd steer away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll laugh you'll cry you'll love it","review":"how old is this movie? it is very good. i can barely watch it without shedding a tear. i always laugh. an great movie and an classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good film to watch","review":"I have always enjoyed this film.Time frame when I was a kid.Nice to remember when things were better & people were happier.The music & the pop culture references are good to see.Dan following up after his Oscar nomination for \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" is good as Harry.

Introducing & this was her career the 2 films Anna Chlumsky.Since a low price DVD NO chapter search list.No extras.The 1 big complaint I have is the film is NOT wide screen. Why not film makers? You are selling the early 1970's time frame so why not show it properly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"This is probably my favourite movie of all time. It came out when I was a kid, and I saw it then as a funny, slightly sad movie about a girl and her best friend. Now I own it again as an adult and can view it in a whole new light, as an insightful, deep movie with a lot more complexity than I ever realised as a child! While we outgrow most of our favourite childhood movies as we get older, I feel like this movie 'grew up with me' in a way.

She is also in love with her English teacher, and joins a poetry class over the summer just to impress him. Thomas J., her best friend, is \\"allergic to everything\\", and sticks with Vada despite her hangups. When Vada's father hires Shelly, a makeup expert, in his funeral parlor, and begins to fall in love with her, Vada is outraged and does everything in her power to split them up. 'My Girl' is a rare treat. It is a very bittersweet look at the joys and tears a girl faces when she stands on the cusp between childhood and adolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"I absolutely LOVE My Girl. It's a timeless classic that is sure to touch everyone who watches it. It made me laugh and it made me cry.

Too bad Sony chose to release this in an abridged pan and scan. But hey, if you don't care about all that Sony cut out of the film, buy it.Addendum:I may be wrong about this being a pan and scan. Columbia, unlike Warner Brothers and Criterion, isn't always, in the information on the DVD, clear about original aspect ratios of their films. If memory serves imdb gave 1:85:1 as the oar for this film a couple of years ago. Now imdb lists 1:85:1 as the original intended oar. As a result I have to say that I am not sure whether My Girl (and My Girl 2 which imdb claims was intended to be 1:85:1) was originally filmed in widescreen then fitted into 4:3."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!

This movie is great to watch and it is a wondreful tear-jearker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I just love this movie. I have a feeling its a bit childish, but the humour and amazing acting is enough to keep me from turning the TV off. All kiddin' aside, I just love it! I've seen it about 45 times and can't get enough of it. When I discovered that Vada was 11 years old I nearly jumped out of my seat! I thought she was like six years old! I guess this just proves that movies are magic. I recommend this heartwarming movie to everyone and everything, even the most pessimistic of them all. You're just going to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas J and Vada; together forever","review":"A well rounded movie evocative of nostalgia, it is sure to melt your heart. We are given a glimpse into innocence that once was. Anna Chlumsky's flawless, natural, honest and mature portayal of the character Vada Sultenfuss is nothing less than perfect and Oscar-worthy. The movie is basically an intimate invitation to witness one eventful summer in Vada's life. It's about her relationship with her father and dead mother, her crush on Mr Bixley, her relationship with the cosmetologist who comes into their lives, her hypochondria and above all her adorable relationship with her best friend; Thomas J Sennett. This movie is Vada's naive yet insightful perception of life and death.There is this one scene which brings tears to my eyes every single time I see it. And this one poem which breaks my heart everytime I hear it. I'm writing this review wishing I could give this movie ten stars instead. Definitely, one of my all-time favourites.

This CD is a collection of funky songs which will linger in your mind and keep your toes tapping. Led by a woman with one of the most distinctive voices that has come along in quite some time this CD displays some welcome new blood in the sugar-coated R&B \\"diva\\" genre. Macy has a great voice and she knows how to use it. In the single, \\"I Try\\" you can hear her subtle heartache. That is followed by the sassy romp \\"Sex-o-matic Venus Freak\\". Macy's voice winds us back and forth throughout the disc. In \\"I've committed Murder\\" this woman sings like she has lived her lyrics and demands that you listen to her. A great new talent. Well worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe The Hype.....","review":"So I went out to see for myself...I'd read all of the reviews, and it was finally time to find out for myself if the actual CD matched the hype. My answer is--believe the hype. What a wonderful debut CD. Macy Gray is a phenomenal new talent. I played the entire CD from back to front all weekend, and I'm still not tired of it! The lyrics of several songs \\"Still\\", \\"Why Didn't You Call Me\\", \\"Caligula\\", and \\"The Letter\\" hit particularly strong notes within me. I hope Macy can keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC!","review":"I can not begin to tell you how wonderful this cd is! What a treasure! How fabulous to have a TOTALLY new and fresh voice in music...she has a sound unlike anyone else, and it's almost impossible to describe her voice. Is it high? Is it low? Is it feminine? Is it masculine? YES! It's all of the above and more.

Not Award-winning","review":"The hype about this album is just that - hype. Ms. Gray has limited vocal talent (no range, can't project, no depth) - in fact producers prop up most of her performances with backup singers and sythesized instrumentals. Ms. Gray has no special writing talent either - her lyrics are simplistic and dull. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant vocalist takes away the Gray","review":"The best album of 1999 and you will be hooked after just one play.

When I first bought the CD for \\"I Try,\\" which is song #4, I kept listening and the whole entire CD is just amazing! Her style is so different.

This CD is a great mix of musical styles while still keeping a smooth groove throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most talented \\"Diva\\"","review":"I have to say this is the one of the best albums I have heard in years. I'm actually listening to it for the 1000th time and it is awsome. Tracks like \\"I Try\\" \\"Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak\\" and \\"I Can't Wait To Meet You\\" just make you groove where ever you are automatically. Macy Gray is a true talent and deserves a lot of respect for this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington!","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this one. R&B music (my favorite genre) has, in my opinion, really been in a slump for many years. A fresh perspective in R&B was definitely welcome to me. Its nice to see a recording that definitely was not created soley to be played of VH1. I feel it still has a long way to go before it can be a 4 or 5 star album. With repeated listenings the songs get repetitive, and sometimes even annoying.Original reviews of Ms. Gray had her in the company of Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone etc. etc. If she is going to be compared to these greats, I will hold her to the same standards, and I dont see that she measures up. I will be interested to hear her follow up when it comes out, with her instant fame, she could greatly improve, or attempt to produce \\"On How Life is, Volume II\\"... I'll be waiting, n the meantime I'll be listening to Billie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I was driving to work one day trying to figure out what to tell my little boy's father how I feel about him and I hear this song, I Try, and her words are what I've been feelng and I had to buy this cd, this girl has major talent I stll have not heard the whole cd, but I think it'll be a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, blah, blah","review":"I guess i'm the only one who didn't like this CD.

You can bash me all you want in your head for attacking a thing like that, but trust me, it's a big part of music...it's like listening to microphone feedback while turning up the bass so loud, it makes my intestines scrunch. The lyrics might be good, but I can't hear them. The only reason I give her 2 stars is because she tried. Well, she can't get anything positive from me. Sorry. And get a voice box operation...sure you have the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"MACY IS MESSY - OVERRATED TO Nth DEGREE","review":"totally disappointing. this was BY FAR the most disappointing CD ever bought... i don't know WHAT people are thinking. i mean i was dooped, i bought the CD cause i saw her live (live TV performance) and thought her whole thing was different and cool. i was only right about the first part. it weas NOT cool ubt rather a horrible WASTE of money. trust me, as a singer myself, i could easily have made a better album. it was a horrid waste of money and cd materials and time in studio. her voice is horrible & her songs are stupid and unlistenable.lmj"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Newcomer Title - Highly Deserved","review":"By listening to Macy's music alone , I was intrigued, but not sure that she'd earnt the above title . But after a visit to the Barber shop this weekend I'm left in no doubt - Macy is one a million, and she thoroughly deserves this title.A few of her tracks on the album have a very adult theme, and it's this style that was embraced in a recent interview with Q magazine - which I read whilst getting my hair cut . When asked what was the most unusual thing she'd done - Macy replied \\"I've tasted Myself\\" ! .... [Yea - \\"Best New-comer\\" - for real ] ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number One","review":"Macy Grays album has made a lasting impression on me that will never fade.

I recomened this album to all!Good luck Macy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be sad for me....","review":"I bought this album for the one song \\"I Try\\" and decided to give the whole CD a chance. From the first song \\"Why didn't you call me?\\" to the last song \\"The Letter\\" was a mixture of funky get your groove on songs to appreciative slow songs with an important message in the lyrics. Macy does have a unique voice in which she uses very creatively and draws the listener into her 'world.' You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A soulful, unique debut","review":"I have to say that there are few CDs I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track or two. I couldn't believe when I came to the end of this incredible CD because it came WAY to quickly! I love the jazz songstresses such as Ella, Billie, and Sassy and listen to them frequently...while Macy Gray has garnered many comparisons to them, I think she is in a league of her own. I can't stand cookie cutter voices or songs (I won't mention any names, but the radio waves are crammed with them) so she is a breath of fresh air. I'm hoping this decade will shape up with more original sounds such as Macy's and do away with the lackluster, sound-alike acts that are out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the hype","review":"The first song will funk your brains out, but it all goes downhill from there. Don't get me wrong here, there are some good grooves and sounds, and I think she is extremely talented, but this collection is just nothing special. Most of these songs bore me, and I find that the predominiately funky rhythms do not seem to mesh well with her voice and lyrical phrasing. I'd wait till her next one comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"As soulful as Aretha and as funky as Lauryn!","review":"By far one of the best cd's that I've heard in the past year and one that is destined to be a classic that everyone has in their collection! \\"On How Life is\\" kicks some serious tail and is a disc that you put in and listen to from beginning to end. It leaves you wishing there were more tracks to listen to...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Spell It Out For You: L-O-S-E-R!","review":"This CD is terrible! The only good song is \\"I Try\\" I can barely make it through \\"Still\\" and \\"I've Committed Murder\\" All her songs are very off color and in bad taste, though, I think. Definitely NOT for kids or anyone with any taste at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"I think this is a terrific funky, soulful album. Macy Gray has a unique style and voice, and she is a great songwriter. From the first time I heard \\"I Try\\" on the radio, I knew I had to get this album, and I was not at all disappointed. I enjoy every song on here, and I intend to buy her other albums. The 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and a centre pic of Macy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about it!","review":"With this CD Macy Gray makes a great argument for .... Only one song is worth listening to. Buy yourself a Big Mac and a Coke; it will be more memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"Basically, I thought that the song \\"I Try\\" was catchy. I listened to it a few times, it got old, and now I don't like it. I don't like any of the other songs either. That voice is just too weird for me. I think that the first single off her new album is all right, but I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macy Gray allows explicit lyrics to get in the way.","review":"The music on this record is down right funky. I hear bluesy grooves with a taste of Prince.The song Why Didn't You Call Me fits this category. The best track, and might I add, should be released as a single is, \\"A Moment To Myself\\" You and I know there are a lot of copy cats in the music industry. If R&B artists would immulate the funky sounds of Macy Gray, Rhythm & Blues would be alive again. However, MS.Gray's lyrics are offensive. For example, the song \\"Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak\\" says \\"Feels like an x x rated movie star\\" One more. The song \\"Caligula\\" says \\"Never lovin but we're always %**//?\\" While singing like a person with a depraved mind, Macy has enough nerve to dedicate a song to God on \\"I Can't Wait To Meetchu\\" If she really knew God, lyrics like the one's I've mentioned wouldn't be on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better :P","review":"Macy Gray is capable of much better!

This album is the worst piece of junk. The only O.K track on this C.D is Do Something. Macy has a really dreadful voice (like Satan!)Still is the most depresssing song ever. It makes me want to jump out of a window. Anyone who says this album is R n' B is crazy! If this album is R n' B, then it is a serious threat to the entire future of R n'B. Don't even listen to track no 3. It doesn't make any sense and is boring. A very dissapointing album.

The instrumentals and synthesizers and beat and vocals are god-awful-terrible. I think Macy can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's a voice coach when you need one!","review":"A friend of mine made a tape of this CD for my birthday. At that point, I had heard only \\"Do Something.\\" And Macy's voice to me was the equivalent of a really bad poison ivy rash. But my friend liked it (she compared her voice to Rickie Lee Jones) so I thought I'll have an open mind about the album. Musically, it's well-done. But my opinion on Macy Gray as a singer hasn't changed. As much as I liked the SONGS (especially \\"The Letter\\"), her voice drove me NUTS. She sounds like Kim Carnes on helium.\\"On How Life Is\\" had the potential to be a GREAT album, if someone else had been the vocalist. It's one thing to have a scratchy voice and can actually sing and emote (Rickie Lee, Erykah Badu) and another to have Macy, who simply cannot sing (she has no stage presence, either). And it's really too bad--how many amazing singers are out there who don't have record deals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"haha this is music?","review":"how can anyone call this music? her voice sounds like a female axel rose with a sore throat and a cracker lodged in her throat. dont buy this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The %#&@ Is This??!","review":"How long of a career do you think this funk diva will have, eh? I give her at the most, say, five years before she completely shreds her raspy sandpaper-on-broken glass voice. Will I celebrate? YES. Oh, to be rid of this monstrosity of a singer! Anyone who buys ANYTHING by Macy Gray does not deserve eardrums, because this ain't music, it's pure torture. What a waste of Vinyl Chloride!!! Excuse me, I just had to clear my throat.

Real soul, original singing style and easy to like with catchy tunes. It is one of those very rare LP's that you immediately fall in love with but you don't end up getting fed up with after 100 listens. If you thought the recent offerings from Mary J Blige and Lauryn Hill were great (and they were) this one will amaze you. BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am without speech!","review":"Finally someone is doing something different! R&B has been floundering of late, unable to deliver anything of even vague interest. I bought this CD wondering whether or not it could possibly live up to the hype. From the moment I slipped it into my CD player, I was completely mesmerized. This is a slap in your face, \\"look at me\\", awesome debut. Macy's voice is reminiscent of Billie Holiday, and the music, though a very '90s blend of different influences, is reminiscent of Sly Stone/Stevie Wonder/Bobby Womack/Curtis Mayfield among others. If you buy one CD this year, this is the one to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is the real Deal!","review":"I have to say that Macy is the first artist who captured my full attention in years. Here is talent that is still raw and powerful and hasn't been softened so that every teenager in the land will immediately understand it. On How Life Is is an album made by a woman for adults. Which is refreshing in the land of Brittney's and Christina's white bread music. I loved the album so much I went to see her while she was in Boston and all I can say is that if you find her music makes you move with its funky sounds and her raspy voice then you will love her live. Sensual is the best word to describe it. Its worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I bought this CD 3 days ago. I heard about that before, even tried to listen it a few times... . Now I've been listening to it non stop. \\"I try\\" and \\"Still\\" are stuck in mu head. The rest is also great. Macy has such a wierd voice. Something like E. Kitt or Edith Piaf. I love it but for some people it can be too much. But well, they should stick with Britney or Jennifer anyway. Cannot wait for more, Macy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macy And Her Life","review":"Macy Gray is a weird one. Her voice isn't exactly the most usual of vocal instruments, and her songs aren't the most average of sorts. Some are entirely filthy songs, like \\"Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak\\" and \\"Caligula\\", driven by dirty funk and raunchy lyrics, but then you can find a gospel track in \\"I Can't Wait To Meetchu\\". More traditional soul ballads, like her big hit \\"I Try\\" and the soulful longing of \\"Still\\" and grinding funk tracks like \\"Do Something\\" and \\"Why Didn't You Call Me\\" are peppered around the unusual, the most unsual being a track about the murder of a boyfriend's boss on \\"I've Committed Murder\\" and rejoyceful suicide note tune \\"The Letter\\". It's an unusual collection from an unusual woman, and it's great. A wonderfully fun debut record."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Debut","review":"This has go to be one of the best debut albums thiis yesr. I had heard of the single I Try and i liked it but i wasnt sure about the al bum so i talked a friend into buying it, after repeated listenings i had to go out and buy the album for myself it was that good. With songs like I Try, Still, Ive Committed Murder, Do Something and Why Didnt You Call me, this is an album worth listening to even if its just round a friends"},{"rating":"2","title":"If all artists were like Macy Gray","review":"This has got to be one of the best debut albums ever. Gray's lyrics and voice are solid. Her \\"raspy\\" voice quietly reminds one of Billie Holliday, yet Gray has a style all her own. Track #3 will make you want to keep dancing -- this is a great CD for parties, in the car, wherever! If all artists were like Macy, we'd have a tough time choosing who'd win a Grammy. I highly recommend this Cd if you enjoy artists such as Maxwell and Lauryn Hill. Full of funk and energy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eartha Kitt meets Donald Duck","review":"After two tracks, Macy Gray's voice became irritating.

I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"...not so innovative.","review":"I didn't like this CD. Compared to JILL SCOTT, LEDISI or ERYKAH BADU, Macy Gray seems to me like a \\"pop\\" singer instead of an RnB/Soul queen...and then \\"that\\" voice too, some people may like it and some people don't, but what is true is that she sounds to me like my 85 year old gramma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Macy!","review":"I first saw Macy Gray on The Rosie O'Donnell show this past week and had to have the CD.

A definate buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is...","review":"Macy Gray puts out a steller performance on her first album.

How could anyone compare her to true sirens such as Aretha Franklin? It pains me how some people really like to confuse garbage with art, or talk themselves into liking this CD in order to jump on the bandwagon.

After hearing \\"I Try\\" on Felicity, and then all of the buzz about Macy Gray and her album here lately, I went ahead and bought it today. Big mistake! HUGE! The ONLY redeeming quality this CD has is \\"I Try.\\" I like that song, but in the context of the album it doesn't sound so good. I found Gray's lyrics to be offensive (after a few different songs about \\"getting high\\"-or with a reference to it-I'd had more than enough, not to mention the sexuality spoken of-ugh!) and I cannot BELIEVE people like this waste of an album. Save your money, don't waste it on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macy Gray is a lot like a cheetah","review":"Cheetahs are known for explosive bursts of speed that are unsustainable for much more than a few minutes. That's how I see Macy Gray. This album starts off soul-filled, firey tunes that make you think \\"What a badass!\\". And even the most cynical of listeners can't help but be reeled in by the poignant ballad \\"I try\\". However, Macy takes a turn for the worst when she goes the \\"Sex-o-Matic Venus Freak\\" route. C'mon. A more vulgar display of trite lyrics hasn't been seen since Green Day. This girl will not last. She's a Mariah Carey in Lauren Hill clothing. You'll have fun for a few listens and then lose interest until you see her pitifully performing on MTV Spring Break. Save yourself the shame and pass on Macy Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried...","review":"Two Stars for the CD, but Ten Stars for \\"I Try\\".I bought this CD because of the wonderfully smoky sounds of \\"I Try\\" and then I was disappointed to find that to be the only song worth listening to.I have a young child in the house, and profanity in music that I have personally selected is completely inappropriate. So, I have already resold this CD, but I look forward to giving this gifted musician another chance. Maybe once she grows up a little she'll also grow into her talent and make choices that will ultimately make her far more successful than in the limiting arena she has currently chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"I fail to understand what is so amazing about her.

Macy Gray manages to bring her own sound to the masses (something often claimed, but rarely proven) not since Nirvana and Alanis has a CD sounded so UNLIKE anything else on the market.

She truly knows \\"How Life Is\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT CD!","review":"When I bought this CD, I really wasn't sure how I would like it. I felt stupid to be buying a CD for one song (I Try), and even worse once I had listened to it! I usually listened to stuff like Mariah, BNL and Britney Spears-MAcy Gray didn't seem to fit into any of my \\"normal\\" categories. But then I started to really listen and love it! She has such a unique voice and singing style-there's no substitute for her! Her songs are SO catchy, but not in an annoying My favorite songs are: (of course) I Try, I've Committed Murder, Caligula, and Why Didn't U call me?. However, the reason this CD isn't geting 5 stars is because of the more annoying songs, like The Letter and Still. But give this album a chance! It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Debut From a Real Artist","review":"What an icredible album that continues to stun, invite and absorb with each listen. And what a debut recording! How many others except perhaps Barbra Streisand, Carole King, Tracy Chapman and Allanis Morrisette have put out incredible stuff of this standard in their first outing? So groovy and funky you could lose yourself in this cd. 'Do Something' and 'Still' are standaouts for me among many wonderful and fresh tracks. Think Billie Holliday meets Carol Channing on cra**, with a touch of Lenny Kravitz, Al Green and Gladys Knight thrown in for good measure.

I see that people who bought this album also bought \\"Music from the Movies \\" , maybe they'd get a pleasant surprise by buying an album with less hype, but more soul, such as \\"Black Diamond\\" by Angie Stone . Sure Angie uses samples from Gladys Knight, Marvin Gaye and others, but she sings without a frog in her throat, and I quite like that in an artist ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPE! HYPE! HYPE!","review":"She has been compared to Billie Holliday, Aretha, etc. After listening this cd I only can say that her voice/songs are annoying, boring and disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, and not the next big thing","review":"This by far is the most overated CD of the year, Macy Gray's voice is just annoying, and she doesn't right her own music(just lyrics) so she is is not as talented as everyone thinks she is. She doesn't come close to Me'shell Ndechello, Dionne Farris or Lauryn Hill. I TRY is the only song that can hold me teenage attention span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous on CD, Breathtaking LIVE!","review":"I was introduced to Macy by a friend, and she definately grew on me. I had a chance to see her in concert, and it blew me away. This woman has talent and has an amazing voice. If you ever have the chance to see her live...hold on to your seat. (Actually, you better not be in a seat because you will want to boogie! ) Sex-o-matic is so full of energy! All I can say is BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a category (almost)...","review":"Here it is: Take JJ Cale, mix in some Portis Head, and a pinch of Beasty Boys and you got a category that I can't seem to find a name for. Macy Gray is hot (and cool)."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Did Something, Alright...She Made a Great CD!","review":"First off, Macy Gray almost defies categorizing. I expected an Erykah Badu-type CD, but instead got a very pleasant surprise. Don't expect Lauryn Hill, either. This is music ala Atlantic Records circa 1968. In other words, this is actually MUSIC! Ms. Gray has created her own sound reminiscent of the good ole days without actually lifting the sounds of the good ole days.The fabulous \\"Do Something\\" is surrounded by other songs equally as good. Some of Macy's songs have a humorous touch--\\"Why Didn't You Call\\" and \\"I've Committed Murder\\", for instance. And, while she has a point of view, it doesn't seem as if she's hard-core out to bludgeon world with it. You will not be disappointed by her if you enjoyed \\"The Commitments Soundtrack\\", Joan Osbourne, Prince (back in the day), or if you've been searching for some sweet soul music with a little blues and ska thrown in for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This Cd is highly recommended by me! Macy Gray writes all her own songs and all of the songs on this album are great. \\"Why Didn't You Call Me\\" has a funky beat and it's one of the best on the album. \\"Do Something\\" is another funky song, and it has great background music. \\"Caligula\\" is funny and dancy. \\"I Try\\" is a really good ballad. \\"Sexomatic Venus Freak\\" is weird, but really good. \\"I Can't Wait To Meetchu\\" is one of the album's 3 best songs. \\"Still\\" is sad and another great ballad. \\"I've Committed Murder\\" is interesting and funky once more. \\"Moment To Myself\\" is happy, groovy and has a good chorus. \\"The Letter\\" is #2, it's a GREAT song. I highly recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole CD \\"How Life Is\\"","review":"I fell for Macy the first time I heard her. Love her voice, but I think she's more a cross of Billy Holiday and Janis Joplin. Memories........"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE 10 SONGS MAKE YOU BEG FOR MORE","review":"With all the music that is out now, Macy Gray has broken the mold. This cd is probably one of the best cd's out there. Her voice is definitely unique, which is something that is needed this day in age. Sure Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, and Britney Spears are popular, but it's all an act -- a three ring circus. Macy Gray does not have huge spectacles of shows, she doesn't have 6 dancers at her side, but her voice makes up for that. From the first song \\"Why Didn't you Call Me\\" to her final descent \\"The Letter\\", Macy takes you on a magical journey into the adventures and mishaps in her life. If you have a taste for new music and originality, definitely buy this album. I was disappointed that there are only 10 songs on this album, and I can't wait until she releases another. For anyone who is a fan of Macy, I would definitely recommend you buying the import singles of \\"I Try\\" and \\"Still\\". There are some awesome remixes and acoustic versions of \\"I Try\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Unbelievable","review":"This is the only scenario I can think of that can account for Macy Gray... She's the illegitimate child of a union between Little Esther Phillips and George Clinton, adopted and raised by Anne Peebles and Al Green and schooled by Chaka Khan. If you don't go crazy over this album, you're dead! Definite album of the year!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Though not all that known, quite worth the $$","review":"This CD is one of the best I've heard in a while. With her unique voice and funky music, Macy Gray brings the sound of Billie Holiday's voice and twists it into the modern day with her catchy sound. I suggest everyone in need of a great-sounding CD get this pronto! Suggested tracks: I Try and Why Didn't You Call Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"Sorry, but Macy Gray doesn't cut it. Her voice wears on you after a while, like scratching your fingernails across a blackboard. Her music is definately overplayed on the radio, which doesn't help much. Does she only sing when she has a head cold? She sounds like she does........."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending Is Not Obvious","review":"One of the prior reviews stated that the ending was obvious in the first ten minutes; must have written the script.There are very few romantic drama/comedies where the two characters part in anything like this way, nor does the illness of the Theron character get revealed until the middle of the film. Certainly, the approach of the Theron character to her life is very unusual.Several of the reviewers noted that SF is beautifully photographed, almost perfectly photographed, to match the moods of the film. I agree.I've watched it about four times, and probably will watch it several more times. The film's mix just works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly well played and though out","review":"This is perhaps one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, because it is very sad and its a movie that makes you think about how much life has to offer and how one day everything can slip away. It also brings out the point that death and life comes and goes but love is everlasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you ever find yourself trapped on a plane","review":"you might just find yourself watching this. It was neither good nor bad. It's one of those movies that you won't feel you missed anything if you don't see it. Charlize Theron is an extremely talented actress, but I'd rather see her in interesting roles like in The Devil's Advocate. Keanu Reeves is still just another pretty face. This movie is not especially original (see: Love Story and Autumn in New York) nor exceptionally well acted, although Chaz (downstairs neighbor) and the kid whose name escapes me are great characters. The plane landed before I could see the end, and I dozed off somewhere in the middle, but I really don't think I missed anything. If you're looking for a tear jerker, rent Legends of the Fall or Last of the Mohicans. The stories are much more interesting and at least Brad Pitt and Daniel Day Lewis are pretty boys with acting talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not such a great movie","review":"i watched this awhile ago and don't remember much; just that i was feeling quite unsatisfied upon leaving the theater, and felt the movie had wasted its potential. the only great part of the movie was enya's \\"only time\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"The worst movie I saw this year. Completely implausible the way the characters evolve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Agony","review":"As bad as the cover suggests, \\"Sweet November\\" is not really a movie but a long soap-opera episode featuring Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron and a bland Enya soundtrack (yup, Enya. Sounds good, huh?). Essentially a cliched, tiresome and utterly tedious romance, this corny chick flick manages to deliver two or three decent scenes (mostly due to the solid Thero performance) and a lot of uninteresting tearjerker moments that drag endlessly. As entertainment this effort just falls flat, and as food for though it\`s equally inane and useless. Nothing new or exciting here, I\`m afraid, but I can\`t say I\`m surprised.Insipid and forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak...","review":"I'm not one of those people who has a problem with Keanu's acting. And I'm a pretty big fan of Charlize Theron, but this movie was pretty bad with a really bad ending. You can watch it if you want, but it's not really worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very obvious!","review":"I know lots of people liked this movie but, I for one did not. It was very obvious within the first 10 minutes of this movie that you would know how it was going to end. I don't know who pared up Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron but, they make a lousy couple. They just don't click together. There is no chemistry there. I would recomend renting this one first before thinking about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who can tell.......","review":"I have actually watched this film 6 straight times! Because the storyline and performances were so great? NO WAY!! Just the opposite! I watched it so many times so I could see the music credits at the end! I knew that Enia sang a number that the lyrics contained the title of this review. I guess I'll have to stop this review and watch the movie a SEVENTH time, because I still haven't nailed down the title of the song. One thing that Sweet November did accomplish though was that it preempted a 2005 remake of Love Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable -- Another Keanu Comedy Classic!!!","review":"As in The Devil's Advocate, Keanu Reeves in Sweet November tries to play a talented professional who has reached the top of his profession, in this case a successful but heartless advertising executive. To suggest that Reeves is in over his head is to understate the situation. The man simply cannot make me believe that he has anything like an I.Q. His big Hot Dog Advertising Campaign Presentation is one of the funniest scenes in movie history, mainly because one can sense that Keanu is working so very very hard and is failing so very very badly. It is hysterically funny, just like Elizabeth Berkley's big dramatic tantrums in Showgirls. It should be common knowledge by now: Keanu Reeves cannot act. He cannot act. He cannot act.Sweet November is a silly little bit of romance that is lifted straight into high-camp heaven, just by casting the inept Keanu Reeves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Keanu pick his roles?","review":"Myself and a couple of my college buddies were watching tv the other day and on was Sweet November. Of course we have heard of this film before, but it most certainly did not intrigue any of us. Yet, this time was different, Keanu was the worst he has ever been. There seemed to be nothing behind his eyes, just nothing. Does Keanu pick his own roles, or just the ones he thinks are really not for him. Theron does an ok job in this flim, but she is no Monster. Well, i would suggest never watching this movie, unless your significant other states that they must see it. I mean...my college friends sat through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty to Sandy Dennis and the original movie","review":"Only someone who has never seen the original could like this flick. It takes a wonderful bittersweet story and butchers it. No comparison. Whereas the original is full of surprises and has you rooting for things to work out somehow, and leaves you heartbroken, this slop has nothing to offer except to note that Charlize Theron sure is a looker! Oh, and Keanu Reeves sure is boring. Two thumbs and two big toes down. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"Don't pass on this sweet, sentimental chick flick.It got all the goods: good acting, charming, sad mysteriousstory, lost love, found love, search for meaning.Scenic location San Francisco. Don't forget the tissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet November","review":"Movie is very entertaining and touching. Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are very good in their roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its moments, but otherwise, yikes.","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the guy that plays Luscious Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies, and the guy that plays Lex Luthor on \\"Smallville\\" play a gay couple. They're freakin' hilarious, but otherwise this is terrible. Keanu Reeves trying to be sensitive and romantic is every bit as frightening as you might imagine. He should go back to being Ted Theodore Logan."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet....","review":"THE MOVIE WAS DELIGHTFUL... IT HAD ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS, OF A GOOD LOVE STORY. A YOUNG MAN WHO IS SO INDULGED IN HIS LIFE, COMES A ACROSS AN COLLECTIC YOUNG WOMAN, AND SHE CHANGES HIS LIFE 4 EVER. ITS DELCIOUSLY INTERSTING, AND KEEPS YOU ENTICED. IT IS A TEAR JREAKER, BUT GREAT PLOT. WONDERULLY DIRECTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"realy sweet!","review":"maybe 5 stars, but before I saw the movie a stupid magazine wrote how it ended.

But it had to for the movie I guess that's what made it good!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This movie was REALLY awful. SOOO boring, bad plot and didn't really make sense. It was just really strange. My husband and I both hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet sleep ...","review":"The best thing about this movie is that it finally finished and got me out of my insomnia spell. It was stupid and boring at the begining and so it didn't hold my interest enough to stay awake through the rest of it. Don't rush out to watch this - that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlize is sooooo annoying!!!","review":"Charlize tries to be a sweet girl but actually she is annoying in the movie, harassing peoples like that and convincing that she wants to help, playing a Polyanna role. Please! Keanu doesn't seems that terrible, actually I found him so normal, he got a life, she doesn't and try to convince him that he is abnormal. Besides, she dress like a homeless, those gloves, scarfs, really vulgar. What peoples saw in her to even consider her sexy? She is plain skinny, no curves. In the movie she sounds as annoying as the leading lady in Legally Blondie 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question:","review":"Could you please tell me how Keanu Reeves hoists a diswasher over his shoulder in a goodie bag (with other items), hauls it up an fire escape and gets it through a window?If your don't care about logic like this, then this is your movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sleeper","review":"This is one of the worst movies that I've ever had to watch. It was utterly boring, and I'd say that there was not a single redeeming quality. Not a single scene that I even kinda enjoyed, and Charlize Theron didn't even have her A-game in this flick. Sickly, dying Charlize is not as fun as lively, vibrant, sexy Charlize. Keanu was as bland and lifeless as ever, and not even in a good way. Not a single moment in this movie was worth capturing on film. Not entirely the fault of the actors or director, because the material (writing) was awful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the original","review":"I guess my title is basically all I have to say about this movie. The original was wonderful. This is just pale by comparison. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be 2 stars - but I'm in awe","review":"This movie is a little treacle-y - as the Brits would say - or sickingly sweet as the US says. But I gave it 4 stars as I was stunned at how gorgeous Charlize Theron is in the first half. I just read that this version is a remake of the original film made in 1968 with Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley. I'll have to watch that - but, boy, Charlize Theron ......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet november (not Spanish Subtitled)","review":"I liked the expedited serviced, but what I didnt like was that this movie wasn't well described in all of their features. I ordered the movie as a gift for someone else, hoping that it included subtitles in Spanish, but that wasn't specified in the general review at Amazon's (in fact, it didn't specified what the languajes of the subtitles were, as all of the movies reviewed at Amazon's).I really would like to know, for future purchases, that the movies listed were rated at all of their features, specifically of the languajes of their subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite movies!","review":"I love this movie, it's one of my favorite! I rented it first, but then decided that I want to have this movie and decided to buy DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as original movie","review":"This modern version is easier to get than the original. Same storynline but the actors here soften the story and make it easier to empathize with. Keanu is brilliant and young lady very very real. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised...","review":"I was referred to this movie because of my love for Jason Isaacs but at the same time I fell into the storyline and the characters. I know that a lot of the story was unrealistic but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. I was really rooting for Nelson and Sara and was so saddened that it had to end so tragically, can there ever be a love story without a sad ending? It is sad to me that love stories always end sadly.I still have to say that Jason Isaacs took my breath away with his performance of Chaz, the friendly gay cross-dresser friend of Sarah. I have followed his career as of recent since falling in love with him in Harry Potter but this took me as a surprise. He makes for a lovely looking man but makes an utterly ugly woman.So over all, worth it and Ron thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I've never seen the original movie, but I saw this one and OMG it made me cry!, just so sweet, enjoyably and perfect!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Love!!!","review":"Probably one of the sweetest and saddest love stories I have seen in a long time. Loved watching it 4 times. Will watch 4 more. You will laugh and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT, THINK YOU WILL TOO!","review":"This movie has a sweetness and softness that I love but it still has some laughs and irony. It is a nice mixture which also includes tears and as a whole it is a movie that I do recommend. Romanticism is definitely the main ingredient. Charlize Theron has a wonderful portrayal, not usual with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like Tear-Jerkers...","review":"If you like sad movies then this is the best one yet. Not only is it one of the saddest movies I've ever seen but also one of the best. It has a little comedy in it and it it almost reminds me of Dharma & Greg except for this is a much more realistic, emotional version. Charlize Theron is fantastic but I dont think Keanu Reeves and her really match up. But, in other matters this is a must-see for anyone who has a tissue box on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry: Can't relate to it...","review":"When we got this movie, my initial thought was: \\"Let's get ready to watch a 'chick-flick',\\" if you know what I mean. So I set myself in the \\"Bounce\\" or \\"Automn in New York\\" type-of-mode. For a while, I have to say, it caught my attention, and I was even happy to see Keanu Reeves deliver such a performance (improving on some of his dramatic performances from before). But, I couldn't relate to the concept of the movie as a whole: there's not a clear point as to why she has decided to face life the way she does (this, in my opinion, is one of the biggest flaws of the movie), but worst even, is the incomprehensible ending... I will not ruin it, but believe me: when you're done watching it, you'll go like: \\"OK... What on earth just happened??\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous","review":"You see, my son landed a bit part in that movie. I could watch it over and over as he is now having trouble in his life. He played the part of the big brother organizer. He was so thrilled to be able to do this. He was discovered in a restaurant where he worked as a bartender. The next thing he knew he was on his way to Hollywood where, like so many others, had his dreams dashed and heart broken. I think he could have done a better job than Mr. Reeves but that is a mother speaking.The movie? Well, I live near San Francisco, and love it as if it were a lover.

The Gershwins were the song- writing team supreme, and there is no one who tops the music of George. Put them together and you not only swing, you lilt and coo, and stomp and woo.Ella can do it all with a lyric, and the pure tone of her voice brings out the essence of that musical freshness , that bright beauty which is the signature sound of young roaring twenties America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Andreaasen","review":"Andreaasen does a poor job of describing the genius of creativity. The presentation is not anecdotal or interesting though she does choose interesting people to profile like John Nash and August Kekule. She misses an opportunity to delve into the bipolar aspects of creativity and to identify bipolarity as a characteristic of many richly creative people. Overall this is a disappointing and poor read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Reading","review":"This book was a boring reading. It didn't stand the author's distinguished career nor as a good science writing. It may help to educate very novices on brain science as a whole. But it failed to give a solid answer to its main premise - where does the creativity lie in brain's multivaried structure. This book though gives some very important examples from extremely creative people's experiences, \\"moments of epiphanies\\". It mentions what Mozart, Poincare or similar person's description of their individual feelings when they were on the verge of some creative thought. On the whole this books failed to explain how and why geniuses are geniuses, but has not forgotten to mention that the author herself was a genius (at least twice in the book).

The 7.2M pixels, video with audio, etc., seemed to be a good package. I also like the fact that the camera appears as just another drive when connected to a computer (i.e., it appears in Windows Explorer in the same way as a USB memory stick).After using it for a while I slowly got disappointed how often the camera misses a focus. When you shoot an easy target (a landscape or a face) then the camera just works fine. When you have more difficult situations (try close-up of flowers or multiple art objects placed at various distances on a table) the images are often out of focus.I'm also not very happy that almost everything is special: I understand that you cannot use AAA-size rechargeable batteries (they are too big for this camera) but why has the USB connector be so odd?

It is super easy to use and I began taking pictures before even reading the instructions. Everything is easily figured with the easy to use menus. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is I don't like that you have to remove the battery to recharge it. It would have been nice to have a docking sort of feature.

They have ice skating, rollerblading, and let me say, it's cool. Now I wouldn't recommend this for someone who gets really hung up on games and gets [mad] very easily(like me). But anyway, it has new characters and you can go to any level you want, that is if you passed it already. Some of the settings are his village, the wilderness, Snowy mountains, Volcanoes, and much more.

YOU SHOULD GET IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"Fan of pac Man or not-this game shall be worth your while!I thought that this game was going to be cheezy, since it involved pacman and wondered how Namco could pull this off. I was wrong. This game kicked ass! The Graphics are not that bad, close to being the best. 3-D pacmam never looked good. The game gets addictive fast, but it isnt the graphics that get hardcore fans wild. Here is a game that is easy to beat(Too easy I should say) and you don't have to throw your controller across the room in frustration. This game is in fact easy enough that I think this game was made for children. But don't let that stop you from buying it. Also, the game was too short and the bossess were harder then the some three levels combined. Spooky, being the last boss, was pretty easy compared to the rest.

An absurdly ridiculous movie, not funny, and hardly anything made any sense. Maybe I was expecting a kinda 'Jurassic Park' or 'Lost World' with some funny characters thrown in to the mix, but men in cheap monkey costumes, a T-Rex with scooby-do type slap stick expressions, and no plausible plot, I did not expect. Ok , the two seconds that the monkey suited man fondled Anna Friels' breasts were....but, I digress. All in all, probably the worst movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect the same thing as the show","review":"This is really nothing like the fun show of the 70's. The only thing similar are the idea of going back in time, dinosaurs, the character names only. The rest has been transformed into modern day sexual and bathroom humour.Remember years ago when special effects played secondary to a good script? This isn't years ago.If it's one thing I miss is just how funny comics were in the past without resorting to potty humor.If you take this an do not compare it tothe actual show, it's an ok time waster movie. But if you put them both side by side, what a disappointment this movie really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dumb it does not even make sense","review":"Will Ferrel has a knack for turning a great idea for a comedy into an utterly stupid movie. This remake of the old classic is a perfect example. Mr. Ferrel plays a mad scientist in this movie, one who builds a machine that can take him to another dimension that fuses different times and places in earth's history. He has two unwitting fellows on his trip, a nerdish groupie played by Ann Friel and an unknown actor playing a redneck with some good intuition and common sense. The three of them have a hell of a trip that blows the bounds of knowledge and logic. And like any typical Ferrell movie, we have toilet humor, scenes with dangerous animals, narcotics, weird foods, and other props found in a slapstick comedy. But some scenes were just too dumb, like the part when Ferrell's character passes thru the digestive tract of a T-Rex, and comes out with his hair in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad movie","review":"hi Hate this remakewhy did they bother making this movieif they we're not going to do itright. thank god i only watched it on hboi am so glad i didn't buy itTerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad fit.","review":"Aside from the fact the comedy itself is bad my main beef with this movie is that LOTL is supposed to be a scifi genre.

Hopefully someday a remake that does justice to the series will be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condemned to \\"The Land of the Lost\\"","review":"A true disappointment. Maybe it's because I don't appreciate this type of sense of humor, but I really thought this was a disaster from the get-go. It was much like a made-for-cable movie, but I've seen much better in that genre. With its sexual overtones and Chaka constantly grabbing Holly's boobs, this misses the boat for the family as well. It earns \\"1\\" star for some of the special effects...definitely not for the script or acting. This flick is eternally condemned to the \\"Land of the Lost\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...No!","review":"Will Ferrell's humor can go so far. He's fine as a support character in bits and spurts, but to carry a film of a self-proclaimed classic tv (children's) show is biting more off than it can chew. The special efffects and production values are great, but the comedy tone for this type of film doesn't mesh and Will Ferrell's comic character and he doesn't gel with the rest of the serious-toned characters. This movie bombed on it's initial release because it was up against the superior THE HANGOVER. However, it would have bombed even if it had been released if no other movie was released in any given weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative five stars","review":"This has to be one of the worst shows I have seen in years. I bought it on sale thinking if it is only rental worthy I did not spend to much more then that to own it. Bad idea, it is not even worth the rental/PPV fee. I don't consider Will Ferrell to be a good actor at all but I had high hopes that this would be at least a B movie given the shows roots from a 70's series, it is not, it was a total waste of time to watch it.

This was the worst film of the summer. I am a HUGE Land of the Lost fan and this was not what fans wanted. It was not what anyone wanted. It was sophomoric, crude, and indicative of all the grist mill garbage that is spewed out of Hollywood these days. With such a big budget and a loyal fan base this film should have been a great nod to the original show. Rather what we got was a nod to ridiculousness. The original show, if anyone cared to watch it, has some very intelligent plot lines and was quite creepy. Will Ferrell went through the intestines of a T-Rex. Comon?Any execs reading this? The film was terrible. Hire some real writers next time to bring a serious version of this to the screen. This could have been the best thing since the Matrix.

Its one of those comedies where every single spoken line is funny in itself, not like many comedies where you have to wait for a series of lines to come out before you get to anything worth laughing at or where the action scene is the funny part. Year One is like that two. Funny how neither film got much for Hollywood reviews and movie critics and it never got a lot of buzz heading into the theaters. That probably says more about published movie critics than how good those two movies are."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to the Original Series","review":"The original series was a cool Saturday morning sci-fi show that the whole family could enjoy.

Let me start with some pithy one-word descriptions: awful, terrible, dreadful, tasteless, offensive, abominable, horrid, atrocious, appalling. There must be more, but I've run out of adjectives for the moment.What I really can't understand is why anyone would make a movie for kids (PG-13 is still in that category), which includes so many explicit sexual references (masturbation, oral sex, and so on). It certainly isn't funny for adults, and kids either won't get it, or if they do, will merely be made uncomfortable. (They will look at you with that special expression that means, \\"How am I supposed to react to this?\\" You will not be laughing, which will give them a hint.)In short, this film had no redeeming qualities whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so very sad","review":"I watched the remake series of Land of the Lost when I was a kid and loved the series, and later I watched the original as reruns on tv land.

I knew the moment I saw the advertisments for this movie that it was going to be bad. Especially when it was announced that it would star Will Farrel. At that point I knew that this movie was going to be nothing more than stupid jokes aimed at making fun of the original shows.So glad I avoided going to see this in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numerous tobacco images resulted in as many as 125 million impressions.","review":"Hollywood studios know about the research linking on-screen tobacco imagery with youth smoking rates, yet they continue to produce G, PG and PG-13 movies that promote smoking!

It seems most of these classic shows are sadly spoofed instead the could have made a good sci-fi film rather than a so-so comedy. The movie was filled mostly with slap-stick comedy and sexual inuendos hardly bringing credit to the original show. It was more about seeing how funny Will Ferral can be again rather than how good of a story could have been made. I knew this would be the case so is why I waited so long to rent it. Its a shame as they could have done so much better and paid greater homage to a classic that many liked watching every Saturday morning as kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Hilarious","review":"This movie is hilarious. I rented it two days before Christmas Eve when everything else was already out. I laughed until I cried. I knew then I had to add it to my movie collection.

Perfect movie for a night in with the wife and teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lets just turn it into a comedy, yeah, that will make big bucks right?","review":"There is something about Hollywood's relentless drive to take any old script from a somewhat serious 70's children's show and turn it into a comedy. Gosh knows why. Lack of imagination? Lack of drive? I mean, if you really took the effort to take a show like the land of the lost and make it into a serious movie it would certainly generate lots of money for those who grew up in that era and would watch it purely for the nostalgia. Sigh, anyway, Hollywood has their own version of mathematics: turn a fun, nostalgic kids show from the 70's into a comedic pile of garbage and alienate the fans and ruin the franchise potential and loose a couple of million dollars and then scratch their heads and say \\"gosh, why didnt that work\\". Simply put, dont watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie I have ever seen!","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever watched. I did not even finish watching it because it was so bad. If I could have given this movie 0 (or less) stars I would.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE WILL FERRELL!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"But this movie was BAD! I loved Land of the Lost when I was a young, easy to please youth but if this movie was meant to duplicate that series or even to mock it in a funny way; then it was a poor job. I even finished watching it, forcing myself to do so like a child forcing down their vegetables. I feel two regrets as of this moment. 1.) I hate to give such a rotten review to a movie whose star actor is someone I admire. 2.)

Its uncertain what \\"genius\\" thought turning the Land of the Lost kids show into a comedy was a good idea. The premise was ripe for a good action-adventure. Instead, Hollywood gave us a comedy based on a script that seems to have been written by a couple of 12 year olds. If you're a legal adult, you're about five years above the most clever bits of humor. The rest is just pathetic. In fact, its worse.The visual effects and acting are both adequate but haphazad. Those are truly the only positives you can say about this film. I saw a couple reviews saying you have to \\"open your mind\\" to enjoy this film.

Their dialogue is hilarious, and they execute their jokes well. These two actors are the film's saving grace.The bad: The sets are both modern and retro. Some special effects are great, while others look like they were stolen from the original TV series. I'm sure the campiness is deliberate, but it just feels weird when combined with more modern special effects.The ugly: The film can't make up its mind. It's like they wanted to make a film that attracted adults but was still suitable for kids. The result is that they ended up somewhere in the middle - too much adult language and jokes to make it appropriate for kids, yet not enough substance to appeal to teens and adults.The film ultimately fails because it tried to make a modern adult version of an old kids show, and it was a half-hearted attempt. If you're a diehard Will Ferrell fan, you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech. Will Ferrel movies continue to get worse and worse...","review":"Remember when Will Ferrel used to be funny? I do. What happened? Will he just agree to do any movie that comes his way no matter how witless it is? This movie is a dog. All of the humor is crude and unimaginative, and if you were ever a fan of the original series, you will likely be turned off by this dull \\"comedic\\" reinvention of the Saturday morning classic.

Sure the effects look pretty good with some nice dinosaurs and the Sleestaks, but the jokes that work are few and far between. If not for Ferrell, I don't think I would have laughed at all. Not only is the film bland, but it doesn't even know who its audience is, with some jokes that are very juvenile and others that are crude and may not be suitable for younger viewers.

Primitive film for primitive people."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happend to good movies?","review":"this movie was just like the first one...raunchy and tasteless and pathetic. the first one had its moments of great humor but this one was a remake with more dumb sub plots.I watched the movie and realized these were absolutley perfect looking teens who went off to college and did the exact same thing they did while in high school which was to go to keg parties and try to stick their d***s into as many girls as possible. I pray American Wedding is the last of this god awful series of party movies. Although this movie may be a good educational tape for parents and may promote good advice: dont send your kids into college, make em go into the military and learn some discipline cause thats what our generation needs today! And a shout out to the makers of American Pie, Loser, Road Trip, How to Deal and so on: stop making these awful movies! your making my generation look bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Stupid it is so funny","review":"Sometimes I just need a really stupid movie for the laugh factor. This movie is valuble for that. It does have a plot. It is not one the religious sect would like because it is packed full of sex and sex references. So this is not for you. If you just want a laugh this is good. The first one is good too. I am not a teen perhaps if I was one I would think this is a classic of my time, but no I am from the breakfast club generation. this was just a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel","review":"American Pie 2's story line was good. The story picks up after the first year of college. Like many have encountered after the first summer after college many new things occur and many things that do not change. The beach house is the scene for wild scenes and good laughs. What AM2 does do that many other sequels do as well is the repetitive bug. The shock/funny appeal is still there in some scenes, but it isn't like the original. Still, though the movie is entertaining enough and with several gut wrenching scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Pie 2 (2001)","review":"American Pie 2 starts out about a year after the original American Pie ended. Jim, Kevin, Finch, Stifler, and Oz have all returned home for the summer after finishing their first year of college. They don't really have a good place to party, so they decide to rent a summerhouse on the beach, and decide to cap off the end of summer with a huge bash.Most of the cast from the original returns. While there aren't too many jokes here we haven't already seen, but the movie itself is pretty entertaining. Highlights include the lesbian scene, and Jim's superglue incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far too funny!","review":"Well, I have to say that this was one of the funniest movies that I've seen in a very long time. The humor in the sequel is a bit different from the original in that there's a lot more physical humor (slapstick style), but I thought that it made the movie just as funny, if not funnier than the original. The sequel also seems to have a lot more thought put in it than the first - the plot seems a bit deeper (yeah, i know, go to american pie if you want a deep plot, right?) - at least a bit more mature than the first one. But hey, they've grown up a little, so we expect that from them right. And hey, Stiffler's mom makes another cameo! I think it was totally worth seeing, and I've already bought the DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Only Is The Movie Good....","review":"I think we've all established that American Pie 2 is really funny, although not as rip-roaringly original as the first. It's pure slapstick - jokes, and that's all cool for the demographic it's pointed at. But most impressive of all on this DVD is, suprizingly, the commentary.The commentary (namely the first one) is absolutely great. It's in-depth and extremely funny. You learn stuff that you never could from just watching the movie and it makes you laugh.AmPie 2 is a great DVD. Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrated? Where's the extra stuff?","review":"Quite honestly, after seeing the \\"unrated\\" version of the first movie (the pie scene's a /bit/ different, for those that don't know, among a few other things), I honestly don't see a whole lot different about this one over the original movie (though I honestly haven't compared them side-by-side); perhaps a slight bit more nudity, but... *shrug*In any case, this is a GREAT movie that can easily stand on its own without the first (though it does nicely continue the series with all your favorite characters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I'm still in complete awe of this movie.

Of course that's not to say that this film was stodgy and overly mature, in fact it had plenty of Juvenile humor, but I felt that the characters were slightly more mature.Of course, it had its fair share of unbelievable situations, but that's part of the fun of a teen movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cashing in","review":"American Pie 2 is more of the same, but in this case that is all I wanted. I liked the first one enough that a second \\"helping\\" was warranted in my eyes. It's all awkward situations and insane predicaments that only the most clumsy or insane would get involved in. The whole cast returns as was probably written in their contracts for the first one. The \\"gross-out\\" humor is in full-effect, but it isn't as flagrantly rancid as the first one. But bodily fluids still play a prominent role. It's funny and entertaining throughout, with a few memorable one-liners. The plot isn't as strong as the first one, it plays out just as a summer filled with sex and mischief with no point which isn't really a problem I guess. The one extremely troubling thing is that it seems the studio really wanted to sell a soundtrack or two, so many scenes have music playing over them so loud that took me out of movie completely, but it's a minor gripe. You know what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a classic and on Blu-ray!","review":"If your a fan of American Pie and Blu-ray then this is a no brainer!!!

They wanted to be pretty much a story to itself. I believe that it is better than the first movire but not by much. Their humor is set up more and had a previous movie to build some new jokes. That's why if you love the first one your gonna love the second one. It's more of...humor than slapstick if you like it's awesome if not, well then your loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment...","review":"I had great expectations, after watching American pie 1 (which was very very funny).

There are some good laughs especially in the opening scene when Jim's Dad interupts a sexual escapade by Jim. Eugene Levy undoubtedly is the highlight of this sequel.The rest of movie is just a non stop sequence of undersexed college/high school students striving to get laid. The characters are slightly amusing but the film as a whole does not add much to the more successful original. The script is oh so repetitive. Not bad but certainly not great either as a 2 1/2 star rating sounds right."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the wait","review":"The first American Pie was interesting and done well. The plot wasn't that brilliant but the esemble cast was able to make a decent movie. However, American pie 2 falls short of its predecacor. The movie is weak at best.

A group of young people starting their adult lives. We have seen them in high school in the first one, now college with this second slice of pie. And the third film takes place after their first year of college. Where of course Jim & Michelle plan their wedding. I recommend the entire series. You should go for the unrated versions. The DVD's are loaded with extras. American Pie 2 takes the guys to a lake house for the summer of their lives, where they plan to party and get laid of course. Laugh out loud humor is the result as you get to know the characters a little more. Also one of the funniest moments in the trilogy.. Stifler's golden shower!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the first American Pie movie and reading all the positive reviews of this sequel, I came in with high hopes. Instead, all I got was a simple rehash of the same jokes from the first film, only this time, without the humor. It's as if the producers simply said \\"okay, I want everything that worked in the first film repeated, only let's make it louder and even more obnoxious\\". The only reason I give this two stars is because the entire cast at least attempts to inject some of the same spirit that they brought to the first film. Too bad the script lets them down, hard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sequel","review":"American Pie 2 was something of a surprise, I didnt expect it to be as hilarious or as intelligently written and directed as the original American Pie. To say I was pleased with the overall movie is understating the fact enormously.

I figure that if you are going to cash in on the fame of the first, you have to expect people to reflect & review.There was far too much reliance on crass humour, there was too much swearing, and the movie lacked any real flow.There were a few truly funny moments, but these were few & far between.Bottom line, watch it on weekly release at the local video store, have a laugh, but save your money something better.And, if you don't own the first release (American Pie 1), buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Full Frame","review":"Do not buy full frame movies.

Stan Clarke's 'Vulcan Worlds' is a great piece and a smart opener. Lenny White contributed 'Shadow of Lo', which is good, but not spectacular. I was hoping for an Al DiMeola original, but only got 'Earth Juice', which is a group effort.This is probably their low point, yet it is still a good album (note the 4 star review). Every group has its ups and downs. I would suggest this not to be your first RTF album.

There are great details about the Treaty of Ghent, the Second Bank of the U.S., the Seminole War, Monroe's diplomacy, the Missouri Compromise, and the Presidency of J.Q. Adams. There's also a nice chapter on the first wave of the Industrial Revolution. While the Era of Good Feelings is generally associated with Monroe, this book also includes the Presidency of Adams to round out the bridge between the Treaty of Ghent and the Jacksonian Era. When Dangerfield puts the story together, however, it is not as approachable as other tales of American History. There are too many references to unexplained names and events that leave the novice historian with too much work to piece the whole story together."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff won't dissolve","review":"I bought this last year so I could just use bleach as a chlorine source.

I disagree with the reviewer who believes the China of today is much the same; I am visiting China right now and it is much changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Azalea","review":"Red Azalea is a wonderfully written book by Anchee Min. Her narrative is rich in description as it takes the reader into her world during Mao's reign. This was the first book I read about that period in China where we see how people had to camouflage their emotions in such a hard and cruel world. As a child growing up in the 70's, the rhetoric used scared everyone to think that the people in China were robots who didn't feel. I thought the Chinese lacked human emotion because I did not realize just how oppressive the government was on its people.Reading Anchee Min's book revealed that under the blanket of fear were real human emotions alive and bubbling during such a repressive time. I highly recommend this book to everyone in order to understand the human element of the Chinese during the last years of the cultural revolution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still think about this book 5yrs later","review":"Lovely book.

It is a good stand-alone book, or a companion book with Jung Chang's Wild Swans. This is an autobiography that reads like a novel and kept me turning the pages to see how her life would progress. Her writing style is smooth, and easy to read, her passions, fears, sorrows, despair, and her strength of will are all laid bare with honesty and passion. If you have read Wild Swans, you will have a clear understanding of the story behind her telling. If this is your first book dealing with life under Chairman Mao, and you would like to learn more about the history and life of the Chinese people during Chairman Mao's time, then follow this book with Jung Chang's Wild Swans."},{"rating":"2","title":"umm...","review":"I'm not really sure what to make of this book. It was very powerful and personal. It's unlike any other book i've read because it something that has actually happened.

I would reccomend this book for someone who is ready to read a story that can overwhelm you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stan Getz","review":"This is a great review of Stan Getz' Bossa nova years with many great Brazilian musicians and Getz at his most melodic flights and solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT!","review":"I'd seen this movie almost 20 years ago when it first came out, and remembered it to be a well acted suspenseful thriller. Sometimes the memory is tricky, however, and you're disappointed when you see a movie again. Not this time. I watched it with my teenage daughter and she really liked it too. It's just a bit choppy in the beginning showing the passing of time, but otherwise it flows well. I'd definitely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a good suspense movie.

DID NOT LIKE THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great NON-comady Goldie Hawn movie!","review":"From the first time I saw this movie (on cable) I LOVED it!!!Goldie Hawn is an AMAZING comedic actress, but rarely does one find her in a serious role. I can think of only one other movie that was not a comedy (per say) that she was in. \\"The First Wives Club\\" (which she was dang good in that as well!)Deceived is a thriller that twists up and down and then back around on you, with Goldie being of course the focial point of trying to not only to figure out the WHY, but also get a step ahead in order to get her daughter back.Why this movie didn't get higher ratings I can only think that people simply could not SEE her as a serious actress.This film is dark, jumbled, and makes your eyes go wide with surprises. Just how I like my thrillers.I would absolutely recommand (and have!) this film to not only those who are Goldie Hawn fans, but enjoy phsycological thrillers and plot twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very chilling Hitchcokian thriller","review":"A very chilling thriller about a Manhattan woman whose married life turned out to be a sham. Not only she knew that not only her husband was living a lie by using a dead man's identity, but was still alive after the accident which killed a hitchiker to cover up his tracks and that he was married to another woman at the same time. On top of that, he was a serial killer who killed the curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the same night he and his wife were at a cultural gala. As his wife was looking for a restroom, she came upon the dead body in his workroom. He also killed the hitchiker as was mentioned earlier in the review as well as his mother so as to cover up his trail of wickedness.This movie is guaranteed to shock and scare, but in a very sophisticated way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of buying this DVD from MarsMovies!!","review":"5 star movie; 1 star seller: I saw this movie many years ago and was so looking forward to watching it again last night.

I had read about the demise of Dr. Tarnower in the newspapers and was just curious. I have adopted his recommendations and i keep track of my weight, dieting for 2 weeks once in a while, whenever my scales show 2kg more than my usual weight. This was easily done, notwithstanding the life style of a hospital medical doctor which I have led all those years. I am 69 years old now and this still works. I have bought this book as a present to many people who were interested in a life long program of keeping trim."},{"rating":"1","title":"This diet is very unrealisitic to follow.","review":"After reading the Scarsdale Medical diet thoroughly, I don't know how any person that leads the normal fast paced lifestyle which most of us today do, can suceed at this diet.

I will try the diet, and then maybe I will feel differently, but am not going into this with a real good feeling....I wish I wouldn't have even bothered with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from Amazon","review":"I ordered a used book and never received it or the replacement that was promised.

If you don't cheat the diet works as promised.Highly recommended book. For me SMD works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow and worked well","review":"If you plan to lose weight, this book may be you answer. At the advice of my Dr, I bought the book.

Go visit you Dr for his advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe, but it really does work!","review":"If anyone is a skeptic of anything quick, easy and effortless when it comes down to losing weight, \\"it's gotta be me\\". This book, however, makes the two week plan a breeze to follow, offering options for four variations to the basic plan. I went on the traditional two week plan and lost exactly 20 pounds, as promised. The only thing I wish this book included was sample plans for the follow-up Keep Trim eating weeks. I felt safer when I was told exactly when and what to eat. I looked online and found a support group that was very helpful to chat and share ideas with, at (url). Reading the book is an important part of the process. I highly recommend that anyone interested in jump starting their metabolism and learning balanced nutrition and portion control should order this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have loved to see it updated","review":"Scarsdale is one of the \\"classic\\" diets. I wish Tarnower were here today to give us his overall feelings about the Atkins and other Protien diets. I find they work as well as Scarsdale. The only difference is, on Scarsdale I was constantly hungry. It's a good read, nonetheless. Especially the mention of Jean Harris in the Acknowledgements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it sets out to do","review":"I first used this book over a decade ago and then I gave it to someone who didn't retrun it. so I bought another one. I find it a very sensible approach backed by the science. Although I'm not losing weight as fast as I might have wanted to (and as fast as some others), I am nearly at my target weight after 5 weeks. The diet has been very varied and healthy and is pointing me to some permanent changes in diet. It does take real discipline to follow and not cheat, and it also takes a bit of planning to make sure you have the right stuff for each coming day. But I'm well pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acknowledgement Review","review":"Dr. Tarnower created what might be the worlds healthiest diet back in the late 1970's. Since he was a cardiologist his primary concern was, of course, with the ticker. The book is written in plain english so lay persons, like myself, may understand it. The only problem I have is with who is given the very first acknowledgement in the begining of the book. Jean Harris is thanked for her help with getting the book published. Since Jean Harris is also the person who shot Dr. Tarnower five times, and eventhough this sounds redondant I will say it anyway, and killed him, one year after the book was published, I see no reason why the acknowledgement to her was not deleted from all future printings.I know Amazon.com has nothing to do with the printing of the books they sell, but, well, you asked for my opinion so I gave it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used - Never Again","review":"I bought this book to replace a library book my son lost.

Just using a respected name like Karloff is not enough to make a movie. Even Jack Nickolson was insufficient to make this film more than it was. Basically, nothing happened! After watching it once I chucked it to the back of my collection and have not watched it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terror-able","review":"Sluggish pacing and some questionable shots make THE TERROR a recommendation only for those who want to see a very young Jack Nicholson and a very old Boris Karloff in something other than the immeasurably superior THE RAVEN. Director Roger Corman lays the atmosphere on with a trowel and leaves continuity, consistency and coherence far behind in his wake.Karloff plays the Baron of a dark and brooding castle and Nicholson plays a misplaced French lieutenant in circa 1805 Somewherevania. There's a long dead wife, a diaphanous maiden prowling about a crypt at night and an old crone with a falcon borrowed from the set of Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. The plot? Well, you can mix those ingredients together and probably come up with something a little more substantial than this one.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low-budget, snail-paced movie...typical Jack Nicholson stuff","review":"This movie moves at a snail's pace as a soldier takes shelter at an old Baron's castle while searching for a mysterious woman he discovered at the beach near the castle. Boris Karlof's performance as the elderly Baron is the only one that makes this movie worth watching for the first half hour, and even then his acting gets lame and overleveled. Just like other typical Jack Nicholson movies, the movie is very slow, and extremely boring. It is not scary, and it is very easy to see that it is fake and stagy...Rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever!","review":"No wonder there are no reviews made. I saw it on tv yesterday. It was terrible. It had a disgustingly simple plot.(One of the things I hate most in a movie or novel)The locale was far from being scary.By the way,I am a Jack Nicholson fan.(He was awesome as ever!)His existence was the only thing that kept me from turning off the tv. Well, worst vice is advice but please take it. Do not even bother to check out the details on the net.PS.This is the first film that I've seen directed by Roger Corman. I will buy his book on making movies in Hollywood and never losing a dime.If his other movies are directed in the same manner that won't be a surprise for me.(But you never know! )"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best B horror movie of its class!","review":"The Terror is simply a fun B horror flick. Forget the acting, it's terrible, but that's its charm (it's worth it just to see the early Nicholson). It's the atmosphere that makes this movie a classic. The musical score gives it the true feel of the late night horror genre. Of course it's not scary, but that's beside the point. The ancient castle with its wonderful architecture, the ocean waves crashing on the rocky beach, the \\"old women\\" and her shack in the woods, and Stephan (the butler) whose performance is reminiscent of a Mel Brooks movie, make it a treat. For Karloff fans, this is a must see. I've been a fan of Corman's work for quite some time, and I think this is one of his better films. I would also recommend \\"Die Monster Die,\\" directed by Daniel Haller, for those incurable Karloff fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Lyrical Book that makes you yearn for the Country!","review":"I love this book! I checked it out from the library and my children loved it too! My boys are ages 5 and under and they kept saying, \\"I want to live in a little country town!\\".

I bought the whole 4 dvd of the isshin ryu karate system and I was totally deceived. All in all, a very superficial work: basic stances are taught in 10 minutes, work on legs in non-existent. The entire dvd on kata, does not give step by step directions, but just starts with the master moving around, and giving blows to the air....how can a junior karate starter follow thorugh ???The only section which is acceptable is the dvd on self defense (note: the 4th dvd is just a repetition of the dvd number 1, with a 15 minute addition on self defense): basic self defenses tecniques.

Dont get me wrong, Screaming Lord Sutch is great but these are not the original recordings I am interested in.

They are a cool band who got recognition for remixing Silverchair in the first place, and now have released an album similar to Junkie XL's work. It is fast, trancy, and would tear up any dancefloor in sight if given the chance. This is frest and exciting, and aside from Junkie XL, I can't compare this to anyone. Weird beats and simmering rythmns help to balance out the even stranger (kind of snotty) vocals here.

Period. Steve Perry and Journey are more credible (...ugh. I can't believe I just wrote that! - DAMN YOU, Bon Jovi!)A complete waste of time and money....."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good!","review":"the songs are not so good! i hate bon jovi! the lyrics are terrible! there's better bands! this is old 80's metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BON JOVI- SLIPPERY WHEN WET","review":"This album is excellent; a necessity for any rock fan's collection. It is more than just goofy \\"hair-metal\\". The album opens with \\"Let it Rock\\" which is such an awesome song it had me playing it repeatedly, which I don't usually do. Next is the smash hit \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" which you surely have heard already, which is followed with the fantastic Livin' on a Prayer, which I also played repeatedly. \\"Social Disease\\" is a standard Bon Jovi number. \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" is a classic that compares the life of a rock star to that of a cowboy. \\"Raise Your Hands\\" is the quintessential Bon Jovi song. \\"Without Love\\" is a good power ballad. \\"I'd Die For You\\" is one of those songs that makes fans love Bon Jovi, or on the other side of the coin, makes other people hate them. \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" is a great ballad. \\"Wild in the Streets closes the album nicely. This is an exceptional album overall, with no weak tracks at all.

YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME was one of the top hits of September 1986,when this album was released. The next hit was LIVIN' ON A PRAYER. Hey,is that Peter Frampton's \\"talkbox\\" on loan heard in the song? The other is WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE,which debuted on the radio in the spring of 1987. All those songs appeared on the 1994 compilation CROSSROAD which would contain a new version of LOAP entitled PRAYER '94. The other songs are great. Bon Jovi's 1988 follow-up NEW JERSEY would be a platinum smash as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"never say goodbye,a classic prom record","review":"bon jovi's slippery when wet is a classic prom record. when you go to the prom this year and hear classic '80s music,you might hear you give love a bad name, livin' on a prayer,wanted dead or alive, wild in the streets, and of course never say goodbye. have fun at the prom and hold on to your keys. ed wilson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Hair Metal","review":"I decided to purchase this CD since I am a growing fan of classic 80's metal, namely Queensryche among such. Bon Jovi complements my collection and he is a notable artist (I once saw a recent Oprah show with Jon Bon Jovi giving a concert.) In my opinion \\"Slippery When Wet\\" shows how popular hair metal artists, like Bon Jovi, have now evolved into the modern pop rock picture in accordance with the times. I am sick and tired of songs that receive to many airwaves (Dan Powter's \\"Bad Day\\" comes to mind), and this style of metal is a nice departure from that pop scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST EXCITIN' ALBUM","review":"Slippery when wet shows their most succesful and the most hit album. After havin' two albums previously, they return with this album. 'Let It Rock' showed them playin' the hard powered track. The mid-tempo 'You Give Love A Bad Name' seems like a joke for women who have break in love. The beautiful melody on 'Livin' On A Paryer' make me like to listen to this song. A more jokin' song, 'Social Disease' tells 'bout fallin' in love.(You can guest that by listening to this track intro. My favourite song, 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' shows Sambora playin' guitar on cowboy melody. The hit ballad, 'Never say goodbye' is a good feelin' to listen to this track. And also, this album shows their ability to sing together. I recommend this album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer","review":"I received my disk a few days before the last possible receive date.

You HAVE to own it quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh not that good at all","review":"Slippery When Wet some think its the greatest album of all time but personally i think its just one of those albums you can just pass on as nothing. Whats so special about, \\"Let It Rock\\", oooh so they used synth and guitar and just played one note and than bon jovi's singing comes in who cares. The reason i give it two stars is because its okay i guess i mean livin on a prayer and wanted dead or alive is okay but besides that its too glammy. not great not good"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Side of 1980s Musical Output","review":"The 1980s were certainly a very eclectic time for output in popular music. Especially for those of us who came of age during that decade. On the positive side, we had timeless albums such as The Joshua Tree, Moving Pictures, Master of Puppets and Remain in Light, among others.Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet represents the bad side of the 80s - generic songs; a soulless processed drum sound; and over-produced \\"anthems.\\" Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Poison, all members of a shallow, talentless club."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Partridge Family is better than this","review":"When I saw Bon Jovi open up for Ratt I became a big fan. He and his band blew Ratt of the stage. This was a surprise and I expected him to record some great rock. What I got here was pop blop. Yes, this gives rock 'n' roll a bad name! There is just enough good stuff here to truly torment a real rock fan.If you don't like rock music this may be for you....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"this isn't the worst album ever, but it's not good. Now, i'm a huge fan of the 80's rock scene, but for some reason, i never caught on to this album. Livin' on a prayer, for god's sake, i'd rather listen to an old guy crap his pants. The only worhtwile song on here, in my opinion, is \\"I'd Die For You.\\" Now that's a good song.If you're into bon jovi, GET IT, BY ALL MEANS!! but if you have a taste in music, buy van halen's 1984, or Def Leppard's High 'N' Dry instead. GREAT 80's ROCK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks Very Big Things","review":"This album epitomeses the worst kind of cheese American idolitry, and generally blows big things.Some of RS's solos are passable, but for the most part - it's standard bad popcorn glam, for over-the-hill women who drink in bars by themselves, and over-the-hill men who always wanted to be American, or popular - but failed on all counts.For more of this throw-away hamshank trash, see Europe, Def Leppard etc . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi = bad joke","review":"I used to think Korn was the destroyer of metal, boy was I wrong...after hearing this I knew it was Bon Jovi. I really think that this is the worst music of the 80's, even worse than Modanna or Paula Abdul. Even hairmetal fans dont like this! Hairmetal fans listen to Twisted Sister and Skid Row, and avoid pop like this, White Snake, Poison, Warrant, and Europe. This bad joke here made it so other pansies like Cinderella had a chance to make it, when all they were were talentless hacks who ripped off Van Halens 1984. I couldn't imagine anyone listening to this without having their ears bleed, this makes disco look like Led Zeppelin! Well, at least its better than Good Charlotte and Linkin Park (although not by much).Anyone who hates Jon Bon Blowme and Bad Joke is commendable, because they (Socialist Metal Head, Cotton Hell for example) are smart enough to realize how p**sified this is. I feel bad for anyone who doesn't see through Bad Jokes haze.DIE JON BON BLOWME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy Coated Pussified 100 % Certified Garbage","review":"Here it is - Slippery When Wet . I believe Bon Jovis 3rd album .This album is a turning point if you follow heavy metal . Its the watershed album that turned heavy metal from an up and comming genre into a laughing stock . This band doesnt get the flack it deserves . This is the 1910 Fruitgum Company with flangers and fuzzboxes. Its candy a$$ crap aimed at 13 year old girls. Its part of the reason music is in the sad state it finds itself today. This is what Nirvana( the most over rated bandin history )and a host of grunge bands revolted against ... and successfully so. Why ? Because this music is so bad that anything would make it look good. You can directly thank Bon Jovi and crue for the pussification of heavy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best bon jovi album ever","review":"this is the best bon jovi album of all time. It shot them to superstardom and songs like \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" are Bon Jovi anthems. Livin On A Prayer is the best example of never giving up even through the tough times and Richie Sambora's mastery of the talk box is just great. Wanted Dead Or Alive is the Bon Jovi anthem. And to top it all off, Never Say Goodbye is an amazing love ballad. The second best love ballad. When JBJ dreams about movies they wont make of him when he's dead is the best. But that came 6 years later. Anyways Slippery When Wet rules and i truly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vo5 charged hair metal","review":"Theres no denying Jon Bon Jovi has an incredible vocal range and Richie Sambora, unlike many 80's guitarists can really wail when he wants to. The first half of this album fares much better then the second half. Theres arena rock gems like \\"Let it Rock\\", \\"You give love a bad name\\" and \\"Livin on a Prayer\\". \\"Wanted:Dead or Alive\\" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic. IT will make you grateful Kurt Cobain came along and destroyed this kind of spandex and Vo5 charged poodle hair metal. In any case the album does make you wonder how much you got to fork over for those girls in the album jacket to wash youre car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"Bon Jovi mixes rock and pop on this album to make something that has a complete 80s sound. This album, especially the hit livin on a prayer, is a complete Bruce Springsteen ripoff. After seeing how well Springsteen had been doing (in particular 2 years earlier with Born In The USA) this band tried to use the same themes in their music but it didn't work so well for them. Buy Springsteen way before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Child","review":"Simply put, if you're into the music from the 'Big Hair' 80's era, than you'll love this CD. Check your pulse if this CD doesn't take you back to your days of immortality and remind you of someone you once were! Example... the first speeding ticket I got was while this cassette was playing in the car. I had a Radar Detector that was screaming at me, but I had the stereo cranked so loudly with \\"Dead Or Alive\\" that I couldn't here the alarm and got busted by the Florida Hwy. Patrol for 72 in a 55! Sometimes the music is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slippery Rocks!","review":"Slippery When Wet is the best. All the tracks are good.My favorite is Raise Your Hands. It's makes you feelgood inside. Just to think I can sing like Jon, is crazyI know, but I love it. Let It Rock..

After reading my review several times I realized this wasn't a \\"bad\\" album, it's just that it sold a lot more copies than I thought it would. I just don't understand why Bon Jovi has remaind so popular while other bands like Dokken and Ratt have not enjoyed that level of success. Was Bon Jovi that much different than Ratt or Dokken? Of course not! Those three bands first appeared during the '80s and pretty much recorded the same kind of music (hard rock). Although this album does contain some of Bon Jovi's best tunes (Wanted Dead or Alive and You Give Love a Bad Name) those songs are really no better than Dokken's In My Dreams or Ratt's Round and Round. Ratt and Dokken may have rocked a little \\"harder\\" than Bon Jovi, but if you compare this album to Ratt's Out Of The Cellar or Dokken's Under Lock And Key I feel the Ratt and Dokken albums are much stronger and contain better songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi - Slippery When Wet Cd","review":"I love this cd!

I absolutely wore it out on vinyl. Looking back on it, it's not as great as I thought at the time, but listening to it always take me back and it's actually not that bad. Some good songs on here and I'm sure you've heard them all 1,000,000 times. You don't need the album to do that, but it's fun to listen to it in its entirety, since there are a few here that you'll never hear elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"As funny as genocide.","review":"I have a small confession to make. I did not watch this film in it's entirity. 57 minutes into my descent toward death I managed to drag myself from the room by my left index finger, -the only part of my body able to survive the overwhelming physical depression. As I lay in the hallway willing my body back into action, I considered the possible motives anyone would have for inflicting this monstrosity upon the world. I came up with nothing, save the notion that some idiot somewhere thought that a bit of slow-motion jousting was a good enough premise for an entire film.This film is'nt just bad, it's debilitatingly naff. You won't laugh, you won't cry, you won't be scared, you'll just be perpetualy bewildered for many weeks to come. I still wake up at night asking \\"why?\\"Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most pathetic waste of time I have ever seen","review":"This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Usually, a truly abhorrent film offers at least some opportunity for entertainment, by either laughing at its stupidity or poking fun at it Mystery Science Theater style. Not A Knight's Tale. There isn't anything resembling plot continuity. The anachronisms are incredibly awful...you cannot suspend disbelief enough to actually accept these things happening. What's worse is the fact that the attempts at humor fall flat as well. The only redeeming qualituy this film has is an attractive cast, but eye candy isn't nearly enough to save it.Don't waste your time. I know I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Movies ever!","review":"I can't beleive people went to theatres to see this abomination. I was forced to watch it to begin with and only stayed to finish it because of a morbid sense of curiosity that kept me watching to see how bad it could get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gack!","review":"The music in this one really puts you off the mood.

As I mentioned, the plot was so obvious, I felt like maybe they producers had stumbled across one of my 4th grade essays and cribbed the movie from that. The acting, bar Ledger, was pretty ropey and the whole hi-hi-hilariousness of the movie failed miserably.A pleasant watch for teens and impressionable young women I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could pluck out my eyes.","review":"Based on the current rating of this movie by others (4 stars), I must have been watching a completely different movie. He Will Rock You? Here is a rare case of a soundtrack ruining a movie. Left on their own, the songs are great, I like Queen as much as the next gal. I shouldn't blame how much this movie sucks all on the music, the movie is chock full of lame dialogue, a cheesy and predictable plot and an unlikeable princess who is bitchy and useless, I only wish she'd died somewhere along the way. The only saving grace to this movie is the inclusion of James Purefoy, but get out your magnifying glass...his role is microscopic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fails on so many levels!","review":"P.U.!!!OK, the obvious thing is the horrible idea of using rock music as a soundtrack for a period movie. It is such a ridiculous and horrible idea that it's hard to imagine anybody actually going along with it. Did the direcor have nobody to discuss these things with? But the rest of the film is actually so bad that the crappy choice of music doesn't really stand out the way you'd expect it to.I'm granting the single star here for Rufus Sewel who was put to much better use in Dark City. This movie might do to the cinematic knight what Don Quixote did to all those literary tales of knight errantry, i.e. kill it dead as a stone.If you see this movie in your local rental outlet, turn around and walk away quickly. It really is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Obviously, this movie is not meant as a strict period piece. So, I sort of can deal with the rock music. I cannot, however, deal with the heroine Jocelyn. She is annoying at best. I have to agree with other reviewers, she doesn't fit at all in the movie. Maybe if they had changed her hair, her clothing, her mannerisms. Just change something. Kate was much more interesting and no where near as strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 13th Century Clashes with the 21st Century...","review":"The film is a tale of three squires whose master dies prior to a joust that brings them their food and shelter. In order to to have food for the evening they decide that the youngest of them, whom has some talent, should joust and bring home a prize for food. This escalates and with the help of an unheard of writer they counterfeit family tree papers, which gives them the right to continue jousting and build wealth. Knight's Tale is neither drama, comedy, or satire, since it uses all of these aspects to sell humor, morals, and values. Unfortunately, the value of the story vanishes when these three genres conflict with each other making one laugh at the film rather than the parody in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Knight's Tale\\" -- The review.","review":"The film, \\"A Knight's Tale\\" is the story of a poor boy, William Thatcher, who even though not known at the time of noble birth, strives to be a Knight. Some may say, predictible and bad, I say make a better one. This is an excellent film, that will surely help Heath Ledger's upstarting career. The film shows the true beauty of London with it's locations. I can not get over realistic it is to the elder times of which this film was set. The action scenes were very intense, with seeming as if it were really happening. Also, stay tuned after the credits, because there is a special scene that is just laughs. Personaly, it could of been not there, but whatever \\"they\\" want.Have a good one.Ryan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure","review":"Okay, okay, I admit that this is truly one of my life's guilty pleasures. At least this piece of fantasy doesn't even try to pass itself off as history. From watching the extra material, though, it is obvious that the writer/director did a good deal of research into jousting. If you're looking for a couple of hours of mindless frivolity, this is the place. The cast looks as though they are having the time of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Knight's Tale","review":"I collected all Heath Ledger's movies after his unexpected and untimely death, this one was the BEST!

I'm very happy with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An over all good movie","review":"The only thing I really did not care for in the movie, was the addition of the \\"modern\\" songs such as \\"We will rock you,\\" by Queen. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the song when it is on the radio, but call me a fool for thinking that it has little place in a movie set in Renaissance Europe. Other than that, I find little, if any fault in the movie. As one who is a fan, and attendee of many Renaissance festivals and who has seen Jousting combat first hand, I can say that this is superbly well done. Well acted, and a plot that is not too over the top, or mind numbingly dull. While I don't think this is a \\"must get\\", I do think that you could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, Comedy, Romance - All Around GREAT Movie","review":"Sure this movie is a bit off the charts when it comes to reality but hey, not all movies can be dead accurate. This movie is fun-loving, action-packed, can make you laugh (that is, if you have a sense of humor), and has its share of romance. A Knight's Tale portrays such determination and energy in committing dreams. It's something that everybody should be feeling. William (Heath Ledger) had a dream to become a knight and he aims for it. Wanna know if he succeeds or not? Go buy the movie :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Different: I Didn't Like It","review":"I notice the other Amazon reviews are high on this film. I wish I could say my opinion were as high of it. I found it flat throughout and I can't say that Heath Ledger, who I'd heard was the next big leading man in the movies, did anything for me either. The rock music set to the medieval setting was good and the Chaucer character was a very good one and interesting to watch (a supporting role). Rufus Sewell also made an interesting villain. However, those are the only virtues I could find in this action adventure yarn set in the medieval jousting world. If you are looking for a knockout script and knockout acting, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Movie","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie.

I am really gald that I have seen it now, and I was also pleasantly surprised to find a cerain family member's music video on the DVD too.

The fashion and mannerisms are as far off from reflecting the period as the music; why bother making a movie about that time then?

The Blu-ray edition has NONE of the special features from the regular DVD releases. Not only is this NOT the extended cut, it doesn't even offer the deleted scenes on a special features menu. In fact there is NO special features menu. I've noticed this issue on a lot of Blu-ray releases. Sure you get the better looking film but no interviews, no commentary, no deleted scenes. Nothing. I am so disappointed in this release. I will be getting rid of it and going back to my regular DVD and researching the Blu-rays before purchasing.

Heath Ledger is ugly, and the fact that that stuck up brat Jocelyn was wearing bright yellow dresses and sporting blue hair extensions certainly didnt add any authenticity to it. Oh and then, AND THEN! \\"We will rock you\\" comes on and wow, I'm really sucked into the story, its just soo... MIDEIVIL! I almost hate to tell you about Chaucer, the only amusing thing in this boring bleh of a movie. Chaucer's gambling habits make him lose his clothes to gypsies, twice! he is funny, but not enough of a consolation to watch this peice of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"A Knight's Tale will go down in theatrical history as one of the worst films ever made, earning a spot next to Ishtar!While the predictable script is bad enough it is accompanied by a modern soundtrack that deviates from the era in which is suppose to be portrayed. Also the wearing of modern clothes by the princess detracts from the essence of being a princess.This movie was so bad, that if I weren't at a drive-in, waiting to see the other feature, I would have left.SAVE YOUR MONEY!

I thought the movie was bad, bad, bad. There was nothing in it that belonged in the Medieval era. The styles, the personalities, music, nothing.But my husband liked it, so we bought it and I watched it again. What a wonderfully delightful movie! The plot is of course much the same as other movies...damsel and knight and jousting, but the way it is directed is awesome.If you don't look at this movie as a documentary of the Medieval era, it is perfectly wonderful. Get rid of all expectations when you put it in to watch and I guarantee it will be the best movie you've watched in quite some time. I know my husband and I do...we watch it at least once a week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please edit soundtrack.","review":"Great movie. Can't wait.

This would have made the movie excellant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential","review":"Ok maybe it is just me, but this film had the potential to be great. Especially with the budget it was given. Classic rock had no business being in a film like this. Especially in the beginning with the spectators singing along. Plus there sounded as if there was a jukebox in the French pub. Not to mention some of the Gen X fashions and hair styles that were worn. You make your own judgment but was very unbelievable for the period they were portraying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"Absolute ... the director seems to have been trying for a blend of medieval and modern culture which worked VERY badly. Also, bad plot, unlikable heroine.One star earned by the fact the Heath Ledger was quite astonishingly good looking in armour and growled at people a lot. A further star earned by Chaucer, who was really quite amusing.However, neither of these things will convince me to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tale of a man becoming a Knight","review":"1st if you are into 100% accuracy such as SCA don't watch. If you want to understand the feelings that were probably held by people from the era of Knights and Kings you will find it here.It is an honorable tale, has good acting, humor, action, good supporting roles, decent pace, good camera work (it does not detract from the story). It is not entirely predictable in specific events but the story is a standard epic. The feel is authentic, people actually get hurt and not everything works out perfect. But it does have the happy ending which I require to give any movie or book a 5th star.I bought it because it was cheap, not expecting much. Surprisingly I have watched it numerous times. My rule is that if I can watch a movie multiple times it must be good.My only question is \\"whats up with her hair?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Change your stars","review":"Heath Ledger stars in this creative and adorable jousting movie as William Thatcher, a squire for a knight who suddenly is thrown into the armor himself. William poses as a knight himself and begins winning competition after competition. He also wins the heart of the lovely Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossaman). As he falls further in love with her, it becomes more obvious that he is straining to keep his identity secret. He knows that if it gets out that he's a mere peasant that the best punishment he could receive would be a trip to the stocks. Unfortunately for him, he does have an enemy who seeks to make William pay for being so good with both jousting and with Jocelyn...This is a definitely a must-see movie. You'll laugh...you'll cry. You'll sing along to the incredible soundtrack. It's definitely a very cool movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most pathetic thing I have ever had to witness","review":"How could anyone have sat through this entire movie? The thing that I can't believe is that people are rating it as being a good movie. Did you actually see it? I think for me what ruined it the most was the soundtrack. What a horrible selection of music to play for a \\"midevil\\" movie. Was it midevil or was it midevil/21st century/terrible. Their verbiage, forgive me if I quote it incorrectly, but there is a scene where the main character has to fix his armor and the blacksmiths tell him,\\"You have to pay CASH first before we fix it.\\" CASH?! They might as well have asked him for his ATM card.And then the ballroom dance! Do I even have to go there. That is when I walked out of the movie theater. Just don't waste your money people. Please. You will lose braincells watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful awful awful!","review":"I am not a teenage girl, and I don't swoon over Heath Ledger. If you are in the same situation, then bring a pillow to Knight's Tale, or better yet don't see it. The \\"hip\\" setting of this movie hardly makes it revolutionary, or even good. The plot is completely scatter-brained, often makes no sense, and is obnoxiously repetitive. Really, there must be 50 jousting scenes and the all are exactly the same. Movie also includes the worst villian ever; his dialog is stupid, trite, and over-the-top. The final battle includes a stare down between him and Heath that goes back and forth for what seems an eternity. But perhaps the dumbest part of the whole show is the overly dramatic, unrealistic, and very forgettable romance between Heath and the princess. Do not see this movie unless you enjoy putting yourself through agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Knightmare more like ...","review":"As the movie starts out, you can't stop but to notice to hard-rock music of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You.\\" People are clapping/stomping to hard-rock and doing \\"the wave\\" in the stands. I guess this was where \\"the wave\\" was discovered. That threw me off already. I thought this would be like something of Camelot calibur. This movie is a slop job. The only bright thing of this movie is the character Geoffery Chaucer. Unlike anything from his, Cantebury Tales, this movie stands pretty low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Stop! Please!","review":"Remember Rocky? The original? The Academy Award winning film about a wrong-side-of-the-tracks pugilist given a million-to-one shot at fame and glory?Now imagine that film set medieval times. With inferior acting. And poor casting (that was an ENGLISH princess?). And glossy production values. And no heart.This movie could have been really funny if played strictly for comedy...if it laughed at itself more. Unfortunately, it takes itself too seriously too often; not all the time, but enough to repeatedly insult the intelligence of the audience. It takes a monumental effort towards the suspension of disbelief to stomach this movie...even just to play along.David Bowie's \\"Golden Years\\" is forever sullied. \\"We Will Rock You?\\"...yikes!Adriaanne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FONGING BRILLIANT!!!","review":"This movie is easily one of my favourites for the year, with its mix of action, humour and romance it really makes for an enjoyable watch. Heath Ledger gives a great performance, as do the rest of the cast. Shannyn Sossamon's costumes are often quite interesting and innovative, not quite fitting in with the Medieval setting, but then, what in this movie does?? I knew right away that I wanted to watch it again, and after a second viewing, I just HAD to own it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a bit of light-hearted entertainment, and it is easily worth the five stars I have given it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but certainly not the worst","review":"I really question the judgement of some of these reviewers. A work of Satan..??! Oh, please! First, I am an English teacher, and a big fan of Chaucer and his times. The first time I saw this movie, I was screaming in disbelieving horror throughout. However, my sons loved it and it was on HBO, so the second time they watched it, I could see some merit. By the third time, I was forced to agree with the reviewer who said Chaucer would've loved this. He would have. The commoner rising up on his own (basically) honest merits comes straight from Chaucer. Yes, some of the dialogue is cliched, the Black Prince was not noted for progressiveness, but the cast makes it rise up above such picayune things. Ledger is great, and Jocelyn actually has a mind of her own. See it with an open mind and see for yourself. One other note - mute the volume during Robbie Williams attempt at Queen (final song). Now THAT is desecration!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Press: world cup winning fly-half can act!","review":"A Knight's Tale really works. It's eye candy, not brain candy, but it worked a treat for me. I thought the potential love triangle was left sadly unexplored (especially as there wasn't really any chemistry between Will and Jocelyn), but otherwise, full marks: Sewell was a great villain, the father/son bit was done nicely (you should see Cheapside nowadays, by the way), and I thought the rock music worked extremely well. Finishing with Ackadacka was just inpired (so much so that School of Rock took this leaf out of the book).How they convinced Jonny Wilkinson to take the leading role, though, I'll never know. \\"Heath Ledger\\" indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had expected this to measure up to Terry Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm - but - was sadly disappointed.

The lady didn't fall instantly for the knight, and that makes her smart. Almost all of the characters are intelligent. I like the movie when the characters are smart.

Incidentally, \\"Chaucer\\" was delightful! However, he did not speak in Middle English. I learned Middle English so I could read the Canterbury Tales in original form.

It was romantic, dramatic, poignant, and absolutely hillarious at the same time. There was pleanty of action and beauty to keep the men happy, and romance and drama ( along with total hottness) to keep the women happy. Also, the abundance of comedy could keep everyone smiling.

I find the silliness, funny references, rock soundtrack quirky and wonderful, and yet the romantic story remains compelling. Now I watch it just for the sheer fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"A sort of cross between an MTV music video and a costume romance, this film is held together by the good humoured performances of its cast (in particular Heath Ledger and Paul Bettany).

If you are looking for dark historical accuracy, this is not the movie for you...but if you want a fast moving feel good movie that can be watched with the family, buddies, or date this is a good pick.

This is not a historical commentary, and isn't meant to portray the material as a documentary. Any plot variations or shallowness should be attributed to the fact that the creators of this film were trying to do something fun and unusual. In that, I believe they succeeded. Despite the fact that William ended up with Jocelyn instead of Kate, the movie still works. Reviewer Octavius needs to lighten up. A film is meant to be taken for what it is, not what it isn't. This film is definitely entertainment only. If you want real history, tune into the History Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"What a waste of time, a total load of garbage.

It isn't even worthwhile to comment on the 'historical inaccuracies', since they are so extensive and appalling that this film cannot be qualified as a period piece/historical film at all and must fall into the category of fantasy. As such, it fails miserably. Plot and dialogue are awful... so many bad choices were made that Amazon does not give enough space to list them all.Here stands a glorious testament to Hollywood's eternal quest to reach for new lows!

So the movie has rock music in it. Who cares?With that aside, this movie is basically a compilation of things I've seen in other movies many times before. For example--the \\"common peasant\\" making his way to greatness-storyline, the teach me how to dance because I don't know how to dance-scene, the two opposing characters with a love interest in the same girl, and of course the bad guy getting beaten in the end while the good guy steals the girl. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bad guy wears black armor and rides a black horse. This is orginality at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"I consider myself to be a pretty open movie watcher. I enjoy watching period style movies. I even thought the movie Black Night was pretty entertaining. This movie was just a bad movie. Not even bad in a funny way. If you make a movie about people in the Renaissance period, you don't have crowds singing \\"we will rock you\\", and doing ghetto dances. The story, in itself, is hard to digest on it's own... and has been done before... many times over... and better. It's your standard happy-feely random kid goes from rags to riches doing what he loves to do with the help of a couple other down-and-out characters who end up being miracle workers with ingenuity. There is absolutely no historical truth in this movie, and apparently no research done at all to even make it seem somewhat believable.Bottom line is, save your money. This movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this movie...","review":"Strange as it may seem, I've watched this movie a couple of dozen times and seem to enjoy it each time. I also pick up on additional pieces of the plot that I missed the time before.

One to add to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"I thought this was a really great movie! I think the rock music really kicks it up.

The preview looked intriguing, until the Queen dance number. I hoped that Heath Ledger, whom I loved in \\"The Patriot,\\" could somehow make up for the obvious deficiencies. The ONLY reason that I even went was because the movie was playing at the local pizza-and-beer movie pub, and friends wanted to see it. Overall, it just seemed like the director could not decide between making a period movie and making something silly. The combination just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeech!","review":"Sorry, but I found the jarring juxtaposition of medieval jousting with 1970s pop tunes too much to take.

There's nothing really bad about the dialogue, theme, or the actors and actresses. However, there are many parts that aren't convincing in the least, or even realistic for that matter; such as the hairstyles and dancing.

The jousting was awesome, that's the only I liked about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Rock You!","review":"The second I found out about this movie, I immediately wanted to see it just because of the main character! But after I saw it, I realized I enjoyed beyond the EXTREMELY hot knight. This movie is hilarious, but it is also a wonderful and touching story. You'll get action, romance, adventure, and comedy all rolled into one great movie. Plus, I thought it was so cool how the soundtrack was full of old rock music from Queen and David Bowie.

Nor can you watch it over and over again like you can with Gladiator and Braveheart.

This movie offers nothing for you. I find it a rather indignant thing to open the the first scene with Queen's We Will Rock You, (being a fan of Queen). The movie has a dull plot.

I honestly didn't think the movie would turn out to be as entertaining as it is. The sets and period costumes are wonderful, and they let you imagine what it would have been like to actually be there. Heath Ledger gives a strong performance, equally adept at comedy as he is at drama. Some of the best performances in the movie are from the actors who play his friends. Mark Addy is absolutely perfect as Geoffrey Chaucer, and his character is especially fun if you know his history before you see the movie. There's great chemistry between Ledger and his friends, but one of the film's problems is a bit of an occasional lack of chemistry between Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon, who gives an otherwise good, funny performance as Jocelyn. This has already become one of my favorite movies on DVD, but for most people, it's going to be a love-it-or-hate-it movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten Up","review":"If you take yourself very very seriously, do not see this film.

If you spend more time mocking others than laughing at yourself, do not see this film.Otherwise, if you're someone who enjoys seeing the good guy win, get the girl and triumph over the kind of people described in the first paragraph...you'll like this movie.Honestly, some of these other reviewers should lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love this movie, hate the blu-ray edition","review":"I have always loved this movie since I saw it in theaters, so this review has nothing to do with the actual movie, but with the blu-ray edition. I have this movie on DVD and there are special features on it, commentaries, deleted scenese, extended scenes. This blu-ray has no special features menu at all. I felt kind of jipped, on this blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I discovered Rory Block one night on Austin City Limits. I was captivated. On stage by herself, performing passionate folk/blues, singing and playing her acoustic guitar as if she meant every word and note. Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez all rolled into one. I went on a quest to find some of her CDs, and eventually bought Mama's Blues, which I liked. I also recently bought Confessions of a Blues Singer, which is even better.Tornado disappointed me. Only three or four of the songs were the bluesy stuff I was expecting. Most of the rest are more mainstream ballady things, and they really drag. I really love the artist, but this was one CD I wished I hadn't bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Series of Novelizations That Improve On the Source","review":"I HATE novelizations. But these done for the great British TV mystery series starring Robbie Coltrane actually improve upon the teleplays, adding rich details and psychological insight to the already intense plots. These books could easily stand alone as a great series of psychological crime novels, unified in tone despite the fact that half a dozen different authors have been involved in their creation. Leave it to the Brits to once again do the impossible.

That is a pretty amazing track record and this game completely emulates the arcade game perfectly. The graphis are run of the mill but the game is incredibly fast. However, if you do not own a lightgun (Namco GunCON) or some other type of lightgun then you shouldnt buy it. No gun = no fun!The GUNCON from NAMCO is the best choice b/c it is the most accurate and durable...get this game if you have a gun.Also recommended: Time Crisis, Time Crisis 2 (ps2), Point Blank, Point Blank 2, Point Blank 3, Time Crisis: Project Titan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This game is perfect for old fan of the arcade or pople just starting to enjoy the game.

It just might be.","review":"I won't bore you with a description of what's wrong with this movie because nothing at all works in it. From the derivative plot to the lame acting to the ridiculous \\"twist\\" ending, this movie is bad from start to finish. If you like bad movies or just want to torture yourself, then this might be a film for you. OK, it probably isn't the worst movie ever made (in a world with Baby Geniuses, Glitter, and Showgirls how could it be?), but it is God-awful. Renting this film would be a mistake. Just stear clear altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST HORROR FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"The idea for a good slasher film is there, nerdy guy gets dumped on by hot chicks, comes back to get even in the end. Unfortunately the best I could say about the movie was \\"it's a good idea\\". From the opening sequence (kinda looks like a copy of Carrie), this movie lacked originality, taking ideas from other films and making them seem cliche, from the killer in a mask to having a victim hiding in a morgue only to get caught. Overall this flick was disappointing at best, at some times I wanted to shut it off and put myself out of my misery. DON'T WASTE YOUR HOUR AND A HALF ON THIS ONE! IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST HORROR FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL, HERE WE GO AGAIN","review":"JUST WHAT THE WORLD NEEDED, ANOTHER SCREAM-TYPE HORROR MOVIE.

IF YOU WANNA SEE THE AVERAGE MASKED MAN GOES ON A KILLING SPREE MOVIE, THEN THIS ONE JUST MIGHT APPEAL TO YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! An original ending!","review":"Despite the fact that Jamie Blanks wanted and tried to make this movie all about Denise Richards...it is still one I watch regularly. There are some of the \\"obvious what's going to happen next\\" moments, but if a horror movie didn't have a few of those, people wouldn't get it. Donnie Darko for example. Very good very dark. Back to the point, I wish this movie had gotten more clout when it came to theatres. I vaugly remember and trailer and a poster. It is definately worth the rent to see if you want to buy..I did. If you love this movie, don't listen to the commentary, it will frustrate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and ilogical","review":"Valentine started out good. It could of been a much better movie if they handled it well. The movie is predictable as nothing i have ever seen. Some of the killing scenes are ilogical and not original. For example: At a party girl hits the killer who falls unconscious, but instead of running were are all the people are, she runs in a room and hides, and I think you can guess what happens next. The story plot was original, but the movie overall was bad. The movie gives us so many clues as to who the killer is. There are scenes that have nothing to do with the movie and are put anyway. The ending would of been nice and surprising without the obvious clues. If you want to see a good scary movie see Scream, Urban Legend, Halloween, etc. Valentine could of been better. In the movie every time the camera follows a person who is alone, that person is killed, And I mean always except of course for the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I see a trend","review":"Does it strike anyone else as unusual that every single good review of this movie is filled with spelling/grammatical errors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible movie, if it were not for Denise Richards I would have turned it off after 10min. Watch it on mute if you do buy iy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Sender. Unopened.","review":"\\"Valentine\\" is a toothless, vapid rehash of the slasher flick, done straightfaced with zero irony or chills. It's beautifully shot and well-produced, but, Lord, is it boring. Ripping off \\"Scream,\\" \\"Friday the 13th,\\" \\"Carrie,\\" and at least a half-dozen other horror films, it doesn't stray far from what we've seen before. Someone, somewhere, was convinced that Denise Richards can act, but her blank performance says otherwise. Ditto the wonderfully bland David Boreanaz, whose screen presence has all the flavor of rice cakes. Despite the well-staged slashings and so-called surprise ending, \\"Valentine\\" is much ado about nuttin'. Return this baby to sender."},{"rating":"1","title":"YET ANOTHER UNINSPIRED HALLOWEEN RIP OFF! 1 1/2 STARS!","review":"Another dull entry in the slasher film genre. This one has a decent cast, but little else. This film's only saving grace is the ending even if it's a bit predictable. My biggest problem with this film is that we've seen it all before and done better. You don't have to look to closely to see the obvious similarities to 'Halloween' and many other superior films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy her flowers instead","review":"Wow,this movie is quite possibly one of the most uninteresting slasher movies in years. At no time does this create even a small amount of suspense. The actors appear to be uninterested in the movie and look almost ashamed to be in the film.After the tired cliched opening of a young picked on boy being beat and humiliated at a school dance we flash forward 13 years and find that he is now looking to get even with the girls who rejected him. The fact that the girls are made to look like horrible mean spirted witches almost has you cheering for their demise. The final revelation of who the killer is is a big let down and raises questions as to how he was able to commit some of the murders.Give yourself a break and save your money for something that is really scary. Spend your money on flowers and skip this valentine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BAD","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I have rarely seen such poor writing. The \\"twist\\" at the end was stupid and tried to be confusing on purpose. It wasn't. It was just stupid. If you took out all the scenes that were not needed to advance the story, you would have a 15 minute film. Without David and Denise, I doubt this film would have ever been seen in theatres. It isn't scary at all. It's just BAD. For proof, listen to the director commentary. Most of his comments are about everything he did wrong and why certain scenes do not make any sense at all. That's right - the director of the film explains why his own movie is bad. Don't believe me? Listen to it. Oh, wait - Don't. Peel some wallpaper instead. It is much more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"'Valentine' gets firmly lumped into the post-'Scream' series of horror movie clichés.Like the 'Urban Legend', and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' movies, 'Valentine' isn't by any stretch the worst movie I've ever seen, but creatively, it leaves a LOT to be desired.Just as it's predecessors, 'Valentine' is an ultimately-unfulfilling clone that's only to be viewed on basic cable or the WB network. You'd kick yourself for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious, beautiful and stylized junk!","review":"Five beautiful friends who start receiving threatening valentines find themselves being hunted by a repressed killer (obviously inspired [or stolen] from HALLOWEEN) wearing a cupid mask. Is it that nerd they all teased in sixth grade? Attractive but predictable, poorly written thriller that not only has a complete lack of suspense but can't make us seem to care about a character of any kind. Still, at least director Blanks tries. Based on the novel by Tom Savage."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's horrible all right","review":"Valentine is a ghastly mess. Upon recieving violent valentines the \\"heroines\\" proceed to go out alone, ignore the advice of the police, withold evidence and generally act like fools. The plot had potential but the actors and the crummy dialog destroy all hope. David Boreanz essentially plays Angel as a drunkard human instead of a brooding vampire but that's the best thing I can say about the flick. Denise Richardson is the worst thing about it. Her acting was never her strongest suit but in Valentine it takes a real nose dive. ...The twist ending didn't make a lick of sense and I took the DVD back to the store and begged to exchange with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary. Not fun. Not worth it.","review":"This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. The \\"scares\\" are lame bursts of loud music trying to make you jump. The guy who directed Urban Legend made this movie, which is really the big suprise here. That was a fun movie; this one is so awful I can't believe it got made. Even the otherwise good actress Denise Richards is dull here. The book this film was adapted from was excellent; it gets so twisted out of shape here it is shameful. I can't believe how many movie fans say \\"this was a good movie, just ignore the reviews.\\" Besides a halfway decent first five minutes, I can't not recommend this movie enough; whatever you do, avoid Valentine at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie just sreams originality..","review":"Ok, so I lied. This movie is a \\"painful\\" film with an unbelievable plot and too many plot holes to point a stick at. The performances are dismal, and the actors hardly look as though they were remotely interested in their characters. Although \\"Jamie Blanks'\\" previous attempt 'Urban Legends' was not a box office breaker, at least some of the ideas worked. This film has poor dialogue and generates no sense of atmosphere for the viewer. Personally, I would rather stare at my eye lids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent but predictable","review":"Valentine is a decent movie. Not one of the best I've seen, but watchable...More than once in my case. I'd seen it years ago when it first came out, and figured it out in the first 10 minutes. With Valentines Day around the corner, I thought it fitting to share the movie with my 17 year old daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it Used","review":"I bought this movie used and not only was the case in great condition but so was the disc. Im very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average teen slasher pic, but still pretty good...","review":"While there has indeed been a long line of teen slasher movies, they have tended, over the years (with the notable exception of some good scares in the Scream series) to be predictable and formulaic. Well, Valentine is no different; however, I do have to give better than average marks to the acting in this one, and the deaths in this film are perhaps a bit more creative and interesting than in the usual movie of this genre. The storyline does indeed keep you guessing until the end, which is rare these days. This one won't be on anyone's Top 20 horror films list, but it is fun, watchable, and worth a rental.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!!","review":"Today is Valentine's day, so I thought I'd review this movie! This is an awesome slasher and has a great storyline! At a Valentine dance, a nerdy kid named Jeremy Melton asks 4 smokin' hot popular girls to dance, but they all cruelly reject him. Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation and they start to make out behind the bleachers. Some school bullies see them, so Dorothy tells them that Jeremy tried to sexually assault her, then the bullies taunt and severely beat Jeremy up in front of everyone. Years later, a man with a knife and a Cupid mask begin to stalk and kill all the women who rejected him. From sending gothic Valentine cards, and chocolate filled with maggots.

The storyline doesn't stop to murders, the characters developped, they are young adults who have their own problems and touch of evilness, they are not perfect and innocent which is to my mind more believable than a naive teen. The murders are original and Denise Richards is just perfect. There is also good suspens with a very good ending but I won't tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good kills, great end but, what about the plot????","review":"Great things here: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Blood, great music and great kills,The plot is so stupid, that it's even bad for a slasher film.And it's a little boring too, it gets good only when it ends.Denise Richard, AHH!, such a lovely girl, but such a bad actrees.She only use two facial exoresions in the film, she [stinks]!!!!But, like i say in all my horror/slashers reviews.If you like this genre, you'll love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses are Red....Violets are Blue....","review":"The chilling story of a group of high school girlfriends brought back together when one is murdered is a terrorizing way to remember Valentines day.

Then they are stalked and murdered by a masked assailant. Sound predictable? Maybe, but this one is creative with touches of originality - a breath of fresh air since this genre was pretty much ground out by 1984. Better-than-average slasher film had me guessing - I thoroughly enjoyed this. Features include director commentary and interviews with cast and crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slasher-comedy","review":"I thought this film was just plain funny, and so will happily fork out the cash when it gets released. Angel fans will be happy to see David Boreanaz smiling, a change from his usual brooding vampire, and given the nothing-special plotline, he does deliver a fantastic portrayel of a role that could have lead to the film being pathetic, but which he manages to avoid. Denise Richard fans will love the hot tub scene, while scream/slasher followers will put this down as a cult classic, while not being terribly scary, there is the expected tension, numerous gory deaths and gallons of bloodshed which allow it to leave a mark in your memory, while not wholly oscar worthy, this is a great films to watch with a bucket of popcorn and a bunch of friends when you have a free evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the dvd and play frisbee with it","review":"unless you are a 15 year old adolescent boy who likes to look at full figured female bodies, dont bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"David Boreanaz Fans Don't Waste Your time.","review":"I was so disappointed with this film. I had hoped this movie would show off David Boreanaz's talent. Who knows. Maybe he doesn't have any, beyond what we see on Angel (I doubt that though). This role was a re-hash of Angel. Brooding and skulking. Don't ask him to try something new. Don't take advantage of his obvious comedic abilities. The ending was so obvious about 5 minutes into the film. Of course the ugly boy will become the handsome, sexy male. Gee, who'd a thunk it."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.

Jessica Capshaw saved the day!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange little film","review":"Something like an episode of \\"Sex and the City\\" directed by Wes Craven, this mercifully short teen flick can't decide if it's a girl-power sex farce or a by-the-numbers thriller. It hedges its bets and settles for being plain bad. It might have worked if pre-release buzz hadn't identified the serial killer. But if you know who it is, the whole thing's rather tedious. Denise Richards does her usual thing, as does David Boreanaz with one pleasant exception - unlike in \\"Angel\\", he's occasionally allowed to smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valentine delivers sweets and candies","review":"i loved this movie and i own it on DVD and you should get it now because it is a clever thriller for all horror fans and delivers real valentine sweets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There was Capshaw's Bf There was that other guy why david?","review":"I have to say, wasn't Angelus Evil enough that they have to give away Adam too?I am really Angry with the writer!all though i liked the way the killer killed and the Sexyness of the party, and the Dromatic killing scene of Paige (DANISE RICHARDS) and especially the killing scene of that girl, you know arrows, Falling into the garbage box, and i really liked the killing scene of shelly, it was really scary and looked painful, one slash and kill finished.Anyway, i didn't like this insult of Boreanaz, so i can't give it more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-Three Star Beginning, Spirals Downhill Fast!

In my opinion, I give it 2-3 stars for the first half of the movie, 1 star for the last half, and -1, for the ending. this movie starts out decent, including a funny 'speed dating' segment. The movie just spirals downhill getting worse and worse until it finally ends in a STUPID UNINTERESTING INSULTING MESS. Denise Richards is beautiful, but her character is really very dull. This is basically a cheesy teen slasher that insults anyone with even half a brain. I gave it two stars because it had some decent moments in the begining. I'd pass on this terrible movie. You should see the director and his commentary--he is terrible. I can't believe he could actually film a movie :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slasher at it's best","review":"I kind of expected Valentine to be a bit of a let down,but as it turns out,it was a pretty suspencful slasher movie.The movie was well paced,well written,well acted,well produced,and well directed.David Boreanaz actually carried his role quite well.Director,Jamie Blanks,really did a great job with this movie,as he did with his previous movie,Urban Legend.And I have to give props for the creative death scenes.Valentine might not be nearly as good as Urban Legen or Scream,but it still is a great slasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BAD, the SAD and a WASTE OF TIME!","review":"Wow, it has been a LONG time since I have seen such a BAD movie!

If you think about it, most of the scary movies, I mean REALLY scary movies, are the old ones, classics, NOT this ...! I would really like to see some good horror movies come out.

What point does the neurotic chic that keeps bugging Cameron have? Talk about loose ends! The cast was great and showed great talent, but I think that talent was severly wasted on pointlessness. The movie could have had great potential, but really kinda wanders off and doesn't make any sense. It's basically a big gore-fest. If you don't have to pay for it, watch it all you want, I don't suggest wasting the money to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a horror...","review":"Well, I do not say it is not entertaining, however there is a long way before I call it 'horror' etc. Actually it is addressed to teenagers rather than adults . When I went to see this one,I was expecting murder cases with investigations, like I read in some mysterious -horror books by skilled authors. Then it turned out to be the sort - creating horror by force so the customer will think it is horror and get scared, which it is not so.All based on girls' valentines - this movie is just an empty plastic bag with some nice colours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie - The book is much better!","review":"Believe it or not - this movie is loosely based on the book \\"Valentine\\" by Tom Savage. Really, the only similarity between the book and the movie is the concept of five school friends being killed on Valentine's Day (even the characters names in the book were changed for the movie!) While the movie turns out to be a slasher flick, the book is more of a murder/suspense novel.Surprisingly, even after reading the book first, I liked the movie.

Spoiler","review":"I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film. But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out. Scream was good everything else is just redundant. Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that. He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better. This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual sex and violence flick","review":"Come on guys, why use your acting talent on an average script like this one?David Boreanaz basically transplanted his Angel good-guy persona onto this movie. We never see him being bad. He is capable of much more complex work, as he showed several times in the Angel TV series.The same can be said of Denise Richards. She is beautiful, and she plays the vixen well, but the complexity is beneath her talent.The script is average, and the premise is tired. I know you moviemakers and team all have to earn a living, but we live for your work, so don't disappoint us so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be that Psycho's \\"Valentine\\"","review":"People shouldn't make fun of nerds in high school.

Well, a group of girls grow up and remember the geeky guy on Valentine's Day. They are murdered one by one and it seems like the killer could be the ultra dork!

To my surprise, this movie was way better than I thought. I thought that it would be an ok movie with lame murder scenes, but it was exactly the opposite! The movie was GREAT, and the murder scenes where anything but lame. The story is mainly about a kid that was tourmented as a child, who now wants revenge on the people that rejected him and made fun of him. And does he get his revenge.

It is a great thrill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valentines Day Never Looked So Bad. 3/10","review":"I am a huge horror fan and was expecting a really good horror but instead I got a boring thriller. The death scenes are so boring,there is no action the killer just kills his victims and there is no chase. I mean the story was okay but it did drag a little and you could tell who the killer was right away.I think Denise Richards did pretty well but her death scene was too cheasy. I feel her character was a pretty strong woman but her death was weak, they could've used a little more action on her part. Also there is a character named Lily who I enjoyed and then she died it was so stupid because the killer shot her with arrows and she just stood there. The ending was so stupid and way too dark believe me this is one valentine you will wanna skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will You Be My Valentine?","review":"Revenge is sweet, just like a valentine bonbon...at least a phsyco killer cupid thinks so.

This movie failed in every element to provide a scary movie. The first weak element was the directing.The second weak element was the plot. The story did not deliver anything new. It was a big failure, because it was just a bad mimic for the best scary movies Halloween, Scream, Urban Legend & I know What You Did Last Summer.The third weak element was that everything was very much predictable, even the ending too was weak & predicatable.The fourth weak element was the lack of suspense. Of course when the directing, plot & events are weak how can there be suspense?!!Simply this movie was not creative at all. I'd recommend \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best slasher flick so far","review":"When Valentine just came out, it was rated 18 A, so I couldn't see it.

Trust me, it's worth all of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"When I got this game I was expecting some fast and furious gameplay. Thats all I got. The graphics are good, but the gameplay is horrible!!! For some one like me, who loves statistics and seeing how well your players are doing individually midway through the season, forget it. NO STATISTICS!!! You can't put players at different positions, and create players or have roster changes, because it simply won't let you have this simple option. Besides that it has dumb gimics like playing against a team of dolphins, why??? There is no point to playing the game since you can't see h ow well you team is doing individually or any of that stuff. It's just play play play, and it gets boring and redundant after a while. I recommend renting it first, thats what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOING MORE TO THE GAME!","review":"I REALLY THINK THAT MIDWAY SHOULD HAVE MADE RED CARD MORE BETTER IN GRAPHIC WAYS.

FIFA is Better.","review":"I expected alittle more from this game. I thought the game would be easy to play, but the controls are very awkward. I prefer FIFA alot more. You never get a good \\"feel\\" for the game where it feels like your really playing.--BUT.....I really love the announcers!! You can change the announcers to a few other languages!!! This is the first time I ever saw this! I love the Spanish announcers--GoooaaaaaLLLLLLL!!!GOL,GOL,GOL,GOL,GOL!!!!!--They sound awesome just like on t.v.--But if it weren't for the feature of changing the language of the announcers, I would probably trade this one in tomorrow!!I think Fifa World cup is the best, I just wish they had more teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"For the first 20 levels the game is better fun. All you do is destory buildings and eat people. Its a good game to play with a friend. The bad part is the game has over 150 levels. So that can get boring if you don't have a menory card."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to smash things and nothing else...","review":"If you like to smash things and do nothing else, then this game is for you. While it is fun at first, choosing your giant character and crushing things, it gets real old real fast. The cities you encounter look remarkably (unremarkably) alike. The controls are tight but there are very limited actions to perform. There is very little challenge to this game, as it offers unlimited replays. Playing with or against friends will offer another avenue, but still, it is more of the same. The music is also repetitive and the so-called enemies (police, tanks, civilians) are the same with every level. While the cartoonish appearance of this game may appeal to some, it doesn't make for any real substance. Rent it first before you buy...replay value is minimal at best. Try Spiderman if you want more action and substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and dull","review":"If you play one level, you've played them all. The cities look almost alike, and you do the same thing every time. They have thrown in a few bonus levels, but they still don't make the game any better. I was excited by seeing new characters and all, but after playing it once I never wanted to play it again. The original was more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a game I could have done without","review":"Is this series still around? Why? This game gets old REAL fast and is a waste a time.

Thanks a lot, Midway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun game... for the first 20 minutes!","review":"This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long.I think I'll sell it the first chance I get.

Kane & Abel was very nice, but this second installment of the series was several notches below. Almost 50% of the book is a recap of the first book (though things are narrated from Florentyna's views, but a rehash nonetheless). The second half of the book is too procedural, in the sense that anyone not knowing the American election system will be absolutely lost and bored. The second half is a little too descriptive of the electoral processes, and even otherwise there is really nothing much to the plot. Planning to now read 'Shall we tell the President'..... hope that turns out to the usual Archer affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Loved Kane & Abel & was looking forward to reading the sequel. I understand that in a sequel you briefly recap some of the history that happened in the book before but I found the first half of this book, except for a few added details was basically a recap of Kane & Abel - in fact the one chapter was word for word what happened in Kane & Able. It was kind of like re-watching a movie you had already seen. I found myself wanting to skip pages till I got to a part where I did not already know what was going to happen. The second half of the book was mostly politics which I know interests a lot of people but personally for me was incredibly boring.....I should have stopped at Kane & Able"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.

Not so this time. Girl meets world, girls wants it, girl overcomes all kinds of obstacles, girl gets world.

I have gotten through 70% of the book and I'm bored solid and there's not one character in the book that I can say I even like (or don't like). They're all dull. I've read all of Nelson DeMille and David Baldacci and I thought I would try a new author. My search continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Hours.","review":"I kept waiting for something exciting to happen.

About the first 200 pages are a recap of \\"Kane and Abel\\" and is about the earlier life of Florentyna--not covered in the first of the series. It gets a bit too political as you get into the story, and it reveals the background maneuvers politicians make to get ahead, leaving Florentyna trying to be one step ahead. It's a \\"must\\" to read \\"Kane and Abel\\" first. I did not bother to read the third book in the series. About Florentyna: She's a strong woman with determination, not unlike her father and father-in-law. Enjoyed the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved item","review":"I had purchased one of these in a store many years ago. I loved it and got many refills. However over the last few years I no longer saw them in my stores or the refills. So I was using the old bottles to refill with another kind of liquid oil. It just was not the same. Have purchased many things from Amazon and thought let's see if they have these Oust fans and lo and behold they did. I purchased 4 of them and my house is once again smelling like it use to years ago. I just hope to be able to get the refills in the near future. I like that they are battery operated and I can take them into any room. If I don't want the scent coming out I can easily turn them off for a few hours and turn it back on when I want them to cycle again. In my opinion well worth the purchase. Thanks Amazon so glad I found them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Gabarek's early masterpieces - bizarre yet light","review":"One of the signature avant garde jazz sessions of the early 1980's - Magico is an overlooked classic - the music is thickly textured - colorful - engenders atmosophere - Gabarek and Gismonti were a happy combination - and all that they recorded together in their too brief collaboration is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to \\"Love's Holiday\\"???????","review":"This is an excellent CD, but how can you have the best of Earth Wind and Fire and not have \\"Love's Holiday\\"????????

However, it is not complete enough (hence Vol. 1) because it does not contain great songs/hits like \\"Saturday Nite\\" (1976), \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" (1979), and \\"Let's Groove\\" (1981). All of these songs are included in the single CD collection Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits, which is a much more complete collection on 1 CD (plus, it has remastered sound).

Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written battlefield account","review":"This little book is a well written account of the May 1864 battle at Reseca, Georgia. This is great for the Civil War or history buff, or the genealogist.

Good book well worth reading and owning to remember a lesser known but important battle where so many died during the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke is in your hand","review":"Worst movie I see this year the trailer was better then the movie. It just gets lamer as I watched and the movie is 40 min too long. For a hall pass movie you would expect to see some nude females but this movie is PG when it comes to females then it has a scene with two naked guys showing it all this is the reason it is Rated R but come on. Except for that jokes are those you taught were funny in high school, the guys pretend to be super stupid and lame whats with all the nasty bathroom humor and I mean real defecation, do not while watching this or you will be puking next out of nastiness rank 10 out 10 on nastiness level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be funny?","review":"I think the producers, directors, and actors weren't on the same page when they made this movie. It seemed like they were trying hard to go the Hangover route, but also trying to make it into a good-hearted comedy. Similar to the 40 year old virgin. which is probably why the two main guys were such geeks. I didn't find myself caring much about them and their situations.I don't mind the raunchy crude comedy, but if you are going to go that route. You need to go all the way and be over the top. The whole thing seemed too scripted and didn't really flow.Also, this movie should not be an hour and forty five minutes long. They need to have a director's cut and throw out about 20-30 minutes. I actually stopped it at an hour and thirty minutes.I should have stopped it a lot sooner.Although I didn't know what happened at the end and wasted all that time watching up to that point. I really couldn't care less, but If I had to guess, I'm sure I could figure out the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood is clamoring for the life boats.","review":"Most of my favorite actors have already abandoned Hollywood and are wisely pursuing their own careers. The rest, of course, have signed on to this mess of a movie. This film contains every single actor and actress that are still aboard and rapidly sinking with the ship.Sure, there are very talented writers out there trying to pitch their ideas to Hollywood, but Hollywood is still going with horrible scripts written by their first cousin's brother-in-law. And their lack of vision shows. Nay, it shines!Inspired by a book of 100 dirty jokes, this flick fails to amuse, and least importantly, completely wastes your time. Instead, I encourage everyone to turn this stupidity off, and go out and do some good in the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is not as described","review":"I order this item, and it is not a blu-ray/dvd/digital combo pack.

Overall it is humorous, a couple of laugh-out-loud scenes and some subject matter that will get you and your spouse talking and gigglin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea but didn't work out","review":"This seems like a great potential story: two men are given a week off from their marriage to do whatever they want. It didn't work out that way. The movie bombed. The acting by the male characters, especially Sudekis', was marginal, and the ending was trite and predictable--and a lame car chase scene didn't help. Of course, these guys were not going to cheat on their wives, duh.What could have been a decent movie was almost unwatchable. Of course, a mandatory car race occurs at the end, which does nothing to enhance the quality of this movie. Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate did a respectable performance as the idiots' wives, but it wasn't enough to save this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flatulently unfunny","review":"Another comedy with no actual comedy. Who watches this trash? The IQ level is sub-moronic. Now, I like gross-out humor as much as the next guy, but, please, entertain me while doing it. This mess never gets off the ground.

Not even worth for single star. Too crap script and no laugh at all. Recommend not to buy this movie in any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Not worth the cost of rental. No, you don't watch this for the acting or the amazing writing -- which is good because the acting and writing are horrible. You watch it because it's supposed to be funny. There were maybe 2-3 truly funny parts, but they are so few and far between it makes the rest of the movie painful. I nearly just turned it off and abandoned the movie three times. Not worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inversely Proportional to # of Songs","review":"Besides a poorly designed and viewer unfriendly DVD menu (e.g. lack of chapter or subtile options) the next obvious criterion for quickly discerning the quality of a movie is the number of songs used as a filler for lack of acting, story, script, directing, etc. and this production had 42, yes 42 songs of mostly poor unknown quality at that. Possibly a record for any movie in history thus far. The over 17 rating forewarning at the beginning tells of \\"crude sexual language\\" that plus filler music plus the principal theme of old guys looking at young females should tell us something about the value of 90 minutes of American time. The only explanation is that these rom-coms must be produced for lonely dissatisfied American men and women still stuck in some adolescent fantasy world.The only surprise is that neither a N.Y. or L.A. studio was the customary cash cow assembly line source for this well worn redundant genre. Money speaks and Atlanta listened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farrelly brothers no more","review":"they ruined the careers of some fine actors. Everything was bad, even the lighting was horrible like I had a bad copy (no this is NOT special effects). The acting was as if they said, here read your lines.

Of course, the men are so out of practice and completely tame from years of marriage that they really do nothing...a little unbelievable, given the married men I know. Of course, the wives have an effortless time getting something going with new men, so the Hall Pass kinda backfires. It was funny in places but the ending is bad, with one of the characters getting away with her transgression a little to easily to be rewarding. Not the Farelly Brothers best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea is good, but not the movie","review":"The idea of getting a 'Hall Pass' from marriage sounds great, who would not like that? After watching the movie my wife told me 'absolutely not!', there you have it.There were few parts that were funny, but I would not consider this movie a comedy. Maybe it was the script that was bad. It really is not a family movie to watch with children.For those of you who have idealistic opinions about marriage with children, you should see this movie to see how it is like in real life. Yes, men will do all of those things portrayed in this movie (perhaps women too, I wouldn't know), except the crass conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been funny","review":"Love the actors, but the acting (probably because of the script) was horrible! The babysitter did the best acting job - seriously. Some say it makes the men look like idiots, and somehow the women 'win' in the end. Honestly, I'd have to believe someone in this movie was real before feeling offended. There is gross out toilet humor , a couple of boobs, and what I think to be (but who knows) a fake male body part.

Obviously not for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically Derivative Screenplay, Predictable Average Direction","review":"What does it say when the best parts of a film are in the outtakes?Pathetically derivative screenplay and predictably average direction. Pretty much what you would expect mixing 'Fried Green Tomatoes' with 'The Hangover'.The best gag: Stephen Merchant in one of the outtakes. One could say that his most prominent presence comes at the end - and takes place there too. X-DYikes, I'm going to have a difficult time watching/listening to the man when he does his bit on the Ricky Gervais Show and the upcoming 'An Idiot Abroad, The Bucket List'. {:-DBut you can't really rate one funny scene and one sexy scene beyond anything execpt barely palatable.

More movie-of-the-week than theater going movie, the acting is the major propellent in this piece. Weaver plays a overworked, underacknowledged mother, wife, and school nurse, who while watching her best friend's daughters tragedy strikes. Weaver's character is brought to the edge and back, while her husband now has to learn how to care for all the things he just seemed to overlook so easily because his wife was there.

I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the lack of background music in many parts, but I couldn't get into the emotion that should have come with the movie.

And Christian sounds exactly how he wanted to on \\"Night Train\\", which he plays completely solo. As he states in the liner notes, he only worked it out 15 minutes before recording, and he simply wanted it to sound as low down, gritty, nasty, and funky as possible.

They also tend to come into money and success repeatedly through pure accident. In most of his books, the story is sufficiently well done that I gloss over this and enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, The Prince of Beverly Hills carries forward the worse aspects of all Woods' plots, but with little plot or story; it meanders around, miraculous things happen to the main character (through little effort of his own) and then ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beverly Hills Sleeper","review":"Definetly not one of Stu's best.

I hope he pens another book on the main character here, Rick Barron, and his lovely actress-wife. Half the interest is because of the timing and the setting of the novel: 1930s and '40s Hollywood. You just can't beat that era for atmosphere, and Woods takes full advantage of that. Thanks, Stuart, for another page-turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Some of the editorial reviews mentioned that this book was a thriller - it wasn't, in my opinion. Have never read Woods before, but found his book to be pretty entertaining. Rick Bannon joins the elite Hollywood scene as security guard for a major studio. His position involves protecting movie stars from themselves, and we follow him through the course of some months at this job and the troubles he encounters. It was a bit like LA Confidential I guess.. very old Hollywood, and the feeling you get is the same.. old style. The only part I disliked was the ending (well, the last few chapters). The last few chapters dealt with the war, and it seemed very out of place and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual standards","review":"I have read all of Wood's various books starting with the sailing book he wrote years ago.

Very simple plot lines and a new character who was so much like Stone Barrington I don't know why he even created a new one. Every characteristic of this \\"new\\" character screamed Stone Barrington to me. This looks like a book that was just tossed out and it is an insult to all the fans of Woods for him to give us a book that he obviously didn't take pride in. I will be more careful with his next book and not just buy it because it is written by Woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Stuart Woods' Best Efforts","review":"I usually buy Stuart Woods books as soon as they come out, but somehow this one I missed. I got it recently when a bookstore had a buy 3 get one free sale. I'm glad I didn't actually spend any money on it. It's a fairly 'ho-hum' story, where the action just never seems to pick up. The ending of the book was also a big disappointment for me. I think there was so much more potential in the story, but Woods' just wasn't up to some of his better efforts. One of my personal favorites still is Imperfect Strangers. Some of his more recent books just haven't had the same level of suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun novel to follow along","review":"I enjoyed this novel for a few reasons. First, it's a new character for Stuart Woods and not one that will spin off his other world of Stone Barrington and Holly Barker. Second is that the setting has changed. Now we are in 1939 Hollywood versus today New York. The mingling with movie stars, media moguls and mobsters was good. The story keeps moving and stays interesting though filled with some how-to-make-a-movie facts. The charater, as usual, continues to follow a string of good luck with wealth and women. And, as usual, is a pilot. Since this is a new character I go along with developing him, this time.

It's the third time in a row that something I bought from amazon.com came defective and I was in a hurry, and tried to get this thing going once, twice, the motor took a deep breath, turned and whizzed, and then stopped, then came alive and stopped again. I dismantled it, reinstated it, tried again... and then it got stuck ... and ... well, I just lost it. I still need an onion chopper. I know amazon would have taken it back and given credit or another unit. But I saw red, what can I tell you? Needed to vent my frustration, break some legs, and ended up punishing myself :-((("},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably my worst purchase","review":"This item was of absolutely no use when it comes to cutting/chopping vegetables. The container is small, cleaning is difficult. The blades just cut the vegetables so fine that it turns to gravy. Also, to use this one has to cut the vegetables into smaller pieces anyways, so it is better to spend 10 more seconds and cut them further. (I am a student and thought this would help me quicken the process - but the answer is a resounding NO.)This product does not deserve the praise it got from others. Definitely do not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Chopper","review":"The Black & Decker 1-1/2 cup electric chopper was purchased to provide a second chopper. The first chopper was purchased several years ago and has been an excellent product. However, this chopper is a different story. It is a very noisy chopper. It sounds as though the gears have no lubrication and will soon be ground to dust. Also, the plastic lid was extremely difficult to rotate to engage the safety switch.Performance was so bad the chopper was returned to Amazon for replacement. Amazon's performance was very good, including free return postage, and the replacement soon arrived. The replacement was also very noisy but the plastic lid operation was better. Except for the noise, operation is satisfactory. I believe this chopper will have a short life. This experience and similar problems with other Black & Decker products, all made in China, have soured my opinion of Black & Decker.I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work, not worth it to exchange under warranty","review":"I received this as a gift and it was dead on arrival. I called Black & Decker customer support and was told that I can exchange it for a working chopper if I paid all the shipping & handling costs of mailing them the plug (for proof) and having them ship me a new one. The total cost comes out to about $9, which isn't worth it considering the $11 price of this chopper. I'm just going to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"DELIVERED DAMAGED ???","review":"Purchased this to give to my mom for Christmas. Arrived on time however, it was just in the normal Black & Decker box and by looking at it, I could tell it had taken a beating. I made sure I kept all the paperwork just in case. My mother was eccastic when she opened her gift however, a week later when she went to use it .... NOTHING ! Tried several times and several outlets (she lives in an apt.) and nothing worked. She then brought it to me and we tried here as well. In fact, at one point it did start but lasted only approx. 5 seconds ! I'm now returning it back. Amazon requests you send back in a box ... I will wrap with paper and add label and forward that way. If Amazon cannot do the decency of sending out packages (especially with electronics) properly, why should I spend extra money to send it back ... it's damaged goods anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was used","review":"I received the box and noticed it was a little damaged.

Don't waste your time and money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy at chopping and surely doesn't pulse","review":"$15.99 wasted on this useless gadget. The positives: small and portable, looks nice and cleans up easily. The real deal: it doesn't really chop or pulse (ironically with a pulse button), except making loud noises and spins the food around in the safety-locked bowl. I would have packed it up for return had I not kept it in the cabinet for months before taking a test drive. After one use this shiny toy is going into the donation bin.Usually I am pretty good at reading up reviews and doing research before making a purchase. Guess I bought into the hype of glowing user reviews and Amazon Best Sellers Ranking status. Who wouldn't want a good looking, portable, cheap yet powerful food chopper that also pulses amazingly? Sadly, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It!","review":"I bought this bigger chopper to replace a much small one, to save time. What I ended up with was a chopper that took more time to chop because the blade keeps popping up when it is turned on. The food pushes up against the blade as it chops, there is nothing that holds it down to stop this from occurring. What a waste of money and time, I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Nice HANDY product to have in every kitchen. Works great and speeds up the job (I did everything by hand before)You have to make sure everything is on tight our it will not work - it is a safety feature; but when it first happened to me - I thought it was broke. If you press the button and nothing happens... check everything out -- could be operator error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopping? Uhm, no.","review":"This B&D is the right size and its small footprint would make it perfect for my kitchen...if only it did what it's supposed to do! It doesn't really chop, it turns things into mush - as if you had used a blender. Even experimenting with pulsing time and length doesn't yield chopped produce for, say, making salsa (I wish it turned out salsa as good-looking as the product picture). May be good for baby food, but if chopping is what you need, this isn't the right tool for that. Oh, and let's not forget to mention that it is also extremely loud. No, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal utility","review":"This product varies little from a small size blender. It is a stretch to label it a chopper. It is incapable of chopping raw carrots and minces onions into small particles. It lacks the power to handle difficult chopping assignments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but not good","review":"I used to own a Magic Bullet but had to replace it. I was looking for something temporary until I make a big investment. The reviews for this chopper seemed descent so I bought it only to be disappointed. This chopper does not have the power to blend fine mix. I can barely use it. I would not recommend this product even if it's cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor died after few uses","review":"This machine worked fine until it just stopped. Although we'd had it maybe two years, it was not used often, maybe 20 times tops. So rather disappointed. Called Black & Decker customer service, but they were neither helpful nor sympathetic. Since we had a Black Decker mini oven that also died an early death, will not buy that brand again. They just don't make things as well as they used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used frequently","review":"The little size of this chopper is what makes it so perfect. Its compact size makes it easy to store. Because it is easy to clean, it will be used frequently for small chopping jobs. It is NOT a powerhorse, but it is perfectly acceptable for the size and the very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"the chopper is super load when it's turned on. it does not really chop big pieces, you have to sort of manually chop them first to make the pieces small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"This order was purchased as a Christmas gift and shipped to the new owner.

But nobody seems to carry it.So, we ordered from Amazon. We were excited when the new chopper arrived. But were completely disappointed when we plugged it in for the first time. This new machine is horrendously noisy. It sounds as if the motor has not been balanced at all and the plastic will vibrate apart on its own. There is NO WAY we could stand to use such a noisy piece of junk. We promptly shipped it back to Amazon for a refund.We have still not found a suitable replacement for our old unit, which is still limping along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues, not unusual for B&D.","review":"Motor on this product barely turns at first, makes awful noises, and then seems to \\"loosen up\\" after using it for a while. Had the same product previously and it worked great, so second one is obviously a lemon. However, 50/50 on product quality gets you a 1 in my book. When it works, it is a handy little chopper, especially since my wife likes to make everything from scratch and size and form factor are good. Buyer beware of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Bought this chopped after having had wonderful experiences with 2 of the original B&D 2-speed chopper. The 2 speed chopper is a kitchen must have, but it's not longer produced. The new single speed replacement is disappointing. Going from 2 speeds to 1 forces you to pulse to control the chop size (to avoid juicing the item), the bowl is VERY difficult to remove, the instructions do not note that there is a trick (squeeze & turn) to remove the bowl. This is a problem if your hands are damp or you don't have major hand strength. Got rid of the new unit, pulled out the old one and will continue to hand sharpen the blade and pray the motor holds up. Sadly no replacement blades are available for my wonderful little chopped. Save your money and time and passt on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this to replace an older model because the plastic basket had gotten very worn. Unfortunatly this new one is more difficult to use because the plastic basket is very difficult to properly engage in the base. It seems that the plastic nubs that engage are just a bit too big, and every time I have to force it together I am afraid that I am going to crack the plastic basket.I loved the old model I had and that is why I replaced it with this one.I have been tempted to contact Black and Decker about this, but haven't so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not chop","review":"I purchased this product in January and today had to chop some herbs for a receipe and guess what it did not chop Rosemary or Basil.

Well, that is not much help at all. Also comes with a little tab lock on the plug to ensure that you cannot return it as new even though it most certainly does not work for my needs. May work for salsa or herbs. Don't know yet, but this is certainly not what I wanted! Back to my big kitchen aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I got this based on the many positive reviews here and I'm totally disappointed. It does not chop, a little bit of the peppers I experimented with turned to some unedible mush, the bulk just spins around in the bowl. Totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This compact chopper was a replacement for one that finally wore out after many years.This new chopper does not get the job done. I used it to chop onions/celery etc. for use in stuffings, eggs etc. It took way too long to get things chopped and even then they weren't chopped enough. It ran so long it felt like I would burn out the motor.Can not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"The origial model 300HA was better because the blades were closer together and did a better job of quick chopping small quantities.

It demonstrates the Coen brothers genius on so many levels. Once again they produce great charecters in Chet(steve buscemi), charlie(john goodman), and of course Barton Fink(john tuturro). I highly suggest this film to those that enjoyed Fargo and for those that haven't seen it yet.Warning!!!! ----no action, so those that need buildings blowing up every two seconds to enjoy a movie, don't watch this film, for those that like movie excellence you should enjoy Barton Fink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and Intelligence of Coen Brothers","review":"If you have seen one of the Coen Brothers' movies and liked it, you should try this one. One of the greatest movies that Coen Brothers produced. This movie would take you to a surreal world. A world that you can not imagine.John Turturro and John Goodman play excellent. John Turturro is an idealist scriptwriter. But he should think differently when he is writing a script in a Hollywood style. John Goodman who shines in a brilliantly conceived and executed role. He is my man. While I will not give away the secret behind his character, this is not a performance that any true movie fan will want to miss. It is one of the most dynamic and powerful performance in recent memory. And so, you will not want to miss this, the Coen brothers most original and tightest film, even beyond their other masterpiece, \\"Fargo.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Barton Fink delivers twisted thoughts","review":"John Tuturro is a writer who moves to LA on a deal with a movie business, who suffers from writers block and starts to go insane. John Goodman consoles him becomes his friend, but he turns out to be a madman who kills a lot of people. Both Turturo and Goodman are terrific and this movie will take you an a twisted look at insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cohen brothers film by far","review":"I'm a big fan of the Cohen brothers as well as John Goodman and Jon Turturo, but I did not enjoy this film. They wrote the film while they had writer's block during the creation of Miller's Crossing and it shows. The plot is incredibly flat and slow. The climax with John Goodman is completely predictable and that makes for a boring ending to an incredibly boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with This One","review":"Barton Fink is a poorly written and directed film. It is a string of random clichés with some bad language and a little violence thrown into the mix and little more. Calling this a movie is an insult to the real movies out there.My advice is save your money and buy almost anything else. A more descriptive title would be \\"Rotten Stink\\" John Goodman is a fine actor and this is the worst film I have ever seen him associated with. I am also a fan of the Coen Brothers, but this is just a bad movie.The movie has no action, it is not funny, it is not romantic, it is not intellectual, it has no plot and it just sort of flops around on the screen like a fish out of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks.","review":"This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Do not watch it. Save two hours of your life. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"A wonderful and very surreal movie, boasting an expectedly incredible performance from John Turturro, and probably the best performance of John Goodman's career. Not a popcorn-and-beer movie, but a treat for those looking for something a bit different. Incredibly visually stylish, atmospheric, and delightfully funny, in an obscure sort of way (\\"Writers come and go; we always need Indians.\\") Also a good example of a piece of art that isn't going to make perfect sense to you, but will leave you with plenty to try to puzzle out, if you're into that sort of thing (Kafka lovers should have a blast with this movie.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully Designed, But Useless","review":"Watch this movie to see several fine actors give fine performances. John Mahoney, John Goodman, Judy Davis, all do good work. The cinematography, art direction, costume design, special effects, sound mixing: all are absolutely first rate. If only the script and direction were up to the standard of the rest of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up to Miller's Crossing","review":"Miller's Crossing made me think that the Coens may be the greatest active moviemakers America had to offer. Barton Fink did a lot to confirm that. It's beautiful to look at, and fun to watch, with outstanding performances from the entire cast. John Turturro and John Goodman are both amazing in this. The dialogue is fantastic, although not as wonderfully lyrical as in Miller's Crossing.As with Miller's Crossing, I was hoping for an all-out, deluxe, special edition once this came to DVD. While the extras are nice, I wanted more. Still, the movie looks great, and it's wonderful to finally own it in widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck did I just watch (spoiler alert)","review":"What was in the box?How did he take off the handcuffs?Was John Goodman real? or is this like the fight club thing?Why was the fire accommodating him,is John Goodman the devil?Why did the last scene look like the picture in his room?Who killed the girl?What the heck did I just watch.I'm not going to pretend I understood this movie just to sound smart or cool.

Every line is genius and every character, even the smallest bit parts are expertly written and played. Every award this movie has won is well deserved.

I can and will tell you some things about this game. The graphics are good but not great, the missions are fun unlike wreckless, you get to use a varity of weapons as you progress through the game, but what bothers me is that you can redo a mission over and over again completing sub missions untill you beat it. You should have to do it all in one to make it more challenging. When you shoot foot troops they break like playdo which gets very annoying after a while. Not to mention that you can transform to different vehicles such as a boat a motorcycle and more.

There's an amazing amount of talent that was involved in it, and I had very different expectations. I admit, I'm a sucker for Hollywood endings and neatly packaged films. However, I also like movies that explore characters rather than follow a strong plotline.This film was a character study. The serial killer plot was really secondary to the psychological exploration of Jack Nicholson's character. However, as is a real danger with this type of movie, I found it to be excruciatingly slow and unsatisfying. Penn teases you repeatedly, making you believe that there will be a conclusion, that the killer will be caught (or at least, will kill again), then never satisfies you. By the time the movie ended, I was frustrated and saddened. If you're just looking for a two hour escape from life, you probably won't enjoy this film.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icky Topic","review":"I went to see \\"The Pledge\\" purely because of its very good director and an excellent cast. Jack is always at his best and he did very well here again. I'm not worried about revealing the actor who played the killer because as soon as I saw his name on the opening credits, it was very obvious that it had to be... \\"Tom Noonan\\". All of you should have, or will, pick that up too. A bit typecast. However, the choice of this seedy topic is not one I was too keen on viewing. Even though the issue is a possible reality in our sometimes sick and evil world, I would have preferred if the topic were altered to exclude violence on children. Personally, I don't care to view bloodied bodies of kids. It makes me wanna go grab the murderer and smack his head in. Otherwise, the movie was well made, but it left me with anger over how anyone could perpetrate such a crime.

Great news...","review":"We all know Nicholson can act. And tha''s the only thing worthwhile in this movie: to watch him interpret in a great and convincing manner a retired cop haunted by a Pledge to solve the murder of a little girl. But that's all you will get from this movie, fellow.Penn's direction is slow, uninspiring. No, I'm not just another fast-food film consumer. But it was clear for me that Penn tried to design a special mood for the film, but id not work. The cast is also misleading to potential audience: we've got the names of Del Toro and Rourke: they appear briefly, no more than four minutes, probably paying some kind of favor to Penn.It was not a total waste of time, but it came close. MOvies like Charlie's Angels are a TOTAL waste of time because they're total junk; movies like this one comes close because they heroically try to be bigger than they really are, and it does not always work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I liked this movie up to the point that I realized that he was using the girlfriend's daughter as bait for a serial child murderer.

I mean, from the previews and such, I thought that \\"The Pledge\\" was going to be a really good movie.

I haven't seen Nicholson ever since \\"As Good As It Gets\\" and really, I just have to say, \\"Why, Jack?!\\" I've seen better Jack Nicholson movies than this, such as \\"As Good As It Gets\\", \\"Batman\\", \\"Wolf\\", and \\"The Crossing Guard\\". But \\"The Pledge\\" has to be among the worst ones. And I really don't know what to say about Sean Penn's directing in this film right now.

I'm not just talking about the ending here either. It starts with a good premise, then drags on at length with a less than entertaining story of an old man.Don't get me wrong, it's well acted. The fact that the ending was disappointing isn't all that bad either. It's more the fact that you get slowly dragged along, waiting for the interesting/exciting part. Afterwards you're left to think about the film and reflect on what little went on. Some people turn that into \\"boy this movie is great because it's different from other movies.\\" Originality doesn't mean entertainment though.

Despite what appeared to be an all star cast, the plot and dialogue of this film is depressing and pointless. It is one thing to be melancholy when there is a point to be made or human aspect worth exploring. The sole purpose of this film, however, appears to be the infliction of the writer and director's morose outlook on the human condition.The plot of the film takes forever to develop, then goes nowhere. The characters are not at all engaging, and the filmaking is a disjointed mess.I would not recommend this film to anyone. It has no redemming value whatsoever.

The writers do their best to add a twist to the overly predictable ending. The film is also a two hour long ad for the cigarette companies. Almost everyone smokes and they smoke constantly while awake. But, \\"everyone smokes in hell.\\" Jack Nicholson gives a good performance and is the only cement that holds this film together. There are lots of cameo appearances from big name celebrities. These appearances do nothing for this film other than add some well known names to the DVD box in hopes that you buy it due to \\"star power.\\" We purchased The Pledge as a part of a two-for deal with The Departed.

Because he promised to solve the case, he sticks with it to the dismay of his friends in the police department.Jerry's problem I think has less to do with him being unable to let things go and more to do with his inability to find other things besides police work to bring more meaning into his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pledge is gritty which is a good thing.","review":"This film differs from what you would normally excpect from a crime investigation film in the way that there is not alot of action and car chases etc but in my opinion that is what makes this a good film the diversity factor. You can truley empathise with Jerry Black who is at times resembling a mute in the way he doesnt say anything in the heat of the moment like the main twist at the end when his life seems to be going up after retirement but to start come crashing down again by a twist of fate.

Retired Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) instantly thinks something is wrong, and he goes on the search. Then the movie goes off. Nothing else happens. You keep thinking something will happen, but nothing ever does. The ending is awful. Sean Penn had the knowledge and resources and a good story to make a good movie, but instead he makes an awful movie. The movie is slow. At the end we really don't know who murdered that girl, we get sort of an idea, but nothing for sure.

The acting was good and I was interested half-way through the film until I realized that this was an almost carbon-copy of the 1994 film.I had a real problem with the ending too. I think it was a mistake and made the whole exercise really pointless.

It is nothing of the sort. There's no action chases, no gunfights, and no simple resolution. Instead it's about the protagonist's slow slip into obsession, to the point where he commits a moral crime himself in his monomaniac crusade. A happy ending would have betrayed this (although, for those interested, the novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt has an even bleaker ending)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geez.","review":"I am not sure I will ever see another Penn-Nicholson movie.

There is a great message in the movie about \\"strangers\\" and kidnapping-even in a small town. However, I think the movie was too long and too drawn out. Nickolson's character was suffering from paranoia about the little girl being kidnapped and killed. He made a promise to one of the girl's mother to get to the bottom of it and not to quit until they find the person that killed her little girl. He keeps (or at least tries to) his promise and even though he was now retired, he still continued to search for the person that killed the little girl...paranoid and all. Not worth my time.

Benecio del Toro did a fabulous job as a developmentally delayed man acccused of a horrific crime, but his performance is the only bright spot in this blight of a film. His performance was not enough to rescue the film from a frustrating plot line, Jack Nicholson wandering around for half of the movie looking confused, and some continually convoluted reference to the \\"real killer\\" somehow involving hedgehogs. In summary, find a different movie for movie night, this one is waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Disapointing!! Great talent but a terrible movie.","review":"Considering the talent this is a very disjointed movie. Benicio Del Toro is only on for five minutes. The same for Helen Mirren.The great Jack Nicholson is wasted. This is NOT a happy ending movie. Sean Penn has a very disapointing directing style. It is slow and disjointed. My wife liked it.(there is no accounting for taste!) In my opinion this is NOT a TWO hour popcorn movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!","review":"How could such a star-powered cast have ever agreed to act in this bomb? Did they even read the script? And what was Sean Penn thinking? How many nature shots do we have to have to substitute for plot developments? What heavy-handed directing, particularly the storm clouds gathering! Duh. The camera, as always, loves Nicholson but that does not make up for a real bad script and a really bad job of directing. I don't know how many times I looked at my watch, anxious for the ending, which, in itself, was a flop as well."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-b0697eeb"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/15.md","filePath":"drive/15.md"}'),B={name:"drive/15.md"},G=Object.assign(B,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
