It is bigger than the last one I had but I have a lot of room under the sink. I had the 3 screw mount and this unit came with the Easy Mount. I removed the old mount and install the Easy Mount without problems. If you are going to do it yourself I highly recomend whatching the how to videos on the web. This Old House have some great videos. The plubing video was very helpful for I don't have experience doing this kind of instalation. I ended up turning the dispenser and using a different set up that made the installation easier. Even though this unit is bigger than my old one it is quieter and vibrates less. It comes with a cord and plug, my old unit was a direct wire so I installed a connector and used the plug that came with the unit. Thanks for the other reviews that helped me make this decision. I am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"The install went flawlessly. It allowed me to reroute the drain piping under the cabinet to make more room for storage which was something I needed to do anyway.

I would never buy this line of products and will not install one again for anyone without warning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jury is still out.","review":"I just installed this unit. Installation wasn't as easy as others have claimed, but it was about average for replacing an old build in appliance. So far I am very disappointed in the noise (high) and drainage (slow). I will give it a little time and determine if there is a manufacturing defect or perhaps an installation problem. If I can rule out an installation problem and it continues to perform like this I will be testing the \\"Lifetime in-house warranty\\" and will update this review.A day later: Just talked to customer service about the noise. The representative listened to the noise over the phone and said that it was normal. I guess I'll live with it for awhile longer, but I still don't like the noise of this one. I have an InSinkerator at my lake cabin and it is remarkably quiet, quick and powerful.

I installed it and it works like a champ! The manufacturer provided excellent service. If you order one, make sure it shipped from Anaheim, CA, beware of Cantex.

There were two problems. My Badger was connected electrically directly to the electrical line. No plug. The Waste King came with a corded plug and required a regular outlet. I don't know if you can order it that way, but check before you order online. There was no way to use the one I ordered without cutting the cord and voiding the warranty. The other problem was that the Waste King arrived with some serious cracks around the base. Looked like it had not been packaged well. In fact, the Waste King box arrived loose in a bigger box with no packaging. The GOOD news is that return and refund procedure was very easy and I was not charged for the return postage. Wish it had worked out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the measurements aren't provided....","review":"I just opened the box and almost died at how big the unit is. It is over 14 inches from the silver connection section shown in the picture to the bottom of the unit. With my new deep sinks the disposer almost sits on the bottom shelf of my cabinet.

Sounds like it's going to break. Problem #2, running noise, it isn't just a little loud, it is horriable and sounds like it is going to tear itself apart. Replaced a 20 year old 3/4 HP insinkerator model. I wished I would have kept it, this one would come out and I'd put the old one back in. Plus it is huge in size and takes a lot of room under the sink. Don't believe the statements that it's \\"a little louder\\".

Being a guy who hates plumbing projects, I felt the installation went quite well. After removing the old garbage disposal unit, I was able to install the new disposer using only the parts that were provided with the unit. (After installation, I did need to purchase a couple plastic pipes and elbows from a local store so that the pipes would match up to the old waste pipes.) The Waste King was worked well for a month now, and is much quieter than the old unit. I'd highly recommend this unit to family and friends... I'd also recommend they purchase this unit from Amazon who had the best price available when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent customer service","review":"I bought this unit in October and had it installed in December. After two months, the unit began to leak. I discovered this only when I went down to my cellar and saw water pouring down from above. I called a plumber for an emergency repair and contacted Anaheim Manufacturing (maker of the disposal).Although the parts (drain connection, flange) were not actually part of the unit and therefore were not covered by the warranty, they offered a good faith reimbursement which I consider generous. I recommend them highly for their customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"6 months after installaton, this Waste King Disposal continues to work like a charm.

So far I am impressed with the Waste King and it's lifetime warranty. The next best I could find was a 10yr warranty for 2 1/2 times the price so I will be more impressed if this one lasts longer than that. It is very quiet compared to our old one and seems to be made very well. The installation was easy. I do remodeling and would definetly recommend this product to my customers over the Badger. Time will tell but the lifetime warranty is hard to pass up for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I bought this product because it looked like it would be easy to install and would work well being a 1 hp and it had a lifetime warranty. I have tried to install this product and haven't finished yet as it is leaking. This sink flange is tight and water is not leaking from there. The rubber gasket is on the discharge tube and it is as tight as I can make it. I put paper towels around both the flange and the discharge tube and it doesn't seem to be leaking from from either of these parts. It leaks when a lot of water is released and it drains a lot at once. I have tried everything to fix it and probably spent over 20 hours. I have an authorized plumber from the company who will come over, but he needs to get a new disposer sent and it will be another week. I thought this was going to take 2 hours max, but it was more of a month long project for me. I suspect I was sold a defective unit which caused me to waste a lot of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light weight cheap product","review":"The whole assembly is very light weight with a plastic collar that mounts to the sink flange.

It is not an option as implied by the instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster food chewing machine","review":"Very easy to install. I was skeptical as the description indicated something about an adapter kit to mate thiswith other pre-existing mounts. Look-just remove ALL of the old mount to the sink and install this 'easy-mount'.This beast will chew up anything you throw into its mouth. I have lived all my adult life (half-century mark)using 1/3 horsepower disposal units and I thought that was good enough. It was, until the prices of the lowerhorsepower units rose and it made me look into this deal on Amazon for a full horsepower, lifetime warrantedWaste King.

It is a lot quieter than our previous model. Installation was a breeze and the kit came with everything you need to install. Just make sure to account for the difference in the drop below the sink for the new drain if replacing a 1/2hp or a smaller model. The L-8000 was about an inch further below our sink than our Badger 1/2hp as far as the drain but overall length was about the same.

The unit was packaged well so there was not shipping damage. It arrived promptly (free shipping), so that alone is a plus. The unit looks well made, but will only know how well when I install it. With a lifetime warranty, though, really can't go wrong. The only negative comment I have regarding the disposer and it is not directed at the unit itself or Amazon, is that I needed a bronze colored mounting flange to match my faucet. It cost me almost $100.00 (flange, stopper and shipping). I don't think it should cost so much, but I needed it. Would have been nice if waste king made reasonably priced mounting flanges that matched more finishes for faucets on the market now.Update 10.21.2010: Just installed the unit.

It is not sturdy and a bitch to couple the disposer up to the sink connection (I could get it to work sitting on the counter but from under the sink NO WAY). STRONGLY suggest purchasing the ISE Adapter Kit, which is nothing more than some gaskets that allow the standard ISE mount to grip the Waste King. Even the Adapter has inadequate documentation but, after some head scratching you can figure out how it has to work and the mount is acceptable.

When I run the disposal when the sink is full of water though, it starts vibrating my sink and the countertop FURIOUSLY. I contacted their customer service and they told me I shouldn't run the device this way- I should run it from an empty sink.

We will see how it holds up over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disposal.","review":"The 1 HP on this disposal is great, much more effective than my old sears 3/4 HP. It's not terribly loud either, it has a low pitched hum to it that I really don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good disposal for the price","review":"Waste King disposal seems to be working pretty good for the past month and half. No complaints, the higher rpm motor seems to be doing the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garbage disposal","review":"This product is quiet, very powerful and has never jammed or performed in a manner that was less than excellent. I was really surprised at its cost of $115 and the quality of this disposal. I was very pleased that Amazon would sell this product at such an attractive price. I've had it for 2 months or so and no problems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and powerful","review":"This is the second WasteKing L-8000 I have installed for customers in the past 3 months. Both are very appreciative that I chose this disposal. They are very quiet as well as powerful I found them very simple to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and efficient","review":"Installation was easy and fast. Besides putting it in place and tightening things, I only had to cut a little pvc to align with the currently plumbing. 1hp motor is much more quite than the 3/4hp Badger I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Price was right but doesn't grind very well","review":"The price was definitely right on an Amazon special deal at $99.99. It was easy to install and work nicely. Two cons: 1) a bid noisier than I expected and; 20 the chrome drain mounting ring scratches easily. I would have liked a stainless steel mount.Updated 2/7/12: Doesn't grind anything too fiberous like lemons, oranges or onions. TOO NOISY!! I think this one is defective! It's hard to believe other customers can rate this unit a 5 star. I'm trying to get Waste King to replace mine since I missed the return window with Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I dont know why this disposer gets such good reviews. The disposer is made of cheap plastic, and was a pain to install .I went throuh a lot of trouble replacing the flange that holds the disposer, and the twist-on collar of the disposer wouldn't fit securly without plumbers tape. Then, after 2 weeks of use, the plastic shell began to crack open!. What a dissappointment! I have no idea why consumer reports recommends this disposer over InSinkErator. When I decided to get this disposer, I thought that amazon had a great price for a 1 hp disposer. WRONG. After a bit of research i discovered that the only reason this disposer is labled as a 1 hp disposer is because of a higher starting torque. After a lot of trouble with costomer service, I finally returned it and ordered an evolution excel from ISE. Personally, I think it will worth every extra penny (it was considerably more expensive, but probably well worth it). Final warning: Do not buy this disposer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Let me start with the one positive aspect of this unit, its very easy to install. Other than that I don't have anything else good to say about it. The unit is as noisy if not more so than my old badger in sink erator. Does not grind up the garbage as quickly as the badger and you can't tell when its empty because the noise level does not change. Over all very disappointed. will keep for awhile but intend to replace with an in sink erator with in a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but easy install","review":"I learned of this disposal from Consumer Reports, who gave it a top rating and stated that the ez mount was truly easy to install. I went through the numerous reviews on amazon and came across numerous poor rating, many of which complained that the ez mount was so difficult that they could never mount the disposal. Tick another mark to the the unable to mount column. The cushion mount (gasket) is so oversized that we can not get the mount ring to grab and and mount. Numerous other reviews complined of this exact problem. Also, the help line is closed because it is a sunday and I am stuck calling a plumber in to see if he can get it to mount. Do not bother,BUY A DIFFERENT DISPOSAL, this one is a worthless headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came with support ring too tight on sink flange! Can't remove to install!","review":"We went to install the disposal and we can't get the support ring that the factory put on the sink flange to install it. Here we sit with our whole sink torn apart!!!!! and we can't disassemble to install! My husband is fuming! Nice job Wasteking. And there is no support on the weekends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"died within a year","review":"I bought this particular disposal based on very favorable online review information. Unfortunately, the disposal began to leak badly 7 months after it was put into use. We did not even bother with a warranty claim hassle on this $104 item. We just replaced it with a different brand. Maybe we just got a lemon, but I now consider this brand unreliable and poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled","review":"I'm sure this a great product, although I was misled about the sink flange. It was to be stainless, it is chrome. I will have to order from after market company as Waste King does not have other colors for the EZ mount. The only one I can find to fit the Waste King disposal will cost almost as much as the disposal! Which brings up another issue, today five days after ordering the diposal Waste King direct lowers the price and yes, the flang does cost as much as the diposal."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEED ME!","review":"Bought this unit to replace my Badger 1, 1/3 HP unit that started to dump water underneath the kitchen sink and soaked through the wall into living room carpet after running the dishwasher at bedtime...anyway, install was a breeze. I took out the 3 bolt mount from the badger and converted over to the EZ-Mount. I did not have to buy any parts except for some plumbers putty. Very glad I purchased this unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waste King 8000","review":"Purchased to replace worn out disposal in my kitchen. Got the EZ mount model due to my \\"expertise\\" in plumbing. Took about thirty minutes to install and it works. Would advise using sealant instead of rubber gasket as the drain must be very tight to not leak. Very happy and would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding product","review":"We ordered the Waste King legend 8000 and received in 2 days. Have had it installed and it is fantastic. Our original disposal, 46 years ago when we built the house, was a Waste King and we are glad to have another. Great Service and a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"This is a great disposal for the money. It is much quieter than i thought it would be and the install was rather easy until i got to the actual mounting of the unit. The retainer ring was hard to install but this could have been my wrong interpretation of the instructions. Overall, I am pleased with this unit and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Install","review":"By far the easiest install of a garbage disposal I've done. I like that you just have a rubber gasket and don't have to mess with plumbers putty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I read the reviews before ordering this and they seemed generally good, however my plumber said this was very hard to install and was not impressed with the quality. It seems noisier than other disposals I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Be Easier","review":"This really was pretty much easy as pie to install. I was a little worried because we don't have much room under the sink, but it popped right in. As others have probably pointed out, you need to make sure you seat the gasket that attaches the disposal to the drain as low as possible. A lot of people put it up too high (where it feels like it should fit), and the disposal won't mount. The assembly is all together when you pull it out of the box. Just pay attention to where the gasket is already and you won't have a problem when you put it back on. So far I love it. Easy to wire, easy to install, limited vibration. It has chewed through everything I've put down it and the warranty can't be beat. I'm all about value, and as long as you wait for this to go on sale (Amazon seems to put it on sale for $90 or less every couple of months) then this is hands down the most power for the money you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Disposer","review":"I was hesitant to buy this product at first as I read the reviews but, I am honestly satisfied with Waste King. My friend who installed it is a Plummer commented on how he had never seen a disposer come with the plug. He also said because of the weight it had to be a quality disposer. It is quiet and runs smoothly compared to the cheaper brand I replaced. This is a lifetime purchase and you can't beat it or go wrong. Anything that goes inside of this disposer is gone. Don't drop anything inside unless you want to get rid of it. This is an A plus disposer. I found an excellent price using Amazon otherwise; I would not have purchased this item. I purchased a $350 item for less than $100 with Amazon. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violated Consumer Reports no advertising policy.","review":"The seller of the Waste King L-8000 violated a long-standing, well-known, highly-pulbicized, court-supported policy of Consumer Reports by identifying Consumer Report's rating of this product on its invoice.

I would order from Merchant Express again!James G"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MASSIVE FOR A NORMAL SINK!","review":"Ordered the unit in November and finally got the plumber out for the install in late January. He had renovations being done all the while so there was a reason for the wait. This unit is the largest garbage disposal I have ever seen in my life. If it were installed, it would have a 1-inch gap between the bottom of the disposal and the bottom of the kitchen cabinet under the sink. What's worse? Since the unit is so large, you will absolutely have to re-route your plumbing. If I had mine installed it was going to cost another $400-500 in plumbing to correctly hook it up. This unit should only be used in extra tall cabinets and commercial applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"Should not have believed high ratings. Hard to mount and loud.

It is a little difficult to get on without having two people... the compression mount is very tight so you will need 4 hands to get it in position. Also pretty quiet. at first I wasn't sure it turn on so it took of my finger tips in a heart beat. I learned a lesson there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Disposal","review":"Excellent quality. Great value at under $100. I used the Waste King 3101 ISE Adapter Kit to install it in my old sink.

The Waste King instruction manual is extremely well written (even humorous in places)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Disposal","review":"We have always gotten Badger disposals. This time, I went to Consumer Reports to read their ratings, and went with the Waste King L-8000. It didn't let us down. This is the most quiet disposal we've ever had, does a great job (granted it has only been in for 3 weeks now) of handling food wastes, and surprisingly vibrates very little, much less so than any other disposal we've had. I highly recommend the Waste King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage Disposal","review":"This product was extremely simple to install and runs very smooth and quiet. I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Powerful! East to Install","review":"This product is very easy to install and trust me, I am no handyman. I have never installed a disposal before and the new mounting system is beyond easy. There are no screw and bolts like the old systems. It plugs right into the wall and let the chopping begin. I had a 1/3hp now having the 1hp it actually is so powerful that i forget to put the lid when turning it on and it threw food all the way into the living room. If you want to install yourself, this is the one! It comes with everything you need. Also item was perfectly as described. You could go elsewhere and pay at least $100 more for much less of a disposal. Stop your shopping now and just buy it, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beast!","review":"This garbage disposal is an animal! It can pretty much handle anything you dish to it. We have had it for approximately 5 months now, and I'm very pleased that I chose this over the others available. Only two comments regarding the Waste King (which are not necessarily negative)...this garbage disposal is not quiet. I think you can expect with a 1HP disposal that there will be some vibrations and noise...if you are looking for a quiet, quaint unit under your sink, this is not the disposal for you. Also, when the sink is quite full and water begins to collect, I would expect that when the disposal is turned on it would essentially suck everything down the drain. Sometimes this does not happen, and you have to assist by pushing food/ waste down the drain with a spoon. Overall, I'm happy with our purchase and would buy the same brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Worthless","review":"Thermometer is inaccurate. Compass doesn't work.

This release doesn't include their first 7\\" in it's entirety and the only version of \\"Falling\\" included is the metal version from their first album, which played as if it were an encore. Both versions should have been included. Also missing is \\"Last Sin\\" from the \\"Barricaded Suspects\\" comp. If Farrel is trying to ressurect Decry like it states in the liner notes, I'm sure these tracks will be added as \\"bonus tracks\\" to their new release to try and entice old fans to buy it.

This book gives a little insight to the tenuous hold the United States had at the beginning and it also gives some insight into why the United States needs a military.

Vega displays intensity on this album, and some of the songs are really not suited to her somewhat thin voice, leading her to change her singing style in some places to more of a passionate speaking tone. All of the songs on this album are lyrically solid, and the most memorable melody is perhaps in the song In Liverpool. This album is definitely a rhythm-oriented album, with the pace of the rhythms grabbing you and bringing you along on Vega's musical journey. A partial departure from Vega's prior pop/rock/folk style, this album is inventive and mature, reflecting Vega's feelings and social concerns at the time. For those who appreciate Vega's artistry this is a great album, although it may disappoint those who just like folk-oriented music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock In This Pocket.","review":"I have all five of Vega's cds and I think she was her most daring with 1992's 99.9F. She blended alternative electronic sounds into her music creating a kind of Nine Inch Nails/Vega sound. I like all of her work, but I think this is a classic cd along with 1996's Nine Objects of Desire. She really hit her stride here. Songs like \\"Rock In This Pocket\\", \\"Blood Makes Noise\\", \\"99.9F\\", \\"In Liverpool\\", \\"If You Were In My Movie\\" and \\"As Girls Go\\" make this a classic. This is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly original and worthwhile.","review":"I've only had the CD a few days now, but in those few days I've discovered how truly awesome this album is. Suzanna Vega's voice along with the industrial/machine-driven rock has mesmerized my ears.

Lastly, while I don't favor any one ethnic group over the other, I do find the book lacking in representation of various ethnic groups. I'm sure anyone would agree that African American women have more than ample proportions, and find it quite disturbing that a book with the title \\"DERRIERES\\" exclude such subjects that have been know for their rather bulbous bottoms.

He also spends more time on battle issues in the two world wars than would most authors of a character study of this type.

This author, Richard Holmes, writes long, complicated sentences, using many more words than needed to make his points. At times his meaning seems hidden by piles of verbiage. I often wondered, what did he actually say. That got old fast.In my short read, I found 2 points contradicting other narratives of Churchill's early life.Other books I recall, say young Churchill provided money for his beloved nurse Mrs. Everest after the family let her go with no pension. This book says he didn't, implying he was selfish for not doing so, instead focusing on getting as much money as he could out of his mother for his own wants.Other books say Churchill was psychologically neglected by his parents. This book says instead he was too emotionally demanding of attention from them, not that they were cold and unloving.

The lyrics in this album surpass all the other albums in humor and the musicality, although they are no Dream Theater, they definatly know how to play their instruments. At first listen, there are some catchy songs, but nothing that special, then once you listen again and again it really grows on you. This now is my favorite GWAR album. It's not the heaviest, or the longest, but i believe it is the fullest. It shows a variety of music and the lyrics never let you down.

It's inexplicably annoying. I mean, there's a little boy in the video who keeps falling down when almost every letter is introduced. At first, my four year and five year old were like, \\"Oookaay.\\" But then it got to a point where they didn't even want to watch the video anymore. This DVD is too long to keep a four or five year old's attention span because it is just too distracting.

The young girls in the movie are wearing short dresses, and their underwear is visible when they are sitting. In the shapes video, one of the girls is wearing a dress with a see-through top.

It's not annoying in the way that Barney is annoying. It's annoying for its low production value and because it's utterly inane. Now I'm pretty forgiving of children's educational videos, but this one really drives me crazy. Let me give you an example. There's a running joke in the ABC section where the little boy character falls down (standing flat-footed on even ground, he inexplicably falls down). This running joke is repeated 26 times--once for every letter of the alphabet. My toddler tittered the first time this happened. But even that joke wore thin for him.The producers of this video should be forced to watch it scores of times, because that's what parents have to contend with. Other than that, my toddler loves this video. Loves it! Wants to watch it over and over and over!

I don't normally go for urban (or in this case rural) fantasy, preferring my fantasy to be based off Earth but I couldn't help being spellbound by this.The narrative, characters, character \\"arcs\\", description, pacing, mood - all excellent, with incredible attention to detail. How many other writers, writing about an outsider, the decline of a relationship, your in-laws, loss, childbirth, the fragility of the human body, actually create something as worthwhile, poignant and true as this? How many of them actually have something new or meaningful to say? This book has the feel of someone really getting their teeth into the subject, squeezing every scene and character interaction for all it's worth - fantasy is much better off for this book being written. Shame on fantasy readers for letting such a gem fall out of print!You should buy it. It's terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the happy ending?","review":"All right, all romances don't have to have happy endings.

Everything goes wrong with the main character: she doesn't fit in as a child; when she finally grows up and has a family of her own, her inlaws despise her, and her son is killed in a farm accident. And despite what looks like a happy occurrence -- her childhood friend, a faun/satyr, comes back into her life -- that's doomed to misery as well.I simply can't recommend this book, unless a reader likes to see a character always unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific planning -- and touring -- guide","review":"Highly useful -- before getting to Paris and while there -- plus a fun read.

The cd was also very very boring. William Orbit should made all the songs faster and not-so-long. The only good thing about this cd is that the second disk which is a remix.

It's great to listen to while just thinking...relaxing...reading...it's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"If you've come to William Orbit via Ferry Corsten, great. *But*, beware, do not expect more of the same. I mean, don't get me wrong the remix of 'Adagio is one of the most uplifting dance tunes of recent times... This CD is at the other end of the scale, but in genre and BPM terms, not quality.It shows through that William has spent much time and effort subtly recrafting classical tracks of yesteryear into chill-out soothers for the future.I must admitt that upon my first listen I dismissed it as being too 'light'. But further listens meant I began to uncover the subtle tapestry of what he's tried to create. For instance, I think Ludwig Beethoven himself would approve of the downbeat re-working of 'Triple Concerto'.Classical lovers may turn their nose up at this, dance nutters likewise. But if you're not adverse to a bit of genre meshing, then give this a try. Though not an all-time ambient classic it's definitely worth taking this trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthy of a listen - even if a tad dull","review":"He's original: how many electronic musicians can you say \\"ah, that sounds like William Orbit\\"? He has his signature sounds. He writes his own stuff, and has his own respectable back-catalog (but WHERE is the first TORCH SONG album on CD?)He's got friends in high places.He's sexy. (ok, not)But the album is kind of dull, and lacks feeling. You want emotion? electronica with emotion? someone may have beaten me to this already, because i see 'others that bought pieces have also bought..\\" but check out GLOBAL COMMUNICATION \\"76:14\\".The original German pressing of this album had some Arvo Part tracks that didn't make it on this release, but kudos to Bill for simply \\"doing something he wanted to do\\".

Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pieces in a peaceful style.","review":"Being a fan of ambient and electronica for some time, I decided to give this a try. I can understand how some may simply hear this as a cheesy reworking of the classics, just a man and his keyboard, but it's really much deeper than that if you just sit and listen. I suggest not comparing to the originals as much as enjoying what these pieces are themselves. A few tracks do lag, and there are quiet spots, but as a whole I find \\"Pieces In A Modern Style\\" to be almost hypnotic, and as I said in my review title, rather peaceful. The tracks I prefer the most are \\"Adiago For Strings\\", \\"Cavalleria Rusticana: Intermezzo\\", \\"L'Inverno\\", and the music-box sounding \\"Triple Concerto\\". However the others are fine as well. I say, if you think you might like this, you probably will. It's well worth the used price if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the plastic to press it...","review":"I bought this CD before reading the review on Amazon, however even if I had I probably would have made the purchase anyway.

If you have a collection of the most awful music you have ever heard, this is an absolute must have.If you don't, steer very clear of this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Arrangements <> (do not equal) Invalid","review":"I think this CD is wonderful. It's definitely Orbit. Even classical composers often create arrangements of other composers' works or themes (often times intended for other instruments), so it's really not a valid review to imply that a NEW arrangement is simply not valid. You have to appreciate Orbit's CD as an expression of his style, just as you wouldn't compare a performance of Rachmaninoff's \\"Variations on a Theme of Paganini\\" to a performance of the original score. It wouldn't even make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly rabbit-electronica are for kids!","review":"My God how you dissapoint me orbit! This album is intended for the classical fan, not for the electronic buff, its too mellow, slow, basically goes nowhere. The songs cut off, no ending just the meledy or highlights of sections. If your thinking Madonna think again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All technology, no feeling","review":"Orbit achieves fine instrumentation, but no expression. I expected someone of his standing to break new ground in recording electronica versions of classical pieces, particularly in squeezing emotional expressiveness out of the machinery. No such luck: the renditions are flat. Orbit may be a good composer, but doesn't show talent as a conductor. Thus, I wouldn't recommend this album for folks who are already classical listeners. \\"Pieces in a Modern Style\\" really feels like massage parlor music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put: Bad.","review":"Okay, I happen to own Strange Cargo CDs, and I like them. I own Isao Tomita's albums as well - yes, the man who has been playing classical music on synthesizers since 1974, and yes, I like them all.Pieces, however, gets it all wrong. The album tracks are boring, the most interesting track (the remix of Barber's Adagio) in not on the CD at all, but on a single.If you can, compare \\"Pavane\\" from Orbit with the version played by Tomita back in 1979, on the Ravel album Daphnis et Cloé. While Orbit's version seems flat, Tomita playes the same work with much more emotion.If you like classics played on keyboards, you should really check out Tomita's work. If you expect to find anything like \\"Water from a vine leaf\\" (Strange Cargo 3), then don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"It didn't have to be dance music, or even upbeat. What it should have been was good, like all the rest of William Orbit's music I have heard.This album was just awful. Don't waste your money. If you want to hear W.O. at his best, get Strange Cargo III or Madonna's Ray of Light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lofty goal, feeble execution.","review":"I'm a huge WO fan (yes, even his work with Madonna, which no doubt played no small part in her musical resurrection) and while you can pick out definite stylistic traits, this is just not well executed at all.The string pads seem to be ubiquitous throughout, and it's not even an expressive string pad! There is little emotion here, like a lot of modern synthetic sounds, and so he's quite right: these are indeed pieces in a modern style.If you want true-to-form synthesized symphonic music, try Jarre's \\"Equinoxe\\" or Schulze's \\"Timewind\\" for starters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...","review":"I like ambient music; I love Orbit's other work; but this is simply terrible. If you have never listened to the original pieces, you may like these. Then again, if you have never listened to the original pieces done by true classical musicians, and you like these, you SHOULD listen to the original pieces. I haven't even heard all of the original pieces, but these are so devoid of emotion and beauty, I couldn't bear to listen the album a second time. There is nothing redeeming about Orbit's \\"interpretations\\" other than the name \\"WIlliam Orbit\\". If you are interested in this type of music, do yourself a favor: get the originals (done by real classical musicians). (By the way, not even the remixes can save this album -- buy any of the zillions of trance albums that have it mixed in instead.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got this CD thinking it would be as good as Best of Strange Cargos.

This cd is almost entirely slow, ambient takes on classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics classically done in a modern style","review":"Having owned many and heard most of these pieces in the original form, I've found Orbit's interpretations refreshing and insightful. They will introduce a whole new audience to a genre that badly needs more listeners, yet they stand on their own in feeling and creativity. I think Orbit deserves credit for taking this lateral step.

I believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that are perfect and complete in themselves. So I can only explain this CD as a cash-in operation after the successful Madonna album.My humble advice is, to those who like easy-listening classical music: buy the originals (classical CDs are often sold at a bargain price), since they provide a much pleasant, authentic listening experience. To those who are curious about ambient, buy any CD of the Orb, or Boards of Canada, or Plaid, or even the classic Eno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"If you want to know how to turn great, elegant melodies that still communicates over generations into shopping mall music, listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember the tiny Casio keyboards ...","review":"That your parents bought you when you were ten that were capable of producing only CHEESY sounds?

The plot was so boring, my roomate started watching this movie with me but she got up and left less than a quarter into the film because she was so bored. I'm surprised I actually managed to stick through the whole thing, but to be honest, I was also on my laptop because I just couldn't give the film 100 percent of my focus.

No politics, no big the-world-should-work-this-way-or-we'll-all-die theme. It's just a lot of fun. Cherijo, who is a doctor on a backwater alien world, simply wanted to get away from her dominating father. With her she carries a terrible secret that could ruin not only him, but could end her own life as well.Viehl was a medic in the USAF, and it shows. It's almost as if Viehl actually operated on alien species. The SF fan in me screaches over a number of scientific impossibilities (human/alien half-breeds, for one--we'd be lucky if aliens even used DNA for a genetic structure), but in the end it doesn't matter.

It reminded me a lot of what a \\"Sector General\\" novel (James White) would have been like if it were written by Anne McCaffrey. This novel is more complex than the typical Anne McCaffrey novel, in a good way. Viehl is very imaginative and has come up with a lot of interesting and fun ideas. My only negative comment is that the author should have let someone with more of a science background pre-read the novel and make suggestions. (I'd make the same comment about most Anne McCaffery novels.) It's the first in a series and I look forward to the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been in the Harlequin Romances","review":"The book has the plot of a Victorian Romance AND is almost crippled by \\"political correctness\\"...

She is rescued by an alien crew that loves her so much that they start a war with the evil goons of the chauvinist racist Earth Empire--led by her evil guardian. Before that she saves the planet from an intelligent plague (self-aware viruses),midwifes a pregnant galactic pirate-slaver, and charms everyone she meets...For a self-reliant strong heroine she spends the entire book being saved by adoring fans while she wrings her hands and declaims her complete unworthiness...

I was disappointed, however.Stardoc isn't well thought-out sci-fi; the main character's emotions seem to consist mostly of either wanting to work tirelessly for the greater good or wanting to smash things. Cherijo Grey Veil is apparently able to singlehandedly save thousands of colonists, watch others die, and be harassed and persecuted without suffering any deep emotions or ill effects. Even rape doesn't make her want to do more than break some equipment.Anyway, overall I thought this book was shallow and poorly-written, with some disturbing kinkiness and romantic developments.

Cherijo grows as both a doctor and as a person as she faces medical emergencies in treating species and illnesses that seem unfathomable, including a 'plague' which puts the entire planet at risk.S. L. Viehl does an excellent job in creating a character that is both compassionate and fallable; a likable charcter that faces change and the unknown with bravery and very human emotion.

It seems that with the leaving of Kelly Smith and Edward Carlton, the inspired songwriting is gone as well. It is a real shame because Eric A.K. is one of the best metal vocalists period. However,a bad song with good vocals is still a bad song. This record primarily lacks the originality that most of us flotsam fans have come to expect over the last decade. The guitar solos are amateur and the guitar arrangements are weak. I hope its only a temporary departure from the quality of their last 5 records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best stuff","review":"I never really understood why F&J never get the recognition they deserve.

Why? I have no idea, it just works.2) Use the included network cable for the initial configuration. It was balking when I was using a long cable I know is good.3) Get it to print through the network cable first.

Now we get excellent quality prints without all the extra hassle. The only downfall with the way this unit hooks up is, the desktop has to be \\"online\\" in order to print as it is now sent through the router, which also slows down the print operation from the desktop. And also hooked up this way, the scanner doesn't work from the desktop. I need to pick up a \\"Pigtail splitter\\" so I can hook it up direct to the printer.

Every song the same tempo, variations on there other songs. You want to hear Nelson at his best listen to his older CD's espcially the songs with Dennis Chambers on drums. I guess these guys look at Kenny G living in Malibu, and not having to use any creativity, again i.e. not writing his own music, but just copying an old song.

This book does not cover all the questions that are on the exam. A few questions had me scratching my head.

So for the Network+ exam I decided to try out the Exam Cram books and I was very pleasantly surprised.The emphasis is on the word CRAM. This book, though small, and compact, is crammed with useful information. This book truly epitomizes the idea of cramming as much information as you need for a test, without wasting time on frivolous or misleading details. I really found this book to be a tremendous help, and was the only source I relied on for the test.If you are planning on taking this test, or if you need a useful quick reference book for work, definitely definitely consider this book. It is time and money well spent. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What book did these guys read?","review":"I think that this book is total trash!

I have a bachelors in computer information systems, and have taken a few networking classes. The questions provided along with this book are a joke. If you are lucky about 10% of the questions on the exam will be as easy as the ones in this book. Several of the questions on the exam were never addressed in the book. An example of an actual test question would like: Out of the following fiber technologies, which technology uses a 2000nm beam? This is not the exact question, but its close.

Yes the book is easy to read and the practice questions are a bonus. Go to [...] to really get some extra practice on concepts just glazed over by these jokers.

I like it a lot.. but it is labeled \\"To enchant. A use of spells or verbal charms, spoken or sung, as part of ritual magic.\\" Hmmm, that peaqued my interest.. but that's not what it is to me. I often write my Book of Shadows or other work to it, but do not plan on using it in Ritualism. To me, musick made specifically for magick do not have any words, and if they do, they are minimal and direct. This is a soothing and enchanting disk for sure, but is not one I'd personally recommend for Spellcraft or Ritualism.I really like Real Music records & they continue to put out good releases like this one.

This guy had the nerve to accuse me of tampering with the POS they sold me. After an hour of arm twisting they finally agreed to replace their junk. I went home and used them for about a week before they died again. Went back to their office in Chino and that they said they won't honor warranty on a replacement?! I gave up and just threw their POS in the garbage next to their office. As I drove off I saw two of their employees digging through the thrash to salvage the POS they sold me.

I really like the tune \\"Paul and Silas\\" taken from Acts. The Brothers voices really merge and compliment each other throughout this treasured sample of works. Also \\"Are You Washed in the Blood\\" is a haunting melody that harkens back to the early Appalachian gospel sound. Those two songs alone are unique sounding treasures that will really inspire a Christian life. This album is excellent because of the tight harmonies and awesome instrumental work. If you are looking for a simple but totally powerful and authentic message in your music do not miss out on the Stanley Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book as a supplement for your Tai Chi","review":"A very good book and explores several different things within Tai Chi. However do not expect to \\"learn\\" tai chi from this or any other book. Tai Chi cannot be learned from a book and meditation without tai chi is simply meditation. Some of the meditation requires one to focus within a specific part of the body which is difficult to do. This is definitely one of the best books available on this subject. However to achieve any benefits and to understand, one must have a real instructor to lead you into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More useful information with great photos","review":"A good book to add to your passenger trains collection of railroading books.

The book was well-written and easy to read, and made me want to read Herbst herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap.","review":"This was very ugly and cheap looking when I applied it and it was almost impossible to apply without the air bubbles. Worst thing ever. Waste of money.I took it off and got rid of it. I tried to use it as a backsplash, it was so ugly, I took it off and tiled. I would not even give it one star. But I has to give at least one. Unless you dont mind cheap looking. The material is very thin and flimsy, really hard to apply in long lenghts. Must be applied on the smoothest surface ever or you will have ugly bumps and bubbles.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuff looks good on roll, impossible to put on with good results!","review":"I spent a lot of time to prepare the surface, a 24 x 24 flat white metal dishwasher face panel. It was next to impossible to cover the panel with this without a tremendous amount of air bubbles under the contact paper. Peeling up the paper to remove the bubbles created creases which were horrible. Three attempts wiped out the whole roll.

I have bought the heavier vinyl for the side of my fridge and it's nothing like this. Thicker, stuck well and went around corners excellent! I have had many tell me that they couldn't believe it was vinyl. The texture and color of the real stuff matches the stainless on the fridge perfectly! But then again, you get what you paid for. The real stuff is a little pricy. This is just like the rolls of contact paper you can buy in Home Depot for $9.99 only wider. Since I wanted this for craft projects it's no big deal, but it's also way to shiny to use on appliances. It would blind you, and I would not bank on it staying on for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds easy....it's not!","review":"Thought this would be a good affordable way to upgrade the looks of my kitchen.Even following everything in the directions. It will bubble bady and they don't work out. When you pull it off to try to readjust all the glue comes off of the stainless material. Cleaning it off is tough and I wound up messing up the paint underneath. I ordered a second one to try to cover up what all the damage I've done and it did the same thing. If the material were thicker it would work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"To hard to apply","review":"The roll was bent on the one end.

In 1938 much of what Barton wrote was widely believed to be true, but in the last 70 years so much research has been done that no one should rely on Barton's work for anything! I know that theatre programs still use this text (I had it in 1969 at the University of Oklahoma) but even people at community theatres and high school theatre programs can do better in an hour or two of looking at period paintings online at the Web Gallery of Art or ArtCyclopedia than they ever can get by using Barton's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Latino and knowledge-seeking Anglo: read this book!","review":"White tortilla is a fine phrase to describe the ambiguous career and social challenges facing a light-skinned, pure Latino man who is caught in the complex, dual role of operating in two different cultures. His father told him to NEVER speak Spanish at home! This fine book describes, through humor and anecdote, the identity conflict and practical difficulties shared by millions of Hispanics. Moreover, it is a story about any American who reflects, or was raised within, an ethnic culture while living in an Anglo-controlled world. Dr. Diaz writes in a smooth, literate style and uses dialogue especially well. The book is a must-read for those with heart, Latinos, students, politicians and educators. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star, only because there is no lower rating available.","review":"This is the most masturbatory, self congratulatory piece of work that I've seen in a long time.

Storm landings were a difficult operation in WWII and the author clearly demonstrates how difficult it was to put an amphibious force ashore, support it, supply it, all the while keeping the momentum of the offensive going. The book does leave the reader wanting more in terms of information on the specific battles it deals with. This was not the emphasis of the book but never the less much was left out when detailing the storm landings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Textbook Treatment of WWII Pacific Battles","review":"If you're looking for a detailed, factual analysis of the major Pacific amphibious battles in WWII, this is the book for you. If you're looking for something with \\"personality\\" or more of a human angle, there isn't much here. This is no \\"Flags of our Fathers\\", nor is it as accessible as the Time-Life books.This book has very few pictures, drawings or maps.

I was expecting them to remain true to their Stone Tower and other earlier releases and was disapointed. Being 15 at the time I was in a mode where I wanted artists to play similair music on each album and I disliked to great changes. Now, with a more mature palate I can see what I missed. This was the begining of the more dance oriented Delerium and a natural progression of things. It is like noise unit, FLA and Delrium sounds met and they made this new and experimental sound of Delerium and the result is great if not astounding. The cover art is odd with a face and the text is cheap. The rest of the book-let is likewise and the photo looks grainy and is they highered an engineer from Dossier Records to take the photo. Even so it is a very fine album that should not be missed by fans of Leeb and Fulber."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!","review":"This here is one Deleriums best cds yet!

However, I've never been a huge fan of much of FLA's work prior to Tactical Neural Implant...or maybe even Virus. I enjoy it--but in a nostalgic sense, not because it is complex, lush, evocative music--it isn't. Morpheus is to Delirium as Convergence is to Frontline Assembly. Awful on the ears, but worth the effort if you want a glimpse back into early 90's industrial. I'd like to be more optimistic about this CD, but I can't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bad apple","review":"save your money, don't buy this album. 80's were a painful time for such bands as this one, and this album reminds you oh so well that you should just forget their work from the 80's ever existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This book came highly recommended. ...On an even more fundamental level, though, the story just isn't compelling. There's no strong narrative, no suspense, and virtually no character development. Pelecanos is trying to to make some sort of misguided social statement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"George Pelecanos is an exceptional writer, but Soul Circus is the most powerful novel of his that I have yet read. The third novel in his Derek Strange series, it concerns the jockeying for position of two small-time drug dealers and their mutual interactions with a P.G. County arms dealer. The arms dealer, Strange, and his associate, a white man named Quinn, are all ex-cops. While the story is straightforward, the narrative is multi-layered and richly textured. This is, as always with Pelecanos, a gritty and often grim book, the last possible book desired by the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce. I love its simplicity and clarity. The characters are carefully etched and the ending is as satisfying as it is inevitable. Note to hardcover buyers: this book may still be available on your local remainder shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the Game","review":"I come late as a fan of Pelecanos, and I can't believe I overlooked such a top notch writer. Characters, dialogue and setting all make this a noir mystery from the old school. Heroes aren't always heroes and the surprise ending is back. In Derek Strange and Terry Quinn Pelecanos has created a real life experience, men with souls, consciences and a sense of their own shortcomings. But that doesn't stop them from trying to do the right thing, make mistakes and move forward within the limits of their power. Not for the faint of heart or the reader with a false sense of right and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but profound...","review":"Father Donahue writes as though his words sound like he speaks! If true, that re-emphasizes his interesting way of using words.His headings as Parable as Text; Parable in Context; Literary Context; Theological Contest, keep his commentary in focus. Most of his footnotes are brief and pointed, except for the longest, \\"Excursus on the Ministry of Women\\" from Elisabeth S. Fiorenza.He relies strongly upon C. H. Dodd, J. D. Crossan, J. Fitzmyer, and Jeremias. Following a long Bibliography there are helpful Indexes of Parables, Citations, and Authors.All-in-all my current interest in \\"Preaching Parables\\" places this simple yet profound text alongside A. J. Hultgren, who is more recently published.

Based on the William Gillette play, this Civil War spy story features (VERY young) John Lithgow, Meryl Streep, and Charles Kimbrough (best known for his work in 'Murphy Brown') in the lead roles. (Look quickly for Jeffrey Jones of 'Ferris Buller' fame in a bit as a Southern soldier.)Lithgow is especially wonderful as the Northern spy passing for Southern officer who loves Southern belle, Streep, but cannot (or can he/) let that interfere with his work. Kimbrough plays the rather smarmy suitor to Streep with great panache.The old-fashioned plot offers no surprises, but just sit back and enjoy.

Rain Junior also has a very sappy side, and seems to enjoy teen-age flirts and kittens. Rain Junior does not drink, let alone a good single malt.

This stuff really is the deal because it not only keeps your nails looking excellent but also alleviates splitting, cracking and other nail problems I have had in this long run. I have been using it about two years now with the best results every. It is way cheaper than any salon product or even cheap store stuff. I would say it is the best in it's category anywhere and any place at least thus far. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has problems with there nails.

I saw this product and thought \\"Why not?\\" I have been using it several times per day and it is actually working.

The hardest part was assembling the clear plastic display case, which my wife and I had to work on together to complete.

It includes sex, drugs, and lots of vioence. However, with the amazing Swizz Beatz backing DMX up, the cd is one for the collection. It is, in my opinion, his best. This cd is great for any occasion; parties, something to listen to, something to bob your head to while you drive, anything. I've listen to my copy at least, no embellishing, 150 times through. Though one track did not get my approval for DMX quality, the cd, in whole, should be the one rap cd every rapper strives for. The one album that is virtually perfect in every way, shape, and form. All the right people are featured, including Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, The Lox, Drag-On (another personal favorite, check out his cd- Opposite Of H2O), and the shocking Marylin Manson. It's a high quality cd that every person who has listened to the ... rap put out by P.

I knew going in that it would be over-the-top violent, but I didn't expect it to be so repetitive. A few of the tracks are juicy but most of them don't reward repeat listens, so I can't really justify playing the CD to hear the good songs. The Swizz Beatz production gets old quick. Plus, now that I know that DMX is a bad mother who will devour his enemies and that he loves his b****es, I've heard 90% of what he has to say.The other thing that bothers me is his \\"spirituality\\". The martyr image in \\"Ready To Meet Him\\" just doesn't jive with the thuggish, vengeful persona in most of the other songs. I guess it's an Old-Testament-style of religion that DMX subscribes to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rap album I've heard, this edited version is more fun..","review":"This is the best Rap album I've heard. The album contains a well balanced variety of tracks. You have the head nodders, the serious soulful tracks, the intense high stringers, and a couple of dark ones. I personally like the edited version better because I like the overdubbed vocal patches, (what! Wooo ComeOn! AAH).

There are so many instances where he doesnt even rhyme. He sells his gimmicky bark, and love of dogs (which Snoop already sported) to little 13 year olds, who dont know that DMX has no talent. The man is a deranged person. He is always talking about raping women, killing, and how the street life has affected him mentally. After coming anywhere close to this album, I can understand why he claims he is mentally disturbed- because he is. I dont know any other rapper who would cover themselves in \\"blood\\" on their front cover.

Everything from his incredibly sexy thuggish appeal to his deep and insightful lyrics never fail to astonish me. His strong forceful voice always manages to summon tears to my eyes. This man is a colossal inspiration to me as well as infinate others. This man is practically a god! As far as \\"Flesh of My Flesh,Blood of My Blood\\" goes,he gives 110% in every single track! He is unstopable! I especially love that little prayer/poem thing he did. I really appreciate the fact that he took the necesary time to acknowledge the Lord. When DMX rhymes, you can feel where he's comin' from. For example, when I first heard \\"Slippin'\\", I was ballin' in tears. It's like his music leaps inside you and makes you feel what he feels. It's an inexplickable feeling when I hear his voice. This CD is OFF THE HEEZ! and it deserves 6 stars, and to the who gave this beatiful CD 1 star, e-mail me cuz we need to talk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"whatwhat","review":"I think this is their best work til the new one came out.

It was like DMX decided his name was big enough that he didn't have to put effort into this album because most people will buy it just because its by him. This album was sorry and if you disagree with me you know you're playing yourself.

Plus, although Lloyd Banks and 50 are extremely talented, the 3rd member of the group, Young Buck is terrible, sounding unfortunitly like many of todays so-so MCs.

There are only 2 weak songs, \\"Baby U Got\\" & \\"Groupie Love\\" (again Tony Yayo's verse being hot). From first listen, they were annoying but the rest of the album is straight rap. Some songs better than others like \\"My Buddy\\", \\"G'd Up\\", \\"Eye For Eye\\" and the intro track \\"G Unit\\". Still say Lloyd Banks' solo \\"Smile\\" is a \\"21 Questions\\" part II. And this album may have been even better if Yayo was more present and production a little better but this is NOT a bad album as many have claimed.

Most of Hip Hop today is not like what it used to be in the 80's & 90's. Mostly the 80's were even better because most of them didn't talk about killing or raping anybody, it was all about having fun ex. (MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, or Coolio).

The worst part of the album is that one of the members (Tony Yayo) in locked up right now so he's only on 2 tracks. Young Buck is the newest member and does an alright job but Yayo is a much better rapper. On top of that theres just some awfull songs that should have been left for the mixtapes or just kept unreleased like: My Buddy,Better Ask Somebody,Baby U Got & (song title) which is a year old song off a mixtape that was just thrown into the album. But there is some tight songs on here check out \\"Poppin Them Thangs, Wanna Get Yo Know You, Groupie Love, Eye For Eye & G'd Up.

I don't understand why musicians have issues with each other (Examples : Eminem/Christina Aguilera, Jay-Z/Nas, etc.) What I also don't understand is why 50 Cent insulted Ja Rule for singing in a song instead of rapping. Ja Rule sang on \\"Rainy Dayz\\" with Mary J Blige on the 2002 re-release of \\"No More Drama\\" but then on Mary's next album, \\"Love & Life\\", 50 Cent Is featured on it. I do not consider this entertainment. These people are role models. Their music affects a lot of people. I do not find it entertaining to insult other celeberties this way.

They rap about nothing important, and FAR too many love songs, ala \\"Smile\\" and \\"I Wanna Get To Know You\\".

Yayo is very energetic. Especially on Stunt 101 they do some good rapping, even 50 who usually sounds lazy and uninspired. i guess it's bcz he has his boys with him. this album is not great but its not the worst i've heard. plz take this from a child if you see them with it. this is too violent. i don't know why these rappers have to be like that. don't they realize that it's just about the beats?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tad overrated","review":"I dont hate g-unit.

If you wanna get technical, \\"Salute U\\" w/ Buck & Banks, \\"Eye for Eye\\", and \\"My Buddy\\" are pretty good tracks too. But \\"Stunt 101\\" was probably the WORST G-Unit single the ever be released, as the beat is just annoying. The track \\"Beg for Mercy\\" is just a sped-up, knockoff of \\"Back Down\\". Lloyd Banks' \\"Smile\\", though a decent song, is just his version of \\"21 Questions\\". And the closing track \\"I Smell Pu**y\\", has been heard by EVERBODY through mixtapess, and it was a bad choice to be put on this album. Basically, is you didn't get the album, you made a GREAT choice, as the next G-Unit album will be SO MUCH BETTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting old","review":"oh man the songs from this cd is ok but their really getting old and repititive. also on 50 cents new album coming somewhere in febuary well suck, because he will diss murder inc again ehich is getting irritating since it's annoying, and doesn't 50 cent ever get tired of dissing them, i mean why can't he just give up already. well it looks like shady/aftermath is going downhill which is sad because the rappers there used to be good, but not anymore, since ive been hearing them dissing other rappers, like on eminems song of like toy soldiers he disses benzino which is getting old, and is still messing with ja rule for what he said about haylie which is getting boring. ja rule i would say is better than 50 cent since he is making hot songs, and is not dissing anybody recently, while 50 cent, and shady/aftermath disses the same person over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was my review deleted?","review":"What the hell is going on here?

I don't know about any one else but I'm tired of guns and diamonds. 50 cent is garbage, he is no emcee, he's a commercial rapper, he has the most basic lines i've ever heard. Young Buck sucks, Tony Yayo is good, Lloyd Banks is fire. Banks and Yayo are the only good members out of g-unit. G-Unit should of stayed the way it started, 50, yayo, and banks.

The beats are hot, and this is definitely a CD to bump in the car, but it isn't anything more. Banks drops the hottest verses, and he is obviously the most talented of the group. I'm starting to grow tired of 50, if you want to hear him when he was good, listen to his old albums before he became Mr. TRL. And Young Buck is just terrible, he drops maybe two verses that could possibly be considered pretty good on the entire album.My 3 Favorite Tracks:My BuddyGroupie LoveEye For An Eye"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below my expectations","review":"As a 50 cent fan, i expected this album to be one of his best albums. I thought this album would be better than Get Rich or Die Tryin. However, i wasn't happy at all when i sat down and listened to the cd. With 50 and Young Buck basically rapping about the same thing, this album became boring real quick and fast. With the exception of a few cuts, Beg For Mercy wasn't even worth the money I used on my gift certificate. For starters, the opening track had a legit beat, but no one was able to flow with the beat. The beats could've been a lot better. There really isn't a big change when it comes to the beats. If you are a die hard 50 fan, you will love this cd. If you're not, then my advice to you is to pick up another album because this cd will make your ears beg for mercy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap?","review":"How can you people call this music?

They'll flush out almost anything to try and make money. Where's the talent these days??? I gave this album one star beacuse I did like Track 15 \\"G'd Up\\".

When I do, it's mostly old stuff like N.W.A., Public Enemy, Ice Cube, humously issued Tupac (the albums he released when he was live), KRS-One, etc. It's a shame how rap has become so low.

It got a lot of mainstream hype, and I'm not surprised that it's below expectations for anyone who likes the real hip-hop. I've listened to G-Unit before 50 was with Dre, and I liked it. Some of it sucked, and that's what mostly came out on this album. Lloyd Banks, being the best of the three, really needs to get his solo career off the ground. I'd buy his CD over this one any day. Young Buck is all about \\"f*** this b****, buy that Bentley\\" and should get away from this group as fast as possible. 50 does the usual and gets money. I really have to say I miss the old G-Unit, but with all the attention they're getting they probably won't go back.If you want good hip-hop go pick up \\"Illadelph Halflife\\" by The Roots or \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" by Dilated Peoples."},{"rating":"1","title":"G-Unit drops and... ehh","review":"Well, it's not a terrible cd, but its about 1/4th of what the Black Album is. Lloyd Banks proves he is truly the most innovative, and the best rapper in the group, and Buck basically flops out. He isn't tight at all. 50's verses are alrite, but nothing we haven't heard before. I personally can't wait for Yayo to get out of jail because his flow is siiick. Heres 1 vote for a Yayo, Banks group. 50 stay solo and find something new to rhyme about. And Buck please... just go away. Every1 go buy Jay-z's final effort \\"The Black Album\\" its a true classic, and the last album from the best living rapper in the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big joke","review":"50 Cent is like Eminem.. A huge publicity stunt. And that's what this CD basically is as well. A big joke. Three guys full of bravado running around claiming to be big tough thugs.. But for crying out loud, Stunt 101 was generic and hella boring. The only reason 50 Cent can sell some CDs on his own is because of his marketing image, and the fact that his label sells CDs to the stores and then buys them back. But as far as this album is concerned.. Stay away from it. G Unit may try to market themselves as normal rappers, but in reality they are more pop than Britney Spears.

But real gangstas don't brag about it, they just are who they are. This whole cd is one long song with different beats (and if it ain't about being gangsta, it's a corny rhyme about how you thuggin' females) If you choose to waste your money, go straight to #16 and then press stop cause that's the only song on there worth the $9.98 that I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wackness at its purest form","review":"OK, let me just start by saying that I am thankful that I bought the bootleg and not buy the real thing, because this CD is one of the worst I'v heard this year. 11 year old white boys are going o disagree, ofcourse. But as a true Hip Hop fan and critic, I listened to this record from beginging to end with a very open mind. The beats are OK on the most part, but the lyrics are pure garbage. 50 Cent is and will continue to be one of the most overrated MC of our time. \\"Stunt 101\\" was a horrible choice of first single, but people buy into that. Most of the record is monotone and foccuses on the same old, same old (similar to \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\"). The most bearable track on this album was \\"G'd Up\\" and that still was not anything amazing.

The album has boring production and they mostly sound the same, and just like them to overexagerate on Scarface paraphernalia, which officially has bored me, its only used to bring up their worthless strret cred. My advice for great rap groups are Westside Connection, Gangstarr, Public Enemy, NWA,Cypress Hill,Bone thugs n harmony, Beastie Boys, Run DMC, A Trbe Called Quest, and Tha Dogg Pound Gang which are way better than this tripe.

And anyone who says that G-Unit is just 50 Cent and his tag-alongs are sadly mistaken. Lloyd Banks & Young Buck definitely hold it down, Especialy Banks who could no doubt make a hot album on his own. As a matter of fact 50 Cent is outshined by his homies on a lot of the tracks. The album starts out great with two red-hot tracks, but then dies down a little until Wanna Get To Know You & Groupie Love saves the day. The album then again goes downhill until Smile comes along, this is a Lloyd Banks solo with 50 on the hook. The album then finishes strong with tracks like Salute U, G'd Up, and Gangsta S***. Overall this is a good album, but there is definitely some filler, and 50 kinda gets lazy on a few songs. Bottom line, if you liked Get Rich Or Die Tryin you should like this just fine.

Wanna Get to Know You was decent, but still, not great. I thought this CD would be pretty good, considering it got all sorts of hype, and because Lloyd Banks is on it, but it still sucks. One of the only tracks where Banks gets quality time is \\"Smile\\" and that song was absolute trash, no quality whatsoever.I think that Lloyd Banks is the only good rapper on G-Unit. 50 Cent is way too overrated, and Young Buck needs to learn how to rap. Tony Yayo would be decent, but since he's still in jail and barely on the album, I can't say much about him. Banks has the best flow out of the group, and has the sickest lines.

Nas and tupac made tight ass cuts using guns metaphorically, but those are two of the best rappers of all time. G-unit was only a hot group when dre and shady produced and had more of a say about what they putting out.

For too long now the rap community has shied away from a perfectly natural expression of male intimacy...but no longer.

It has some potentially good songs such as \\"Poppin Them Thangs\\" and \\"Stunt 101\\", but like most other rap artists these days, the music is getting to mainstream and too concerned with making the big money. Artists are forgetting the essence of music and are getting sucked into the mainstream world more and more as time goes on. I would like to see these guys head in the direction of underground rather than aiming their music at 13 year old girls. It is really frustrating because musicians in the rap/hiphop world aren't even trying to make decent music anymore. I just hope that someday hiphop/rap music goes back to what it once was, and not keep heading down the road to fame and fortune and who makes the most money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no dmx luv","review":"stupid g unit. no Dmx luv here or on fitty centz get rich or die trying. tho in tha club wuz a killa song pi.mp wuz ok but get grand champ by Dmx instead.

When 50 cent first came out, he was a nobody and he wouldn't have blown up if it weren't for Doctor Dre and Eminem. This album was horrible.

Yayo was only on two tracks and from the sound of it, the cd would have been even better if he was on more. The hardest tracks are Stunt 101, My Buddy, Footprints, G'd Up, and Groupie Love. Dr. Dre hit this one with the heat on his productions. Just wait for Banks cd to drop, cuz I can't wait. Yayo needs to get released from lockdown cuz he got some flow for real.

This CD truly shows the talent of all the G-Unit memebers and I can't wait till Lloyd Banks does his own LP.This CD has amazing production from producers like No I.D. to Dr. Dre the CD is blazin' with good beats. The lyrics are good but get repetative with the guns and money so that is the only downfall of this one.If your a fan of Fifty than you should pick it up it's not 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' but damn near close.

As these ladies give them love, so why not add a track or more.... The rest of the album is what we've grown to expect of the Unit... This album on first listen may go over your head....

It's cheaper than blank tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you expect?","review":"Were you expecting anything other than songs about guns, violence and killing people? This cd is selling on association just because 50 cent said \\"G-Unit\\" a bunch of times in his horrid album. I've heard some cuts on this and the constant gun talk is extremely monotonous. They couldn't have picked a worse single in \\"Stunt 101\\". How much longer are they going to beat this dead horse? Look elsewhere if you want some quality in your music.

They sound like they were forced to rush this album before 50's flame was blown out by the next hot MC of 5004. This album is not good at all; I mean all those songs and nothing even comes close to his worst song on his major debut. 50 is better as a solo artist and should be banned from doing collaborations with anyone other than Eminem or Dre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beg for Mercy","review":"WOW this sh*t is weak!!!! with the exeption of a couple good tracks this cd is garbage.

Fifty has the worst stage presence of anyone except maybe Jay-Z. He can't rap live for shhh, wheezing and sounding, well, uh retarded, but thats the same in his studio rap.I can't wait until white america stops wanting to see black people kill each other and be ignorant, because as long as thats what they want, thats what mainstream will give them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Album!","review":"G-Unit are great i love them 2 death.

This record was done to fast 50 really doesn t flow like he used to and young buck yells too much. Despite all that its all cool record with track like lay you down and poppin them thangs shows you that 50 still got his musicality. But other than that nothing new.

If you didn't listen to him on the radio, you missed out a lot. Black people have been oppressed by other groups because of the stereotypes. The G-unit has always portrayed negativity and constantly bashing Ja Rule. Believe it or not, Nas made several diss records at them because they did nothing for hip hop. They are hypocrites because they make (horrible) love songs at this CD. Don't worry, they will be buried by Nas and Eminem (he actually hates G-Unit now). p.s: Lloyd Banks stole $800 from charity on 12/23/03 and got charged for robbery.

Get some diversification instead of handing down 18 tracks about guns and money. Also whats with this thug in love sh*t. The tracks smile and wanna get to know you are pathetic and would probably heard at a retards convention. Fifties Get Rich or Die Tryin' is damn good and this g unit album is no comparison. It just goes to show you that dre and eminem who produced get rich or die tryin' were the real people behind the albums success while Beg For Mercy which is produced by Fifty clearly shows that he has no talent at all.

I was really hoping to enjoy this one and share it with friends just the same. However, I couldn't possibly do that now having listened to \\"Resurrection.\\" Both women on this recording find themselves not signing but whining through most of the songs. Rob Evan is about as equal to the talent of the women. But, to hear revisions to these great songs may still sway you to purchase this item, despite the lack of talent. Well, let me throw in this last bit of criticism. Guitar solos. That right folks... guitar solos. The guitar sounds fine mixed with some of the songs but whenever they let the guitarist venture outside of the score it becomes cheesy and unbearable. However, if you're looking for something cheesy and unbearable... try one of my favorite songs (but not from this recording): \\"A Dangerous Game.\\" Any amount over $5 would be a waste of your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new take on a classic!","review":"After listening to this cd for the first time I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be thinking. Many of my initial reactions were\\"What was that?!\\" \\"No they didn't!\\" \\"How could they?!\\"After listening to it again I really enjoyed it. For the Jekyll and Hyde purists out there, you'll hate it! For anyone open to new ideas and new interpretations, you'll love it! Robert Evan is a voice from the Broadway show itself (I saw him as Jekyll), and both woman have powerful voices that, in my opinion, do all of the songs justice. The only thing I couldn't handle was \\"The World Has Gone Insane.\\" I think they took that one a little too far with the heavy metal! But aside from that, there are a lot of embellishments and guitar riffs, but it's a good cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrifying Jekyll","review":"Initially, I wasn't optimistic about this recording, and was also hoping for a new score to be the first release by Wildhorn on this label. However, don't be fooled; listening to the cd in its entirety was a purely joyful experience. Rob Evan, who has played the role on stage over 600 times, gives a truly electrifying performance as the dual characters. Brandi Burkhardt is also very impressive as Emma. Kate Shindle, though not as thrilling as the other two vocalists, possesses a pleasant voice that treats the score respectfully. Many of the new orchestrations by Jeremy Roberts are first-rate and truly beautiful.I look forward to future releases by Wildhorn and Roberts, especially the long-awaited Dracula concept album."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Jekyll & Hyde Resurrection' Rocks","review":"Jekyll and Hyde the Musical has been recorded umpteen times in the US and abroad. If you're a fan of the stage show, you know why. The music is simply riveting. The stage show is often referred to as a pop musical, but this new recording makes it easy to imagine the show as a bonafied rock opera. Whether you're a fan of the show or not, 'Jekyll & Hyde Resurrection' provides a listening experience any music lover can thoroughly enjoy. This version takes the piece to new and exciting places, where we get to hear some new and unbelievably talented musicians. Not only do the three leads sing the snot out of the score, but also we are treated to some amazing individuals who stand out playing the electric guitar, violin, cello and percussion. Kudos to the creative team for their vision and for their production values. Awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"I listened to it once and went back to the broadway cast album. I was disappointed because I did see Rob Evans on Broadway in J&H (He was so good you wanted to hide under your seat!) but this CD is a little too heavy on the electric guitars.

All turns out well in the end, and we're all better for having read this story!This is a truely excellent story for children. The book only has one flaw, but it can be a big one with children.

Muggeridge has so many good points about so many things, and his opinions still are relevant to today's culture. Jesus Rediscovered is, essentially, a collection of some of Malcolm Muggeridge's answers to some deep questions regarding Christianity, religion, and life, and while it sometimes feels written \\"stream of thought\\" or whatever, the book definitely feels like a conversation with a wizened, if slightly cynical, old sage."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCLUSIVE !!!","review":"EXCLUSIVE!!I bought this CD thinking that i was going to get a great hip hop mix.

Each chapter has Meimi, the main character, performing a theft as Saint Tail. However, she never steals without reason, and after the theft, everyone is happier. Her life is complicated by a schoolmate, Asuka Jr., who is determined to catch the mysterious thief.Also in this volume are two short stories. One is a take off of \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" the other a story about using magic to win a love.The translation for this volume is very smooth, allowing the characters to retain their little idiosyncrasies. In all, this is a wonderful example of shojo manga (girls' comic) that can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious and Sweet!(NOT)","review":"I'm sorry but this is probably the stupidest manga I have ever read in my entire life (13 years) first off the drawings are terrible, you can't tell if the object is a boy a girl or possibly an egg-salad sandwich, literrally. Next, the plot crawls along so slowly it takes half the book to get one point across also it is SO DARN PREDICTIBLE!!! Everything that happaned i already knew it would happen and i'm actually not that bright. So anywasy my main point is I would obviously not recommend buying this. All the jolks the main characters try and make are just plain stupid. This manga is about a girl who steals from people so she can give whatever she steals to the poor. Another thing that really drives me crazy is her stupid nun friend, yes I know a nun- Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cetaphil","review":"It's a confusing website.

Taken from the soundtrack of the film 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence', Forbidden Colours is as moving and majestic as it is haunting and sorrowful--one of Sylvian and Sakamoto's finest. Equally as good are the other two tracks which can only be found on this EP, 'Bamboo Houses' and 'Bamboo Music.' These rare tracks are reminiscent of Sylvian's work with his former group Japan--a flair for pop combined with musical elements of the Far East(undoubtably from the influence of Sakamoto in this case). It is truly miraculous that this single has been recovered from the ashes of yesteryear and brought back to the light of day, as it showcases the esoteric brilliance of these two artists at their best.

And i like donnie Yen in Hero (jet li) and iron monkey, but in this movie he was unlikeable. The main thing that made this movie bad was the fighting it was bad it was chopy and way too excelerated. It was nothing like Once Upon a time in China, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero.

I don't see it on Amazon yet, so I can't write a review, but I can tell you it's just as good if not better than the first. You see Donnie and other characters advance further in their martial arts skill. My only complaint is sped-up fight scenes. Thankfully they didn't resort to mass wire-fu in this series. The acting makes up for any shortcomings and this second DVD comes with original language and English subtitles.

We are to be gentle as doves and wise as serpents. The writings of Wendy Alec are very seductive and come so close to what we know to be truth. Close but not dead on, as the Bible requires of a true prophet. These writings tickle the ears but do not be misled. The Word of God is the Bread of Life and nothing more is required to feed God's people as Ms. Alec purports God to now be saying. This \\"version of the truth\\" cannot stand the test of Scripture.

The basic story is a family who opens a lodge on a hiking trail and their guest keep accidentally dying off so rather than have it reflect badly on their lodge, they start hiding the bodies.

I know I read a review about the chair not holding an adult but they are made for kids not adults. I pull up a chair to the table or sit on these chairs.

My son is two and the table fits him fine, and I can see it will last a couple of years before he grows out of it. The table and chairs are wood and sturdy. We had no assembly problems, and the colors are very appealing. He loves the set, and it looks great. We just had a party, and 2 and 3 year olds ate at the table. They had no problems, and it was easy to clean.It is a great bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Table","review":"I had been looking for a table for my son for a long time before I decided to buy this one. It is made well and is about the right size for my almost two year old. He will definetly get quite a few years out of it.It was also very easy to put together once you figured out the instructions. There are no written instructions, but instead pictorial instructions that overlap and seem a littled crowded. However, it was all worth it. When my son got home, he looked at it and then made a bee line to it. My chair is the blue one and his is the natural colored one. We have lunch at it everyday.Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Chairs","review":"The rubber bottoms of the table came ripped and broken. Not good for the floor.

I was going between buying the foam blocks so he wouldn't get hurt and these wooden blockg. I am SO glad I chose these. He loves to play with them, and even though they are wood, he hasn't gotten hurt. Plus they will last longer than foam ones, since he is still teething! No chunks can get bitten off of them. We are looking forward to many, many years of fun with these blocks. His hand eye coordination is already getting better, and its been less than a month! We LOVE them.

She has had a very long career, and her writing not only continues to be fresh and compelling in fantasy (probably her \\"clan terrtitory'), but to conquer other genres handily. \\"Louisa the Poisoner\\" is both a fantasy and a twist on a type of Victorian romance. This is a short novel, but with a satisfyingly rich plot and palette of (mostly unpleasant) characters. It is wickedly, sardonically funny, something Lee does particularly well. Its \\"moral\\" is, to say the least, unconventional, but, I think, quite apt. A very fine, short read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little stale","review":"Love Air Heads and was excited to find a 90ct box for so cheap.

I read other reviews claiming these were \\"stale\\" and \\"not stored well\\" and I would like to say this is 100% correct. You might not notice it very much, but it is correct. The airheads are not gooey and chewy like they should be. I got several hard lumps of something in many of them. There was no green apple flavor, only mystery, watermelon, blue raspberry, cherry, orange and pink lemonade. The orange and cherry had the most problem with deformation (melted and then hardened into different forms).The flaws with these airheads are subtle and will only apparent to an airhead connoisseur.

Reeling out a taut line of tension between her scheming characters, Morris snags the reader. She also does a masterful job of establishing the complex role that Andrea's art, her painting, plays in her life. The paintings themselves, a feverish outpouring as Andrea plots her revenge, are rendered brilliantly in Morris's prose; even now as I recall them the images spring to mind as if I'd seen the paintings in the artist's studio, rather than had them described. Love, friendship, solace, stability -- all are elusive for Andrea. But her fierce devotion to her work, and its dense weave of meaning, sustain her throughout. I love that. This is a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession","review":"Excellently crafted! The characters in \\"Revenge\\" are so believably written, you NEED to know what happens next.

Although her heart was in the right place in trying to help us all learn, I knew very few people who could stand her system. I personally felt like I was back in first grade. Although this system helped me to somewhat organize my thoughts, it was so rigid that it allowed very little of my own ways of doing things into the system. It also made me focus more on the actual guidelines of discussion rather than the material we were supposed to be covering.

But this book has given me a new viewpoint toward the art of landscaping. Basing her theory on the assumption that working folks simply don't have the opportunity to see their planting artworks during the day, the author makes us look at the evening garden instead. I certainly walked away from this book with a whole different outlook, specifically lighting, colour, placement, and sculpture. Most importantly, this book gave me the confidence to go out and try something new. Let the rest of the world hire landscapers to have look-a-like gardens.

There are no descriptions of material types associated with the photos.For someone interested in information on point methodology, material types, or significant historical information, the book will be a major disappointment. Additionally, though the title is \\"Flint Arrowheads & Knives of the North American Indian\\" I could find only three pages containing point types found in the Northern Western United States.For Eastern US collectors, the photos may be of some interest, but for a novice artifact hunter out West, information in the book is virtually non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Touch it with a Ten Foot Pole","review":"I give it 1 star because that's the lowest rating available.I don't have the DVD, I have a video.

Finkelstein only digs at Megiddo, Silberman is not even an archeologist. They have an agenda they want to present and they do so in this book. However, a completely different analysis of the same evidence is presented in other books, for instance in Israel in Egypt by James K. Hoffmeier (1999). The evidence is there, it's just what story you make up to try and fit the evidence. Archeology is a very inexact field, and when you find a pottery shard or a wall, you can fill your mind with almost any story. Since Finkelstein/Silberman come with well known biases and predispositions, I don't give their stories too much heed, and most Israeli archeologists don't agree with them either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise Has Been Thoroughly Discredited","review":"The major premise of this book, which seeks to redate the united monarchy period, has been thoroughly discredited. However, don't just take my word for it. Before wasting your money and time reading this entire book, see the review by Nicolae Roddy of Creighton University. Finkelstein's revisionism is not accepted by most archaeologists. In fact, he has been debunked by many respected archaeologists working in Palestine, including Eliat and Amihai Mazar, Amnon Ben-Tor, Doron Ben-Ami, and Jane Cahill. Whatever the authors' motives, this is another failed attempt to write off much of the Old Testament as non-historical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideological archaeology","review":"To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:\\"This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed Biblical Minimalism","review":"The authors belong to the radical school of archaeology known as Biblical Minimalism that ignores the value of written history in evaluating archaelogical evidence and which sacrifices true objectivity in favour of the ideological standpoint that the Old Testament must be debunked at all costs. Much of what they say has been said by others in the past and found wanting.

I found them musically rather ordinary.

I started reading them at thirteen and and years later still enjoy them. Her books show capable, intelligent young women who can take care of themselves. They are rewarded by relationships with men who treat them with respect. The heroines usually give some type of service, whether as nurses or the daughters of the local minister, to the community. The heros, successful doctors, usually do surgery or something on a pro-bono basis. Betty Neel's books show that you can have a good story without vulgarity and promiscuity.

Prog has never been known for catchy memorable melodies, and unlike Coheed's records you won't find many on this one, rather an amorphous glut of frequent erratic stops and starts, vocals that are completely indebted to New Found Glory and Glassjaw rather than bringing anything new to the table, and a muddy guitar tone that works against their playing style. Good complex songwriting should have a solid base and then add the experimental toppings but it seems like these guys can only do one or the other at a time. In those moments where they stand still long enough to lock into a groove it becomes apparent how conventional their compositional instincts are so I suppose it's just as well that they stick to the technical showboating and juvenile experimentalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm.......","review":"i thought i would give this band a try and ya know what; waiste of my download time. music in general; not too shabby at all. vocals/singer: my god, wtf? sounds like he is trying to hard. but the 2 stars go to the music.

It apparently happens on other size Sony LCD SDM monitors too. Skin tones on certain photos are swapped for hot purple, blues become hot green, certain User Interface colors are switched out too while others are unaffected. You can even watch a photo download--looking fine--only to go crazy upon the completion of the download.

The legendary land of impossible speed and unlimited imagination that has captured all of our curiosity at one time or another has been captured by Motorbooks Classic.

The aura that surrounds this location has been captured nicely in this excellent look back at the rich history of the track. There are over 175 photos included in the book and all are of high quality and tell their own individual story. The collection of stories, historical data and timeless memories is very impressive as can be expected from Motorbook Classics.

Their version of \\"Wild Thing\\" was fresh and raunchy, \\"Touch Me\\" and the rest of this debut album deliver in an equally satisfying way. They rock with an erotic charge and deserved more of an audience than they ever got. Although the band was from England, they would have fit right in with naughty Southern rockers like Black Oak Arkansas. \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Love For Sale\\" are especially provocative, and when Anne Kavanagh sings on the album closer \\"Three hot guys and one cool chick are gonna make you feel good\\", they had delivered on that promise. Despite the hits, this LP did not reach the Top 200 Albums chart, Fancy released one more album and vanished. Their nasty blues would have been a breath of fresh air in the weak pop scene of the mid-to-late 70's, but the public missed out.

Without really getting into the technical description of econometrics, Granger very stylishly describes its use in economic analysis. Through wide ranging examples such as deforectration etc, Granger shows the reader how empirical modelling is achieved. This is tough thing to do as a equation is worth a thousand words, so the author sometimes strugles to keep the pace. But in the end you will definately learn something new about modelling than you have started with. And the price is worth it for you to do so. This book is good for students beginging to understand modelling. In case you are looking at serious time series forecasting and stuff you wont find it here. There are number of books for those topics, but for a non-technical understanding of empirical modelling there are just a few.

Great for anyone interested in getting their foot in the door for sculpting figures for toy companies or liscensed movie figurines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing look at sculpture","review":"I should have read the reviews here before purchasing this, but I really hoped to be inspired by this book. It didn't happen, as most of the sculpting pictured here is from early to mid-90s toys, well before action figure sculpting hit its stride.

After a great first story, my interest quickly waned due to what appears to be a hastily compiled collection of stories, some seemingly having fairly little to do with armageddon (I'd classify some of them as simply having a rather bleak storyline).Add the editor's almost incomprehensible political rantings into the mix, and you have a book I suggest avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Stale old stories that were not even that good.

I especially liked the idea of him finding the Aborigine and joining them. He hopes to find peace from the world but the Mutants come calling.The Hulk becomes the reluctant hero and defends the regular people. What I did like was the humor in the story. For example, the Hulks viewpoint on the famous Sydney opera house made me laugh.The ending of the story made me go \\"ok?\\" but rereading; it suits Banner.Some have suggested it's not the best of the stories but I like it.

Lieberum's lyrics paint lovely pictures and metaphors for the senses.

This album is also excellent music to have playing when you have company/a dinner or if you're just wanting to have a little R&R at home. Since I first heard her I have been listening to her almost every night before bed. More specifically I am obsessed with the song, \\"Can You Here Me\\" it has a play count of over 100 on iTunes because I have it on repeat when I sleep, I can't get sick of it.

It does a solid job of laying out a framework for implementing the HR Scorecard, which is made up of 4 components: \\"HR Deliverables\\", \\"High Performance Work System\\", \\"HR System Alignment\\" and \\"HR Efficiency\\".However, I found the writing awfully muddy, at times unclear, and often confusing. The book throws out definition after definition, and it's hard to tell where one ends and another begins. At times, the authors seem confused themselves, and there aren't clear distinctions between some definitions. It seems like they're just assigning definitions for the sake of assigning them. In addition, much of what they write is intuitive, and doesn't necessitate the lengthy and confusing descriptions.In short, I didn't enjoy reading the book, and as a result, I didn't get very much out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore this","review":"The issue is to have an HR scorecard for the business.

They claimed it would be 7 business days to repair and we are going on 3 weeks now, its still in the shop with \\"major repairs\\"; don't know how long it will be, they still have to fix and ship it. The scary thing is the customer service rep let it slip that some were having battery problems and I needed to try a new battery. My friend also bought the camera from a different vendor so I used his battery but the camera was still dead. I sent mine off to the repair factory. One week later, his camera came up with the same \\"system error\\", which I refer to as the screen of death. He had only had his for 32 days.

Scott at Nikon's technical support department said they would not have even shipped this camera if they knew about this problem. The camera itself works, but Nikon clearly is better at manufacturing lenses than testing software. I could not even hook it up to my computer, thus defeating the point of a digital camera.

Not bad.","review":"I've had this camera for a while now, and the picture quality is quite good. My main frustration is how incredibly long it takes to power-up, the major shutter lag, and also the fact that it takes a long time to preview through pictures because it blurs and then refocuses, and forget even trying to delete pictures on the camera .. takes FOREVER. I don't bother, I just delete them when I load it to my computer. On the plus side, I like the colors this camera renders in comparison with others out there.. I think it's a good camera if you're into taking just like.. artsy pictures of still objects, but not action ones since it is soo slow. and for people.. well people are impatient, and by the time you get the camera on.. it's like nobody wants to stay still for the picture anymore.Not a bad camera, if you're willing to wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of junk","review":"Don't buy this camera! This was the first digital camera I bought (about 18 months ago). It takes OK pictures but they were never quite in focus (what most reviewers called \\"soft focus\\"). Then on a trip they started getting really out of focus when trying to focus at infinity. I noticed it got better when I tapped it, thus loose lens! Sent it in, 6 weeks later got it back \\"cleaned\\", not fixed. Sent it in again, sort of fixed, still not really sharp at infinity, worse than when I first got it. In a nutshell, customer service stinks. They would not replace the camera. The best thing that ever happened to it was I dropped it on the floor and killed it. Then I bought a Canon. What a difference! The problem with the Nikon was it does not focus in low light and instead of being smart, like focusing at 6-8ft like you were going to take a picture of someone in a room, it focuses at infinity or wherever it happens to be when it is trying to focus.Don't buy this camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, bad focus, [not good] in low light.","review":"This camera wasn't cheap when I got it and performance was pretty poor, given the competition. It's slow to focus so you'll never get the picture right. Its performance in low light was bad as well, with lots of noise and grain. And to make it all worse, it's not that small. It's so thick it's hard to fit in your pocket anyway. I ended up replacing it in less than a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dreaded system error!","review":"I got this camera about 18 months ago and loved it. The only negative in my opinion was the pause between pushing the button and the snapping of the photo. Unfortunately, I started getting the message of \\"system error\\" a few weeks ago. I could turn the camera off and back on and it would work. That went on till last night where the camera just quit working and the \\"system error\\" message is on all the time. It has something to do with the plastic binding around the lens. I'm really upset after reading the reviews on this camera because this problem seems to be fairly common. Most of the reviews with the same problem have stated that Nikon is not helpful in honoring the warranty or fixing the camera for a reasonable price. I will give it a try and send the camera to them. If they won't fix for a reasonable price I will never by another Nikon. I just don't think a camera should be this easy to break.

It is easy enough to get started quickly; but, it has plenty of advanced capabilities to explore. The rechargeable battery is terrific. The size and shape are perfect for me.

I have a Intel PII 400 using WinMe and found no problems using the Nikon supplied software, using PSP Ver 7.02 for editing.

I have used other Nikon models with very good success. This camera gave very washed out pictures and skin tones when used indoors. The flash is not what it should be. The skin tones looked green, almost dead. I did like the nikon4 software program because it allowed a person to save pictures to a file, renamed the pictures to what ever the user wanted and evens allows the pictures, as a group, to be saved as a given size. This was nice because it made renaming and saving photos a snap because they were saved as a batch. I returned the camera and purchased a Canon Power shot S110 Elph. The difference is striking. For around the same money, I think the Canon wins easily. Vivid colors and a GREAT flash that leaves colors vivid and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera lousy software","review":"Highly recommend the camera for its small size, picture quality and ease of operation. The Nikon view software is a piece of junk, couldn't get it working on my PC, Nikon Tech support passed the buck to my PC manufacturer and Microsoft. In the end I bought a Sandisk Compact flash reader and trashed Nikon view (and the cataloging demo software that came the camera) also changed my editing software to Photo suite although the included photoimpressions did a reasonable job.My advice buy the camera and a Sandisk compact flash reader the flash looks just like another disk drive , and you don't have to run your camera to transfer pictures to your PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear and compact","review":"Don't let the size of this camera fool you. Many options allow you to adjust settings as required. Excellent detail and easy to use. I am impressed at how long the battery lasts compared with others.

You don't have to know much about ballet to know that without proper technique you can injure yourself quickly and badly.Although she does a good job reminding you about alignment and breathing, unless you are a dancer who is experienced enough to analyze the moves yourself and figure out the proper technique, I would stay away from this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing workout","review":"I have never attended any ballet classes before.I really enjoy the dvd, I agree this is relaxing and therapeutic, and is not a clean ballet, but mixture of ballet and pilates.do you know the moments in life that you are that tired that cannot move from your chair? or coming back from work completely tired and stressed.

The main problem is: most of the encounters are the authors', and the rest are their friends', so the 100 encounters are really only the experiences of a single abduction support group.The other problem is the horrible grammar, punctuation, and spelling. \\"The aliens' are here, but we dont know they're motivation.

The daughter finally makes an entrance in the nick of time before the social climbing wife completely destroys both their marital happiness and their bank account. The daughter gets busy and eventually does manage to help her family get their priorities straight, complete with a happy ending. Unfortunately, the narration of the social climbing gets very tiresome. It is only in the latter part of the book that it becomes somewhat humorous.I had really enjoyed \\"Galusha the Magnificent\\" by the same author, so I eagerly downloaded other books by him.

I picture her in a square dancing outfit on a hillside singing these lovely melodies every time I get this disc out. It's theraputic like a bubble bath with the Elmo bubbles that come in the red bottle. Foxy is a girl with great morals and a good head on her shoulders.

Note that caffeine has been linked to miscarriage, and douching has been linked to tubal damage and infertility.\\" and \\"...in the New England Journal of Medicine, that has shown that 'for practical purposes, the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no influence on the sex of the baby.'\\"You can also find out the details of the method (such as a simple chart) before investing in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex of Your Baby","review":"We'll see if this works.

Dr Shettles is the only one who has performed positive studies of is method. In fact, scientific evidences show the opposite of Dr Shettles' claims, that is to say \\"the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no bearing on the sex of the baby\\"1.This book is one among millions showing how human beings are gullible and can believe almost anything, especially when it sounds scientific.1.

You'll need to read and re-read a few sections while you're going through the process, but it's a piece of cake. We've just finished our \\"dry runs\\" and gotten our baselines, so now we're moving on to the real deal. I can't say yet if we've gotten our boy, but it seems like it should be easy enough to do!My one complaint is that a significant portion of the book is devoted to defending the process Dr. Shettles suggests. It's as though these chapters are directed at the opponents of the method or at other authors who Shettles considers to be false experts. I understand that Shettles must do this to protect his reputation, but if you've bought the book you're likely already a believer. There was no need to spend 20 pages convincing me why I should believe in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Scientifically, but DIDN\\"T WORK","review":"I had high hopes for this book and method to work after reading all of the reviews, and while it was interesting scientifically, it did not work. In fact, both my friend and I read this book and followed it exactly. I kept a record for 6 months, and she did for 7 months. I just had my 3rd boy in June and she just had her 3rd girl in July. I wouldn't change having a 3rd boy for the world - I was obviously trying for a girl - however, if you truly care what sex you have and know you will be disappointed, then just don't have another child. I truly believe the odds are just 50/50 no matter what you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"I followed this book to the T. We were trying for a girl after two boys.

I am having a third boy and am very disappointed that I had wasted a lot of time and money on Shettles books, but most importantly, I feel very sad that I had poured my heart and soul into believing in the method. I sincerely believed in the Shettles theory, it sounded very authentic and proven with statistical data. Since I had followed it every step of the way, I was sure I would be having a girl. Now, I'll be raising a soccer team, which is OK, but the reason I got pregnant with N3 was the desire to have a girl and strong belief in the Shettles method.

I got it the other week and was bored with it immediately. It got a little interesting when it talked about the philosophies of old on female and male reproduction but soon went on to be boring again. Also, it said that when you want to try for a girl you are to have sex everyday. However, when you are trying to conceive doctors recommend every other day because if you do it too often the male sperm count gets too low to be effective. It also stated that if you are on the pill and you discontinue it you should wait 6 months before you even begin to start trying to conceive. I am on the pill and my doctor said that once I discontinue it I should have at least one period on my own before we start trying to conceive.

We'd love to swing the odds a bit (although we'd be thrilled with a healthy baby of either gender) and this is a well-written explanation of the biology behind the practice of choosing your baby's gender. I have a science background, and I greatly appreciate research-based data and Dr. Shettles' book provides just that. Its not anecdotal, its not superstition or voodoo, its real research. This book, combined with Toni Weschler's Taking Charge of Your Fertility (amazing book in its own right) gave me everything I ever wanted to know about my own body and cycles, and therefore potentially choose the gender of our baby. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to choose the sex of your baby","review":"I think the information, while good and providing results, was a little one-sided. There are DEFINITELY more ways to sway for the gender of your choice. I found a lot more in-depth information on the [...] website.

I wouldn't rely on the timing method only! ;o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The research behind this is fascinating.

Sarah Marshall in particular (set in Hawaii) looks nice. All three movies are very funny, and odds are even if you have seen only one of these, you will find the others funny.

His older CDs are some of my absolute favs, epecially the 611 mix and System Upgrade. However, this mix is just.... bleh! The mixing is still tight, but the track selection is really lacking. Maybe if you're new to electronic music and like trance you would enjoy some of these tunes, but I don't really want to listen to BT, Tiesto, or Sasha.

He didn't even know her cell number or her provider but presto he has the records faster than any city cop could get them. A small town hospital with surviellance cameras-not likely and I live and know of a lot of small Georgia towns.

However, I have bought my kids the gas station and fire engine and both have been played with for two minutes and then forgotten. My boys are ages 2 and 4. The toys are very well built and the wood is a plus. However, they are very basic. For example, the fire station has a garage door that opens and closes (manually) and then a sort of bell feature which is not very exciting. The gas station is a little more exciting with a car wash and gas pumps. But even this offers limited playing opportunities. I think that these toys are probably good when one buys the whole Plan City set: the airport, the carpark etc... But that is hundreds of dollars, and you are probably better off getting one of those train tables for $140 (which is a similar idea).

Which is fair enough I suppose. But what happened with this particular disc, was that it kept showing the previews over and over, repeatedly.At first I thought the entire DVD was a faulty one filled with previews.It was not until I slowly trawled through the disc, and got to where the actual movie began. This is the very first time I have ever encountered this problem, and I have over 400 movies, collected through the years.

Even the actors didn't like some of the words they had to speak. Honestly, why didn't the director see or rather hear this?? (3) The plot is not audience involving. We are not given enough to let us engage in solving the mystery. We are simply spoon feed details as they unfold. Not good story telling.

The books were written with such a breadth of narrative, with such am innovative story line, that I doubted that it would translate to screen. I was wrong: in particular the portrayal of the lead character a young woman best described as a furious,indomitable, half mad young lioness of a girl who completely captivates the reader and sweeps you along on her incomprehensible crusade, which, in the end makes perfect sense and is beautifully resolved.

Too many scenes of characters explaining the plot to one another. Also, apparently in Sweden everyone coincidentally knows each other, and 2 out of 3 men are rapists.

The fact that we don't get a satisfying ending is also a bummer. There's no way I'll watch either the 1st or subsequent movies in this series.

Boring. I had no idea what was going on and I didn't even care. I was too bored. There's no character development. Barely a story. Very little action or suspense. You learn nothing really new about Lisbeth. And worst of all she and Blomkvist aren't even partnered together in the movie. They're not even together, in the same scene, until the very end.

Whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this movie should have considered the suspense and intriguing storyline more that slamming people with the horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I loved the first movie, Girl with the Tatoo. I saw it without reading the book and found it easy to follow. That's when I decided to read the Girl Who Played With Fire. I wanted to learn more of the details about Lisbeth Salanders upbringing. The book was hard to put down. Fast paced with intricate details of the many important characters and events that all diverged in the end. Because I loved the book, I was anxious to see the movie. The movie was a disappointment. So much was left out, that I think if I hadn't read the book I would've been lost. It was fast paced, but almost too fast, without much character/background depth. Characters seemed to come out of nowhere and things transpired without much explanation.If you've read the book, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie. Otherwise, you might enjoy the movie because you won't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanted fan of the books","review":"Following the great enactment of the The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I had much higher expectations for this installment of the trilogy. Unfortunately having read the books, I find that the treatment given the material was highly superficial and barely following the plot of the excellent material it is based on. The complexity of the plot in the book is not present in the movie, maybe because the producers and the director wanted to follow up on the success of the first movie they shortchanged the readers who would be the principal viewers of the films.I am saddened that such a rich and enveloping story line was given such a nonchalant treatment to the point that it barely resembled the story line. I hope that if they do a movie version of the third book, they go back to the formula for the first movie, wherein, although not entirely faithful to the book it was a better treatment of the novel's plot and story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mistake!!!!","review":"It is not your fault, but for me this was a terrible purchase; I thought I was buying the video and instead it was an electronic file which I cannot even employ.

It took me three days to get halfway through the movie and finally, after giving it a go the third time, I just had to stop.I'd much rather hear the actual actors voices - even if it's not in my native tongue.

And the pictures are a mixed bag: Some of them are beautiful, while others have the chracters making dumb faces and stuff.

Chapters further follow how Buddhism declined in China after brutal persecution during the tenth century, the deeds of notable Chinese Buddhist leaders of history, and the role of Buddhism in Chinese society.

However, the picture quality is excellent and the scenery is superb, this I must admit. The other dissapointing thing is the \\"Special Features\\" section. The only special feature they show is a theatrical trailer to other IMAX films (about 3 minutes in length.........)Go figure!!!

It's not worth the high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, lacking did I say lacking!","review":"This movie was rushed. Kate Nelligan was boring and very monotone. The footage was nothing special. Seems like any regular Joe amateur could capture the footage that was compiled on this.

I felt though it was inappropriate for this , unless this was a dvd designed to relax someone or for meditation purposes. I would have much rather have heard more of the natural sounds of the ocean.I did like that they mentioned plant life. That was probably because they needed to fill out this 30 minute borefest. It could have been worse .. could have been a 40 minute borefest. They should have,at the very least, tried to get someone of the caliber of James Earl Jones or Attenborough.

That's because the straight through viewfinder, which great for terrestial viewing, is not so good when you're trying to look up at the stars. (I assume this is why it is standard on th ETX-125 since that is more of an 'astronomy' scope).The good news is this viewfinder makes finding things easier because you're look angle is the same for the view finder and the eyepiece. The bad news is that you're most comfortable view is to tilt it off to the side (away from the eyepiece) and that makes \\"driving\\" the scope non-intuitive. I also found it harder to align than the straight through finder.On the bright side this leaves you with the original viewfinder as a nice spotting scope for your younger astronomers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for ETX90 astronomers.","review":"This finder, a standard on the ETX125, is a must for the ETX90 if one plans on using it for astronomy. The straight thru finder is fine for birding, or other terrestrial viewing, but is akwardly placed for most astronomical observing, especially near the zenith (overhead).

I find that Block is an excellent description writer, so if you are looking to add more color and light to your writing I would recommend reading and studying her work, because I'm sure it would help. However, Block falls short in creating a solid story, she does not establish things well, including the girls friendship, from which the entire novel is based. Throughout the novel you are hopping from place to place wondering how it got to this place and that.

My first bad taste came with I Was A Teenage Fairy, which I won't even begin to discuss. Now, with Violet and Claire, I am growing anxious about the change in Ms. Block's work. Her characters are spoiled and unlikable. Her writing has not grown better over time, rather it has gotten old and stale. She needs to try new and more unusual (and more charming) subjects and styles. If her next book continues on this less-than-exciting path, I will just have to be content with Weetzie Bat and accept that the magic is fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book (but it gets 2 stars for Tori Amos)","review":"I saw this book displayed at my school library. Immediately, Ithought it would be interesting. I read the little description and itsounded perfect for me. Contrasts of dark and light, movies, poetry, etc. The basic plot outline had so much promise. The author's problem though, is that she never really delves into any of it. She just mentions it, never truly describing it. The book overall lacks feeling and personality. In the end, you don't really feel like you got to know the characters or sympathize with them. They seem somewhat annoying. The way she writes the book, it almost seems claustrophobic. She piles on meaningless words. It's all words and no imagery. What I did liked was the poetry and Claire's descriptions but that's not enough to save this book.

I completely connected with the character of Claire as well as violet. Violet, so unsure of who she is, trying to control the one thing she can in her life, Directing. Claire, quiet, innocent and naive, wearing Fairy wings at school just because she wanted to. I did that at my school after I read the book, not for attention but because I had always wanted to, and reading what Claire did gave me the courage to try it too, to be me even though I was different. That is what this book is all about, finding who you are and who you want to be, what you want to do with yourself and your life and not yielding to others orders.I highly recommend reading this book if you're young and need to know you're not the only one growing uncomfortably in society today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oowww....","review":"I loved her previous books, although I thought with \\"I was a Teenage Fairy\\" she was moving onto thin ice. Alas, with \\"Violet & Clare\\" I think the ice is cracking beneath her feet. I was barely able to finish the book, despite its shortness. The plot was boiled, the characters leaden and while Violet and Clare certainly represented the banality of the angst ridden teenager, I don't think that is exactly what Miss Block had in mind. I was so disappointed that I considered returning the book half-read, first time I've ever contemplated such. : < I managed to muster on to the end, but most of the plot has already flown from my mind.

There are several aspects of the plot that left me with a giant question mark. I really hoped that in the end the bad sex scenes, flashbacks to the 1800's, and fainting spells that accompanied flashbacks of a recently ended relationship would make sense, but they didn't. Toward the end, one of the main characters deals with HIV. The author did the plot a real disservice by perpetuating stereotypes and connecting it to a man's bisexuality as opposed to all the unprotected, straight sex these people keep having. I was really rooting for this book to be good. Instead, it left me wanting the hours spent reading to the book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Performance Folding Fan # 361","review":"Fans are very sturdy and should not break easily.

The best thing about it is there realy is no love story behind it and if it did, you would not read it any how. If your into books filled with adventure and magic you gotta check this book out. I would give this book to my friends and tell them to read it and it is a good book and said I enjoyed and so will you. It is a book for just about any age. I realy enjoy the books J.R.R. Tolkin writes,and in my opinion he is the best book writer out there and look forward to seeing new books hit shelfs at the book stores and hope that he keeps on continuing to write more books to enjoy .

The fourteen creatures go on a treasure hunt to get their gold back from an evil dragon. I reccommend this book because it's exciting and very unpredictable.

It is however a snapshot of tidbits of information that may come in handy if you need a paragraph or two on a certain subject like sponsors, or zits, or depression. You can not read it all the way through, but you can use it as a reference tool. Is it a must have? Only if you are not looking for deep studies. It is too thin to even begin to explore half of the subjects indepth. It has a great reference section (probably the best part of the book). There are better books that you should spend your money on, like the two mentioned above, but it is good at wetting your appetite on the subjects it attempts to approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Iffy","review":"Be careful with this book. I read the part about advertising, and it's telling you not to let your events be too known because it might scare the Teens off. So, then a more suitable method is....teaching them to be ashamed of the Gospel? As anyone in Youth Ministry knows, Purpose Driven Youth MInistry is the all out best book on the market at this time, but it's major strength is in not focusing too little on too much. In comparison, this book gives tidbits of ideas over a large number of topics in a book no thicker than a magazine. I used to work in a Christian bookstore where we sold it, and I couldn't stand to look at it for more than 2 or 3 minutes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good presentation of the Bombing Campaign against Ploesti","review":"I found this book to give an excellent history of the bombing campaign against Ploesti with enough personal stories of some of the people involved from both sides to emphasis the bravery and commitment of those involved.

This is not by primary DVD player - I have my main one hooked up to my TV, or I use my desktop computer DVD drive.But for the convenience of just popping this little guy into my purse for a subway or bus trip is perfect, and the video quality is fine for just having something to watch when you're not at home. I much prefer taking this along than those 7-inch players that you have to flip up and keep open to watch those are not convenient if you are standing on line or in a waiting room. This item is held like reading a paperback!

Director Jill Morley gives us honest-as-hell, fully rendered portraits of 5 dancers who emerge as funny, smart women dealing with different degrees of emotional damage. Along the way we meet the male characters that populate this world, from the illusion-free sweetheart who drives his \\"girls\\" to and from the clubs to the tipsy customer who tells Jill, \\"I would never sleep with a go-go dancer...I'd bleep her and go home!\\" A very entertaining and insightful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad transfer","review":"I could not watch enough of this to make an assessment of the quality of the documentary. I am prepared to believe it might be fine, in an extremely gritty home-made VCR kind of way.But the video quality was just horrible. Granted, they shipped me a used copy that looked like it had substituted for a hockey puck for a few seasons -- without flagging it as a poor copy in Amazon (shame, shame).But generally with digital media you either get the complete image or you get nothing, or severely pixelated or scrambled pixel images. In contrast to that, the kind of horrifically bad video / audio I observed was the type you get from VCR tapes in general, and specifically from ones that have been reused way too many times, then stored near some source of EM radiation (like any cord or cable that carries much current), or else are copies of copies of copies of copies.Suggest you avoid this one. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!","review":"This is the WORST product ever It was psychologically irresponsible and emotionally scarring. It presents an entirely egocentric and narcissistic view of reality. The ideas, carried to their logical conclusions absolutely prevent meaningful interaction with other humans. There is not a shred of psychologically sound information. If you really want to mess up your life, buy this. For example, \\"I am filled with a strong sense of worth and I increase my ability to attract abundance into my life.\\" - Excerpt from January 24, 2003. What could that possibly mean? It is barely even coherent and lacks any substance. However, if you are interested in a good, hearty laugh, by all means indulge yourself with this product.

Most videos these days try to have a mix of child performers from different racial backgrounds.

Powered by live drum and bass, this collective of artists has released an album that focuses on a real live jam. The Wrekked train adds raunchy, snaring Brit vocals to the hip hop/rock/techno collage of sirens, scratches, keyboard melodies, distorted guitars, pounding drums and deep funk bass. Through the chaos and blaring noise, melody and emotion shine through. This is one of the freshest, most intelligent albums that have been released today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dam* good","review":"Are you diggin FatBoy Slim? If you answered yes, then buy this CD.

Otherwise, save your money and your sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"\\"How To Operate With A Blown Mind\\" is a great example of a disc trying to be everything and winding up with nothing. There are some nice parts here, such as the \\"Planet Rock\\"-sampling \\"Kool Roc Bass\\", \\"Blisters On My Brain\\", and \\"Vision Incision\\", but overall, this just ain't cutting it. It's like the All-Stars were trying so hard to impress with clever sampling or distorted vocals they forgot what actually impresses - sharp songwriting and a knowledge of what makes music work. There's plenty of other good techno, both of the big-beat variety and others, so there isn't much reason to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"i listened to this cd at the wherehouse, because i thought that they were like Fatboy slim, who kicks @#$.

Like Fatboy Slim, Lo Fidelity make cheesy bubblegum dance music for the stupid masses ( I'm sure every raver that has no brain cells love this album.) Just buy the single and skip this album. Go for an album by Underworld or VNV Nation for music of the genre that is good throughout the whole album and meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky techno and HORRIBLE vocals!","review":"When I heard the single Battleflag I thought, I need that CD, and I searched everywhere for it finally I found it here and I ordered it and it really did not live up to my expectations. Battleflag is the only song on the album that is really good. The cheesy techno and the dude doing the vocals sounds like a messed up version of Liam Gallagher from Oasis. To get to the point I think it's horrible. It's just a bunch of junky techno and the lead singer really makes my stomach cringe.

If I had to do it on most albums, I'm not sure I'd do very well; however, anybody (including me) would be able to realize that if this album has any chance of success on the store shelves, Battle Flag has to be released first and then the band should hurriedly put out a new album to cover up the embarrassment of the rest of the tracks. --buy the single if you can find it and forget about the rest of the pitiful tracks on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Was interesting the first listen but doesn't stand up to repeat listens.

Check them out if they DJ live though because they are AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff -- Criticism Not Justified","review":"Really good new stuff, Sounds like a combination of Prodigy and FatBoy Slim.

Unfortunately, there are no other songs on this album. I don't mean good songs, I mean songs, period. All the tracks on this album, except for Battleflag, are just some english guy talking with weird...sounds in the background trying to pass as beats. I'm as big a fan of electronica as you can get, but trash like this gives it a bad name. If amatuers like this stopped producing cds, maybe we'd get a electronica influx instead of pop. The bottom line is, if you want a good electronica cd, get the chemical brothers SURRENDER or fatboy slim's YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, BABY instead. Do yourself a favour, get the Battleflag MP3 and stay clear from this stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic abstract EDM","review":"it's gritty, it's breakbeat, it's dance, it's rock, it's punk, it's electro, it's raw. it's dancable and yet gritty like hard rock or industrial. this is undeniably a classic and the source of many commercial samplings. honestly, i can only listen in small doses though. it's not harmonistic but chaotic so be in the right mood when you play it. regardless, it's one that i continually revisit and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail london!","review":"These british guys really know how to dish out a nice round of hard-beat-bass-kicking-techno.

Out of the ten tracks, three are pretty good to excellent, four are bad, and the remainder leave you wondering, \\"What the heck was that?\\" And another thing, what IS it with British bands having blurbs at the end of their songs?

But, for the rest of the country, we shall never look at Easterners again without thinking of this movie for it cemented in our minds our stereotype about that misanthropic nor'easter urban American subculture. There are no deep layers of meaning in this tale; the humor is at the surface of each character, each setting and every conversation. So, kudos to a creative and uniquely hilarious comedic self-portrait.In sum, a singularly great piece of writing, directing and the actors fulfilled their roles with most convincing humorous charm. OK, I shouldn't generalize, I just couldn't resist poking a little at ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent Dribble","review":"This movie is a base, rambling heap of garbage. It's incoherent, has no real conflict, and I simply can't understand why so many people give it good reviews. It's somewhat visually pleasing until Oliver Platt waddles on-screen to add a sub-plot that truly boggles the mind (really? he's going to get both Catherine Keener and Amanda Peet?!)The characters are uninteresting and I can't seem to find a real motivation behind any of their actions. Nothing is resolved except the little girl gets an expensive pair of jeans at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"Issues abound in this story of a group of people living in New York City, all of whom have differing problems.

The bolts which come with this are also too wide to fit in the stock bolt holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly bulky, but does the job","review":"I bought this for the basement finishing project I was working on. I invented some alternate use for this during the project like cutting into heating vent (which is very difficult for inexperienced people) and cutting perfect shapes in drywall, etc. I had bought and returned some specialized sheet metal cutting equipment, this Jigsaw fared better.The laser beam is useful but not a fine thin line and one has to be careful not to overestimate the use of it. comes with lots of saw blades ( i broke couple during initial trials). The adjustable speed is a good feature as it helps to reduce the speed in delicate surfaces. Blade changing initially was a challenge, but once I got used to it it is no biggie. Unlike Hitachi and many other companies selling similar products, GMC products comes with a edge/rip guide. Overall, I am satisfied with it after using it for about 3-4 months now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is junk","review":"Appearances can be deceiving. When I first opened the box it looked like a quality tool. After plugging it in and running it I realized that it was junk. The noise alone warranted inserting ear plugs. It does have speed control, but is erratic. I own, as a carpenter, Makita, Milwaukee, Ryobi, and other quality jig-saws. This piece of junk should not be on the market. I thought it would make a good back up tool that I could treat roughly. I'll probably give it away. It's not even worth sending back."},{"rating":"1","title":"no sir","review":"it does not cut straight, just curved to the right. it is better to get a brand name than risk buying this tool. it may work well for you but you will be taking a chance. would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality a Problem","review":"Nice Jigsaw made unusable due to the screws holding the footplate insert are not flush and will gouge the surface of the material being cut.

I have never purchased a power tool with this poor a fit and finish. Manufacturer (GMC) is totally disinterested in resolving the problem. Amazon is interested but unable to fix.

She loves to build with these, as well as our 4, 7, 11 and 13 year old children. Our whole family has enjoyed the fun shapes. I was concerned that the wood would not be smooth, but have found the blocks to be terrific! I like having a carry-case for them so they store neatly - although beware that the handles broke easily on the plastic lid.

I've always thought that Hancock's piano work is often overshadowed by the musical contexts he chooses to work in; this record is a rare example of Hancock alone at the helm, and it's a pure joy to listen to--an approach to \\"free\\" jazz that is relaxed and loose, critiquing jazz traditions without tearing them apart, as in the best work of Eric Dolphy (whom Hancock played with shortly before this recording). In some ways this record is similar to McCoy Tyner's \\"Plays Duke Ellington,\\" especially in the mixture of Latin textures with jazz harmonies and structures. This is an overlooked gem which belongs in any Herbie Hancock collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Hancock recording, and his most Latin influenced.","review":"A unique grouping of players makes magic on this 1963 Hancock classic. With Willie Bobo on drums and timbales, and Osvaldo \\"Chihuahua\\" Martinez on conga and bongo, the Latin groove is heavy while Paul Chambers still in his prime holds down a great groove on upright bass. Hancock revels in the freedom that solid groove gives him and excels in both rhythmic comping and soloing. I especially like the 1st tune \\"Succotash\\" which has a fascinating 6 over 4 groove, and some unique percussion. Blaine Fallis - Jazz Guide, the Mining Co."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brave Step","review":"After two albums of great work with a standard jazz line-up, Herbie Hancock made the bold step of recording a jazz album without any horns whatsoever. The result is always intriguing, but not always engaging. Highlights include \\"Succotash\\" (good name, that), and the odd \\"A Jump Ahead\\". Herbie Hancock fans, and those who are looking for something a little different, will probably want to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too journalist, not enough scientist.","review":"I though that the book, The End of Physics was too much like a skeptical newspaper article, and not enough scientific interest.

It can be hard to see the color of the gemstones well because of the way they are set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Christmastime Ghost Story.","review":"This is a wonderful Christmastime ghost story and completely different from anything I have heard before. Instead of being used as objects to incite fear or horror, these ghosts are portrayed with gentleness and compassion, and used to beautifully illustrate the need for love and companionship in every human family, and the longing for closure after a tragedy. At only 90 minutes, it is easy to listen to in one sitting, and it has just the right balance of mystery and action to keep you interested without being frustrated. So get comfortable, turn off the phone, and enjoy this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaches high, falls short","review":"On one level Maximortal is straight up satire of Superman's fictional and real lives.The Maximortal arrives on Earth as a baby, is discovered by two kindly farmers and (as a baby with god-like powers) promptly kills several hundred people before being imprisoned by the army.Meanwhile an unscrupulous publisher steals the character True Man from two struggling cartoonists and proceeds to make millions from their ideas while they live in poverty.Eventually the real Maximortal becomes the fictional True Man and things get strange.There are metaphysical ideas about fiction and reality, belief and magic but honestly they never really come together as anything profound.As other reviewers have said there is some disturbing images, some cheap shocks and some genuinely good bits but overall it's a confusing mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Aaugh.

Almost every single principle that Chretien professes faith in between the covers of this tome has been contradicted by his first four years as PM; from senate reform to patronage. This book reads like and is about as believable as a Liberal Party campaign pamphlet and should be filed along with the Liberal red book campaign platform under \\"U\\" or \\"P\\" for Unkept Promises. If Canadians wish to read an autobiography that gives real insight to a Canadian politician's motivations and beliefs, check out Preston Manning's \\"New Canada\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"\\"Straight from the heart\\" by Jean Chrétien was an outstanding book.

This set is very small, but small can be great for 2-3 years to hold in their hands. After about 1-2 days of play, each moveable section will be loose. The connector on the blade for the bulldozer will be loose, the sections on the excavator's arms will be loose. My son broke the roller on the steam roller after playing with it twice. Plan Toys uses a hard plastic to connect the roller, and it snaps like a dry spaghetti, a hard plastic 1/2\\" piece came out. Luckily my son is almost 3 and didn't put it in his mouth. If I had known that Plan Toys uses these hard plastic, I would have never wasted my money to buy these useless toys. Made in Thailand. These toys don't last.

They're simple, but fully functional and surprisingly well-articulated; and the small size makes them very handy to put into pocket or purse, and appropriate for play at restaurant, museum, park bench, airplane seat, etc. The caterpillar tracks do come off easily but they're also very easy to put back on; and the roller broke along one of the narrower points, but was very easily glued, and is now as good as new again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice small size trio for train sets, play mats.","review":"I was really torn between rating this Plan Toys construction set 3 or 4 stars. I read the negative reviews earlier and yes the plastic bits seem out of place considering this is a Plan Toys product. And I can see how easily they can come off or break. On the other hand this set is perfectly sized and appropriately detailed for our Sevi Village train set. It also pairs well with the Thomas train set. With gentle play the moveable parts of the vehicles are charming and it seems on par with the other Plan City vehicles in terms of quality. Seems fine for our 3 year old girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, low light","review":"Overall, we really like the Meade telescope we bought. But this eyepiece probably won't be used very often.First of all, the viewing hole on the eyepiece is TINY. It's tough to find anything through it.Secondly, the loss of light when using this piece is so significant, that it's more worthwhile to just view it at a slightly lower magnification.You're better served buying one of the lower magnification lenses, and using a 2x or 3x Barlow lens with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"none of these reveiws are talking about this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is not the Johnny Thunders documentary ''Born to Lose: The Last Rock N Roll Movie'' This is another punk rock doc.

What other reviews call 'facts' are mostly just anecdotes from England's experience. I guess what really bothers me about this book is that although she understands and is passionate about education, she knows little to nothing about business. Her examples of 'corporations' and 'big business' only reveal that fact. She doesn't even acknowledge the existence of the difference between 'product-based' business and 'service-based' business, two sectors most kids do learn about in grade school. The difference between the two offer great insights into what the organizations in education and business may be able to learn from each other. I am sure there is a great, fact-based argument on why business models do not work well in education, but it IS NOT found in this book. She is lucky to get one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGONY: A Memoir","review":"This book supports the old saying that you can't judge a book by its cover. It was boring and tedious.

I'm not much of a dog lover, but I surely love Angus and I surely love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable","review":"How remarkable it was to find a book with my dog's name and face on it's jacket peeking at me in a bookstore.

We got the book and used it is a bedtime story. It generated good dialogue (as good as you get with a 4-year old) and it made him think before he acted. It gave him some tools to use with the more physical kids so he resolves the problem in the moment without resorting to aggression.

That's absolutely CRAZY when you can pay $7.99 for Netflix and get every epidisode of Season 1 and 2 PLUS everything else you can watch. Please show the History Channel that WE are not going to take this crap.

This season the guys continue their adventures further from home (Iowa) going on picks in Florida and Texas, as well as several other locations, and come up with more unique antiques. The crossover episode featuring the Pawn Stars' Rick Dale and American Restoration, feels a little forced, but it was interesting seeing the people from 2 of my favorite shows interact. The show keeps it's healthy mix of reality TV and history lesson, and as always seeing the unique personalities of the collectors is always a treat.

I loved the color photos. Yes, it is a short book and does not give every bit of information about the breed, and if that is what you are looking for then you will not like this book.

An often contentious issue that has retained its topicality. Several key court cases are reviewed, along with the reasonings by the various levels of government regarding the taking of private land. Being the US, many of the arguments revolve around the applicability of various amendments to the federal constitution.Another issue gone into is how to value private land that is to be taken over. Here, the use of the marketplace in providing pricing information is crucial, by being hopefully independent of both the land owner and the government.The book also delves into the restrictions on land use, as opposed to outright taking. Reasons include for public safety and health. As you might expect, this can affect the land's value, causing more arguments to break out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unjustly neglected beauty","review":"Winter Hours may not have been a major name even in their heyday, but they made some stunningly beautiful music.

It can be a little time-consuming extending the pliers, opening a tool and locking it in place, closing the pliers (that's what the instructions recommend but I don't bother), using it, re-extending the pliers, then unlocking the tool, folding it back in and closing it back up.

I'm really glad they chose to use many of the songs that weren't hits, per se, but were more represetnative of who they are as a band.

My friends and I agree that it is a fine example of an incredible improvement on an already awesome tune.The best thing about having this CD is that I got to see them at Alpine Valley this summer (I never thought I would get to see them in concert) and now I've got tons of music from the tour.

This will put a slight hault on the bootlegging market which is so numerous yet legal because Pearl Jam allows rrecording of live material and distribution over the internet. Since these songs will have been professionally edited they will sound much better than the same songs live that i have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Never Rest","review":"Unlike other trendy bands in the 90's Pearl Jam has actually made it through the whole decade with just as many fans as they started off with in the beginning. Everyone has already heard songs like Alive and Jermey a million times and I think it was wise of them to like those songs and introduce people to other songs like Courdery and Red Mosquito. Bad Ass album guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEARL JAM ROCKS","review":"this cd rocks!!!!!!Mike is simply amazing.The best songs are \\"even flow\\",\\"red mosquito\\",f*ckin'up\\",\\"cordoroy\\"......To tell ya the truth,they're all good!!!!!!This is a must buy for PJ fans.BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why these guys take themselves so serious","review":"Pearl Jam lives up to there expectations which for real music fans are quite low.

Try something else that's live. Jazz maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"why oh why did i buy this???","review":"alright,but not worth the money.im not a huge fan of the band, but ive got a nasty habit of having to own all the albums by a band i like.well, if you are just a casual fan, dont even bother. the studio versions are just as good or better,so get them first.however, if you are a hardcore fan of the group,id suggest getting this.as far as live albums go, this one is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't make out the cover","review":"I guess that's somebody in the band doing somkind of twisting thing in the middle of the air.Anyhow, this thing is a one star because I had to pay money for it. What happened to the thrifty and fan supporting Eddie Vedder? Where's the other drummer guy? Lastly, Stone and McCreedy really sucked for the live stuff, I mean, where are all of the cool solo variations? They hit just about every usual note in Even Flow and Evolution-two songs which bear the potential to let those guitars rip out some of that lsd-driven ad-lib stuff. I don't think Jimmy Page ever played the same solo twice, remembering the song note for note is not genius, it is gumpish. Might as well have been a studio album"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE OR LESS","review":"This cd contains some cool songs, but pearl jam is nothing compared to u2, that is a really band.

However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description. I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it. It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide! The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others. It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended. I'm sending it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing treatment of a very interesting subject","review":"Published for the juvenile market, this title offers little more than cursory information in its meager number of pages.

Stuntman isn't achieving that level of unity like earlier Treepeople had though. I like Schmaljohns songs (tracks 3,5&9). Track #10 is an awesome ripping instrumental that stands out above the rest. But the remaining tracks are pretty weak. They have energy, but are not very inspired and are kind of forced sounding. John Polle's vocals sound kind of cutesy to me, especialy next to Schmaljohns, and his lyrics are unrefined.I got this album when it came out but didn't keep it.

I used to love APB, but when my brother left for college in the mid-80s ... so, went the VINYL collection. APB is the stuff of legend, but unfortunately no one ever caught on to them. They have a funk edge akin to the Soulsonics and the danceability of New Order (but, they are definetly not NEW WAVE). Their bass lines are slap and pop ... almost like Flea (of the RedHotChillipeppers), but more FUNK.

Kent Nagano, the soloists, the orchestra and chorus are super in this live performance. But I found the \\"kabuki\\" staging of this opera weird, frankly. Not only does it completely clash with Rimsky's sinewy, oriental-style music, the costumes make everyone look like overstuffed dolls and make graceful movement impossible -- hardly in keeping with the sensuousness of the score. (Besides, Japan or Mongolia has nothing AT ALL to do with this opera ... perhaps the producer needs to bone up on his/her history to recall that it isn't Russia that traces its lineage to the Far East, but rather the Hungarians, Finns and Estonians!)This opera could really benefit from a staged production that is true to the composer's intended style and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I bought this because it was recommended by J Scott Morrison.

This in and of itself is enough to upset certain people. Although I am a big fan of Kelly and his method of teaching I was not impressed with the mostly up close shots of him speaking on the diffeent subjects covered in this DVD. The situational stuff was a mere few short scenarios that covered the last few minutes of the DVD. In all honesty I could have picked this stuff up by reading any article on training, protective equipment, and street scenarios. I'm disappointed by this DVD as in my opinion does not come close to being as informative as the first two.

The 1955 time circuits are very accurate. They even included the Pepsi Cola logo that is barely visible on the container for the time circuits. They also added the meter that Doc gives Marty to indicate which of his presto logs will fire. And the coolest part of this model is the base. It's the railroad tracks that they put the car on so that the train could push it up to 88 miles per hour.Just a great diecast model all around.

The leather doesn't look worn in a cool way, it looks cheap or damaged, as if the bag is made from leather rejected by a better manufacturer or damaged by a tanning process gone wrong.

Where i found it. What the song actually did for me is bring back memories of a crush that i had on a girl in high school and i know know where she is and and i am going to ask her to go out with me and for her to read this review.

Didn't sound like it to me...I listened to the words of the song and there was no message to it. As for musical quality, I shudder at the sick-sweet sound of it (I shudder while I write this). Bad enough I can't respect the song for musical quality, but when it doesn't convey a message that the band claims to have, uh...no, sorry people. Try Rebecca St. James on for size, now THERE'S good Christian music from a female artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"When I first saw the music video, I was also hearing the song for the first time; therefore, I can't separate the effect the song itself had on me from the visual images. The music video I refer to is that attached to the sound track of Dawson's creek. The video and the song complement each other so perfectly. Leigh Nash looked both like some unearthly creature and a princess all in one. The musical introduction also adds to that fairy tale magic about the song. It makes kissing seem like some wonderful and joyous. The lyrics take you into the atmosphere of the video. Its hard to place the emotions they evoke, its an adult love expressed in childlike pleasure and its pure fantasy yet it makes the joy of kissing real. Her voice is lilting at the right spots and interprets it with whimsical clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for a rainy day, or any day","review":"More often than not, I find myself humming 'Kiss Me'.

The album kicks off with the haunting 'Une Femme Avec Toi'. The song still remains one of her best from the beginning to the climactic ending.

This is a CD I mean to pick up, having not heard it since the vinyl. The vinyl recording had that excellent, compressed, punchy quality of the best analog rock and punk albums, and to my knowledge captured the Godfathers' live sound most faithfully of any of their releases. The Godfathers rocked with gravelly swagger, sounding a bit like a bluesy Buzzcocks or garagey Mighty Mighty Bosstones. If all you know is the US-tamed \\"Birth, School, Work, Death,\\" you should definitely spin this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillow to small and not much filling","review":"I was excited to get this pillow as I have had one before.

It took a month and a 1/2 for it to arrive. When I received them (I bought 2) they were dirty! Well the cases were. They looked like they were handled by dirty hands. Once I got them all washed up, I spent my first night with them. I must say, I love them! They are a bit small, but how much room does the human head really need? It's just the right size. I would strongly suggest buying the pillow. Just don't get it directly from the site!! It's worth it to pay a little extra for a clean product and speedy delivery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for reading in bed...not great for sleeping","review":"Too \\"noisy\\" for sleeping for me - the contents make crinkly noises all night long. Not good for folks like me who tend to have some trouble sleeping. Does stay cooler than a regular pillow, though, so that would be somewhat helpful in the warm months, although the noise factor would cancel that helpfulness out, for me anyway.I do like it and use it for reading in bed and propping my head up as it can be shaped well to various positions.It also seems MUCH smaller than 20\\" x 15\\", probably because of the way the contents move around inside and can bunch up in various spots.I would not buy it again, but I'll use it for reading since it can't be returned now that I've tried it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and not puffy enough","review":"I am a fan of this style pillow however i had to order a bigger size ( this size is tiny ) and i found the pillow wasn't filled enough.

I think it is a bit pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like you are sleeping on cellophane","review":"Received this pillow as a gift from someone who loved their pillow. What they didn't realize was that they have a cloud pillow and not the buckwheat pillow. This thing is heavy, noisy and uncomfortable. I woke up with a vicious headache caused by several kinks in my neck. Anytime you barely move you hear a the crunching and shifting on the buckwheat hulls. The only way I can describe sleeping on this is to wrap up a nice, thick hardcover book with cellophane and put that in your pillowcase. Best use for this pillow is in a pillow fight with someone you don't like very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pillow ever for me","review":"I first purchased one of these over 10 years ago hoping it would help a chronic sore neck. I tried it a couple of times but could not get used to the hardness and the noise. I gave up and stored it away until a few years ago. I tried many types of pillows and was waking up every morning with a stiff neck and headache. Once again I tried the buckwheat pillow and used it every night. I no longer hear the noise and my neck feels great! I take it with me always when I travel and have never sleep on a regular pillow again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asthma Attack!!","review":"I bought one of these buckwheat \\"hypo-allergic\\" pillows a few years ago. I had childhood asthma and I had not had an asthma attack in 25 years. After sleeping on this pillow for a few weeks I ended up in the hospital with a full blown asthma attack. After I left the hospital, we traveled to Florida and I felt well. I had left the pillow at home. Shortly after I returned home and began once again sleeping on this pillow, I had another asthma attack. DO NOT BUY this pillow if you have asthma or allergies. It is not safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed..","review":"I purchased one of these based on Amazon reviews only. I don't get how 'great' this is from other reviews. To each his own I guess. This is basically a bag of grain. It feels like a 50/50 mix of sand and crunchy rice. Save yourself a few bucks, go the the closest farmers market in your area and buy a bag of desiccated rice. Fill a pillow case with it and try it out. That's what this pillow is. Other reviewers say the crunching noise isn't a problem. With all due respect, they must suffer from hearing loss. Every little move of the head generates crunching noise. I tried using it for about five minutes before giving up. Lastly, pray this pillow never breaks open in your house. If you think the bean bag chairs of the 70's were a nightmare when they broke open, this pillow will set new standards in household aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPS did not deliver this gift","review":"THis was purchased as a gift for my daughter and UPS returned it to sender, I am not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shady business","review":"After ordering two of these pillows, I was shocked to see how small they are. I also do not find them to be at all comfortable.In addition, I was enrolled in another service which was then billed to my credit card without my knowledge. It was said to be a thirty day trial, with an option to cancel anytime with no further charges. I never received any paperwork or future products and was automatically billed by an unknown complany with the information I provided to Sobakawa. When I called to inquire about it, I was told there was nothing they could do and that I was being rude. The customer service rep. then basically hung up on me. The process seems rather dishonest in my opinion.Stay classy Sobakawa."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"I had one ten years ago and got rid of it, thinking it had gotten \\"old\\". I missed it so much and had a hard time supporting my neck with any other pillow. It is amazing. My sister borrowed it when she came to visit and loved it so much that I got her one as well. It crunches when you get it positioned but once you are settled, it is settled, too. I woke up for a year or two with pulled muscles in my neck and back. This pillow never does that to me. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"smells, loud and too small","review":"First let me say I'm sleeping w/o pain with this pillow BUT ...The smell of the pillow is overpowering. The smell, which still exists after a month outside and two additional months in the bedroom, is a heavy petro-chemical solvent smell which my wife can't sleep close to. It's so bad that ... enough said about the terrible odor. Next is the size. It does NOT even come close to the size shown in any of the commercials. In fact, I sewed both the pillows together to get a \\"normal\\" size pillow. And now last, the pillow when laid on can and does create a creeking sound with the slightest movement including your own heart beat.Overall, the pillow sucks big time but in the morning I feel better so ... take the good with the real bad. Don't buy the Sobakawa, buy oatmeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow- Off-White (20x15\\")","review":"I found this pillow much to small, nor did it seem cooler than any other pillow I have tried.

The first night I tried to sleep with it, it was tough. Very full, no give and it was just hard. Fast forward to today and it's definitely flattened out some. Reminds me of like a bean bag. It's like a mini bean bag for your head. They're full when you get them then later they're flat. Hopefully it doesn't flatten out too much. The other thing is they said it STAYS cool. I have to argue that bc it definitely gets warmer before I fall asleep causing me to turn the pillow over. Maybe not to the degree of a feather pillow.

This is not an honest business practice. Although I received my money back in full I do not think this is a way to do business. All Sobakawa pillows are standard pillows at 20x15 in size. Reducing the size means less buck wheat hulls and more profits. But that is not honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this pillow","review":"Simply laying your head on this pillow is like laying your head on a bag of cement. The hulls DO NOT shift around to conform to the shape of your head and neck. By manually moving the hulls around, you can create some level of comfort, that is until you need to move into another position, then you have to move them again. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the crunchy pillow.","review":"While traveling in Japan I had the good fortune to come across a buckwheat pillow in one of the hotels I stayed in. Since I enjoyed them so much while traveling I decided to get one for home. I purchased \\"standard\\" pillow size and it was way too small to be comfortable. This particular product must be treated differently because every move produced a crunching noise. I ended up switching back to my old pillow during the middle of the night. I will be returning them for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small, Too Hard, Too Noisy, Too Gimmicky","review":"Yeah, this pillow pretty much sucks. In addition to it being a tiny, crunchy, heavy bag of buckwheat husks, it doesn't even live up to it's biggest claim: \\"Keeps your head cool through the night.\\" I did not find this to be the case at all. In fact, I would say this pillow retains heat better than most synthetic fibers in pillows. I tried it out for as long as I could bear (about 20 minutes) and you can clearly feel the pillow heating up to your body temperature.

After three hours the first night I ended up discarding the Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow and going back to my much better memory foam pillow.

But I didn't lower my rating because of that, it was my own fault for not paying attention. I rated it low because this is just an uncomfortable pillow. All it is is a giant bean bag. You remember bean bags you played with as a kid? Remember how they were hard and hurt if you got hit with them? No, I'm not having pillow fights with this thing, I'm just saying it's a hard pillow. Maybe some people like that, but not me. My head doesn't sink into this thing at all and it gives my neck a cramp.

I've had some fairly serious problems result from sleeping in the wrong position and certain pillows always create problems.I also have allergies to down and feathers; I tried a Temperpedic and it didn't cradle my head enough; and the foams I've tried also put my neck under stress.This pillow is reasonably priced (there is a limit to how much I will spend on pillows to find one that works).But, more importantly, it works for me. It holds my head in position, but allows me to change positions easily without a lot of fuss. I've had it for about a month and there was only one morning where I felt I had gotten into a bad position.I do wonder if I should have gotten the larger version. This one is too small for a \\"normal\\" pillow case, but it does work so this is a minor issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"My neck pain is gone","review":"I initally purchased the pillow because of theclaim \\"it says cool\\".....

They really feel nice and cool in hot summer nights. It was slightly tricky to get used to at first because they feel slightly crunchy, but after a week i was hooked and will never go back.

A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although I am a fan of most of Ackerman's books, this one was a disappointment. Unfortunately, despite having perceptive insights and unique comparisons, there was much that was repeated from her earlier books, as well as a rather dense mat of imagery and quotes to get through. While I might use it to get a grip on some concepts raised in an introductory psychology class, the unending imagery and run-on sentences made for hard going and rather thankless reading for pleasure.

Its sparkling review in People Magazine led me to believe that this would be a review of psychological research written in an entertaining fashion. Neither was shown to be the case. I soon found that Diane Ackerman had minimal previous experience with psychological findings . . . her credit was that she was an English professor. As a result, her writing was so filled with cliche and metaphor that it made me want to vom. Every sentence contained some sort of cheesy word play and nearly every other sentence contained the word \\"yen.\\" I don't have a yen for the overuse of such a word.Part of the problem could be that I have a degree in psychology.

A history piece presented by 21-st century men. The film failed to show customs and cruelty of early 18 century. Some parts are really lengthy and dull with no meaningful impact on action. Binoche is sailing around in her skirts without showing open passion either to her husband (except the unnecessary and out of taste nude scene) or to the murderer. Seems that she only pretends that she really cares about the guys. I guess she just looks for a strange way to escape thoughts about hanging herself because of boring island life. I have a feeling that the whole \\"male\\" cast (mostly unknown actors) is poking around Binoche. Her suppose-to-be husband and that other guy are of no match to her as actors. If you are up to a real character played by Binoche you better stick to films where a) she plays with great names as Fiennes and b) she plays less morbid character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & pretentious","review":"Auteuil & Binoche are so \\"liberal\\" & \\"liberated\\" in this movie they should be driving around in Volvos!

The hero is attractively presented, but he's weakened by his interaction with this heroine. The author set the story in 1780's PA and frontier KY, yet basically it brought nothing realistic of the time period into the plot, except for the heroine's fears of an Indian attack.

Three issues caused us to throw it away. First, we couldn't figure out how to stop those little drip drip drips. Over night all the water would come out. Also the screw cap had to be put on jusssst right or the water would gush out around the cap. The cause seems to be only 1 1/2 thread engagement between screw cap and bottle. As a result screw cap has to be put on carefully to make sure no under tightening or over tightening. Third, if the bottle wasn't mounted perfectly vertically then the water would drip out faster (this seems to the way with all of these type lickers not just Lixit). The fourth issue was the dog had to lick lick lick lick a lot to get enough water especially in hot weather. We ended up buying and a 1 quart round Lixit with a bigger pipe. If we mount if vertically then it only drips a few times before it stops.

Needless to say I pack my drums into these approximately one times a week for 4-6 months (to bring them to church and back) and these are not the protection for my drum I thought they would be.

Inexpensive enough so as to make it not really worth the effort to return, I decided to give it a spin and see if it would suprise me. Samantha Deane acts at times up to pro standards, in other scenes lives down to the quality of the rest of the production, particularly the script. A few of the others give almost acceptable performances. The women involved are at least reasonably attractive, but even by the standards of softcore cable or direct to video fare, this is dull as both crime drama and erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see this back in print.","review":"I first bought the individual issues of this story off the rack back in '94, and ever since then, I have been telling anyone who would listen that this is a fabulous work.

Eventually my Mom and I were able to safely lift the pan because she would slip a knife underneath the handle to lift and then I would pick up the pan with the pot holders. The handles laid flat against the pan and there is no way you can safely pick them up when getting the pan out of the oven.

Unfortunately, \\"El Greco\\" falls into this latter category. I think even The Greek, himself, would have nodded off into his plate of paella listening to this nonsense.

The original version is what I essentially listen to because I \\"skip\\" tracks 3 & 5. Those two tracks disrupt the dark & somber mood of work.

At the first very moment it seems dark and gloomy, and in the middle of the tragic IX movement one wants to shut the sound and just take a walk outside to the sunny street to get rid of that cemeterial feeling. He does not though - the music hypnotises him and only after the last piano movements of the epilogue is he able to take a move. A number of times it will take to fully understand the album spirit - with its gothic romance and Byzantinian church mood. But when one catches one - it realises the album deserves the name and fits the epoch of its purpose. It comes to me later that the music is El Greco himself, from infancy and childhood till the last days of his, postceded with a beautiful piano theme of Epilogue - the paintings left after him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Wow, this is far not from what I like in Vangelis.

His music has inspired me since I first heard his album, \\"Direct,\\" when I was eleven years old. Other albums, such as \\"Bladerunner\\" and \\"Oceanic\\" have set my standards very high for the quality of Vangelis' work. The dramatic Movement 1 is a good example of what we have all come to expect from Vangelis over the years. After that, the album is sucked into a black hole of redundancy that may cause many listeners to skip through the tracks after listening to about a minute at the beginning of each one. This album is Vangelisesque, yet it lacks the dramatic diversity of his previous works. The album is not suitable for much more than background music at a dinner party. Not many people are going to say, \\"Hey, I want to listen to some music. I think I'll put in 'El Greco!'\\" Definitely \\"Direct.\\" \\"El Greco\\"-- no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too somber and unmelodic for me","review":"This is an album mislabelled; the music does not evoke the concept indicated by the title.

Slowly evolving, deeply atmospheric, and sometimes downright creepy. Very moving and emotional, especially the two sections that feature vocals. The electronics are especially more modern sounding ( I personally find that some of his earlier, more popular and more \\"classic\\" - at least in terms of fans' preferances - work sounds terribly dated,as far as sound quality and the keyboards and synthesizers he used ) while at the same time having a timeless sound, like good orchestral work should. Very highly recommended to fans. ( You know who you are. )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price. Does the job.","review":"This product is cheap and effective. The rubber side prevents solvents and oils from leaking onto your work bench (coffee table in my case). The green felt side prevents scratching/marring and seems durable enough.

It is also machine washable so when it gets dirty, just toss it in the washing machine on the gentle cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An achingly beautiful book about life as a musician.","review":"Peter Guralnick makes you realize how much it takes to be a musician. His portraits of the lives of country, blues, and rock musicians are so beautiful and yet so tragic. You finish the chapter on Bobby Bland filled with admiration for his conviction, yet saddened that what defines him as a human being can become such a grind. And you finish the chapters on artists you didn't know or care about--Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Charlie Rich--filled with admiration, realizing that they loved and commited themselves to something that was as dear to them as it was to their fans, even when, as with Charlie Rich, it fell beneath their expectations.

Ruined my engine!!!! Do not buy!!","review":"This part was manufactured out of specifications. The bottom shaft on this part was slightly too large to fit into the oil pump hole in the engine block. We had to rotate it with a drill and very-fine-grit emery cloth it down quite a bit to get it to go in. We should have re-worked it even further because afted 5 blocks of driving, it siezed up, welded itself to the engine block above the oil pump shaft, and broke free the ring gear on my camshaft. We made sure we cleaned it and lubricated it very well after this re-work so there was no grit or anything holding it up. It was simply still too big. I am now putting a newer engine in, because it costs less than a camshaft fix.WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS PART!!! GET IT FROM THE DEALER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Jazz Fusion","review":"This is simply a top notch Jazz fusion effort from Chick Corea and the Elektric band II. What attracted me to this project was the generous helpings of Fender Rhodes keyboard and electric guitar.The songs draw more from Jazz than Rock, but rely on both to create a set of mostly uptempo groove oriented tunes excluding the ethereal Silhouette. What can you say about Corea'a skill? In my opinion his fusion chops have never sounded better and the musicians he employs are extraordinarily complimentary.

In the 15 years since the archeological evidence continues to support many of the contentions this book makes.

Shadows are reduced to black blocks, and the picture is slightly squished horizontally. Even films of specialty interest can be released in first-rate transfers at affordable prices, as the fine editions from Warner Archive show, so there is no excuse for Classic Media's compromises.

Claire Trevor is one of the finest ladies of Film Noir, and it is always a treat to see her perform. This was the first film I've seen with Marsha Hunt, and she was just as good as Miss Trevor. Raymond Burr was great as the \\"heavy\\". I always like seeing him in pre-Perry Mason roles. One thing I did not care for in this film was the music. It sounded like it belonged in some creepy sci-fi movie. If you are a Film Noir fan, this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Film Noir","review":"Raw Deal is one of my favorite Film Noir movies. The characters are gritty and real, the plot isn't predictable and the film was recreated by the artistic team of director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton. Alton is famous for his dark moody Noir lighting and camerawork.The Sony Wonder/Classic Media disc is remastered so the image is crisper than the previous version of this movie available on DVD. This is a double-edged sword however as the film images were brightened and the contrast reduced during the remastering process. This might make the film more accessible to a mass audience, but much of the Noir feeling is lost.Even so, This is a good affordable version of this classic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds the readers attention to the very end!","review":"Angels on my Wings is a well-written story that will leave you in a cold sweat.

The evolution of English, of sexual relations, of morality and religion, of class differences, of pop music, of recreational drug taking, and on and on, Silverberg masterfully takes to the logical extreme. If there weren't logic, of deeply reading into current trends and our current acceptance of them, with chronological booster jets bolted to their sides and set spinning off into the 24th century, this would be just another futuristic scifi romp. But Silverberg's ability to extrapolate from the present sets him above and beyond the scifi hacks who think it only has to be imagined to be realistic enough. How can this book have gone out of print?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat take on overpopulation","review":"I've read quite a few books dealing with future resource issues, both fictional and non-fictional, this is one of my favorites. There is a few parts that are undeniably 'soft porn', but they are used mostly as illustration on the utopian lifestyle and not just thrown in. It doesn't spend much time dealing with engineering or economics so it won't put you to sleep that way. Its quite a good look into an imperfect utopia and shows how humans can mess up even when given apparently unlimited resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite scifi books","review":"I found this vision of a future world for humanity to be intriguing, if not entirely believable. I just don't think that many people would be satisfied with a life of so few choices. Yes, I understand his theory that \\"artificial selection\\" by years of living in Urbmons would weed out people who dream of something more to life than reproduction, who question the status quo, who long to explore the outside world.

Everything by Silverberg I've read since this one has been a let down because of how good this book was. Not quite a novel, this is actually just a collection of short stories focused on specific characters living in a huge apartment building set in an overpopulated future. The characters lives sometimes interconnect and the whole thing works as a complete unit but you could easily just read one random chapter out of the book and enjoy it as a story in and of itself. Beautifully developed characters. Silverberg has a very emotional style that can really grab you. The last chapter was incredibly painful to read because it seemed so real.

As it is, the film comes across as a amateurishly pretentious film with too many obvious symbols (especially statues and religious imagery), a really cheesy score that overly accentuates the obvious and an unjustified and abrupt ending.This is a French film, so its all about internal desires and not much sexual action takes place onscreen. The two male leads are cute, although the character of Mateo is not that interesting or good looking to justify the sickening devotion he inspires. There's only a brief sex scene, and a pretty tame one. The rest consists of longing glances between Bruce and Matteo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best boxer briefs ever","review":"I'm not actually under 13. Anyway, these are the best briefs I've ever worn.

Michaud ,again, has done an outstanding job in writting a great book about Bundy.There ARE some new insights not seen in other books regarding Bundy's crimes (Like details of Naslund's and Ott's murders, and some insight on Donna Manson's fate.Bundy spent the next 10 years on Florida's Death Row, using legal tactics to delay his execution and offering confessions to his crimes in exchange for a reprieve. After years of living in denial - insisting he was innocent - Bundy finally came clean, although he referred to himself in the third person and claimed the killings were carried out by an \\"entity\\" within him.He said he became obsessed by hardcore pornography involving sado-masochism and bondage and said he enjoyed the feeling of being in complete control of his victims. He said the primary motive was rape and that he had to kill the victims to prevent them testifying against him.Strongly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let-down","review":"Pages and pages of verbatim interviews with a megalomaniac, even one as twisted as Ted Bundy, get dull after a while.

From the cover, this book looked strangely interesting: it didn't seem like a previously opinionated crime writer's account of Bundy; rather, it was Bundy himself speaking.The only problem is that what Bundy says in the book is pretty -- in short --boring. I don't want to give away what goes on in this book, but let's just say that the subtitle \\"conversations with a killer\\" does NOT fit well. Sure, it may be conversations WITH a killer, but barely about the KILLING that Bundy did.The authors spend their entire book arguing with Bundy to fess up to at least ONE murder and comment on it; or at least come up with ONE alibi for explanation. He does neither. Instead, Bundy gives a textbook version of what a serial killer would probably be like.

Everytime I hear it, I practically fall asleep. Yeah, Brad Nowell might be dead, but his music is NOT boring. Mark McGrath will never reach the same hights as Brad Nowell. Sugar Ray is NOT a bad band. It's just bad songs like \\"Someday,\\" and \\"Every Morning\\" that makes them seem bad. Don't waist your money on this. Some bands that are much better are Korn, NIN, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Rage Against the Machine, and Smashing Pumpkins. If you want ska get Sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar Ray is a very talented band.","review":"Their last cd ( Floored ) had acceptionally great songs.

After wrapping up a tour with 311 and Incubus in 1998, the band headed back into the studio again. They were famous for producing a good metal song with funk guitars, so I picked this up the day it came out. What a waste! There is one good song, New Direction #1, and it is only 43 seconds long! Sugar Ray completely changed their style to easy acoustic ballads reminescent of well, no one. Maybe Sugar Ray won't be appealing 12 year old girls on their next effort, which I'm scared to even call an effort after 14:59. Buy their old stuff if you want real music, or check out Incubus, Deftones, (hed) p.e., Videodrone, or Far. Otherwise forget all good music and turn to pop for a wonderful happy time. Yay!, yay!, nay."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad,sad,sad what happend?","review":"What happend to their up beat sound and punk attitude.Theis songs are wimpy no hardcore anything why does it have to be happy,happy joy joy.

Juxtapose their gormless musings with totally average chops and you have, (sigh) yet another miserably uninteresting, vacant rock band. There are bands out there that are miles more interesting than \\"Sugar Ray\\" (The Manic Street Prechers, Switchblade Symphony, Placebo ect) but they are all intelligent and \\"intelligent MTV\\" or, if you preffer, \\"intelligent radio\\" were oxymorons the last time I checked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on guys, give em a break","review":"I mean, sure their hard rock stuff was better. But Sugar Ray is a band that is capable of playing all sorts of music, and this cd was devoted to people who liked Fly and wanted more of it on \\"Floored.\\" I'm a guy who is into both kinds of their music. I hate pop... except when Sugar Ray does it. They have just decided that they do the songs like this better, but there are still hints of the old Sugar Ray on here. If you don't like this music, fine. But just give them a break, because I think they'll always have a song or two for their old fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUGAR RAY'S BEST EVER!!!!!","review":"In my opinion Sugar Ray did a great, and I emphasise GREAT job on this CD!

Other than that song, \\"Every Morning\\" is pretty good, so is \\"Even Though\\", and \\"Ode to the Lonely Hearted\\" is OK. The rest of it is LOUD, skin-head stuff (I don't know how else to describe it) that I can't stand to listen to. Why does no one make ALBUMS anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very eccletic mix","review":"Sugar Ray seems to have many sides to their music, and this album showcases their ecclectic talents. Not every song sounds the same, and I liked every song. It's a great album and addition to my c.d. library.I am usually weary about buying any c.d. that isn't a compliation album of songs I know I already like. I got this for Christmas, and if i had bought it, I would not have been disappointed. Like Tom Petty, Sugar Ray's entire album sounds great. I don't have all their albums yet, but plan to.I totally recommend this one, it's fun to listen to and totally rocks and it won't disappoint in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best!","review":"I had only heard two songs on this CD previous to purchasing it, and I must say once I put it in my stereo, I LOVED IT!!

Every song is soo great.Mark has the nicest voice I've heard in my life. The best songs are,\\"Every Morning\\",\\"Falls Apart\\",\\"Live & Direct\\",\\"Someday\\", and \\"Even Though\\". I paid a lot of money for \\"14:59\\" but it was worth every penny.If you want to look smart, buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar Ray + $$$ = A total waste","review":"Coming from a former fan of Sugar Ray, let me say that this CD should not have even been released. It's so weak that I'm almost ashamed to say that I was ever a fan of this group. This is what happens when record companies manipulate their bands.Several songs are Sublime rip-offs similar to \\"Fly\\", but I'm sure everyone reading this is familiar with the Spin Doctors rip \\"Every Morning\\" and the Weezer sound-alike \\"Falls Apart\\". In the end, what you have is an uninspired mess that is totally awful. Don't waste your time with this one - trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply pathetic","review":"So, they made it big with their Sublime karaoke hit Fly. What did they do next? Just simply delaying the inevitable. And what better way to do it than ripping other bands as well? Like Weezer (Falls Apart), Soul Coughing (Personal Space Invader), and other bands.This band has no integrity or originality whatsoever. Like i just said, simply pathetic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word sums up Sugar Ray- SELL OUTS!!","review":"When you compare Sugar Ray's first two albums with this one, there is one obvious difference, the new album is so soft. Well, how can a band that played hardcore/punk music all their lives turn into a sell-out band. Can it be the success of the song fly? YES. The second album was awesome, except for Fly. When the band saw Fly being number 1 in all charts, they decided to do a whole CD full of Fly. It sucks. Also with Sugar Ray, all these Teens buy the CD because its cool and the singer is HOT. Now, i believe its an embarrasment for a band that wrote awesome songs turn into another Backstreet Boys. I would give this CD 0 stars, if Amazon had that obtion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bwahaha... Sugar Ray...","review":"Sugar Ray is a terrible band... their hard rock is decent, but it would never be enough to equal their success. No no, they had to rip off hip-hop to get to where they are.And instead of growing past that stage like others have, they instead released a new album FULL of songs that just beg for radio play. It's funny. It's also disturbing because MTV plays these guys 24/7.Of course we all know MTV is a piece of crap - no integrity at all. Never playing groups with real talent. So Sugar Ray fits right in.Write me back, please, I'd love to see what all you mindless Sugar Ray fans think.Get a clue - go buy Beck, Sublime, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Rage Against The Machine, Metallica, The Chemical Brothers, whatever, but please folks don't spend your life listening to this excuse for music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very WEAK CD, but it was expected.","review":"Anybody that has followed Sugar Ray and Mark McGrath for the last two years should have expected this. They have taken the success of \\"Fly\\" and exploited it. They've traded artistic integrity for commercial success. I knew 14:59 would be nothing like Lemonade & Brownies or Floored after they did a special for Nickalodeon. If you like HANSON, you'll probably like 14:59. If not, spend your money on their first two CD's or another band altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fly\\" is a poser song and so is this new album","review":"ok lets get something straight for all you people who wait for the radio or MTV to tell you what is good. Fly is the off-beat song on the whole floored ablum. Before that their whole sound was based on the all the stuff on Floored besides \\"Fly\\". That song is just there and for some odd reason it became a success. Now if you people got Floored for that song and not for anything else then you didnt buy sugar ray. you bought a 1 hit wonder. Their new album is based on the success of one horrible song. Sugar Ray is a bunch of sellouts and i wish them all bad luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same boring stuff you hear from any other band....","review":"I liked Sugar Ray better as a heavy band!!

Take \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" blended with smooth jazz, or played solo on an acoustic guitar, and it's still a wonderful tune. Not with Sugar Ray. Strip off producer David Kahne's (Sublime) trendy acoustic guitar over drum machine, record scratching, and Roland SH-101 bass tones and what do you have? Awful songs. I'm sorry, but \\"Someday\\" is a very bad song with very bad lyrics.But corporate radio will pound it down your skull until you're forced to run down to Best Buy and pick it up. Who was it that said supply creates demand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!!!!","review":"What the hell happened to music? How these no talent fools are popular should be a Nova episode.

But now, capitolizing on the concept of 15 minutes of fame (which they are so incredibly close to...), they have returned with a watered-down, stale, boring, and incredibly unstylistic follow-up. \\"14:59\\" brings to light the sole soft song on their previous album, \\"Fly.\\" Whereas usually the record was dominated by hard rock, punk music, this album is mainly light-hearted, jazzy pop/rock riffs, like the delightfully catchy \\"Every Morning\\" or \\"New Direction.\\" Unfortunately though, aside from these two standouts, the record is much embarassment. The cover version of Steve Miller's band \\"Abracadabra.\\" Enough said. It's lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"had it, sold it, don't miss it","review":"I bought this Cd for about 13 bucks and sold it to one of those used Cd stores for about 5 bucks 2 weeks later. I feel cheated. I was lame enough to buy it because I liked 2 songs, and I thought I might like the rest. Someone wrote a review saying 'diehard sugar ray fans will like it!'. They haven't been around that long to get DIEHARD fans. If you want to get a good ska/rap type Cd Please go get a Sublime Cd. Cause the music is way better and Brad Nowell was way finer than poor mark will ever be. (and his music was more edgy and less radio- friendly)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the old Sugar Ray?!","review":"I like hardcore punk music, but I must admit that I bought \\"Floored\\" because of the song fly. I was having trouble finding good music and I lowered my standards to what had to be in a good song in order for me to get the cd. Well, when I heard all of the other songs on \\"Floored,\\" I loved it. I was so happy that I lucked out and found a hardcore punk band. Unfortunatley, The majority of people don't want that kind of music, and unfortunatley, Sugar Ray new this. So they decided to \\"go with the flow.\\" They figured out that because \\"Fly\\" was such a big hit, that they would make more money by making more songs like \\"Fly\\". That is all \\"14:59\\" has in it now, are more songs like \\"Fly\\". Now Sugar Ray is just another Teeny Bopper hearthrob band. If you read the other reviews on this cd, you will see that every other one has something on how Mark is just sooo cute and that they love him. It makes me sick that they would sell us out like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intelligent review (just to tick you people off).","review":"It seems to me that we are living in an age where looks are sadly emphasized over substance, insofar as making your way into the top-40 is concerned. Sugar Ray rely on the strength of their lead vocalist, Mark something or other's nicely fitted cheekbones to sell albums as opposed to writing and playing some intelligent tunes that don't have predictable choruses. Yeah, I know guys; it's hard trying to write something poignant when you have the brain's of a welding-bench. Boring songs, boring lead vocalist who's never had anything interesting to say about life and a repulsive fan-base. The truth can be scathing, no?"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 great songs and a remake of a great song.","review":"Do yourself a favor.

I've never liked Sugar Ray, but when I heard 'Every Morning' I decided to buy the album to see what it's like. BIG mistake. It turns out that 'Every Morning' is the only passable song on the whole record, which is no doubt the reason they released it as the first single. The rest of the songs, I'm sorry to say, flow into one another in dissapointing endlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"pop songs for your girlfriend","review":"Of course every chick loves this band and especially Sugar Ray, the voice and looks makes a groovy impression.

It's a good blend of hip-hop backbeats and California surf-soul.. Mark McGrath is an underated vocalist and lyricist, and uses numerous influences ranging from the Beach Boys to The Clash to complete an album that is definitely worth repeated listenings. The only problem is the filler, and there's plenty of it. But most of the tracks are well produced and do allow for some cohesion. It's a fun record, regardless.

I'm especially partial to the song \\"Falls Apart\\" (track 3) It has the perfect mix of Rock but also mixes great harmonies into it. Every Morning is also great--but only if you don't listen to it for like 3 weeks then listen to it. I am impressed with this. you will be too.

Often after I have gotten the clothes from the dryer, the clothes or blanket/sheet still have the odor on them such as body odors and accidents (urine), so its not that great of a cleaner because I have to inspect everything, spray and add extra detergent/soda to ensure cleanliness.

Clearly, Dossey has a connection with the fascinating Miss Nightingale that spans the boundaries of time and space.

I finally laid the comforter on the floor and then the cover on top of it.The cover is at least 10 inches to short in both width and length. Even if I had used hot water in stead of the coolwater to wash it, I can't believe it would have shrunk this much.Very disappointing.

I also bought the Pinzon down blanket to go into the cover. Not realizing I bought blankets and not comforters, when I went to put everything together, the cover was slightly smaller than the blanket. I was a little upset at myself until I realized the extra size of the blanket would actually help keep it from moving around in the duvet!! I made the bed with the duvet buttons at the foot of the bed. The excess blanket hangs out slightly but as it's tucked between the bed and the footboard, it's not at all noticeable. And again the extra length keeps the cover in place.The duvet itself is incredibly soft and adds a layer of warmth to the blanket. I also bought matching sheets. I liked the combo so well that I bought a set for my king sized bed shortly after getting theirs put together. Now we're all toasty and warm at night.

I cannot understand how child-like grammar, which is worse than the actual grammar used by my four year old daughter, can possibly be a positive influence. Moreover, the behavior of this character is exactly the behavior we are trying to help our daughter grow out of, so why would I encourage it by reading this?

The original War Games was filled with wonderful, sympathetic HUMAN characters, funny moments amid the rising drama, and a wonderful sense of pace and build. The Dead Code has NONE of this, substituting MTV-like editing, suspense-free drama, and amoral characters who you want to slap from the first moment. How to count the wrongs? The \\"Bimbo Bomb\\" at the very beginning? The completely inept chase scene where speeding cars CANNOT catch up with the on-foot suspects? The mother character who is introduced, and then dropped like a lead brick? The final scene which does nothing more than copy the original message? The non-existent chemistry between the two leads? The only good parts of this film are when they bring back elements from the original film, but those pleasures are few and far between. This one is awful from the word go. Watch the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"One star would be too low as it had two redeeming moments, but I'm comfy with two stars.

A couple good ideas in the script, and a couple of good moments, but they're outnumbered by a hundred bad ideas. The ending stole too much from the original.

Made in the US of 50% recycled fiber, and machine washable, the cleaning pad seems to make rather inflated claims. Measuring at a mere 3-4 mm thick, the gun pad is hardly lush. It appears to be constructed of a chintzy polyester felt with an even more miniscule plasticized backing. While it might protect the surface from minor drips or spills the Drymate pad is unlikely to provide adequate cushioning or surface protection. The thin plasticized backing is neither slippery nor tacky and while it lays reasonably flat and doesn't slide excessively, it hardly grips. I doubt this pad will last long or hold up to repeated washings.

Of all the costumes we searched online, the ones with the muscles were his favorite. I ordered this one on a limb, but was 100% happy with it once it arrived. My son looked so awesome in it and received SO many compliments when he wore it trick or treating. The quality isn't the best, but it's a kid's costume, and I don't expect/need it to last forever.

This batman costume looks like it should have the cotton but it doesn't. Instead it is a board under the material that gives it that look. It is awkward and not as good as it could have been had it been made the other way.Also the cape is connected to the mask which makes it so that if the cape gets stuck or stepped on it will yank the head back. Definitely needs to be re-designed with kids and practicality in mind. My son loves batman so I couldn't return it because I didn't want to disappoint him, but he didnt wear the mask/cape at all during trick or treating. Not ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I've had things fall out of my ear that were more interesting than this movie and I'm quite serious.

More stylish, more Sci-Fi.The film itself is very interesting, a little quirky in places, but actually makes an attempt at being original; for which it suceeds. The black comedy element comes as a surprise. It is an Australian film, but comes across more as a Bristish-type movie in some ways.I was a little disappointed in the authoring quality, but considering the price of the DVD, what can you expect.

If there is too much information in California to include enough information about a site, perhaps LP shouldn't publish the title. Listing every potential site without adequate information is not helpful.I have used the LP Turkey, Bali, and Greece books, and while I think most of the problem with this book stems from LP's confusing and cluttered format (which was a problem for those books as well), this book was less useful for my California traveling than those other books were, although I cannot put my finger on why that is.I am thinking of getting the Fodor's guide instead.

Now, I have never had and probably never will have a guru, but I do get a feeling that I would indeed think is similar to sitting in your guru's presence.However, this particular set is indeed energizing and much better suited for serious listening, but not for meditation. An hour spent in this musical master's presence is still intensely rewarding. It does help to have a basic understanding of what to expect and listen to in music of India, but if you are tuned into the sound of the sitar, no more is truly necessary.Scholars or just plain ordinary music-lovers like myself can very much appreciate and enjoy this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the best","review":"Great little flashlight, very bright and the belt holster makes it VERY convenient.

It is made from solid anodized aluminum that I have no doubt will last me many many years. The lens on the front is made of plastic and is only water resistant, not water proof. The best part about this flashlight is the... light! This thing is BRIGHT! You can adjust the light from flood to spot by twisting its cap (like all mag-lite's) and it even has several modes you can put it in like half brightness, sos, strobe, etc...

It is a good, sturdy, high quality light like every other Maglite. The light is super bright. It has 4 different modes: High, low, flashing, and SOS. It is nice to have two different brightnesses so you can save on batteries if you need. Even on the brightest setting the battery last longer than a normal incandescent bulb flashlight. The light is very compact so it makes it easy to carry around. It is weather resistant so that is another plus too. Really the only downside to this light is the fact that you can't really adjust the beam on it like you can on other Maglites. This isn't really a defect of the flashlight since all led bulb flashlights that I am aware of are like this. You won't regret getting this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible junk. Switch fails more than it works. Tried 2 of these before I gave up on them completely.

I sent an email to Maglite about the problem but never heard from them. Finally, after a year of sporadic use the light gave out altogeter. After putting new batteries in it the light flared blue and then quit. I again sent a note to Maglite and was told to send the light and a check for $7.00 to the factory and it would be repaired. I chose not to do so because I could have purchased a new one for the total I would be paying.Although I've always had good service from Maglite I am considering a different brand because I do not feel that Maglite stands behind their product enough. I would not recommend this light.Yatta Jacob"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am impressed","review":"I bought this because I was looking for a replacement for my incandecent version of the mini mag.

I just wrapped the flashlight with two loops of electrical tape and it fit like a glove...a tight glove. For the price this light is a definite thumbs up. The beam is bright and adjustable as you turn the housing and with a little help the accessory pack works great with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small flashlights","review":"Bought four of these in different colors for nieces and nephew for a camping trip. They are amazingly bright. Too bright, perhaps. But the 25% power mode is a nice bonus. Quality item. Long lasting battery life (according to the box) (actually, I switched up to these when I found out that the old, non-LED bulbs were not only older, but significantly shorter lived).The only problem is that it is a little hard to get the flashlight into different modes. But that may just take practice. The flashing mode (for alerting people) the SOS morse code mode (for signaling for help) also very useful aspects of the flashlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"This is the second one of these I've owned.

I spent $20+ on this light and if the head of the light taps anything during use, so say you inspecting an engine bay and you extend the light to look at something, if it hits the side, the flashlight changes modes. Absolutely as irritating as possible, bought two of them and they both do the same thing. I was hoping they would swap it out and be more attentive to the problem. I wouldn't buy another mag light ever. I bought a Dorcy LED light for $5 that turns on, is brighter and turns off. No foolishness needed or blinking, dimming and sos modes if it gets tapped. What a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Maglite ever.","review":"I hate this flashlight. I use a small flashlight at work, probably 12 times a day. I went to this flashlight because it was supposed to be brighter and the batteries were supposed to last longer.

Don't buy unless they pay you $50 to take it. then keep the $50 and throw the POS away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright but hate SOS feature","review":"I am pleased with the brightness of this flash lite, but the twisting of the head to get it to just stay on, and not start the stupid flashing on and off, drives me nuts! I have an old mini Mag lite which I retrofitted to led, and although it is not as bright, it at least does not start flashing on and off whether or not I want it to. The flashing feature really is extremely irritating! I use rechargeable batteries in my mini mags. This head twist one will work okay for just a little while but when the batteries begin to lose the least bit of charge it commences with the bloody flashing. My old retrofitted one just gets dim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst LED flashlight","review":"I had been using it for 4 months and now the LED light is totally burned out. Never buy this product again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the $$$","review":"This light is one of several I have acquired as of late and for the price.... It is decent. For me, the color temperature is a little too cool(on the whitish-blue side).I prefer a slightly warmer temp. The twist control is fine if that is what you are used to and don't want to change. I prefer a tailcap switch that allows momentary operation.If you are looking for a nice entry level LED light, I suggest the FENIX E21, which although around twice the price of the Mini-Mag, feels like a much better built light, and is much brighter. All in all for the price, it is hard to beat, especially with a lifetime warranty. Just don't expect too much and you should be happy.BTW. The nylon holster does a good job at carrying the light on your belt for daily carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"maglite","review":"maglite as brand is very good in my experience, but this product has an very ineffective on and off switch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"Just like others are saying.The switch has problems functioning.Great flashlight when it will work.Which is a small percentage of the time.Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design Not durable","review":"I have owned 3 of these mag lite LED flashlights and the problem is they are not durable as you would expect from a mag lite. Basically if you drop them once your light is done, it will flicker and cycle through the stupid electronic modes randomly. All three of the lites i owned ended up doing this no matter how carfull i was with them. I finally gave up and switched to a drifferent brand. When they are new they are wonderfull lights but they only last 2 months tops if you actually use it. Not recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"I just received the product and really needed a flashlight, however it was dead. would not turn on even with fresh batteries. and yes i know how to turn them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like my Maglite","review":"I didn't like my maglite. The lumen strength was average and the battery usage was average. The bulbs do go and you have to replace them which I found fiddley and I bought some bulbs once which did not fit so wasted my money. Another time the prong broke on the bulb when I was trying to replace it. I don't recall having to replace bulbs with other torches (an added expense). After a few years of limited use something broke inside the torch and I ended up disposing of it. The one plus I give it is that I liked the candle mode (a nice feature to use) but I won't be purchasing a maglite again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has problems","review":"I got one as soon as they came out years ago. I had problems with it as soon as I took it out of the package. There's a contact inside of it for the + side of the battery that came with corrosion on it that made the light turn on / off randomly. I tried cleaning it with a pencil as per the instructions on Mag's website and it still had the same problem. I sent it in for the warranty expecting a new unit, they sent me the same one after they had tried cleaning it with a pencil, and it still has the same problem. SUCKS don't buy. I like the cheapy ones I get for a couple bucks or FREE that have 8 or 9 little leds over the Maglite LED. I also have a Dorcy LED that works alot better and is alot brighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has worked a pair of hours!","review":"After a first set of batteries, the rotating switch has a misfire which makes me unable to turn it on.

Only the red color of light is today the only poor consolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered!!","review":"If you check my records, the product that I received was not this picture.

Good multipurpose light for the price. No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be seen from the moon","review":"Only jocking, but this light sure is bright. With a quick turn, it will then halve it's brightness. Another turn and it starts to flash. With one last turn, it will then flash out SOS in Morse Code. Very cool. The head is also slightly bigger the the normal halogen. One thing I do notice that is annoying, is that the light emmited seems to have a stroboscopic effect, especially as I move the light around. I find this is tiresome on my eyes and would probably not purchase another one because of it. If the frequenecey were to jump past what is decernable by eye, only then would I purchase another LED torch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak beam with annoying flash options","review":"Picked up one of these Maglite LED 2AA lights on Black Friday. Trying it out, the light projected is about half that of a Streamlight flashlight that uses only one AA battery. It's also much more blue of a light. With new batteries, the beam seems quite weak.Next, I tried the options for a flashing beam, 25% power, and SOS. The packaging included no instructions as to how to use these. After a bit of experimentation, I found the Maglite cycles between all the options. If you want a normal, solid beam, you can use it once. After that, you much turn the Maglite on and off several times to cycle through all the other options.I want a flashlight that works without me having to turn it on and off several times to get a normal beam of light. Back this goes to the store, as other brands such as Surefire, Fenix, and Streamlight do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Maglite.Ever.","review":"I love Maglites, have used them for years, but they dropped the ball on this one. The \\"electronic switch\\" apparently has a mind of its own. You switch between modes (high beam, low beam, flashing beam, etc.) by twisting the head off and on again quickly. But it will switch modes (or go off completely) on its own with no movement of the head at all. First I thought the batteries might be weak, but that wasn't the case.I will still buy Maglites, but I will avoid the \\"convenience\\" of \\"electronic switches\\" like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"good thing,but pouch - bad","review":"Best flash liter i ever owned. a little moon in a pocket, Highly recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I use a flashlight in my work pretty much everyday. I bought this hoping for the best. What a disappointment... The light starts out sort of bright, but if you leave it on for more than 5 minutes, the light output drops significantly. Plus, it does not \\"focus\\" or \\"zoom\\". It is pretty much a piece of junk. I gave it to my kid who likes it, but he liked the broken flashlight he had before just as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Decent","review":"This flashlight is well made and a definite upgrade over incandescent flashlights. However, as far as LED lights go, this isn't very bright. The Duracell Daylite flashlights seem like they put out almost twice the brightness, and its flood beam is way brighter than the Mag's.Mag has been traditionally a reliable tool, however, they're definitely losing their edge with the introduction of the LED."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating switch and multi function","review":"I bought this light because of the name. I had been frustrated with other low grade LED flashlights so decided to go with the quality I felt Maglite represented. Unfortunately I've been disappointed. I tried to use it as a work light but gave up on it. It flickers on and off when bumped during use. I tried tightening the end cap but to no avail. It may be a faulty switch as indicated by another reviewer. The multi function switch is total aggravation to me. Flashing mode and SOS mode are of no use to me, and probably no use to anyone else either. I find it odd that other reviewers find these features so valuable, but maybe they find themselves in life threatening situations more often than I do. I just want a flashlight that turns on and off when I want it to, and this one fails that simple test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and sturdy","review":"Bought this as a recommendation this thing is quite powerful and has multifunctions like S.O.S mode or power saving mode with a quick twist and it comes with a sturdy pocket that can be attached to a belt i like this so much I am thinking in buying it's big brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected more of a Maglite","review":"I have had problems with this one staying on. You have to bang it to get it to come on half the time. And it's only a couple of months old, and I just had to replace the batteries already. It is very bright and when it works well, I love it.

The blanket MUST be washed before using as it does feel stiff right out of the package (as most things do). There was no excessive lint after washing and drying; perhaps different colors shed more than others.Purchased the light green, washed them, used them for a couple of hours, and I think they are wonderful. Light-weight and hold in body heat very well.As far as the complaints about 'unfinished edges', there is no need to finish a selvedge edge, hemming would only add bulk. Regarding the negative comment of 'I can see my hand through it': This can be achieved by pulling it tightly over your hand and finding an extremely bright light.If there is such a thing as a perfect blanket, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martrex Velex Queen electric Blanket","review":"Do not buy this blanket.

First noticed when blanket was a month old, one spot where the outer material has disappeared. In the spot you can see an inner weave material, but the outer material is gone. During the next several months, more of these places have appeared. I can't directly put a cause on the problem- seems to wash & dry well, no excessive lent. The blanket is used gently. I don't know! I wish I had returned it when the problem was first noticed, but time passes fast. For this problem I have to rate it at 1 star. If it didn't have this problem with holes- I would give it a 5 star.

Not to mention Ron looks like he swallowed a whole lemon and Hermione's legs are out of proportion.If you note the pictures, they look like the hair has texture, the glasses normal, and the faces very close to the actors.

The only problem I had was that the story kind of fell short at the end. The way it was told and where the story worked reminded me a lot of Ingmar Bergman's \\"Cries and Whispers\\" and \\"Scenes from a Marriage.\\" The songs and music are compelling.

The film was also overly slow without much of real interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Pretentious.","review":"By now, with his third film, Tran Anh Hung has no new elements to sustain his debut, Scent of Green Papaya. Hung tries so hard to avoid the war politics of Vietnam and gets bogged down on melodramatic mess. It is sad that Hung, respected by western critics, is in deep denial of Vietnam's colonial history. In Cyclo, he deals a little bit with the sociological aspects of Vietnam; unfortunately, he does not probe deep enough to be compelling.'Being compelling' perhaps is Hung's problem. The characters, particularly the three sisters, in this movie are flat, one-dimensional, and utterly unconvincing. Furthermore, they are exoticized, especially Hung's own star and real-life wife, who played the youngest sister. The plot is so thin and choppy. The pacing of this film is so erratically episodic and as slow as molasses.Hung focuses on so much so on the visual aesthetic that he completely abandons the storytelling aspect of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vietnamese chick flick","review":"After the first fifteen minutes, I was bored with these stories of three sisters.

The dialogue is very corny. It's written with a Westerner's attitude and perception of Vietnamese life.

The movie is so westernized that there's very little Vietnamese left in it.This movie is painfully slow. I had a real hard time paying attention.

This product gave me just the finish I needed, and I don't have to worry about it flaking or cracking. It it very thin, like water, so it flows into crevices well. Some of the surface I coated was a very fine thread, and the coating was so thin, that it did not cause any binding of the threads. It is very important to have a clean metal surface.

Barbed comments abound which instead of shedding light on the book's subject matter, seem to be included to ridicule its subject.Instead of delving deeper into the life of Mr. Gable, Mr. Harris belabors whatever industry gossip he unearths and uses this unsubstantiated information to propel paragraphs of his own personal musings.

With Clarke at the helm, they released gems like \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\", \\"Dreaming Of Me\\", and \\"New Life\\". After he left, they became darker and (unfortunately) more commercial. The early years and their synth-heavy soundscapes were left behind...to the detriment of New Wave fans everywhere.This compilation represents the high point of Depeche Mode, at least in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound quality!!","review":"Don't misinterpret this review.

The follow-up -Just Can't Get Enough -was \`hugely enjoyable, bouncy and boppy and very close to irritating.' It got worse. \`Just Can't Enough was trying... and now this is insipid,' another critic said the next hit See You. To be fair, Depeche Mode's early material ... wasn't any worse than their contemporaries at the time.

Most of the tracks on this CD are just horrid. You feel embarressed just listening to them much less owning the CD. But, the album does have a few good tracks.

Although I have a Japanese version of it, I liked the fact that my copy included all the lyrics as well as some pretty interesting reviews about the band which can be quite funny at times.

Oh yeah, if you like People are People and some other classics that were not included in your Catching Up cd, this has it.

Songs like Just Can't Enough, Leave in Silence, Master and Servant and many others show how the band chnages style many times. In the early days it was a straight forward synth pop band with bouncy and meaningless lyrics such as New Life. Later on the lyrics improve allot due to the departure of Vince Clarke and Martin Gore taking over the task to write the music and the lyrics. He manages to pen such unforgetable tracks for instence everything counts, master and servant and many others. It is nice to see how a band starts and then matures and finds their true potential. This is definetely the case with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"bottle pourers","review":"I purchased these bottle pourers for several reasons, one being that they were very reasonable in price.

It was a hole-in-the-wall record store in Lansdale, PA, and I had never before explored the world of Indian music. The Dhun on this recording was instantly a favorite: the call-and-response at the conclusion between the sitar and tabla remains one of my favorite passages of music, period. Shankar is at the peak of his form here, and the longer meditative raga is serene and magnificent. The initial spritely raga is lovely as well.Perhaps because I took my SATs with the dhun playing in my head to calm me down; perhaps because every copy of this recording I've owned to this point has been damaged in some way, and now the CD brings beautiful crystalline sound; perhaps because the Dhun truly is one of Shankar's most accessible and splendid recordings: whatever the case, I love this recording, and I am grateful for Mr. Shankar's enduring gift of artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Renditions - Great Funky Reggae","review":"I admit I was a little leery, I thought it would simply be some weak reggae-fied 60's soul tracks - more novelty than anything (or worse - steel drums) but these are top notch re-interpretated reggae-funk with meaningful performances.There are some killer cuts that not only remind you that 1960's soul/r&b; was not just fun and games - it held meaning and ask real questions - and this CD shows that that message is universal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be updated.","review":"I think the training was ok, but this is 2012 and selling training for the older versions of excel pre-2003 is a waist of time.

The flimsy insufficient-for-metal-parts box arrived tattered, torn, and red pieces of the tricyle were scratched. We decided to keep it due to fact that our newly-adopted son had never had a trike, and we so wanted him to have one waiting under the tree on Christmas morning. Assembly instructions were blurred black drawings. My mechanically-inclined husband had to work and work to get the tricycle together. Parts didn't fit well. Handlebars were the worst. They won't tighten and stay straight no matter what. The basket won't fit on the front if you attempt to really tighten handlebars. Long story short, I'm back online and shopping for a usable, better quality tricycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"This was my first Trollope novel and I don't understand why he isn't more popular.

As a \\"radio-drama\\", it was an excellent story. My fifteen-year-old daughter and I cried quite a bit throughout the second half of the story.The book on tape is told from the father's perspective. He's working too hard and his little girl is growing up to fast. Only, like most of us who get caught in that trap, he doesn't realize just how fast she's growing up until...but that is the story, and I won't ruin it.Yes, you will know the direction this story is going fairly quickly. No, there are not many surprises. Yet, every once in a while, it is good to hear a story that is sentimental and sweet.I don't know if I would have enjoyed reading this as a book, but hearing it while driving was a worthwhile experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sappy, not well written","review":"I was really ready to like this, but found it sappy and a weak story. Details that didn't fit, loose ends -- what was the point of the music? Where was it coming from? And highly predictable. Lots better Christmas stories around, e.g. Polar Express, A Christmas Memory (Capote), Gift of the Magi, even Seuss's Grinch, etc. Dickens makes the same points more majestically in A Christmas Carol. I wouldn't recommend this over any of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a marketing tool.","review":"Overrated and poorly written, this book was a huge disapointment. With every boring and simplistic paragraph I wanted to scream. The characters are flat, and the narration and sequence of events frequently illogical. Moreover the plot was so obvious and trite that I wanted to gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty cover & great opening conceal lousy book.","review":"The book is seriously flawed, to say the least.First it has a 4 year-old girl speaking in the voice of an adult. Why? Because the author wants to lay the wisdom of a child on us as the central theme of the book. It doesn't work. Sorry, but four year olds don't speak in complex sentences. That almost ruined it for me, but I figured, go ahead, maybe it won't make the same mistake twice.There are other events, however, that are equally jarring. I can't provide details because they occur at crucial points in the plot. In my opinion, it's cheating to use unrealistic events in order to let a story reach the conclusion desired. Such techniques stink and rob readers of their time spent. Puleeze!!I happen to LOVE touching Christmas stories that are done well. (I was a fan of \\"The Waltons,\\" if that is any indication.) I almost threw this book across the room after finishing it, however, I felt so cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I'm not surprised The Christmas Box was a runaway bestseller or that is has become a Christmas classic. This small book has a big heart; the story is lovely and moving, yet never maudlin.

It drags you in and you don't want to put it down until you have finished. I started reading this one afternoon and thirty minutes later I was finished and sobbing. At one point I was crying so hard I couldn't see the words on the page. This book helps you see the true meaning of the holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sap and Salt Lake City","review":"I'm not one for emotional literary melodrama and I've come across two reactions (mainly) to this book. Either one loves it and it brings a charming nostalgia or it is taken as a cheesy attempt at capturing Christmas via the tale of a bereft widow. Set in Salt Lake City, a family with young children moves into a quaint Victorian home (the likes of which I've never seen in dreary and overly suburbian Salt Lake) to care for an elderly widow, and discover this heartwarming old woman lost a child as a young wife. From there, the story loosely ties to the idea of life after death and how to heal through your grief of losing a loved one and how to appreciate your family while you have them. These are all appealing themes but I found this book to be quite commercial and a little too Disney meets the Lifetime channel. If you're into sappy books with overtly Christian themes this might be a good read. Otherwise, stick to Dickens for Christmas family narratives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Christmas Box","review":"I was disappointed. Did not have the feel of a good book.

But I think I've finally learned my lesson . . . the hard way. This book is so disappointing! Not solely because it's poorly written, but because it's making so much money and it's so ordinary, so lackluster, so . . . boring. What is it about books like this one, Waller's The Bridges of Madison County and Sparks' The Notebook that make the American public go gaga?

However, I have very little nice to say about this novel. I read this \\"novel\\" last night in 45 minutes. FORTY FIVE minutes of reading time for $14.15. What a horrible waste of money. This isn't a novel, it's a extended short story that is terribly written and the plot itself is so ridiculously convenient as to make the message of the story unbelievable.I am a mom who has lost a child and this story still did not resonate with me. Instead, it read as a gimmick and the special message at the end was none too surprising. I am more surprised that people have to read this book to figure out that the \\"gift\\" god gave his children on the first Christmas was the gift of his son, Jesus. Yes - Jesus was our original gift and was altogether more special because he was the child of God.

But I was annoyed to find that while the story remained the same, they took out all of the fun in the book. If it was a funny line or scene, the author either removed it all together or destroyed the cute one liners by draging them out. Then the Characters were wrong. O'Connell was portrayed as big, tough, and steritipical hero type instead of a fun, dashing, and brave hero type. In fact i think the only one right was Benni.

This one is in COLOR! It is a documentary of the P-47 Thunderbolt in action over Germany. The film contains excellent gunship footage, especially of the aerodrome raids in April, 1945.Near the end of the program, thousands of German soldiers are shown walking back to Germany in defeat. U.S. Airmen are filmed during the close of the war and are shown during the disbanding of their units.The fact that this documentary is in color is what separates it from others I have seen. The vivid colors of the German country side, and of people, uniforms, and equipment bring a reality that black and white cannot duplicate. Having served seven years in Germany with the U.S. Army, I find that many parts of the country shown in the films look as though they were filmed yesterday.

This CD features guests like Janet Jackson, Mystical, and Ozzy Osborne along this time as guests, as well as the Flipmode Squad. The song with Janet is the best collaboration with Rhymes on this CD. Give this album a try and trust me Fans and Non-Fans of busta won't be disappointed at all. He just has the powerful energy of a super hero! If you weren't into this kind of music before, you will be now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What The ****!!!","review":"After hearing his flawless album When Disaster Strikes,E.L.E makes you say what type of sh*t is busta on!!His interludes can't even test his last album.His lyrics are repetitive and have nothin' to do with E.L.E!! The album was so disappointing I taped 2 songs and returned it. He has to 3 good songs and that's pushing it.They're Tear The Roof Off, Gettin Rowdy Wit Us... feat.Mystikal and his one With Ozzy Ozbourne.Busta was my 2nd fav artist but with this album he dropped quite a few notches!!Better luck next time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ELE has some really awesome songs","review":"ELE has a great rap song with Mystikal and Ozzy Osbourne, even Janet Jackson is good.

But I'll tell ya, dem be fools! On E.L.E. he busts out with some fresh raps that are so advanced that even a spring chicken would have a hard time scratchin' it!What I appreciate about this CD is Busta makes his own wall of funky, odd-timing jams, then busts through it with smooth lyrics. \\"What's it gonna be?\\" is a perfect example of this; The song, featuring Janet Jackson as a guest-vocalist, combines his serious New York street rapper talent with a trip-hop beat and high-tech instrumentation, then adds Janet's lovely voice to smooth it all over into a cream dream. Here y'all- Let the suckas drown, Busta Rhymes breaks it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad content; amazing talent","review":"As I am a Christian, I cannot stand the things Busta Rhymes sings about. But after listening to \\"Gimme Some More\\" I was absolutely floored by Busta's speed and clarity in his raps. The sample for that song is also an amazing contrast to the lightning-fast raps.

Busta rhymes would be so much cooler if he wouldn't swear. Thanks to busta rhymes i swear so much i got my mouth washed out with soap every day.

This blanket was thin, cheaply-made, and some edges were not even finished off. It does not have the weight and softness that the other Martex Vellux blankets have (and still have) so I felt that I purchased a 'flawed' blanket.

Themed anthologies are always a iffy proposition, since they tend to force writers into places they don't belong, and to compile one takes a highly-skilled editor to pull it off. Unfortunately this editor doesn't come near to any of that kind of talent. If it didn't have heavy marketing behind it this book would surely die the quiet death of dumb books, but instead it (and its predecessor, which was forgiven for a cute attempt at a bad idea) create a public embarassment for literary erotica as it is intended to be and the poor writers who had faith in the project."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit of shallow water","review":"A bit of shallow water, some nice art work, but not much to read.

I must definitely disagree with all those who find it too technical. Rather on the contrary, I would say. Admittedly, entire pages with greek letters look intimidating at first glance. But what Hamilton actually does is making a huge effort (unlike most of his competitors) to actually explain the details of the derivations, thereby helping the reader a lot. You'll learn to appreciate this a lot by the time you start developing sth. on your own rather than simply applying existing techniques.By now, I've been through most of the chapters and I'm yet to find a typo, let alone a major mistake.

Colin Friels is the trumpeter - John Anderson - who meets Cross before his hot chops gains him the slick moniker, Dingo.And from that encounter, Dingo Anderson is placed on a musical journey, not only to strive for artistic excellence, but to seek out Cross one more time. This is a universal path, but in Dingo, the trek is paved through jazz charts calling out to Anderson & Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"After getting into Miles Davis' music a few years ago, I looked upon this film as one of the holy grails of jazz. Because it is out of print, I rented it so I could decide whether or not to buy a used copy. I was immensely disappointed at how poorly made this film is--and I wasn't hoping for a great film, but a decent little film with a jazz story and soundtrack. The characters weren't likable, and the direction and film editing were clumsy and sophmoric. This film had nothing but the soundtrack going for it, and that I could listen to on a CD. It looks as if Miles was picking up some extra cash and the makers were exploiting one of the greatest names in jazz. I like quirky little films that have some flaws, but this film has just too many.For a good jazz film, try Round Midnight with Dexter Gordon. That one hit the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have your friends ever complimented you on your toilet paper?","review":"Just like in another review, I've had friend after friend use my bathroom and tell me how great my toilet paper is.

However, I thought the writing left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am the stepmother of Erick Esch","review":"It is too bad that the author didn't bother to get correct information from the family members that had to go through the horrific ordeal. I personally read the book and it sounds like Erick Esch himself wrote the book. What a joke! I lived with Erick Esch during the time of the crime and he had absolutely NO REMORSE for the crime committed. Why didn't he say in the book why he only served 3 years of a 28 year sentence? The mystery remains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear no Evil review","review":"The book was ok but there should of been more background on John Velasquez.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"I picked this book up yesterday at noon and literally could not put it down until I finished it last night. What a fantastic author! So well written. My favorite true crime author up until this book was Ann Rule. Now I have two favorites. The writing makes you watch a \\"mind movie\\" of all that is happening. This was such good writing and such a compelling story that I will be first in line to buy more books by this author. I cannot say enough good things about the talent this author has for making you see things that are happening. The story comes alive and it is almost as if you are there. The characters are so well developed and the story is just incredible. The only thing I would have liked more about this book is to have learned more about the victim. My heart goes out to his family. This story should be discussed with all teenagers as a good lesson in how the law works and how much you risk by doing incredibly stupid things. An awesome read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch true crime","review":"Yet again, you can't judge a book by its (lurid) cover or dumb sales pitches (\\"8 pages of startling photos\\"). This is an excellent, quick read. Jarrod Wall is very well portrayed. His suggested motivation for the murder is very interesting and quite convincing. However, Wall has all the classic traits of a sociopath & I came away from the book feeling that was equally important in his crime as the suggested motive. Many, many boys have experienced something along the lines of the trauma Jarrod went through without resorting to murder. My impression of Wall from the book made me glad he remains in prison. On the other hand, the author's portrayal of Erick Esch was also good, and I left convinced that he should not be in prison & deserved a second chance. Overall, this was a good, solid read & well worth the money & time for true crime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things left unsaid","review":"I'm from Huntington as well and was closer to this story than most. We pretty much accepted Jarrod's motive as it was explained during the court proceedings, however many of us knew there was more to it. There was much more suspicion of Clayton Carter than was ever mentioned in the book. I don't feel that justice was completely served in this case or he would have been included in the overall judgement. I do feel the book has brought to light many of my suspicions and validated several of them. One thing I did not like about the book was the portrayal of Mr. and Mrs. Wall. I will never in my life judge them for how they reacted to these events. People react to shock and grief in many different ways. I know for certain that this devastated them, and to portray them as uneffected was a mistake. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand the situation better, however keep in mind that even 12 years later, there are still many things that remain unsaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some reviewers are missing the point","review":"Just because Napoleon scrambeled and won doesn't make him lucky in fact that's what makes him a great military leader. He was a detailed planner but he understood that no plan survives first contact and that adjustments need to be made on the fly. The side that can make the quicker and faster adjustments wins. I think the author should have stayed away from words like \\"Blundering\\" in the title because it gives the impression that he was lucky but nothing could be farther from the truth. If Napoleon was lucky you could say he made his own luck. The ability to quickly adapt plans especially when your moving large armies is predicated on detailed planning and a well trained chain of command and staff system - all the responsibility of the man in charge. This book, from this perspective, enhances the great reputation that Napoleon has and deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blundering to Authorship is more like it.","review":"For some reason, the Napoleonic Era is my passion. I love to consume books about it. I bought \\"Blundering to Glory\\" in order to learn more. All I could learn from it is that some people are still fighting the Napoleonic Wars. In the place of muskets and cannon are prejudiced words and propoganda of the age. Mr. Connelly uses the same Anglo-eccentric/ anti-Napoleon propoganda that was used back then. At first, I thought it different, but as each chapter unfolded it became easier and easier to predict what he would say. I usually keep the Napoleonic books that I purchase. Needless to say, this is one that I didn't keep. So, I suggest that you do not make the same mistake I made and instead save your money and look for authors like Peter Hofschroer, David Hamiton-Williams, Scott Bowden, John Codman Ropes, Jay Luvaas, Brent Nosworthy, George Nafziger, Andrew Uffindell,... the list goes on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of mine","review":"It\`s been 20+ years since I first heard this album and this was my introduction to the great playing of Dave Weckl.Being a drummer, I must say that the whole CCEB catalog is a drumming class, vital listening for those who love the instrument.All musicians here are seasoned and experienced at this point of their career, since in 1991 they had been playing together for 5 years.The album starts with a bang of a beat and just keeps rolling all the way until the last track, a 10 minute masterpiece that showcases the band skills, grooving ability, rhythm creation and melodical side.A must have for all CCEB fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical genius","review":"Caviat : I am a fan of Chick CoreaHaving only owned one CD of the bands \\"Eyes Of The Beholder\\" prior to this purchase, I was about to go see the band play in NYC @ the Blue Note and wanted to expand my familiarity with the repertoire.

The sounds produced for this CD are misguided rip offs of such groups as Bronski Beat, M-People, Madonna and Kylie Minogue. Shlock after shlock is contained herein and the songs that don't sound like other artists are barely worth placing down her cleavage...But I do believe that BELIEVE the single was a masterpiece, probably because as alleged this week - she never wrote it. If you didn't let someone buy you this for Christmas, DON'T touch it, it says alchemy all over! Amazon.com are selling a new mix of the single 'Believe' which is yet to be released.

It is Cher at her absolute best, her powerful voice tracing through dance anthems such as \\"Taxi Taxi\\" and \\"Strong Enough\\". The smash-hit #1 Believe is definately the best recording, but this is also definately not one of those CDs that you buy for the hit song and never listen to the rest. No, folks, this is one of those CDs that you enjoy from beginning to end. It is proof that no one bridges the age gap like Cher. Although sometimes corny, you have to admit, that whatever she does, her Cherness shines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe in CHER!!","review":"Cher's 1998 success of \\"Believe\\" marks her as the oldest woman to ever have a chart topper, and a number one hit. The title track was THE pop song of 1998, putting artists like Brandy, Monica, Lauryn Hill and Britney Spears in 2nd place. \\"Believe\\" in my opinion is better and more danceable than 2001's hit \\"Living Proof.\\" She also works with Madonna's prodcuer William Orbit. Some people say Cher copied MAdonna's dance style of \\"Ray of Light\\" but I sitll love both even if she did copy Madonna. I dont thinks he did though. Anyways, this includes great dance james like \\"Taxi Taxi\\", \\"Love D'Amour\\", \\"All or Nothing\\" and a remix of the 1988 classic \\"We All Sleep Alone.\\" If you're a Cher fan your CD collecion is NOTHING without \\"Believe\\", a dance classic and the best dance/pop album of 1998!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Cher Makes a Believer Out of Me","review":"Cher is dynamic throughout her \\"Believe\\" album. Strong vocals and great production make this one of Cher's best efforts. The album opens with the title track, Billboard's top single in 1999. \\"Believe\\" is a soaring dance track sure to be among Cher's signature songs for years to come. The album features a strong cover of \\"The Power,\\" a song originally recorded by Amy Grant. The singles, \\"All or Nothing\\" and \\"Strong Enough,\\" are pop gems with the latter sounding like a true 1970s disco classic. \\"Dove L'Amore\\" is a sensual love song with a great latin beat. The album closes with a remix of the 1987 Cher rock classic, \\"We All Sleep Alone.\\" It is reworked with a techno dance beat. The song shines almost as much as it did on the 80s Geffen album, \\"Cher.\\" Indeed from start to finish, \\"Believe\\" is the best Cher album since 1989's \\"Heart of Stone.\\" \\"Believe\\" is the perfect foundation for Cher's greatest comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album","review":"This is my first album by Cher. I have many cds, but this is my favorite. The best songs are: Believe, The Power (also recorded on Amy Grant's 1994 album, House of Love), Runaway, Stong Enough, and Dov'e L'amore. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Cher's music or a new collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe Forever","review":"Believe Es El clasico Album Que nadie Puede Olvidar asi pasen los años.believe es Un trabajo Bien hecho Cosa que nos Desilusiono con LIVING PROOF Pero Yo creo que es un Buen Album lo unico es Que Tubo Una Mala Publicidad y por eso es que no se Vendio Muy Bien.Todas Las canciones de believe Son Un derroche de creatividad y Originalidad. Es Un Disco DANCE muy Bien hecho Ademas Con la imagen de Cher lo Hace ver un muy Buen trabajo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe WHAT????","review":"This Believe album is good. Very well put together,, But To Mr.Mc Cartney. Madonna's (Ray of Light) was NOT out sold by cher sorry buddy you wrong, Ray of Light is now at 4.5 million copies in the U.S alone, and is at 15.0 million copies world wide and peak at #2 for 2 weeks in 1998. Cher album peak at #4. this is not to put Cher down in anyway, But A proven fact is that what Cher has done in the last 45 years or so, Madonna has done it in 10 years. and has remained in the spotlight/charts since 1983 through 2003 and currently at debuted on th HOT 100 at #50. But dont get me wrong Cher rocks since 1998 was her return,/ Madonna never left. and also has more fans of all ages. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher is the best...Better 'Believe' it!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great dance cd.

Yes, for the sake of survivors, Cher will always be a grand guidance figure to shelter us from the cruelty of love when it leaves you bleeding.Despite of a few critically too cliche-sounding disco tracks, I gave 4 stars to the bold release of this record and insist \\"this is the (curing) album for the lonely\\" and hurt.P/S: The CD sleeve printing is a platinum pearl-like silverish blue which adds the disco feel to this album.

It was cool, her voice was wonderful, and the song was too. I almost bought the cd a few minuets ago, but then, horrifyed, I realized the rest of the songs on the whole album were sh*t! It's just not fair. It's not the sixties anymore. Enough with the disco! I think I might by the single but the cd's other songs are tooooooooo crappy to ever be worth their cost! Cher dident even write beleive at all. She's really phoney I think and it makes me sad cus i loved the song. Maybe someone should write all her songs, because, as I've discovered, she is just not talented at writing songs. Oh, and for those of you who don't know, It's \\"Life after Love\\" not love after love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is the worst thing since moldy bread!","review":"Cher's talent has reached new lows with BELIEVE. All of her songs have the same cheezy techno beat that only a burnt out disco freak could appreciate. With a little bit of talent and creativity (obviously lacking here) she could have made a far more enjoyable and worthwhile album. The only reason her CD got one star is because NONE was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell it if you have to.","review":"This cd was a great dissapointment to me. I thought I would be getting Cher's usual blasting talent, but in this cd it was one song after another that sounded exactly like the other.

I loved the way her voice was mixed. The tempo of the music makes you want to dance. If you didn't have fun on the disco floor in the 70's, try it now. I remember how fun it was and Cher was there too. Her voice is still deep and sexy. You go girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Cher's worst album","review":"I have loved Cher forever. I have all of her albums, autographs, pictures, etc. I even have both the U.S. and U.K. versions of her last CD, which didn't sell well here in the U.S. My point is that I was so excited to get this album but decided to listen to it first at a listening booth because I didn't want to wait another second. I have to admit that I am a completist so I purchased it, but I hated it with a passion. It sounds like it was put together in a single day haphhazard. It's cheesy alright, but not in Cher's trademark way, more like random disco numbers. Anyone who wants the real CHER should go buy the new greatest hits package."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DONT 'BELIEVE' THIS CD IT ISN'T 'STRONG ENOUGH' FOR WORDS.","review":"Cher really shows what she wants to be - 30 years younger and a pop princess....No go!

Miss this horrible CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a mistake","review":"This was a mistake with all the hype of Cher as a diva. The CD was only Cher again, with a older voice, and modern musical attempts to cover it all up. It would have been just as good to keep listening to the oldies. Besides Cher was never there long enough to make a come back as a solo artist. In my view, this is another CD to fill gaps on my CD rack. The lyrics are all about Cher it seems and I found no interaction at all, to even credit it's author. It is like staring at a picture of Cher's photos. One would need to a Cher fan possessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A JOKE","review":"This must rate as one of the worst albums of all time, i didn't think Cher could musicaly sink much lower than she already had, but boy was i wrong, this record is just the pits.

IT'S CHER!","review":"The voice! The hair! The face lift! The diva is back! This album could be easily mistaken as a Stock Aitken Waterman project and surely will make Donna Summer green with envy. Although most of the tracks in this album sound similar from one to another but Cher's energy saves the day. Apart from everybody's favorite title track, Strong Enough and the next single Dov'e Amore should get to your attention. The Latin beat of Dov'e Amore reminds me of Gina G's 'Ti A Mo' a couple years back. By the way, both songs were written and produced by the boys at Metro. Pop this CD into your car and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Listen to the touching lyrics.

Now that she is finally back on her feet some idiot has to come in and treat her like dirt again. People like them are probably just jelous anyway. This has been one of her best albums. She really tells a lot about what she is feeling. She also is just having fun. The beat she used and has been using is still the same and just as good if not better. The music is also equally good if not better. There is no reason to put her down. She has worked very hard and deserves some credit. Her inspiration has helped the music business a lot.

I only wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PIECE OF TRASH","review":"This is a horrible CD. I borrowed it from my friend's parents, because they said that it was a great CD. I was VERY WRONG! Cher is sooo fricken old. She is the oly woman on earth to have an autogrpahed version of the bible. She has also colored her hair much longer than there has been color tv. My opinion on her is that her song \\"Believe\\" is for mid-aged people who can't cope with the fact that they are getting old, so they try to listen to OUR type of music, and reccognized that they liked it, their parents liked Sonny and Cher, and even their grandparents liked them, so they buyed the CD. 'nuff said. I'm out.

Her latest is definately one of her best, including the fantastic dance tracks, Believe, Strong Enough, All or Nothing and Runaway. To appreciate the excellence of this CD, the singles released are a must to listen to. The variety of mixes are astonishing. Every song could be a hit single. Remember \\"I'ts All or Nothing now.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher Pulls It Off!","review":"\\"Believe\\" was one of those instant classic songs that defied modern trends by turning an early 80's dance theme into a late 90's monster hit. It's a powerful song and only the brilliant producer Junior Vasquez could produce such a hit. However, the remaining songs are a disappointment, showcasing Cher's amazing voice, but lacking originality. \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" is a pleasant soulful rendition that closes the CD, but the middle sounds like the filler that it is. However, only Cher could take ten songs to sell a huge album, just by her own tenacity and talent. Having the one gigantic hit doesn't hurt either. It's worth buying the album just for this song. If you really only want this song, the CD single has so many dance versions, it fills an entire CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHER BELIEVES","review":"I was never a fan of Cher, but the classic dance anthem Believe brought me to like her latest musical effort. Strong Enough, a disco diva tune and Dove Le More, a spanish dance track are my faves, I wish her music were more like this as this in my opinion is her best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 years later and still great","review":"I LOVE IT! 14 years later and still great. \\"Believe\\" is a must have for fans of Cher and those who like late 90's early '00's dance music.

I really like some of the songs, and I don't like some of the others. This is my first Cher CD so I'm not a fan or anything, in fact I don't particularly know about her much at all. But this is a good CD. I bought it for $3.99 used, and I think that's what it's worth. It's certainly not worth $14.99. If you can get it for a cheap price and you like, disco/electric music, then I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Believe Single is Delicious","review":"I have not been a fan of Cher since she was with Sonny. I actually accidently listened to the \\"Believe\\" album at a local music shop. The title track utterly amazed me coming from Cher. Is this her first techno album? The arrangement and vocoder treatments are simply stunning. The rest of the album has a few interesting instrumentations but the singing is disposable chanting sap that Cher has become famous or ridiculed for. Resort to the CD-single."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM!!!","review":"You won't get dissapointed. This is the best music I've heard from Cher ever! The best songs: All or Nothing, Strong Enough and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-cheesy yesterday, infectious today!","review":"Wow, this CD really reminds me of a waitress I worked with in the seventies. Rosie, if you're ou there, call me! Being musically adventurous, I purchased Cher's CD based on Amazon reviews and music samples. Yesterday, I thought it was really cheesy, today it has grown on me. I love the digital manipulation of her voice on the first cut, BELIEVE. It works really well with her distinctive voice! And the fifth cut, STRONG ENOUGH is pure Donna Summer circa 1977. Production sounds like a cross between Giorgio Moroder and William Orbit. Occasionally, she veers a little too close to Madonna\`s RAY OF LIGHT. At first listen, Cher sounds reluctant to sing this material, but I wouldn't be surpised if this CD outsells anyone's expectations. Cher is like a cat with nine lives. This CD is going to make a great gift for my Uncle Debbie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!","review":"I can't believe this is the same woman who sang \\"Gypsies, tramps and thieves\\" and \\"Jesse James\\" when I was younger... that's all I can say.

I used to be a huge fan of hers,but the song 'BELIEVE'is been over played,and NO i dont believe in love after love anymore! Her concert Believe at the MGM Grand otel in Las Vegas was very dissapointing also,with too many theatrical effects. She didnt even visit Studio 54! Everyone was waiting there for Miss CHER to show up after the show,but even all VIP's were dissapointed. Cher has better work than this album,i have written lot of reviews,but the were always positive,but hey mabye her next album just could be another smash hit,mabye she should retire?from ALTER EGO in Tulsa Oklahoma."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I BELIEVE\\" CHER SHOULD RETIRE AFTER THIS ALBUM!","review":"Between the facelift, clothes, and the music style, Cher is competiting with Brittany Spears for the worst album of the Millenium.

A result of too much plastic surgery...? After \\"Believe\\" was played about one hundred times, it began to get tiring. After Cher's \\"performance\\" of the song consisted of one hip-wiggle and then retiring (most probably to drink condensed milk) it became more tiring. Now, after bombarding us with incessant dance beats, each sounding exactly the same - I'm asleep. There are more talented divas out there, there are more talented singers out there.

The voice- distortion on \\"Believe\\" just makes it that much worse. The only redeeming factor? It's Cher."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD STATE OF POP MUSIC AND CHER'S CAREER","review":"I am appalled that their are so many 5-star reviews of \\"Believe\\" on this website. Cher's voice needed to be digitally enhanced by a computer to give \\"Believe\\" a bit of novelty value. It has no value as a showcase for vocal talent. The sales of her album are as astonishing as the success of the Spice Girls. Are her fans the same people who believe that Cher really uses the shampoo (for her wigs!) that she sells in TV informercials? Weak voices enhanced in the studio plus public mass without taste equals huge sales. What a sorry state for pop music and Cher."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got old fast","review":"Two days ago I bought this album because of \\"Believe.\\" At first I liked that song as well as \\"Strong Enough\\" and \\"Dov'è L'amore.\\" Now all of those songs have gotten old and there aren't any other songs worth listening to. I have CD's that I've had for a longer period of time and they still haven't gotten old. Overall, I was extremely disappointed. I will be selling this album tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What pop music?","review":"I don't even want to call this pop-dance, it's just way off the beat. The first time I heard Belive, I thought it was a guy singing, the song itself feels really long & out of tempo. If you want to believe, with a real dance pop, buy the new Backstreet Boys CD (I'm 20 year old guy & I have to admit, those guys are awesome), it's far worth it. AND I WISH THE RADIO STATION WOULD STOP PLAYING 'BELIEVE' 20 times a day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T BELIEVE.........IT! AWFUL!","review":"Oh please who can really listen to this CD and say it is really a pop wonder? The first cut \\"Believe\\" is great dance music I agree, but from then on it falls to total disasterous proportions. Give this one a thumbs down...either treat yourself to dinner or buy some other CD. Cher you should be a shamed of yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHER KILLS THE DANCE MUSIC SCENE WITH THIS ALBUM.","review":"Cher dies on delivery with this CD. \\"Believe\\" the first single off the album is the only catcy tune, the rest of the CD just falls apart, especially the second single \\"Strong Enough\\" should be retitled \\"Weak Enough\\", as for the rest of the album it sounds like one big giant single- all the songs sound the same. The worst cut \\"Taxi Taxi\\" a disco warped disaster. Bring back Donna Summer anytime, and Cher go back to what you do best \\"rock\\". Remember \\"Skin Deep\\", \\"Jesse James\\", etc. Give this dance techno a TOTAL miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cher's trying way too hard","review":"I was not all that impressed with Cher's new album. I think she's trying to fit in with music these days and if she continues it may get to the point of being a sell-out. If anyone buys the album I guess I can say two tracks to listen to are Believe and Strong Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music is probably the best I have ever heard!","review":"All the tracks are wonderful and inspiring. I can't wait to get it for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"about as good as her concert","review":"I just saw Cher last week and purchased this album before the concert. I find it very weak, as if it were conceived, recorded, and shipped in a week or so total. I couldn't \\"Believe\\" that she did four or five songs from it at her show. The only one that got the audience going was the title track. The rest sounded all the same. Like her show, this record is full of gimmicks. It's a shame she rushes through old stuff, which is much better. And after seeing her do \\"Believe\\" live, I now know why she decided to lipsynch the song on VH1 Divas Live. It's almost painful at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD, SAD, SAD.","review":"THIS IS SOO SAD, TO SEE AN ARTIST SO DESPERATE FOR A HIT THAT SHE HAS TO PERFORM SONGS THAT EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS WOULD REGARD AS SUSPECT, COME ON CHER YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"I'M FROM MEXICO AND THE ALBUM WAS A SUCCESS. I LOVE CHER SINCE ALWAYS, BUT PEOPLE ALTHOUGHT KNEW WHO SHE WAS, BELIEVE GAVE HER THE FAME SHE NEEDED HERE. I WORK IN RADIO STATIONS AND I JUST CAN SAY THAT SHE DESERVED THIS. THE BEST TRACKS OF BELIEVE ARE ALL OR NOTHING,WE ALL SLEEP ALONE, LOVE IS THE GROVE, TACKING BACK MY HEART,RUNAWAY AND BELIEVE.

I JUST HOPE THAT CHER CONTINUE WORKING IN A FUTURE ALBUM THAT SHOW US SOMETHING AS GOOD AS THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHER IS BACK, IF SHE EVER LEFT","review":"Cher is here to stay hunny.... every song on this album is great corny fun. when i first heard the title song, i thought 3 things: this is Cher? god this cheesy, and wooh! when can i hear it again...since then it has become the dance club anthem of the late nineties...i just went to Cher's concert a few weeks ago and it was the most spectacular show ever! i'll be at Cher: tour 2010! except for her and Tina...i'd like to see other 50+ stars goin on tour and dancin around in big wigs and tight leather! wooh! you go Diva!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent. This is a superb C.D!!!","review":"Whether you do or don't like cher, this c.d. is a must have for everyone. It includes the singles Belive and Strong Enough and has other great songs such as Runaway and All or nothing. This c.d. is certanly NOT a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you even MOVE with that much surgery?","review":"I actually haven't bought this CD but heard it at a friend's house against my will. Why would I buy this? It's complete, total, absolute b.s. and I'd rather rub my fingers in horse excretion than hear it again. I think Cher should've stayed with Sonny- the man who created her. She has the most annoying voice of any singer, more annoying than Snoop Dogg or even Mariah Carey. What makes me even angrier about this is that the centurion platinum \\"Believe\\" is the song that played in the backround when my ex b*tch dumped me.. Do I believe in love after love? Ah...no."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever","review":"Simply the worst album of her career!! It is as if she set out to make the perfect 1990s album. She took a pinch of tech (like Madonna) and heavy overdub on the vocals. Cher has a voice that is matched by few, but she hids it away on this album. It is a must for her, every decade she comes out of no where and makes an album that sounds like the times. Go back in your cave for another 10 years Cher!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my coke spoon?","review":"For those of you who thought (hoped?) disco was long dead and rotting in the ground, here comes another relic, Cher, with more booms and thumps the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack (and the singer herself has as much plastic). \\"Believe\\" is an instant dance-floor epic, complete with smoke-machine intro and vocoder effects. It will be no. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 by the time you read this. The rest is more of the same, including a forgettable re-working of one of Cher's earlier hits, \\"We All Sleep Alone\\". With her surgically improved body, that seems unlikely. If this is her way of mourning Sonny, let's hope that Gregg Allman doesn't kick the bucket anytime soon. Buy a copy of \\"The Beat Goes On\\" instead. More fun, more meaningful, and Sonny only sings part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"odd","review":"I think that this song is very odd because of the fact of the love that she once shared with the man that is now dead. they were a wonderful couple and life after love really relates to Cher personally. It is a wonderful song. Keep on singing!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to believe in Cher","review":"Once again Cher has rosen to the top. Enlightenment, and time has given Cher the energy to give us exactally what we want. Back in 1994 we embrassed Cher for her coming out on \\"One by One\\", and her greatest \\"Walking in Memphis\\". It was only a matter of time that the rest of the world understood Cher. With her newest CD on top, this is where Cher should had been all along. Now that she is teamed up with Madonna, only greater things can happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"un-believable","review":"cher is back and better than ever, her last \\"it's a mans world\\" is definitely worth checking out too. best tracks here are \\"believe\\", \\"runaway\\",\\"strong enough\\", and \\"takin' back my heart\\" but they all are great! don't be put off - check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, foot pounding musical excitement","review":"Cher is back with a new CD! She has never left the music in her heart behind. Fifty-two years young, Cher is inspiring and not to be ignored. \\"Believe\\" has great dance music and phenomenal vocals. Cher continues to shine and share her talent for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky disco beat...really takes you back","review":"Totally different sound for Cher but every song is upbeat and fun. I found myself dancing around remembering the old disco sound. I love Cher's voice and if you love Cher too then you will love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarely is an entire CD loaded with great songs","review":"Im am 42 and can't stop listening to this album. It is perfect for 15-50! Every song is just great - kinda of a softened disco sound. Rarely do you find an album with what I would call numerous hits. Most of her songs on this album could easily be a number 1 on the charts. You wont regret buying this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"The music sounds like a porno movie soundtrack","review":"Although she has never claimed to have a great voice, Cher always had catchy songs that were sort of tongue in cheek, but she wasn't always aware, which made it even better. This music however sounds like the background music in a porno movie and her voice sounds strained and overproduced. Please buy \\"It's a Man's World\\" if you want the real Cher."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENERGIZING, POWERFUL, MOTIVATING","review":"The energy of Cher's music is awesome. This is \\"taking back your power\\" music that is motivating and inspiring. If your heart has been broken and you don't know where to begin, listen to Cher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on top of the game","review":"She's a key player in the generation that created the \\"cool\\" kids today think is their own. She's done it all along the way and always stayed right on top of what was hot...whether what was \\"hot\\" was new or not. Limited voice? Plastic bodied? Too old? I bought my first Cher song in 1965 and my most current in 2000. She sounds as powerful and fun as she did 35 years ago. Let's see how many of you are still buying Celine and Fastball and any Britney NEW RELEASES in 2035. Take a look at any photos of Sonny and Cher circa 1966 and tell me what cool looks like in 2000. To trash this incredible force as dated is like calling electricity a quaint idea. Like any great artist, she owes us nothing but gives us her all anyway.Thanks for this latest gift Cher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is great!","review":"I love the Believe album. Who cares if it has sort of a disco beat to it? Disco and 70s style are definately coming back into fashion. I think that my favorite song besides the title track is \\" The Power.\\" It's such a lovely mellow song. Cher is the best! I love everything that she does! I can't believe that people don't like this CD! I can't wait until the next Cher album comes out!GO CHER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EH , not a very good album.","review":"Cher has an OK voice, I think, but artists out there with much better voices include Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. I think that her song Believe is OK, but other than that, not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is better!","review":"I agree with some, The Power is better with Amy Grant..BUT, this CD still is really, really good...Believe just has the spirit to make you want to get up and dance! Runaway is one of those self-pity songs...All or Nothing is just a fun song, but also talks about trying to find out if a relationship is worth it or not...I could go on and on, but Cher is really good...I used to always think of Cher with \\"I Got You Babe\\", but Cher has certainly made her mark with Believe. This is a CD you really won't want to miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is hot!","review":"\\"Believe\\" is just great! I never was a fan of Cher but this album surprised me. OK, so some songs sound the same, but who cares? If you like the basic beat, what's the problem? \\"All or Nothing\\" , \\"Believe\\" and \\"Run Away\\" are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I am an absolute die-hard fan of Chers....saw her in concert and it was great!

Cher's the original; she's been around the longest. And it shows. She has managed to create an album that is creative and dancy but totally Cher. There are latin sounds, amazing ballads, and techno beats like the best DJ's in NYC. This is not an album for the faint of heart: this is an album for anyone who appreciates creative and talented musicians making electronic music sound amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher is best than ever!","review":"She has totally make a comeback. She is going to be on top of the US charts with her album \\"believe\\" and her next singles because her songs are fun to listen. It was about time that Americans have a change in music taste. Cher as well as Madonna are making those changes now and there will be more artists to follow. We are going to be dancing on the radio for the next millenium and that sounds like fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC","review":"I have just ordered Cher's cassette BELIEVE. I have tried to find and buy that cassette for about one year now, but was never able to find it. Thank you for having the cassette. We have a radio at work and everytime this song comes on, I turn the radio way UP and move around in my chair. Thank you Cher. You are by far THE BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL OR NOTHING","review":"Cher still knows how to work a song. She wrings these dance tunes for every drop of emotion. I'm fat, 48, and still find myself working my shoulders, feet, and toes to the beat, and recklessly flinging my head up and down like a plastic chihuahua in the back of a car window. I think perhaps one needs to have a few miles under one's rear end to really appreciate it, particularly the disco-flavored cuts. Favorites are of course the title cut, All or Nothing, and Run Away. If you're in your car, lip synch fearlessly to Believe and feel energized!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BELIVE/ STRONG ENOUGHT!","review":"It really make me belive myself, I'm strong enought, and wonder I can be wild while dancing"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS","review":"All right. The only good song on this album is Believe. I think Cher is too old to sing. She should stick to dance songs where she has a lot of music to back her up. Don't buy this. I reccomend it to Celine Dion fans and some Whitney Houston fans though. Buy some of her older work first and if you like that buy this.Take my word for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I can't believe that anyone would buy this CD. There are no decent tracks on. Cher should just go away and stop filling the world with songs that sound like they should be played at your parents 25th high school reunion."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Virginia : Cher fan!!!","review":"Believe is Cher's best work to date! Her title track song is very upbeat and full of energy! The whole CD shows Cher's many talents of being able to sing any type of music. This CD ranks right up there with the Diva queen Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"My roommate bought this cd and though I am not a huge fan of Cher, I must say that this is a great cd, especially if you like dance music. Most of the songs are very catchy and they stay with you. The title track, \\"Believe\\" is incredible and my other favorites are \\"Taxi Taxi\\" and \\"Love Is The Groove\\". I don't care much for the remix of \\"We All Sleep Along\\". It was fine like it was. This music reminds me of Donna Summer at her best and I am sure that Summer wished that she could have hooked up with these producers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous!","review":"I recently discovered Cher through a friend (while painting of all things). This album is amazing. It is literally 10 tracks of gay dance goodness! She has reinvented herself with this peppy new upbeat album. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cher in all her campy, European disco glory!","review":"This cd did come as a suprise to this long time Cher fan. I will say upfront that I am a fan who buys regardless. I absolutly love \\"Believe\\". Hopefully we'll get a remix and not have to wait for the import. Todd Terry does a killer remix of \\"We all sleep alone\\". One thing can be said for Cher (that does not always apply to other female vocalist out there today), when she opens her mouth to sing you KNOW it is Cher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believing again","review":"A few years ago i lost someone very special to me and this song brought the memory of him back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new hope for me.","review":"I love Cher all together, but when she made the song beileive I fell in love with it. It gave me a new hope. really. It did. I coulden\`t get enough of it! Cher is awsome! And so is \\"beileive\\" After I had lost the guy I liked the line \\"Do you beileive in life after love?\\" really gave me hope.

She has been through so much in life that she deserves to be on top. I have followed her career all my life. She was great on the Sonny and Cher Show and her years after.

Camp Blood is the tackiest and non scariest movie ever!! The acting was outrageous, the blood was orange instead of red, and the quality of the film was shocking. ... I've heard the sequel is better but something that continues from this movie is gonna have a hard time entertaining the audience. The movie's story is weak, not much happens until half way through and by that time your almost snoring for England. Basically I could do better with a hand held camera and a bottle of tomato ketchup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp Blood Review #1","review":"Wow! What can I say about this movie? I fell in love with it after just 1 viewing. I saw it in a video store shortly after The Blair Witch Project hit the theaters and rented it. It is independently-made so the camera work isn't spectacular, but the special effects make up for that! The characters and dialogue are believable, and the action is intense and scary. A must-see for all horror movie fans!! Needless to say, I own this and the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie had little gore with a terrible plot. I would cut my eyes out before watching this Home Video again.

It says, cannot use in our region, its region for United Kingdom. My son was so disappointed.We are in United States. How can we get a new one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eberrasing","review":"If you but the anaglyph version of this then you are a fool. The anaglyph version cuts out all the nudity which is what made the original version popular. Besides, the anaglyph version doesn't work at all. The images aren't assembeled well. It's a waste of time unless you can find an original disc. This anaglyph version is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lychee Gummies","review":"The gummies are great. I bought them 4 my mom and she ate them up. The product arrived quickly and in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly SLOW shipping","review":"I have a fondness for these candies but having no vehicle, I purchase them online instead. I ordered them in September (it is now November) ad after contacting the seller and seeing they still had them in stock, my 'estimated delivery' now stated they'd be here...by New Year's. 4 months for candies is ridiculous. Oh, and don't try to cancel your order: it won't happen. Do yourself a favor and buy these from a Chinatown or FYE/video store near you. Much cheaper and you'll have them immediately..Now then, these are HIGH QUALITY candies. A bag of them is generally cheap, somewhat healthy, and very low calories. My friend, who is diabetic, uses these when she feels light headed because they offer natural sugars more than artificial ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really like this Lychee Gummy candy.","review":"I don't really like this Lychee Gummy candy. I ate real Lychee last year in China. But this candy tasted weird. My kids and my husband didn't like the flavor either. My son said there were some white powers on the candy. Better be another one if you are looking for some Asian snacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Flavor","review":"If you're looking for an interesting gummy product then this is definitely one to check out. The flavor is very unique and the texture is comparable to lifesaver gummy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well organized book full of helpful tips and guidelines","review":"I would not say this is the difinitive \\"kitchen garden book.\\" But it does have a plethora of information. While many gardening books give examples of vegetable plots, this is the first one that photographs the site and then numbers all the plants. It makes it very clear which plant is which instead of having to guess. The book is organized in a straightforward manner from the planning to harvest. Their reference section is extremely comprehensive. One of the sections that I found particularly easy to read is the Plant Selection Guide for both herbs and vegetables. All of the plants are lined up with their basic planting requirements: planting depth, sun/partial sun, zones, etc. There is an interesting array of receipts that I will have to try...\\"Pear, Watercresss, and Lentil Salad\\" and \\"Root Vegetable and Apple Stew.\\" Overall, this is a solid vegetable gardening book with loads of advice especially on herbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO PAUL MADDAMS","review":"Bravo and Thank You Paul Maddams for your beautiful messagein your book \\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR.SIDNEY\\".Your words touch our hearts.Tears are welling up in our eyes when we understand what the most precious treasures in life are : Love and Family !Your book should be read by everybody on Earth !Love, dreams, children, grandchildren and family should bethe main purpose of every human being.Yes, I just want to live \\"My Life\\" to the fullest, being in love and surrounded by all my dearest ones with love !\\"Carpe Diem\\" - \\"Seize the day\\"Christine Scheer - Los Angeles"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessary Pep-Talk","review":"This book isn't a set of instructions for writing or publishing; it is a word of encouragement from an old friend who cares enough to tell you the truth - both the good and the bad. Betxy Lerner is honest about the difficulties an author faces, which at times are many. But her book asks the writer to look past all that as she shares some of of the reasons that things are difficult in order to encourage perseverance rather than despair. But it's not just the content that makes this book worth buying. It is also the delivery - it is written in a simple, easy-going manner that will keep you turning pages until the book is done. It is a good read that is well worth a place on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must for editors and writers","review":"This is a wonderfully well-written book. I think it is essetial to both writers and editors. There are wonderful stories about famous authors. I am recommending it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read For Aspiring Writers and Editors","review":"I've read many books on writing, and this is one of the best. Betsy Lerner was an editor for many of the best publishing houses in America (now, she's a literary agent), and her savvy know-how will help many writers who don't know much about the publishing industry.This book is not about the craft of writing. There are many books for that, (perhaps too many) and Lerner is explicit about not wishing the book to be a technical tutorial on writing. Instead, she delves into the psychological issues that encumber almost all writers, and comments with insight on how to surpass those issues.This inspirational book is a novel and refreshing take on the writer's profession, and merits many readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Writer's MUST!","review":"Every writer -- well published or aspiring -- will recognize himself/herself somewhere in this insightful, compassionate book. Betsy Lerner says what writers need to know and what many have long have suspected. Forest for the Trees is a book for today; it replaces and bests every other book of its genre. Thank you, Betsy Lerner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sound and perceptive advice","review":"Although the author of this book rejected my proposal, I have to admit that she knows what she's talking about both when it comes to exploring the psyche of the writer, and the advice she offers to work through your uncertainty and finally begin submitting your manuscript. I also took her advice not to be discouraged by one rejection, and although I am not yet a published novelist, I will keep this book on my shelf and turn to it whenever I start to feel like I am alone in my writing journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best writing books since If You Want to Write","review":"Like Brenda Ueland's If You Want to Write, this is a life-changing sort of book, especially, I think, for the person Lerner calls \\"The Ambivalent Writer.\\" The ambivalent writer, she says, is the one who changes forms and styles from day to day, a screenwriter today, a novelist the next, a web writer the third. The ambivalent writer is also the person who has all the neuroses associated with writing but little or none of the production. You know, she says, what you want to write-- you've gravitated toward one or more forms all your life. Write it.Lerner gives you permission to make art out whatever obsesses you. She shows why it is ridiculous to think you could rewrite Angela's Ashes or Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and why your book will probably bomb if you do. Buy extra copies to give to relatives who tell you what to do to make your next novel a bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a keeper!","review":"So I'm up until after 1AM, locked in from the very first page. Betsy Lerner has been there, done that. The lady knows, since she is one, writers and how they feel as they move through the process of writing, submission, and being published. More, she has the words to say what she means so that any writer not only comprehends but identifies if not themselves, other writers they know. As a published writer, I am doing my best to see that the writers I know hotfoot it right out to buy Lerner's book. She deserves our thanks for this marvelous gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forests Trees and all between","review":"While the title of this book comes from a letter from an editor to a writer, it brought to mind more the song from the 1960's or so. While this book is geared towards writers it provides an excellent insight into the life of an editor, various other positions in a publishing house, and publishing life. I found this to be a great bonus that won't get in the way of the main focus of the book. Her advice incorporates her own experience from starting out as an assitant editor and beyond with other editors of famous writers for an excellent book about writing and publishing. It is well written, easy to read, humorous and extremely usefull. I am far from getting anything publishing, but I found it helpful to get such an indepth look and I think nearly any avid reader who would like to know more about the whole process would gain something while being entertained at the same time. I definitely think it is a future source of reference as I look to publish in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Light","review":"This rather tedious book is long on (the author's) vanity and short on new or helpful advice. Read Anne Lamott, Joan Didion, and Natalie Goldberg instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Funny, Awesome!","review":"Lerner has done an awesome job of revealing really insightful \\"behind-the-scenes\\" stuff! I read the \\"publishing\\" section (there are two parts: Writing & Publishing) with great interest. As a children's writer, I found it so interesting (even though she never really discussed the children's publishing world) and entertaining.I highly recommend this book to beginnng writers, budding writers, and seasoned writers.Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and funny, Definitely a must have.","review":"This book has been cracking me up for days. It's honest and funny, it's sad and true. I can pick myself out in the various types of writers she mentions and that also makes me laugh.To the people who say they're not crazy and feels that Lerner talks down and condescends, I disagree. I feel like she's just being honest. For example, when she says, \\"the only place you'll find more alcoholics than an AA meeting is a writing conference\\", that's hilarious! I had a great chuckle out of it. Honestly, my fellow writers, does it not make sense? I don't drink, but I can see how trying to write might drive somebody to it! Loosen up and laugh. Don't waste your time being offended, take her advice and enjoy the book. It gives me hope that someday I'll see some things of mine published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Oh that all editors had Betsy Lerner's dedication, wisdom, and skills. She's brilliant and I loved reading her book. She hit me right in the face in the first chapter when she described ME: the ambivalent writer. And I so much appreciate her reminder that it doesn't matter who says what about your work -- what matters is what YOU believe, how YOU take it, what YOU do about it. I feel tougher and braver having read this book. I'll keep it for a shot of confidence when I need it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"She knows writers...","review":"Lerner understands writing from every angle. I found the book to be a form of validation that the weird crap that I go through is the same thing that scores of other wannabes go through.Lerner makes some good points and gives some excellent advice. I found the book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physician, Heal Thyself","review":"It is difficult to take some of her advice seriously. I was at an event where Lerner embarrassed a writer in the audience with a nasty joke after she asked about the ethics of changing agents. The event continued to focus on the red-faced person in the audience, who Lerner lambasted for being like a boyfriend or spouse with no loyalty or staying power. Funny, then, that her second book is with a different agent than her first. Hmmm... how solid is the advice? And if her second book is about feeling like boyfriends didn't stick with her...then how muchof what she has to say is really based on her own bitter agenda? Some of the advice in here is good, but alot of it is skewered . It is also a little fuddy duddy (Calling the reader \\"dear reader\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money for Anne Lamott","review":"'The Forest for the Trees' was a waste of time and money; any writer would be better off investing in 'Bird by Bird' by Anne Lamott. She, unlike Ms. Lerner, is funny, helpful and offers far more than obvious advice. My desk was complete with a dictionary, 'The Elements of Style', and 'Bird by Bird'; 'The Forest for the Trees' was an unworth addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and false adverising","review":"This horseshoe set is cheap, the shoes are not steel, as advertised, but cast iron, and they break quite easily.

Broke the first time used!","review":"I should have know that nothing this cheap would be made well.Brought this set to a cabin for a weekend with friends, and the first game we played with them they broke. We were throwing them in a pit filled with dirt and sand and lined with soft wood. When they broke, we could see what they are really made of.

It also blows my mind that these 3 guys used to be in a glam band in the early 90's called southgang. They are so much better now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"To be sure, I originally expected alot out of this CD due to their first single, \\"Freak of the Week\\". However, this is another one of those albums that I went out to buy because of that catchy tune I heard on the radio and got suckered into a $15.00 investment that was put away after the first week of listening to <come on, we all do it now and then>... There are a few songs that are worth listening to, and most of the album's music is good, but the corny lyrics make most of it intolerable. At best this is an album that delves into mediocrity and the band will most likely fall into the one-hit abyss column ... If you wanna hear something good within this musical realm, listen to any David Bowie album; afterall he's the ones they copied ... Then again, thats just my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!!","review":"I Heard Freak of the wekk on the Radio so I got this CD, and if any one out there likes freek of the week you'll love this CD 'cause freek of the week is only start to all the great songs on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous 3 are Rockin'!!!!!","review":"This is CD is one of the best that I have ever bought. I saw a Marvelous 3 show a while back and was immediately hooked on the group. Their catchy tunes and sharp, clever lyrics are so addictive they should be considered illegal. The more often I listen, the more I like. This CD is a must-have for any serious rock fan.

The rest of the album is thoroughly boring and a huge dissapointment. This band is simply a group of cool looking guys who were thrown together by a record producer to make money.

This music might sound neat-o or have a nice little beat to pre-teen idolizers, but to the serious music fan, this is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost as good as third eye blind!","review":"The marveluos 3 are great. Lot's of people compare them to third eye blind (who are awesome!) I don't see why everyone is giving them such a bad rap.

It gets really boring if all that people sing about is how aweful their lives are and that crap, like most of the other alternative/rock bands out there.
