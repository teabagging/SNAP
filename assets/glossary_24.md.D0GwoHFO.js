The layout is of good quality and can take a bit of a beating. The instruction manual is very informative with a bunch of different game variations. My only complaint is the card deck that comes with the game is not really a good deck(kinda flimsy), but that's minor. The chips that come inside are your standard 5g plastic which is fine, but there is not enough of them. You can purchase a box of 100 at the local drug store for a few bucks. Overall this game is a good time for a casino night at the house and we have a good time playing it.

If you have not purchased the first book, then only buy the second because you really don't need both.The details, quality and extensive info contained on magical and meaningful names is marvelous! I recomend this not only to pagans but to anyone who needs names. You will not find names like these on those \\"baby name\\" sites.

My only complaint with it she fixed in this release there was no decent index. This index is much more complete and easier to use.If I had to find a problem with this book, it would have to be she focused to much on movie character names in this book opposed to digging deeper and finding out more about truely unique names that she already had. Yes she has a wonderful list of everything, but now I would like to see her expand on these names.I even chose the name of my company from her book. My company's name is Omicle.

All four have stayed on despite hitting many of Colorado's big potholes. When installing, make sure they're snapped in all the way. One cap on the rear wheel looked like it was properly installed, but snapped in further on one side when I gave it yet another push.

It is a really nice watch in theory, but a bit lacking in execution. It has a lot of features so if you can live with the problems, then it should be a great watch. The main problem appears to be that the watch face is made out of plastic (not mineral crystal), despite what Amazon says. I have verified this with Casio customer service. This plastic material is not recessed (which would protect it), but instead it is actually raised above the watch allowing it to be easily scratched.Further problems are 1) the watch face is a bit low in contrast, 2) the numerals on the watch face are a bit small, 3) the keys are hard to press and 4) like all Casio Databank watches, it is not even splash rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is progress?","review":"There used to be a simple Casio databank watch that let you keep phone numbers,tell the time, set alarms and time a footrace.Casio, however, seems to have \\"advanced\\" the product so much that I have found it unusable.

Right now, it is two time zones off and beeps when I don' want it to.Part of the problem is a \\"manual,\\" which like all of them in the electronics area, is too small to read and so thick it won't stay open on your lap or table.

I was buying a new watch or band on average everyyear before I got this metal band, and the metal one lasted seven years!Now I find that the only watches that have metal bands don't do what I need anymore, and they cost significantly more than what I paid for the one I have.

This one has a metal case with rounded edges and promises a great deal, but the interface is all but unusable. Entering phone numbers is arduous and then they display in a totally unhelpful format.

The baby fish don't fit in the big fish's mouth, so I don't know why it's called a fill and spill. The little fish are cute and are finger puppets which is kind of neat if you have small children, but that's about all the positives I can say about this toy. The big fish fell apart the same day we got it, and it was only played with for 5 minutes. My son has no interest in any part of this toy, so I gave the little fish to my dogs...they like them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Promising but Isn't","review":"I thought my daughter would love this toy when she got it for Christmas. Instead it has gotten tossed aside. Even when it was new to her, she paid little attention to it. The fish make sounds which is nice and I thought she would like that because she is very auditory. However, she has taken little notice of it. The squeaker is impossible for small hands to manipulate. Although this toy is colorful, it has gone unnoticed by my little girl even when she was an infant (and even when the toy was carefully demonstrated and brought to her attention)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great toy","review":"This toy is a waste. The big fish opening and shutting is just looking for little fingers to get pinched.

She does enjoy chewing on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is Falstaff","review":"I have read the other review of this work and I take great exception. This is the recording by which others should be judged. Solti captures the raucousness of Falstaff, using and emphasizing the horns like great comedic guffaws. Geraint Evans oozes unctiousness and Freni sweetly takes on the only aria in the whole opera. When you digest this version of Falstaff everything else is so lady-like and almost effeminate. Falstaff is a drunk, he smells and he is dishonest. Strings cannot bring home this earthy opera the way Solti and the horns do and Solti keeps the opera moving in a wild, continuous manner--like a ball well dented rolling downhill and he finesses the fugue at the end. This opera, in my opinion Verdi's masterpiece, is in continous motion the way Gianni Schicci is. It is not a stop, stand and sing opera like Don Carlos and others make that mistake--not Solti."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little 'consulting bibble'","review":"Must be the most useful, supportive book I had for the past 3 years since doctors tried to labeled my child as ADHD!

In fact, my only qualification for having read this book may be that I cried when I read Old Yeller and that was a LONG time ago.But I loved this book. Most of the stories are only a few pages long, so if one doesn't click, you can be on a brand new story in no time. My favorite stories were Lynda Barry's graphic short, Stephen Kuusisto's description of meeting his new guide dog and how they come to trust one another, and Lee Forgotson's thoughts on how dogs helped her come to terms with the aftermath of September 11.Most of the stories were funny or touching, but there were several eulogies to old friends, as well. The drawings by Mark Ulriksen are eye-catching, a little off-kilter. Two paws up for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delight for all dog lovers","review":"My husband and I adopted our first dog less than a year ago and our dog-lover friends gave us a subscription to The Bark as a \\"baby-gift.\\" We've enjoyed reading every issue of The Bark and got this book after seeing the advertisement for it in the magazine--what a treasure! The writing styles are diverse and each story lends its own unique flair to a delightful compilation. My husband and I rarely read the same books as our tastes differ quite a bit, but we have had difficulty taking turns with this! Unfortunately, I don't think the book has gotten a lot of publicity outside its ads in The Bark, so I want to spread the word about what a good read it is and what a great gift it makes for any and all dog-lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Bark magazine, but this book is BAD BAD BAD","review":"Bark magazine is a good magazine, mixing informative articles and touching stories. I had high hopes for this Bark book, given its excellent \\"pedigree\\". Unfortunately, this book is an EXTREME disappoint. This book has just 2 or 3 good stories.

Had she known the sadness between the covers I'm sure she would have chosen another book. Why a dog lover would want to read countless stories about how human carelessness caused their dogs to be hurt or even killed is beyond me. Have people ever considered keeping their dogs on leashes?

Las chicas se ponen a trabajar, Chon se echa novio, su reputación se va a la porra gracias a los comentarios de una envidiosa conocida, el novio la deja, Cristina se marcha a otro país, la tía se muere, Chon alquila un piso a la calumniadora (fíjate, ahora tan amigas), y termina casándose con un admirador de su madre.

It is true, and must be admitted by those who look at history objrctively, that the Christian religion has had an enormous impact on the course of events in the United States . . . much more so than secular historians would have us believe. My favorite part was the minute account of the Second Great Awakening - particuarly the revival meetings in Kentucky. But these books, in and of themselves, are not going to give an individual a balenced view of U.S. history. It is just too biased. The authors have attempted to put a religous construction on all key events, and on all key men behind those events. Too much gloss. But you won't regret reading it. It's good reading, and I learned a lot from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our American Heritage","review":"Just as they did in \\"The Light And The Glory\\" the authors summarize so many interesting events during this period in our nation. We can be proud to be citizens of the United States and pray God will continue to intervene in our affairs so His glory will continue to shine \\"from sea to shining sea\\". Also, it helped me see how the same temptations as today (mainly a large, controlling federal government) were present back then and our nation overcame them by God calling forth some unlikely men and women. Hopefully if they did it then, we can find a way to overcome today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lightweight","review":"This is a very light bracelet and is not suitable for the true jewelry collector.

It comes exclusively with a red R2D2 action figure which is a plus also since it's going to be a highly collectible item in the Episode One series.

He actually seems to have grown as a character, although only to the extent he is 2.1 dimensional rather than two dimensional. The combat seems a bit more sophisticated, actually employing combined arms for a change. The best possible book in the series, the \\"General\\", is the one that will not be written. Here we could have seen the implications of a military officer as head of state, grappling with tough decisions that effect soldiers and civilians alike and perhaps offered a broader glimpse of politics and foreign relations in Shelley's series universe.

Great canvas bag that feels sturdy enough to take a lot of abuse. It's about 2/3 the size of an A3 bag and to me feels slightly more durable with thicker fabric so I am pleased with it. A3 bags have a waterproof coating on the inside but this does not so I will spray it with some scotch guard just in case it is left sitting outside on a pallet. FYI... It has small D rings at the ends of the zipper that look like they are for a shoulder strap but no strap included. I don't plan on using a shoulder strap as I like using the 2 handles as shoulder straps and wearing it like a backpack to haul it long distances if I have it loaded up with heavy gear. The handles on this bag seem well suited to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a BIG Bag - great for trips","review":"My wife always packs for vacations as if we were never going to return home, making getting everything in the car a challenge.

Conventional wisdom may have it that it takes Springsteen to sing a Springsteen song. Actually, I believe what it takes is someone with the authenticity of Springsteen, admittedly a rare find in the entertainment or any other industry today. Just because Springsteen is a great songwriter, his lyrics may be singable in a meaningful way only by those who share the genuineness of The Boss, or at least, by those who can enter into the spirit of a given set of lyrics authentically. This album is a pleasure to the ear and does not disappoint. If you appreciate these characteristics of Springsteen's music, I think you'll also enjoy these musical performances for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"i could have made this myself at kinkos","review":"I own an Olympus c-5050zoom, and it is an amazing camera.

On the other hand, there are so many things to recall as an owner,that it is handy to have the Curtin slim volume at hand for reference. It covers all the must-have information. The more obscure stuff is with the Olympus CD in a stuffier verbage. The Curtin CD combo adds only color pictures,but it is probably worth getting and saving to your hard drive.

Listening to these great songs, like Suite Judy Blue Eyes, Helplessly Hoping, and So Now Begins the Task, with his wonderfull soulfull voice and his just incredible guitar playing is such a treat. Like Joni, with her \\"Blue\\" album, these songs are among Stephen's finest, and this style I believe suits his talent the best.

Helplessy Hoping and many others. I have always favored the acoustic side of Stephen Stills.This Cd is actually a demo he recorded while in the process of writing many future hits for CSN and himself. The songs in many cases are very raw and unfinished. He also displays the open tunings that he used constantly with CS&N; and himself.I love it when they go into the vaults and find a gem like this.

The CD is good but why Madonna decided to include two boring interludes, the Sorry Remix and the ULTRA boring Confessions of the dancer's lives is beyond comprehension.

This latest concert however exceeds anything she has done before. This concert is refined, provocative, political, touching and visually stunning. Madonna has always been on the pulse and this is no exception. No one does shows like Madonna. From her dancing, dancers, to costumes, lighting, visuals and awareness of Aids, famine and political inclination, Madonna is always with the current, hip and classy. She also looks amazing.

He plays a six string guitar with the third string doubled an octave higher, which gives a special ring all his own, somewhat like Compay Segundo's guitar sound. And Eliades' singing is absolutely tremendous. I saw him perform when he toured the States. His stage presence was surprisingly like Jerry Garcia's, in that he never looked at his guitar, rather at the audience the whole time, singing magnificently and ripping his trademark rides on every song. Every player in his band was superb and they rocked the house here in Austin, TX. I heartily recommend any of his CDs, particularly Son de Santiago, this one, Chanchaneando (a couple of lovely duets with Compay Segundo) and the best of them all, Sublime Ilusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cure for insomnia","review":"Buddenbrooks is a pitiful example of German literature.

It became clear to me that to enjoy this book, one really has to devote 100% attention to it for long periods of time rather than reading bits here and there (as I normally do).Besides, this novel contained one of my favorite lines in all of literature: \\"Go to the devil, you filthy, sprat-eating slut!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"deadly","review":"In the same league with Gabriel Garcia Marquez' \\"100 Years of Solitude,\\" and Leo Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace.\\" It's the mighty Buddenbrooks (noble German businessmen) versus the Industrial Revolution, and I won't let on who claims the victory.

They have not left black marks on my socks like many other oil-tanned boots that I own. My only negative critique about them is that the laces are a bit on the short side. Not a big deal as I was planning on replacing them with black colored laces anyhow. Not crazy about the brown and black mixed sole?

Overall a nice boot at a nice price."},{"rating":"2","title":"boots i have always wanted.","review":"i have been wanting these boots for the past three years now and i have finly got them, they are everthing i wanted. i have been climbing trees and my spikes are rubbing on my legs for now on they can rub on my boots and save my legs. thanks to company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPER suspense thriller!","review":"I never have taken the time to write a review, but I felt I HAD to after reading The Kokopelli Theory. What a fascinating premise! The book spins a wonderful suspense involving the origins of the deadly Hepatitus C virus. It was all very convincing, though I know it is fiction. There were excellent twists that made this one of the best reads I've had in ages. This book kept me reading and reading until I finished--In a single sitting! A friend recommended it to me, knowing I loved this genre, and I've been spreading the word ever since. Hard to believe this is Kevin Correa's first novel. He reads like a very seasoned author. I've been checking the listings, hoping for a second book! Thank you Mr. Correa for such a fantastic ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and very accurate on his research","review":"This is an excellent book, a real page turner... yet the author did his research regarding the Hepatitis C Virus.

I sought this book as potential source material for one I'm writing about documented cases of police and prosecutorial misconduct.Unfortunately, this book's content commits the worst crimes attributed to its targets: broadbrush accusations and biased conclusions without evidence, half-truths, mis-statements of facts and outright lies.In short, these authors have committed a frame-up almost as egregious as instances where authorities have actually railroaded an innocent citizen into prison.The sad fact is, with a little hard work and honest research, these academic fellows could have written a book that used facts to make it credible.Since they didn't, I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Roberts, the Liar","review":"It's difficult to take anything Mr. Roberst writes seriously as he is on all sides of almost every issure depending on his audience. He likes to be \\"confrontational\\" which, for him, amounts to attacking politicians and groups from the left for doing one thing and those on the right for doing what he told the left they should do. I guess he believes that makes him \\"balanced\\" but it's a lie, he's simply someone who likes to stir the pot regardless whether he actually believes or doesn't believe in the postion he's taking. And that's the trouble, he really doesn't have any beliefs.Good reading if you like sociopathic writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance","review":"The Civil War ended over 150 years ago.

His technique is good (some problems with pianos), his agility commendable.People looking for an adequate rendering of old arias will find this compilation lacking instead: he chooses (as declared in the booklet) to ignore philological and stylistical issues, singing them beautifully but also romantically, as late Donizetti or early Verdi. Problem is that this, to educated ears, sounds incredibly wrong, nearly inaudible.A pity: with more attention (much more attention) to style this could have been a useful compilation for singing students too. Such as it is, it is only good for Mr Vargas' fans if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"Vargas shows no understanding of the music he is singing.Cecilia does.Cecilia Bartoli - If You Love Me (Se tu m'ami ), 18th-Century Italian Songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"He missed the point","review":"I am sorry I bought this album. I did not listen to the sound bytes first...my bad! Vargas croons his way through music that has been orchestated out of all recognition. It sounds syrupy and sentimental, not intensely emotional. The Carissimi is a joke! The Scarlatti is painful to hear. There are too many fine performances of 17th & 18th century music out there for this to pass muster. For example, if you want to hear Bononcini as he should be sung, listen to Martin Oro or Gerard Lesne.

I had difficulty finding one that still allowed decent movement of the thumb, and its tip. My issue is in the 2nd joint from the thumb's tip, what most might call the thumb's knuckle, or carpometacarpal. I have used it for about a year and the splint is still in good condition. I have not worn it during vigorous activity. Besides supporting the thumb, it provides warmth, which provides some pain relief, equivalent to me to 400 mg of ibuprofen. Sizing is a bit difficult without actually trying it on, and even with the best size for me, I have some trouble getting a good wrap around the thumb as it seems to be made for a fairly large diameter thumb. It works well despite the fit as it fits well enough. I plan to buy another when this one is worn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freekey's CD Sucks","review":"This cd is wack.

The recipes I have made are delicious and well balanced. The life-food kitchen part of the book tells about the tools and essential ingredients you will need (juicer, blender, miso, unpasteurized soy sauce, unrefined oils, etc.)The information presented is remarkably informative but not organized in an intuitive manner. Nevertheless this book got me drinking alkalized water and doing a number of other offbeat things which have generally benefitted my health. The book makes many claims about what makes certain foods and practices (such as long, austere cleanses) beneficial yet has no bibliography, so all the information must be assumed to have come from the observations of the authors.

Once you listen to the first track, a lively rendition of \\"My Ship,\\" you know you're onto something special: a beautiful, rich flute sound, classical precision that doesn't sacrifice emotion and style, and no gimmicks (like electronics or humming into the instrument). A couple more tracks of blues, ballads, and swing, and you'll know that a new star of jazz flute has emerged.A nice assortment of material shows off Holly's talent and that of her exceptional rhythm section. There are blues tunes (\\"Groove Merchant\\" and \\"Some Other Blues\\"), seduction songs (\\"If You Could See Me Now,\\" \\"But Beautiful,\\" and \\"Ceora\\"), a jazz waltz (\\"Thoughts of You\\"), and a couple that move right along (the aforementioned \\"My Ship\\" and \\"Winter Sleeves\\"). The 10 tracks total about 58 minutes of great music.

The sound quality is very good but only in some songs in others it sounds muddy. The bass is incredible it like vibrates i ussually keep the volume a little lower than as high my ipod can go because the sound isn't so great when its loud but again in certain songs the volume makes no difference.

It also does not leak any sound out when you have them on so you won't bother people around you. However the most important thing is obviously the sound and it didn't live up to my expectations.

My #1 brand from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Comfy!!!","review":"These here are some bad boy headphones! The bass will rattle your little pea sized brain!

Kind of a let down","review":"I have an older pair of on-ear Skullcandy's that have awesome sound and the bass really gives you a great crisp bump. These headphones however are not as good. Essentially everything but the bass is good on these. It doesn't have a natural sound to it at all, it sounds more like a hit from a kick drum when the drum has a hole in it. I would suggest spending your money somewhere else if your looking for in-expensive over-ear head phones. The fit and finish is great but let's be honest, that's not what matters with headphones. Very disappointing coming from Skullcandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Headphones","review":"The only thing I wish they had is a volume dial, just like the smokin' buds. The only downside to them is that I forgot to turn off the bass boost when I first got them and wasted a AA battery... Somehow, those two \\"downsides\\" don't seem negative enough for me to decrease this review by even half of a star haha... They are really good headphones, they produce VERY high quality sound, and I won't be using any other brand as long as these last, which is about two years so far without problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"good bass but not much else","review":"I bought these headphones to use them at work. I tried them before and was quite impressed, but could not use my own player and music samples then.After normal use it was clear that they are all about bass reproduction. The bass was impresive, but higher frequencies were muffled. The sound insulation was poor. The folding design make them fit awkwardly and uncomfortably.I returned them and tried other models instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I have bought 3 of these, 2 from other sites and this one from amazon. they all seem to arrive with blown drivers or crackly speakers.

Good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"HESH are much better","review":"I got these cuz they were supposed to have epic bass turns out its just loud muffled high frequency bass that makes your ears hurt. You have turn the bass down if you wanna listen to music for long periods of time, which defeats the purpose. They are made of the cheapest quality plastic! You'd think there something you'd buy at a gas station! and the cord is made of cheep vinyl instead of the rubber that most headphone cables are made with. Skullcandy inkd have much deeper bass and more balanced sound that does not make your ears hurt after long periods of listening. Hesh are much better quality plastic and have a braided cable and sound that you can turn up without destroying you ears. I recommend inkd for bass and Hesh for over ear listening if thats your thing. Anyone who thinks these have good bass have never heard good bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"well, for 40 some dollars these headphones kept me some what happy. They do have decent bass. But bass that cuts out all the other parts of the music, and doesn't have good quality on any of the other segments of the music. Then after a month of listening on them, normally at around 50 to 75% volume on my ipod, the bass part of the headphone is blown. and now it is a 40 dollar pair of headphones that are worse than a 5 dollar pair of ear buds. so pretty much, i shouldn't have cheaped out and bought skullcandy when all of my buddies said they sucked. i guess i learned my lessson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Grandma's typical Headphones","review":"I bought these in hopes of getting a great superb sound with great base..... ***Do not buy these*** if you like listening to different Genre's of music.

Sound doesn't matter.. literally","review":"Listening to this set made me realize that the developers focused more on design (which is decent) rather than the sound.The headphones fit nicely but this thing has the worst sound quality I've ever heard from a pair under $40.00.buy the least expensive Sennheisers if you are looking for absolute sound and get ready to be blown away. These headphones.. I do not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad headphones, but the bass is a gimmick","review":"I got these headphones relatively cheap. They're fairly compact, lightweight, and comfortable. The sound is okay, but the bass is way overhyped. The subwoofer amp takes a single double-a battery, and has a wheel to adjust the bass levels. If it's not turned on, the bass is nearly absent. If it is turned on, it's muddy and thumping. It literally tickles to wear because the headphones are vibrating so much. My daughter loves to wear them and have me pump the bass to full because of the tickle effect. I have a pair of ATH-M50s that I bought for $110, and they richness of the sound is a million times better.tl; dr: if you're buying for comfort and mobility, these aren't bad for the price. If you're buying for sound, especially for bass, get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FOR YOUR MONEY!!!!!","review":"For the money you pay you are getting the best value.

I've been using over the ear headphones for a while now and these are the best. At $50 you cannot beat the sound quality, design, and comfort of these. The subwoofers are very powerful and can shake like crazy, but not too much where its uncomfortable. I use these with my Zune HD and even with a case the plug fits fine. Ive seen video reviews and I realized they fixed the huge problem where you cannot use it with an Ipod case. My only problem is that my head is kind of big and the plastic by my ears that adjusts the size bends a bit to fit. I dont know how long that will last before snapping but hopefully that wont ever happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBBBUMBUBWBUW WUB WUB WUB","review":"Love these headphones for all of my tectonic and electro music the bass is crazy loud and the vibration adds to that effect.

When I got them I was so excited but when I listened to music with them for the first time I literally was jumping around, (crazy I know). Some people may not like them and some may love them like I do, it depends on the person but these are awesome and the bass is absolutely amazing, phenomenal! I have never heard such bass, I know that it gets help from the sub-woofer which is attached and it is great. In addition to everything, the music does not leak! I hate when I'm listening to music and others around me are disturbed and telling me to turn down my music but with these you do not have to worry about it. Long story short, they are great, especially for the money. I originally wanted beats by dr. dre but was not willing to spend all of that money on headphones so I got these and I am beyond satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressive at all","review":"Sound okay, until you turn on the \\"subwoofer\\".

The bass is good, but everything else just sounds flat. Many other reviews have stressed this, but I figured maybe they were just being picky. They were not. If you want to listen to anything other than bass heavy music, don't buy these. Also mine didn't come with the airplane adapter, unless they no longer ship with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Phones","review":"I've had these for over a year now and I really like 'em. Sound quality is good, not stellar but quite good. Its a \\"present\\" sound, not like with some ear buds where it feels like the music is forced into your ears, these fill the area of your head with sound making it feel natural not forced. They're really good for watching movies too. If you want bass, these will do it for ya', careful though, too much and they will blow. (a friend of mine blew his out) The cord wrapped wires are a nice touch, though the preamp is really clunky and inconvenient. A binder clip works well to take up the excess cord between the preamp and the 3.5mm plug. They adjust to fit well but are a bit tight at first. The ear cushions fit around the ears well and block out most noise. I rarely collapse them because the hinge and lock on top feel kinda cheap but like with all things, don't abuse 'em and they work and will serve you well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh","review":"They sounded great!! the subwooferes were awesome and the sound quality was good, but they felt as if they would fall apart at any moment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad construction quality","review":"ProsI bought this item last year, it has really good sound quality and the amplifier is great. Also the design looks cool.ConsHowever, the construction quality is poor and it broke, after a month, from the side while I was putting it on. Took it back but I really like the design and sound quality, so I thought may be the product I had was defective so I gave it another chance, I got the same kind again brand new. This one also broke and from both sides. It is pretty bad engineering or very low quality plastic or may be both. But I still paid good money for this and don't expect it to break so easily. I hope the manufacturer looks into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"I was greatly disappointed with these stupid headphones. If you wanna throw away 70 bucks, then go ahead. Take off the battery, what do you get? 2 dollar headphones, I swear. I regret buying them. The bass is over exaggerated and doesn't sync in with the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painting problem","review":"So, I bought an authentic Skullcandy snoop signature headphone. Great, cuz i'm a big fan of snoop. The sound quality is good nough for the price. But here comes the problem. After 2 months, the painting on the headphone start to lose. And the cheap plastic material that made this headphone started to show up, which is really really really ugly. After another month, the connection in the middle of the headphone is broken. So, I cannot wear them. I tried to use glue, but it wouldn't last long. So, If you really looking to get a headphone that can stay with you for years, don't go with this pair. Instead, get the beats pro. or mixr. If you don't mind the looking, get those professional sennheiser, AKG, Beyer dynamics, they definitely make better headphones. Though beats sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oportunity of improvement","review":"I live in Costa Rica, i was buy this product 1 week ago, and the subwoofer dead, the sound without the amplifier is terrible, the cable have a circuit, you move it and the sound dissapear.$50 to the garbage.I'll to reparing, because the process for devolution and warranty from costa rica is to long."},{"rating":"1","title":"These things suck","review":"I was super excited when the head phones got here, but they fold in half so it was constantly yanking out pieces of my hair , also when i leaned to the right at all the headphones sound went out. The bass amplifier hardly did anything, and the music was way quiet, i have earphones that are louder than those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed","review":"I'm very disappointed with this headset, I expected much more, because I bought another skullcandy brand products earlier and were of very good quality. The material of what it's made seems to be very cheap and fragile. The sound it's not great at all, is very opaque. the bass is nothing but vibration and the highs are missing, just mediocres mids.Recommend not to buy these headphones, go for the Titan Steel model of the same brand, there are way better and cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. but sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations.The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say bout these. So i returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. after trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRULY disappointed.","review":"I can't lie, I was truly disappointed. These headphones have really nice bass, but it seems that the actual speakers aren't very high-quality. They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned, but after two weeks of regular usage with high bass, the subwoofers on both sides started rattling. There wasn't anything else I could do but return them, and I still haven't received my voucher. The bass is incredible, the actual speakers (with bass turned off) doesn't have very high quality, they are very comfortable, but the durability is very low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skullcandy - not just a cool name","review":"Overall a good product.

Honestly worth the money and I only bought mine for 35 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"These headphones are spectacular! They work wonderfully. They are very comfortable. Bonus: They look great! They even come with a little carrying pouch. :) The sound quality is impeccable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The headphones sounded pretty good while they worked. The soud quality was not super awesome but having the subwoofers was pretty nice. They fit very well and were very comfortable which was also very nice. The problem I found is that, like other people, my speakers started to die after very little use. At this point only one speaker is working correctly and neither subwoofer functions anymore. I expected better given skullcandy's reputation but I was let down. If you buy these and they last, then more power to you, they aren't bad sounding but they seem to have a tendency to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm, awesome","review":"This product is spectacular. I am wowed by the quality of the sound and the comfort of the headphones, and will continue to be for some time.

Not that that's really a knock to skullcandy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally- great sound and great fit!","review":"All I can say is: these are amazing!! They are the first headphones I've tried that actually fit without some kind of modification or struggle. Then, I plugged them in! WOW! You will never use all of the bass that you have at your fingertip! The other reviews are correct that they are very good at isolating noise both from outside and from the headphones to the outside. I had them absolutely cranked up and they could hardly be heard from the outside. The sound quality is excellent in the high and mid ranges and UNBEATABLE in the low range. When I opened them up, I tried a variety of music types and they all sounded outstanding. I don't know why anyone would buy anything else, at any price if they tried these first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound, warm like ear muffs, and poorly designed.","review":"Alright, the sound is great for the price. Here are the negatives: first, the pod for the AA battery is awkward. When I plug it into my computer, it weighs the cord down so much that it's uncomfortable to wear. Plus, the weight of if has already bent the male part of the headphones. Second, the headphones are so warm. If I were sitting at a bus stop in January in Chicago, these would be great. Last, the construction of the headphones is really shotty. I read this in previous postings but was dubious about other reviewers. Trust me, I take care of my things and after two short months, my headphones broke down the center. My advice, if you are purchasing them because they are cheap and want good sound, buy them... just don't ever fold them up.Update: Shortly after writing this review, one speaker broke. I continued using it for two more months. Now, the other speaker is dead. What a waste of money this things were. I changed my rating two a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim M","review":"The worst headphones I ever have purchsed.

I took a chance based on reviews that seemed to vary a great deal. I have to say after now owning them that I wish I would not have purchased them without listening first. I wanted to plug into my Kindle and relax with some ambiance but found that these headphones are definitely missing a pitch range. In case you missed that last line THESE HEADPHONES ARE DEFINITELY MISSING A PITCH RANGE. If you need to have audio frequencies well represented these are not the headphones for you.

Buyer beware, listen before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphones while they last...","review":"I don't normally review products, but I have had these headphones for less than 6 months.

They sound great and pretty much cancel out outside sounds. If you're into hip hop or any other type of bass heavy music, these kick ass. Haven't tried them for movies yet, but i expect good things. They're comfortable, they're foldable and they look pretty good too. Only problem is that it's hard to tell how easy they can break based on the material they're made of. So far so good. That and the subwoofer switch eats through batteries pretty quick. You might be able to avoid that if you lower the bass. But then heavy bass is the point. It never ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are AWESOME.","review":"I listen to Speed Metal, Heavy Metal, and Dark Metal. The Sub-woofer on this headphone is awesome and very responsive.

I love over the ear headphones and I was hoping this would satisfy my needs. I read other reviews, already knowing the pro and cons of these headphones. What I wasn't expecting is the mono sound coming from the headphone without the bass turned on. It was a little disappointing, but common sense told me to just leave the subwoofers on. As far as watching movies with them, they are great. Appropriate for any movie you can imagine. I even used them to edit video and audio for school. What really disappoints me is they only lasted 25 days of use. The left subwoofer went out and I was left with crackling and poor sound. The sounds of the plastic as I moved around would overtake anything I was listening to at any point of having them on. Poor quality at a low price.

Returning both and probably sticking with earbuds for now.The sound quality was awesome, although they were not great at blocking out jerks on the train. Subwoofer is a bit bulky and heavy, the weight might contribute to cord wear and tear. The speakers are soft and very comfortable (except they kept sliding off my hair), but not very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Overall Sound Quality","review":"The overall sound quality is horrible in these headphones. There are basically two options when using these to listen to music: 1)Listen with no bass at all (sounds terrible), 2)Have so much bass that it overpowers everything else and vibrates like a cellphone on your ears (sounds terrible).There is a bass adjuster that in theory would be able to find a setting that you like, but it's more like letting you find a setting you hate the least. What the other reviews have said about the rock bass frequency range being non-existent is also true. I will not be using these headphones. I will just give it to someone I don't like as a twisted joke.The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the price.

I had read too many mixed reviews. Well I am happy to report that these headphones are pretty awesome. I am in no ways crazy over sound quality but these headphones make music sound pretty smooth. Whenever I put on a pair of headphones I can actually hear a difference. I love the bass feature and after the headphones have been broken into, they are very comfortable. I only wish the headphones would have come with directions on how to properly fold the headphones, but after a few tries it gets easier. I would recommend these headphones if you want great sound but don't have the money to pay for really expensive headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass noise amplified","review":"Turn on the bass and it's amplified bass noise, no mid-range. Turn off and it cuts out all of the bass and only has treble. No crisp clear sound. My earbuds work far better than this and are a lot cheaper. I was expecting amplified bass drum sound with a full mid-range, but it was hard to hear singing with the amplified bass noise. Kinda like listening to your neighbors stereo in your house where you only hear the bass but the music is muffled. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Avoid buying these headphones, there great if you like bass and only bass. Music quality is poor after that.

Bass should not be powered by batteries, the subwoofer is just a fake label.You really get loud vibrations picked up by drivers, hence why you need batteries. You get a ringing sensation, it will itch the first time.I think skullcandy should sell vibrators not headphones.Overall they are relaxing for a while but you realize the sound quality does not keep up with the bass.I reccomend these 70 dollars be spent elsewhere, try them out for yourself before you buy them I know tons of kids who love them, thus why I sold them.Worth 20 dollars If you ever wanna buy these, either way there's no reason, Sony has xb500's if you want genuine bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"the subwoofer sounds like falsely added bassthe cord has a massive on/off switch on it (its like the size of a small cell phone!) that holds a AA battery in it.I have to jiggle the cord in the headphone jack to have the volume come out evenly to both sides of the headphones (and yes, ive used separate headphones in the jack and it works fine, so the issue is def the headphones, not the jack)After i deal with all that, the sound is \\"ok\\" at best.Cheap for a reason!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for play not for pros","review":"As a working DJ i play 3 or 4 nights a week.

First, the \\"bass amplifier\\", or \\"vibrator\\" as they call it, more or less just makes the headphones vibrate. It amplifies the bass for only about the first 20%, but after that, distorts the audio so much that it is unlistenable. Also, the mechanism that notifies you whether or not the headphones are on is lacking, and so it chews through batteries like it is it's job.Still, amazing sound, and I fully recommend these headphones. Just be careful to turn off the headphones when done."},{"rating":"1","title":"one problem","review":"these were a great portable pair of headphones for a while, then all of a sudden the right ear stopped giving sound. i could here the bass in the ear, but no mids or highs. i can only suspect that it was because of the wiring in the bass amplifier battery compartment. they lasted me a good 7 months or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paid more but was worth it!","review":"I bought these at Circuit City for a considerably higher price but I most say it was definetly worth the price.

Some people say that you can't hear the bass line but all you have to do is adjust the amp level and you have your bass. I would have paid alot more for these if I knew how great they sounded! I have had these for about a year and have yet to have a problem except having to replace the battery every other week for the bass amplifier. Excellent set of headphones for the price, you can't go wrong with these!Edit: The reason I have to replace the battery so often is because I wear these whenever I go out of the house so they get alot of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"These headphones are great. The sound quality is decent and they are really comfortable. My single complaint is that the subs don't get deep enough. The really low, heavy beats are hard for these to match.

The bass module was an ok thing but I did not care for it.Heavy on the cord and it did nothing for the volume it just thumps and vibrates your ears more.Instead of sending them back for replacement I bought the Hesh model w/no gimmicks on them.

Don't use the subwoofer, but unlike others I have no problem with the sound on mine ... kinda distorted at first, but whether they broke in well or I just got used to it, they sound great now. But the plastic along the adjustable headband started chipping away and now one of the earpieces slips off and stabs my left ear every couple of days. Awesome.I realize that at $36 these are not intended to be top of the line, but if I have to tape this thing together after just six months of moderate use, that's a pretty crappy design.

Personally, I like to hear clarity in the low end of my music while still getting a strong bass feel. What these headphones do is ridiculous! Every time there is any low frequency in a song the headphones vibrate. And if that wasn't enough, when you turn off the bass boost, all the lower frequencies are basically gone. The mids and highs aren't all that great either. Skullcandy has always been terrible and these headphones are no different.

The whole experience was the worst ever with any product, I ended up so frustrated and upset that I threw away the headphones, half open, altogether.I will never buy a product from SkullCandy again.

They're great at the gym and work great if you're in a public place and want to zone out in your own world. A must buy if you're a music enthusiast! The only problem i have with them is that the wiring went bad after a few months. if i hold the wire that plugs into whatever i'm playing music out of just right i can hear them just fine. Otherwise, the sound cuts in and out if that. Either way, i still highly recommend these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close.","review":"I'm picky about my audio. Not so much that I'll get into an argument about whether burn-in has any effect or not, but the sound has to be clean and balanced or I'm not happy. The skullcandy skullcrushers is nowhere near this.I am aware that these headphones are meant for bass, and in that it delivers. When you turn the battery-powered sub on you get a noticeable boost in the low, but the problem is that while they were working on the bass, they forgot the make the rest of the range any good. The mid and high are nowhere near the same levels and there is a laughably noticeable fall off in volume when the tone goes above the sub's inadequate range.I will say this, it seems well-balanced for rap. So if you plan on listening to nothing but rap on your new skullcrushers, you will be happy the rest of your days. Everyone else will be severely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality but BREAKS EASILY","review":"The quality was good, sound was great I loved it.

Dont get me wrong, the sound quality was amazing and the bass kicker was great but it isn't worth the 40 dollars I paid at the time, I'm glad its on-sale because the plastic they use is crappy.Caution: I know a lot of people who have bought these headphones and had them break in the SAME PLACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm.","review":"So i paid 35 dollars for these headphones.

When it comes to sound equipment theres always brats who would refuse to buy anything short of Sony or Bose etc All i can say is, if your looking at these headphone your probably not some hi-tech sound engineer. But honestly these are really awesome. So comfertable. Ive worked with 250 dollar headphones on and they have literally cut off blood supply to my ears, and i have a normal sized head with normal sized ears.

They look great but I was not impressed by the sound.First of all, yeah there's a ton of bass, but the tonality and texture is so thin it defeats the purpose of turning up the bass. I think they are rightfully named \\"Skullcrusher\\" because the vibration this thing puts on your ears is unbearable when bass is turned up highest, and just plain annoying when you turn the knob down a bit.I'm not an old guy complaining about how loud the bass is.I'm actually 25 years old who loves music and sound. The quality is just very cheap. The highs sound like a tin can, while the bass sounds like a nasty farting noise constantly thudding in your ears.I feel like their \\"selling point\\" is the whole subwoofer idea. Sounds great on paper, but no so much in the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cheap Bass","review":"These are pretty decent low end headphones.

Over all I am very satisfied with this product it is a great deal and you won't regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"these are amazing headphones, i am on my second pair. the experience of listening to oa song with the bass on full blast, is an experience that cannot be copied by any other headphone. these are simply amazing headphones. however, the folding hinge is pretty flimsy, and can break pretty easilyi should also add, that music is not the o nly thing that sounds amazing,movies and games with anykind of gunplay are made even more intense.... it feels like somone's firing a handgun right next to your head everytime a gun is fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, when they work.","review":"Only one side of the headphones works. the only way I get the other side to wrok is by bending on the headphone plug in the right direction.

I could easily chalk these up as my worst set of earphones. I recently purchased a set of Beats Wireless and I couldn't be happier. Yeah having a tune-able subwoofer is a good concept, but, it just doesn't work out. I understand Beats Wireless and these are an apples to oranges compare-o, but this things were a huge disappointment. Oh well. They went to the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I bought these at Best Buy for $75, and I can't believe how atrocious they sound. No bass. The vibrating sub-woofer is not a suitable replacement for real bass. You would expect something more from headphones that claim a sub-woofer. I would put these on par with $15 ear buds or mid-range ear-cup headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"pinstripe design","review":"Great Comfort was brought down by the bass boost module in the audio cord. When the module slides off of a surface it falls and pulls on the headphones briefly. My units quit producing sound from the right side 4 weeks after getting them. Skullcandy has a great warranty so not terribly upset but I am inconvenienced.I am receiving a new pair from Skullcandy, so I take the malfunction as an anomaly. The bass boost is truly a boost, also note that it is not just butting to boost but you can moderate the level of boost."},{"rating":"2","title":"These really get the bass pounding","review":"Great product.

I was very very veeeeeery wrong.They sound great until they break a month into use. Apparently they are NOT designed to handle the great sound they produce. After a few weeks the bass cut out.I called them for a refund, which I could not get because I got it through amazon, so they sent me another pair. THESE BROKE TOO. I look at their website for warranty stuff and turns out the 3rd time they fix it they wont give you a new pair so I just took the money and bought their Heavy Medal Ear Buds.Those have been working fine, but again DO NOT BUY SKULL CRUSHERS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the average music listener.","review":"I am a typical music listener, with an ipod, with music from van halen to tupac, and these headphones are awesome.

Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey for the poor construction, but I love the bass!","review":"I have had these headphones for more than a year, and I really like the look of them. I like the fact that you can pump up the bass or turn it down, and it still sounds good. Downside-the cord is permanently connected, I have to wiggle it around to hear the sound sometimes, and once it breaks for good there's no replacing the cord. Also, they could be more comfortable.

There are one or two somewhat catchy songs with good musical arrangements, for example the first two songs. Some of the songs are just plain bad, like \\"Bang-Bang\\" and \\"Just A Kid\\". \\"Joy City\\" is somewhat catchy and the lyrics are so awful it's funny. It's also hilarious that it sounds like they're playing table tennis. The whole song is so silly it's funny.Most of the album works on a \\"campy\\" level because it's so over-the-top and silly, or just to listen to as background music, but it's not \\"good\\". Buy it only if you find it at a cheap price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Watch out - if you like to \\"come out at night\\", best stay away from this \\"mission\\". This sounds like some of the earlier pop Prince projects- but they are better. I picked up the cassette of this album for a quarter - and still question if I got my moneys worth! While Edgar has always had a more commercial lean than brother Johnny, he still has my respect as a school of rock professor. You can find a decent sax solo or two on this recording, maybe. But overall, this is a concept project album, and contributes little musically to the Winter cataloge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Headlamp","review":"This is my first headlamp and it has worked very well for me. The available angles that the lamp can do is very good and suits me needs well. It has a very long use time I had it in strobe mode for 72 hours.The light at max is fantastically bright. Low is a very nice reading light level.It works well for gloves as long as they are not too padded.It is a bit stiff for the head, I would prefer some more padding there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apalling Product! Do Not Buy!","review":"I bought this particular model for my brother as a Christmas present in December 2008 because he was always borrowing mine on camping trips. The one I own is an earlier, and cheaper, model Princeton Tec \\"Aurora\\" with three LEDS, that he got me for Christmas 3 years ago. Mine is a great product and still works flawlessly to this day.The problem with this model is that the pivot point design is abominable and loosened up after about 4 weeks of use to the point where it flops all the way forward and points at the ground, essentialy rendering it useless. Unlike mine, which has a through bolt and locknut for the pivot, this model has plastic tabs which snap onto either side of the headlight housing so there is no way to tighten it back up. It boggles the mind how this ever made it through a design review process and into production.One of the worst designed products I've seen since 'Windows ME'. I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"The light was great for close work or reading, but the batteries don't last very long in it perhaps because of the low battery indicator and the plastic cracked somehow.If it was made out of stainless steel, extremely tough aluminum, carbon fiber or titanium and it didn't have a low battery indicator that wastes your batteries while letting you know that your batteries are getting low, it would be great. But unless these changes are made to it, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princeton Tec Quad Headlamp","review":"I love the Princeton Tec headlamp because it is small, light, and relatively cheap, and the batteries last a very long time. Great for backpacking, and I always take one on business trips, just in case. Also, you can clip the headlamp to a baseball cap and do without the headband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work..........","review":"Sadly, this doesn't work. So disappointing. Sending it back.

It failed to work when testing to get ready for a 2nd camping trip. When I opened the battery compartment it was all corroded inside. Don't know why as the 1st use was NOT in rain or damp situation and I kept it in a baggie to protect from moisture in any case. So, not my idea of a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch Failed","review":"The switch failed after just a few uses. The light refuses to stay on.

It worked great, providing excellent lighting in a choice of 3 different intensities. Best of all, it was lightweight and very comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Pivot Point","review":"Echoing what another reviewer said, the pivot point is made out of plastic. Due to this fact, the lamp loses its ability to grip onto the pivot point as the plastic wears down. Mine is at the point -- after four or five times out running -- where it has to be either completely up and facing forward or it will flop down and point directly at my feet. Neither of these positions is useful for running as a straight forward position puts the light too far for running, and straight down simply blinds me and doesn't shoot the light far enough forward. I would expect this problem to exist for other applications as well if you have to lean forward. Do not buy this product.I now have to put a piece of plastic behind the lamp and use a rubber band to hold the lamp against the plastic. This allows it to point down slightly, but it looks even more ridiculous. Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Small, powerful and battery life is good. You can't get a better quality light that's waterproof with regulated output for less money.

They both use them to work on cars in the dark and love them. I recommend also purchasing rechargeable batteries. It has a variable brightness and the lamp tilts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"I've used this headlamp several times now and it works as advertised. The three light levels are nice, I used the lowest setting on an evening walk in the woods, and the highest for checking the pork shoulder during an all-night smoke. And it's reasonably comfortable, too. I haven't used up a set of batteries yet, so I can't speak to battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaw, major","review":"The headlamp itself is attached to the headband by a terribly designed shape in plastic. The lamp itself will fall off the headband OFTEN.I usually tie my primary headlamp to a bag handle (like an airline paper slip with your name on it, on your luggage, looped through itself) so I can access it first and quickly.Not an option with Princeton Tec Headlamps. The plastic shape on the lamp is designed like a sideways \\"I\\", so you can get it on rather easily, but keeping it on would require glue, or a safety pin in your head..no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"I really like this series--about women trained at St. Jude's Abbey in the \\"knightly arts.\\"This one has the heroine looking for a stone in Wales that is cursed so that if the King steps on it, he'll die.

I felt I needed to finish this one for 2 reasons: I never finished \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and I thought it might be going somewhere. It turns out the plot device is merely a vehicle to allow Heinlein to imagine how he'd act if he had boobs and a vagina. About halfway through, the novel merely becomes a series of hook-ups although none of them ever go into enough detail to be racy or titillating. The entire premise is about as sophisticated as a mane trolling a sexy internet chat site masquerading as a woman. I'd recommend finding another use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Live Footage but Not Much Insight into the Band...","review":"Ramones Raw is basically Marky Ramone with a handheld camera annoying Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and C.J. while on tour. There is some great live footage of the band playing some classic songs. The DVD doesn't really tell a story but is more of a narrative of the Ramones life on the road. The inner relations of the band are not touched upon at all. In fact, by watching Ramones Raw you'd never know that Johnny and Joey hated each other with a passion. Most of the running time is lighthearted gags and inside jokes interspersed with concert footage. For a complete look at the inner workings of the band, as well as the making of most of their albums, pick up the End of the Century DVD it is a MUCH more comprehensive look at the band as a whole.

The title track that kicks off the record is one of the hardest rocking things they ever cut. The songs, while just a slight notch below those on the original, remain terrific retro-pop tunes, illustrating why this group is held in such high regard among power pop aficionados, and is a large part of Twilley's legacy. - Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music GuideNote: The 1990 DCC/Shelter reissue was engineered for compact disc by Steve Hoffman and contains the original 1977 album cover art not available on the Capitol reissue, as well as complete song lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"Sorry, I don't get it. Sure, there are some nice enough songs on there, but they're few and far between. Mostly what we get is tired old recycled riffs which sounded a lot better when The Kinks (or whoever) did them to begin with. I got interested in checking Twilley out on the basis of stuff like \\"I'm On Fire\\" and \\"Out Of My Hands\\", and because I had heard so often how underappreciated and excellent he was supposed to be, and everyone pointed me in the direction of this one. Nonesense! You're perfectly well enough off with just the \\"XXI\\" ('Best Of') CD, and even that one's not in short supply of a filler. In short: If you're really looking for good music in this vein which isn't on everyone's menu, just check out Duncan Faure, Fountains Of Wayne, or someone who's really, truly, underappreciated...there's no shortage of 'em out there.

It worked for 8 days, but then she started doing the clawing again with the sticky stuff there. I even tried putting another layer of strips down, thinking that maby the week-old ones weren't so sticky anymore, but she just kept on scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mbeere in Kenya : Changing rural ecology","review":"The first of a two volume series that provides a detailed look at the history and current status of the Mbeere people. While living with the tribe in the Peace Corps it provided valuable information that otherwise would have remained unknown to me as much of it is based on oral stories and knowledge. The history of the people as shown through goverment documents, pictures, stories, and previous antropologist studies are all included in the first half of this comprehensive set. It is a fine reference for anyone who wishes to study the tribe and its history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reference on the History of Astronomy in Canada","review":"This is a unique book about the history of astronomy in Canada. The coverage is quite good but could have been enriched and is somewhat biased. Especially some aspects might have been explored in more details, like the astronomy in the French regime. On the other hand, a large coverage is given the the David Dunlop Observatory. The book looks a little outdated now as the astronomy has largely grown in many part of Canada in the last 20 years.It is still the authoritative book about history of astronomy in Canada. A recommanded reading for a long cloudy winter night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality","review":"I am very unhappy with this product I ordered ,the package appeared to have been stored in a molded warehouse or something of that sort.I did not appreciate the reglious paper in the package also.This was a present for my grandaughter but I will NOT be giving this to her I donated it to Goodwill.Never again will I order this way.NOT PLEASED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire Lash #210","review":"Fire Lash is the 210th book in the Executioner Series by Don Pendleton and the first book in The Red Dragon Trilogy.

It gets off to a slow start though and the characters are not so interesting and pretty shallow. There are several bad puns and references to recent popculture weaved through the predictable storyline. I'm a little over half way through and having trouble picking it up -- that never happens. If you think a farmer naming his cows Britney and Jennifer after Spears and Lopez is sweet, you might enjoy it more. I just finished the Corrections before this. It was not lighthearted but it was funny and engaging. This book reminds me of the disappointing 8 O'Clock Tuesday (or something similar and not memorable) that my book club read last summer. It is a \\"sweet\\" book though and some may enjoy it for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The city folk are coming......","review":"This is a delightfully witty commentary on city folk who chuck it all in to dwell in rustic splendor in the idyllic countryside around Eight Mile Bottom, but who get a lot more than they bargained for.If you likedBridget Jones's Diaryor appreciate British humor, you'll enjoy the resulting calamities, confusion, misunderstandings and slapstick comedy that ensue when Rosie and Mark and Samantha and Guy make the big move to their respective dream country dwellings.Full of local color, scandalous gossip, and a wide range of eccentric (or just plain strange) characters, the author regales us with the trials of the decidedly not well-to-do Rosie and her writer boyfriend Mark, and the misery of everybody else having the bad luck to encounter the filthy rich Samantha.A hunky farmer, a reclusive pop star and a houseful of ghosts round out the story, which is recommended if you're looking for an extremely light tension-relieving read.Amanda Richards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled Mess","review":"This book has an interesting premise that is ruined by poor execution, thoroughly detestable characters and asinine dialogue. The main heroine basically has to choose between three moody, insensitive jerks, the only difference being their occupations. Too many characters, all of them underdeveloped and none of them likeable. Campy pop culture references and throw away dialogue.I wish I could bill the author for the wasted hours I spent on this mess. A beach book? Sure, use it as a coaster or as a sand shovel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"Enjoy \\"Farm Fatale\\" for what it is- a light comedy. Discussions of realism and structure should be saved for literature, which this charming book does not even attempt, let alone claim. I haven't yet read Ms. Holden's other books, so I couldn't be disappointed on that score.Many reviewers complained of the ending, and I disagree-I think it suits the tone of the book: lighthearted, unlikely, silly and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel good book","review":"While the book was light and fluffy it was well written and had good character development. I liked all the twists and turns, the last 100 pages were hard to put down!!!

The characters are so colorful and crazy - I can see this being made into a movie! I have to say, the first 30 pages or so were hard to get through (getting to know the characters), but well worth it! I'm recommending this book all over the place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining, but disappointingly lightweight","review":"\\"Farm Fatale\\" starts off as a Bridget-Jones-style modern Brit comedy, but by the end I felt like I'd been reading an updated Harlequin romance. Holden does put unexpected plot twists into her book, but many of the characters who start out interestingly dwindle into stereotypes, and I was very disappointed by her unbelievable ending. The story includes mildly graphic but hurried sex scenes that are not particularly well-written. (Holden's mention of the \\"hungry throb\\" her character Rosie feels in a certain part of her anatomy irritated me for weeks.) This book might amuse you on a plane, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a definate MUST HAVE in the cd collection","review":"I first heard The Devlins performing with the Tori Amos concert in Abq.

I am a B&W junkie and believe movies should be preserved in their original form. However, I got stuck watching it in color because of a technical issue with our DVD player. I found the colorization job that was done to be garish in some areas but completely weak in others. What really amused me was the fact that the \\"colorizers\\" left so many things uncolorized. Some are subtle and in the background and others are quite obvious. I spent most of the movie picking out areas that they didn't bother to colorize. Apparently they were too lazy or felt the audience was too \\"dull\\" to notice. It really irritated me to see this careless treatment of such a classic. As far as the restoration is concerned, I felt that it was fairly decent.

Amazon is offering March of the Wooden Soldiers free this Christmas (as a rental) and it is unwatchable. The aspect ratio is seriously messed up and the characters appear tall and skinny while some parts of it you get the feeling you are watching the movie through a fish eye lens, and the lower parts of the film are cut off. I love this movie and we used to borrow it from the library on 16mm film and watch it with a projector and the quality of that was better than what Amazon has here on Video On Demand. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original please!","review":"The pleasure of new formats like DVD is to provide the original, remastered versions of classic films.

It is from Legend Films and Genius Products and it looks SPECTACULAR.

I viewed the Legend version (in the red box) alongside the Goodtimes version, and the Legend version is many times better in quality in both b/w and color. Well worth the extra few dollars and a must buy for Christmas or any other time of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same as Was in Theaters","review":"What was once shown on television around the Thanksgiving-Xmas seasons over 30 years ago is not what is on this video. There is at least a good five (5) minutes missing from it. The scene is where Tom-Tom has been banished to Bogey-Land and Bo-Peep is with him. He sings to her to go to sleep as they are both very tired. It is evident that this was copied from television and edited to take out the commercials. I believe the person copying this from TV was in the kitchen getting something to eat while this was being edited.I wanted my children (ages five to eleven) to witness classic humor and a wonderful story. However, even though they did not know what was missing, it was evident that something was not right.I feel it is a sad event that what we remember from our childhoods cannot be the same of which we wish to share with our children.The movie is a classic if it isn't colorized. To see it in its original B&W version is wonderful.- A very disappointed viewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"As a sucker for holiday movies I was running out of things I'm familiar with, so I moved into uncharted territory. I don't know why I thought it was a holiday movie though, because it really was a nursery rhyme romp. However considering when this movie was made, and the budget they likely used, it's almost amazing they did such a good job. I forgot the point, but the two foolish large men saved the day, won the girl (for the good guy) and all was well. It probably looks like the film quality of other things from that era, it's not particularly cleaned up but certainly it's tolerable cinematic viewing. It might be a nice introduction to youngsters to Laurel and Hardy, and they'll certainly get a kick out of the nursery rhyme parts. Everyone old enough to know who Laurel and Hardy are probably already saw this and liked it. And for the rest of us it wasn't bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god I'm 7 years old again!","review":"This movie just takes me right back to childhood.

But shes in love with Tom Tom.

There are no blacks, just light grays, and the tonal balance is all off and wan. One must significantly lower the brightness on one's display to get an acceptable image. The colorizing looks much better as well when darkened. I'm of the feeling that the image was brightened for colorizing, but then it wasn't darkened again (as it should've been) before final mastering.As far as the HD upgrade, it is minor. It appears that a great deal of digital noise reduction was used, leaving patterns and edges of objects rather waxy. It also shows up how some of the colors bleed over on different objects. I only paid about $9 fo this Blu-ray, but come on...

And for the most part, I have to agree, now having seen the uncut, unedited version presented here. This is some of Laurel & Hardy's best work. Disney studios obviously studied this film because so many bits of this and that were lifted from it. The march of the toy soldiers is an amazing peice of stop-action work considering that it was done in the 1930's, and almost seems to have been lifted frame by frame by Disney. Of course, in all fairness, MGM's \\"mouse\\" is an obvious parody of Mickey, and the three little pigs, plus their theme song, are most certainly Disney's. But Stan and Ollie are in fine form, and very, very funny, and that's what most of us are there for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Poor Quality!","review":"Look, I'm not going to complain about Laurel and Hardy's classic Christmas film, \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" otherwise known as the original \\"Babes in Toyland.\\" I know the film was done in the early 1930s in Black and White.Sadly, my DVD has such a poor quality. I couldn't watch the colorized version in the first place. The black and white version was better but not by much. It took about 30 minutes to air 10 minutes of the remaining film.The extras are in the same boat as well. I don't know maybe I got a poor copy in the first place. It's a shame because I really love this Laurel and Hardy film. Maybe I'll get another copy to replace this one. The features included an original cartoon short of \\"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\\" and other special shorts.That's why I'm giving it two stars because I really enjoy the film and the extras but I can't with this DVD.

With the \\"Rolaids,etc.\\" the pancreas has food glob to alkaline...then you get your problems.We had a problem with ulcers when we first started the Papaya. They healed over a short time.

Does exactly what it supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't notice the small print for the mint...","review":"My bad for not reading all the ingredients thoroughly but do be aware if you are a speed shopper as I am, that these taste like peppermint papaya. I love peppermint tea, but I do not like peppermint fruity taste right after or before a meal. It messes with the flavors. Therefore these are mostly going to be unused. I'll have to go back to quickdigest. Was trying to avoid the carbs...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"These papaya enzymes are great. I keep a few in my purse at all times so they are always around when I need them. They never fail - whenever I eat something that upsets my stomach, a few of these calms my stomach almost instantly. I also love that they are natural, contain a few types of enzymes and are minty. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"Ya need this if you are a complete Hendrix nut. But the author attempts musicological analysis where people like Velvert Turner, Wolf Marshall, Andy Aledort, and others have done an excellent job already. I needed some historical and political analysis but none was forthcoming, mostly because the author is an Englishman and deals with Hendrix through that social lens. This is an otherwise excellent series of books, but I implore the publisher to get a Yank to do another one on Hendrix. Maybe someone affiliated with the Hendrix museum up in Seattle, Washington USA. Heck, let ME write the Hendrix volume. I have all the bios, recordings; even the instruments and effects of the sort used by Hendrix. I'll write the publisher directly and see if they'll give me the gig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever!","review":"Being a computer engineer, I have never touched half the FE material. This book barely touched on the subjects, and some not at all. Full of misspellings, grammatical mistakes, I highly do *NOT* recommend this book. The only thing I used was the practice exam which is available in other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the adulterous heroine!","review":"This book was not a romance IMHO. I wish the hero would have just kicked the heroine to the curb and found someone that was at least faithful to him. If I don't like the protagonists in a story and I'm expecting a romance, then for me the book did not do it's job. Jo Beverley is a good writer but I find her stories can be quite dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jehanne is an unfaithful tramp. Not romantic.","review":"Ok, I'll admit I didn't get past the first 24 pages, but by that point, I knew all I needed to know. I normally really love Jo Beverly, so this was an extra disappointment.The book starts in a place where most romance books END. Jehanne and Galeran are already married, have a child and Jehanne has had an adulterous affair and had a second child while her husband is away at war in the holy lands for three long years. All Galeran can think of while he is away is his lovely wife and child, and he comes home to find she's replaced him with someone else AND had her lover's child! That is SO unromantic. What is the point of reading further? I already hate Jehanne and frankly, think she's a tramp with no morals.All the other reviews I've read solidify my feelings about this book. If you love a sweet romance, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo disappointed","review":"The heroine is weak. The betrayal is overwhelming. I just wanted Galeran to beat Jehanne and move on and find a more virtuos woman. He could do better than this slut. She doesn't even seem guilty! I'm so distraught over this storyline. I can't believe Jo Beverly wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Beverley's best","review":"I love Jo Beverley's romance and this is one of her best-to be recommended along with Emily and the Dark Angel and My Lady Notorious.

Where were you Marilyn when I started my own business 20 years ago?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Brazen Hussies\\" Will Jump Start Your Business Marketing","review":"Okay, the title's a scream but when you open it up you'll find Ross' book jam-packed full of ideas that if they don't get you a little excited, well, check your pulse. As someone who's worked in advertising copywriting, public relations, marketing research, strategic planning and done a lot of sales I have a fairly extensive library of marketing books. This one is top's on my list because it takes a subject that many women unfortunately shy away from and makes it fresh, fun, easily approachable and 100 percent rock solid. A must for any woman (or man) interested in de-mystifying the process of moving products and services from you to the happy end consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazen Hussies UNITE!","review":"Thank goodness Mrs. Ross finally gave us brazen hussies some credibility. I just wanted to let you know I have just finished \\"Shameless Marketing for Brazen Hussies\\" and have enjoyed it immensely. I've found value in every single chapter (especially the sidebars). Even after 15 years in small business administration I still found myself amazed at the information that has been included and spent a lot of time surfing the resources provided. Although I've visited and know of many of the sites listed, there were many that I had never heard of and that helped to provide me with in depth knowledge of other areas in small business I may not have dealt with in the past. This is definitely on my short list of books for women in business..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable at any level","review":"It became obvious that the author loosely bases his tales on very little fact. This isn't to say that there aren't criminals and ne'er-do-wells in Japan (as in the rest of the world) but if you were to pick a crime...say, stealing motorcycles...and then write a story with two main characters, a love interest, a few antagonists, you'd be doing exactly what is done here. In the end, I think it a little sophomoric to think that we should be shocked by what we read, when what we are reading here is obviously fiction based on fact. Whenever conversations between two characters takes place, you know the author wasn't present for those conversations, whenever a crime is discussed, you know the author is guessing as to how it was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"mislabeled and misinformed","review":"The back cover copy should read something like \\"Greenfeld reprints so-so interviews with his friends (real and imaginary) in a manner that shows you that this book is messily taped together.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read; entertaining and educational.","review":"The aspect of this book that enjoyed the most is how Mr. Greenfeld was able to skillfully incorporate social commentary and criticism with an engaging prose. I came away from this book with a better understanding of not only mainstream Japanese society, but also it's underbelly. A sordid place inhabited by low-level yakuza, porn-stars, and drug peddlers. Read this book and be inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regardless of the scholarship, it was a hell of a read!","review":"I don't know whether the book is fiction or fact, but i was totally engaged with it. The stories of the Japanese youth is totally interesting, and in a lot of ways, just like us. I was never bored with the book. I'm going to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, utterly dreadful","review":"I live in Japan and was terribly disappointed by this work. Greenfield pitches this as a documentary but it's anything but, pure fiction and not even good fiction at that. Has he even been to Japan? I doubt it. Never I have I seen such a blatant attempt to stereotype modern Japanese culture in the latest cyberpunk style with the only aim being to make money. Avoid this book! I didn't want to give it a single star, but the Amazon rating system forces me to. A big zero would be far more appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Some of the people who reviewed this book took it way too seriously. To criticize Mr. Greenfeld for not backing up his \\"analysis\\" of Japanese youth culture with scientific facts and evidence is ridiculous. The author of this book is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, an erudite, scholarly observer of Japanese society. Like thousands of young Westerners before and since, he initially went to Japan as a JET Program participant and used his considerable writing skills to quickly move beyond the world of teaching English. Whether or not his stories are true is irrelevant. Whether or not they even accurately reflect the lifestyle of Japan's \\"next generation\\" is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that his stories, while occasionally a bit slow, are well written and worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that it seems...","review":"Take this book, and anything else by this author, with a very large grain of salt. To put it very charitably, there seems to be no barrier between fact and fiction... 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel - a fairy story","review":"This book is unbelievably bad. Look, I live in Japan and I can't believe that this joker has ever been here. This book is becoming something of a legend in the foreign community here as it's just so incredibly untrue. Where did this guy do his research, sci-fi movies? Come and live here Karl and when you've got a few years under your belt then, and only then, you'll be in a position to talk. Until you've done that then kindly label your juvenile dribblings as 'teenage fiction'. Better still just shut up until you actually know what you're talking about. There should be a zero star rating on Amazon because I feel really nauseated at having to give this 'book' any stars at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but dated","review":"Book is well written and interesting but the information is dated now that the Japanese economy has been stagnating for even longer than ours. It is still very much worth a read and will broaden one's sense of the complexity of Japanese society. The last story is particularly fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried very hard","review":"Sutherland's voice was tired and heavy and slow. I wanted to like this very much because I love Sutherland, but to my knowledge the only singer who kept his voice so long was Kraus. I highly do not recommend this CD. The last piece on it (Una voce poco fa) came to life some and I liked it and if the whole disc had been at least of that caliber I would have liked it and would keep it. Everything seemed slow, and as though it had all been transposed down a few steps, and there were no fireworks (except the last number). Of course, this album is called Bel Canto Arias, not Coloratura Arias. Some may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad crystal","review":"the crystal scratches very easily...not a good watch if you can't read the display! I tried to clean it but no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic case breaks in a few months","review":"About 5 months after I received the watch, the part of the case that holds the band in place broke. I've always liked the features of Casio's watches, but this is the second one with this problem in a year.The watch is so cheap it's probably not worth the trouble to try to have it repaired or replace--besides, the warranty excludes rough handling and I think Casio would use that as a dodge to avoid replacing the watch. Caveat emptor on Casio plastic watches: they won't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and poor company","review":"The watch lasted 2 weeks.

First of all the instruction book was micro fine and I had to have greatly enlaged to view. Secondly I've yet to enter the basic time/date functions in either. The buttom system, etc., etc. is crazy. The light is next to worthless (whereas my older Casio was great and simple to program). I would NOT recommend this unit to anyone............."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 years? How about 10 weeks?","review":"This watch is very thin and light, and about what you would expect for the price. The illuminator function is weak at best. It turns of automatically after just a second and holdnig down the button does nothing. All that would be acceptable if the company's claims of a ten year battery were true. My battery lasted about three months before dying in the middle of the night. I took the watch to have the battery replaced and was told that not only did they not carry the battery, but they were not allowed to open the back of the watch and would have to send it back to the manufacturer. All in all a disappointing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"My husband needed a watch for Christmas. He wanted one that was durable to the outdoors, nice enough for church and one with a band that wouldn't turn his arm green or pinch his skin and hair. My husband loved this watch!! It was perfect!

The time zone and alarm functions make it very practical for travel across time zones, and it's cheap enough that there's no need to conceal it in potentially risky tourist areas around the world. My only reason to give it less than 5 stars is that the method to set and change times is far from intuitive and I find it takes me a while each time to rediscover the method. For the price, especially, this is an excellent option.

However, I find the instructions for setting up various operations to be difficult. Also, for some reason the Month / Day seem to drop out sometimes. Perhaps I'm accidentally touching one of the buttons which could reset the numbers? Otherwise, it's a beautiful watch that is well worth the price.

I can't stand fake plastic screw heads... why do that?), but it's 20 bucks, is very comfortable, very legible (during the day... digital display can't be read in dark even with light), and so damned useful I had to order a second after losing the first.The databank feature is \\"quaint\\", back when storing 500 bytes or so could be called a \\"data bank\\" and when people had pagers and phones didn't store numbers.The separate analog/digital setting problem is still there, as with all casio analog-digital watches (that I've seen).But, it's a working watch, shows the date and has a stopwatch. Water resistant (I've swam with it on), comfortable soft velcro band.That's really all I need in a watch. For 20 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Comfortable","review":"Thisis themost comfortable watch I own or have ever owned. The velcro watch band makes it a snap to put on, remove or adjust. I haven't had the watch long enough to test out the claims for the battery, but so far, this is a great watch for casual attire situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Watch","review":"I like canvas and that is one of the main reasons I bought this watch. Also it has a 10 year battery.Also it is bothdigital and analog, so I can see both the time and the date.On the other hand, I don't like to take it off when I take a shower because of the velcro, and that can be a bit unpleasant but not all that bad.Finally, you have to be patient when adjusting the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch for the money","review":"I needed an inexpensive sport watch that I could wear for working / playing outdoors. I think this one will fit the bill just fine. I like the color, the face and the fabric band. I don't love the velcro strip all the way down the one side. I'm sure it's good for making the band adjustable for many wrist sizes but it covers the band too far for my taste and I'm concerned it will collect dirt and grime. Other than that the watch was fairly easy to set and the light works well so I can see the time in the dark. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what I want, at a replaceable price","review":"I treat my watches very bad, and so far this one has held up fine. The face is plastic, and it is already showing a little bit of wear. Its definitely cheap (fake plastic rivets, velcro, wristband material), but is lightweight and has as many functions as the higher priced watches have.Seen considerable use outside already, in the heat and rain. No problems for this durable Casio."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had so many high hopes for this watch","review":"I almost wanted to buy one for myself but this watch although stylish isnt durable at all and all thats left now is the watch with no band. the nylon is tough but the leather that connects directly to the watch wasnt strong at all and came a part from the watch very soon after the gift was given. the indiglo on it was nice but thewatch heldup poorly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"It\`s a good looking dependable watch that\`s well worth the money.

The only regret about this CD is it doesn't include the lovely ballad \\"Once In A While\\" (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). In my opinion, that was one of the best songs.

The songs are very catchy and easy to sing along to. Tim Curry brings his very distinctive voice to this recording. The reason I only gave this recording 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because a few songs (i.e. \\"The Sword of Damocles\\", \\"Planet Schmanet Janet\\", \\"Planet Hot Dog\\") were not included for some reason, but it's wonderful nonetheless.

You have some nice computer generated FX, mixed with some cheesy Halloween alien costumes. As a matter of fact I thought the aliens in the movie looked like a complete rip off of the aliens in the movie \\"Enemy Mine\\" made back in 1985. This movie was very so/so. I would pass on it.

While many so-called financial self-help books provide seductive, angles for acquiring wealth, CYFS shows how people often already posess the tools, resources, and yes, the cold hard cash, to alleviate the financial stresses plaquing so many Americans today. Eaton communicates clearly the key steps in avoiding the rocky coast of spiraling debt, eternal dissatisfaction, and the stresses created by always wanting \\"more.\\" Eaton's book is effective because he has in-depth knowledge on the subject, is wise beyond his years, and really cares about the subject. Rather than picking up the next tome on getting rich quick, try a pleasant and worthwhile detour with Conquering Your Financial Stress. Thanks to Eaton, the reader may find the grass is greener right under his/her own two feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best, honest, and most important approach","review":"This book has the goods and delivers.

The ultimate \\"tighten-up music\\"! Nothing got us in the mood better.Seriously, the musicianship is outstanding, solid pounding drums, actual guitar solos! excellent songwriting and of course Roi's great growly vocals. This is a band to be taken seriosly, not some snotty teenagers banding up in their parents garage and playing their buddie's parties for a six-pack of beer. (Not that there's any thing wrong with that...) They should never be forgotten. I was elated to find this on CD. I looked to replace my old LP for YEARS. On a whim I googled them and there it was.

There are some fabulous dancey songs such as \\"tangerine\\" and \\"suite dreams\\" that evoke the best in nightclub splendor, and then there are some thoughtful and feeling music and lyrics included in \\"i hear you dreaming\\" and \\"justice,mercy\\".

The girlfriend is a date rape victim, not a virginally, repressed teenager. So I assume, by \\"sexual fantasy\\" you are referring to the attempted date rape scene. Ramona is a battered prostitue, not a temptress or good friend of the mother.

In this collection of harpsichord work brought thrillingly to life my one of the equally superb playing by fellow Frenchman Christophe Rousset. Couperin's style combined French and Italian which brings together the sonorities and particularities of the harpsichord, His six books of hasichord suites are meant to portray both people and places and are quite evocative even though scholars have not been to discover who they are. I found that most of these pieces were very moving even the ones that move faster. Every classical collection should have these CDs because in my opinion only Bach's harpsichord music surpasses Couprin's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to sing along with and not torture.","review":"Many kids music CD's lead to crazy parents.

I usually don't review items, but this one was so bad that I couldn't help but want to warn anyone who is thinking of purchasing it! The quality and construction of this unit is horrible. The screws did not even stay in the fake wood. (I knew this wasn't solid wood, but usually, screws will take). After putting it \\"together\\", it LITERALLY fell apart as soon as I picked it up to move it to the spot where it was going. The back panel came in broken and the shelves were rough. Also...the unit does not hold as many DVD's as advertised...at least not in an upright position. The shelves aren't evenly distributed so the last shelf holds the DVD's laying down.

Unfortunately for me, the shelves were fine at the toppermost use and on the bottom shelve. Anything in between will not work. On my unit, the outside particle boards are both bowed.

Assembly is easy and fast, but there is a lack of support to prevent the shelving from swaying. The shelves are just supported by little metal screws that stick out, and because of the lack of support in the middle of the shelves, they just fall down. I did attempt to make custom modifications, but it was basically a loss at that point.If you are capable of making adjustments and have time to trouble shoot faulty furniture, this is the perfect DVD storage unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Purchased at a local big box for around $40. It went together quickly, but fell apart the moment I put DVDs on the shelf. I don't mean the self fell down, I mean the entire thing collapsed.

The quality of the $20 unit I bought was much better than this! The finish is nice on it, but that's about the only good thing I have to say. The shelves don't sit evenly- the unit side walls feel unstable- the directions are awful and it is awkward to assemble.

It's almost like, don't look at me, because I'll break! I would not have paid $30 bucks for this.. it's like worth $5 bucks or something. They spent more on the quality of designing the box (that you throw away) than the cabinet material itself. The bolts you use to hold the inner shelves are a joke.. they keep falling off when you are inserting DVDs into the cabinet.I have experience in building things and assembling things like these. The instructions were easy to figure out and the glue came in handy to paste the wooden rivets.

SUPER easy to put together. i'm a girl and it only took me maybe 10 minutes to put together. the directions are just pictures, but honestly, you don't really even need them.

I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but not quite what's described","review":"It does not have \\"2 fixed shelves and 4 adjustable shelves.\\" All six shelves are adjustable, which means it's unstable. It wiggles a few inches from side to side when you touch it. I placed mine up against a different (stable) shelf, and that solved the problem; luckily it leans in the right direction. If you don't have something for it to lean on, you'll have to anchor it to your wall (they don't include anything to anchor it with, although they do include a random tube of what I assume is glue -- I guess they have a sense of humor about their craftmanship).Also, it doesn't hold 112 DVDs unless you stack them sideways. It holds about 96, with a CD-sized shelf left over. If you use it to store CDs or a combination of CDs and DVDs, then the advertised capacity is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine with a little extra work","review":"The complaints about the falling center shelf is so true (even with the little knobs put in the right way) - crappy design indeed. However I used a glue gun to glue the side panels and the back panel - after putting this piece together, just glue it between the side and back panels (in the back of the cabinet) while having someone else holding the side panels inwards. This made the shelf very sturdy. I filled it up and it's holding my collection very well.

Many of these songs were forgotten, but are still classics like the Jolting Joe big band song, or DODGERs that mixes a bunch of popular oldies beats to describe a game between the Dodgers and Giants. A good variety of different songs too like Bruce Springsteens country version of Take me Out to the Ballgame, and the disco hit love is like a baseball game. Some of these songs feature the actual players, and its just a perfect collection for any baseball fan, although I would have liked to seen songs like Meet the Mets or Go, Go White Sox, this is still a good collection of gems.

It was relatively easy to put together by myself (though I had trouble getting the pieces of the metal frame to fit together too). It looked nice and felt very solid and sturdy. Unfortunately, after only 3 weeks the front support beam cracked with two-average weight people sitting on it. It looks as though the beam (the long board in front which the metal frame partly rests on) is constructed of two pieces of wood glued together, and a recent bout of hot weather must have weakened the bond. If you're feeling up to replacing the beams that are included in this set with sturdy boards of your own, this might be a good investment for you (it is a very comfortable frame--when it's not broken!). If not, I recommend buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive But Not Quality","review":"I love how this futon looks, and it also feels high quality at first--very substantial and heavy. However, first appearances can be deceiving. This futon has almost fallen apart after about 3 years of use by 2 average weight people. One of the support bars has snapped at the joint and the screws have stripped the wood leaving the whole thing very wobbly.

It is informative and left me with no questions. Along with the previous review, I also traveled halfway across the USA to be in the care of Dr. Lyons. I had excision of endometreosis performed by himself and could not have asked for a better experience. His passion for what he does is inevitable in both this book as well as his care.

It doesn't fire every so often esp if you try and shoot to fast, but for macro photography (which is what I mostly do, and use the SU-800 for) you do not need fast what so ever.

He strikes his wife and expects to make it up to her in bed not a minute later as she begs him to stop!

Both characters had me so annoyed I only continued reading in hopes that they would grow on me (with hopes that they would become better people). Unfortunately this story continued to frustrate me throughout and as an avid romance reader this could very well sit on the bottom of my list. Not only did I find the characters both lacking a moral compass, I could not sympathize with either and couldn't care less what happened in the end. I also felt that this novel was borderline culturally offensive with no real lessons learned by either character. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise wild","review":"Not as good as her other novels. It was nice but a bit ficle too. But I love Johanna Lyndsey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambien substitute","review":"Johanna Lindsey's 'Paradise Wild' has that one quality which I find unforgivable: it's boring. Be warned, this is 300 pages of two people, neither very likeable, getting into fight after fight, doing a lot of lying, having more than a few misunderstandings, then making up. End of book. Fighting, lying, misunderstanding and making up can hold an appeal if done well-- like for instance if it involved characters the reader has come to care about, or if it's extra-over the top, but here we get none of that.The sexual tension was nil, and I could hardly care less about the main characters and their stupid war. I thought about abandoning this book after nearly every chapter I finished, but like the fool I am, I soldiered on, hoping (I guess) something would occur that made this book worthwhile. Lord knows what that would be, maybe the two leads meeting a violent end at the hands of a disgruntled reader? Anyhow, I say avoid, it's not worth the time it would take to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise? Wild","review":"I read this book early in my love affair with Johanna Lindsey heros. This was one of two (A Pirate's Love being the other) I wish had gotten away from my stack of books to be read. The hero was too angry (abusive). The only reason it gets two stars is for a strong beginning which sets up a potentially great spurned love scenario. I wish the rest of the book had lived up to its beginning. Perhaps a good replacement title for this place on the list would be Once a Princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture to get through it!","review":"First, let me say that I LOVE Johanna Lindsey. Her characters are wonderful and most have a lot of humor to them. However, I HATED this book of hers. It was torture to finish it. The two main characters were so cruel to each other and the reasoning and dialog didn't make any sense. Here is a story of two stupid people who would rather think the worst of each other and get their revenge then think logically and humane toward each other. Then, to make matters worse, Johanna skimms over the love scenes with trite description. I usually read her books in 2 days. This one took me 2 weeks. I was just hoping it would get better but it kept getting worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance? You're Kidding!","review":"This is the first book by Johanna Lindsey that I've read and I can't believe it could be classified as a romance. Jared and Corrinne are two of the least engaging characters I've met in a 'romance' novel. Jared is vengeful, violent and vicious. Corrinne is spoilt, bad tempered and completely unloveable. So Jared has, as a little boy, witnessed the death of his mother by suicide - yes, a traumatic experience for sure, but I could not forgive his violence towards Corrinne nor his downright vindictiveness. Men who are violent towards women are NOT romantic figures and should not be portrayed as such. Ask any woman who is the victim of domestic violence. I was appalled to find Jared and Corrinne having passionate sex after a particularly violent episode. I could see no development of any deep loving feelings. Corrinne just wakes up one day knowing she loves this violent creep - but with her background and personality, how would she know anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Story","review":"I won't describe the story since others have already outlined it and in fact I wish I read them before reading the book myself. I have been a Johanna Lindsey fan for years and have read almost ALL her books, including books with violent themes, but I can honestly say that this is the first book that I have finished and felt that hero will likely repeat his abuse. I know the characters aren't real, but I love to think characters in books move on to have beautiful lives together and this wasn't the feeling I had finishing Paradise Wild. The book should have a built in scary song chip that plays when you're reading the last chapter, because the thought of them sailing off to Hawaii together was not a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise but Boring","review":"This is not Joanna Lindsey at her best; like the little girl with the curl, when she's good she's very good and when she's bad she's horrid. Here she is merely predictable with rather boring main characters. There is no chemistry and little plot.Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing -- not up to JL's usual standards!","review":"I normally love JL's books, however, this one I really, really didn't like. First of all, it was difficult to get engaged with the story because both of the main characters were so unlikeable. The romantic \\"hero\\" is a man bent on revenge ... OK, I could deal with that. What I couldn't get past was this \\"hero\\" rapes and then later hits Corinne. I couldn't get past either of those acts and couldn't figure out why she would either. Corinne, however, decides to chase after her deserter husband and pose as a whore (after first deciding to adopt out her baby and then deciding to keep it but not tell Jared). By the time they both admitted to loving the other, my only question was \\"WHY?\\". Unlikeable characters, slow plot, unbelievable \\"romance\\" ... the only saving grace was a peek into Hawaii prior to/during the revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not romantic, full of anger","review":"There is a clear separation of Johanna Lindsey's earlier work from her more recent titles. This is one of her early books and was pretty awful. She spent a lot of time focused on the drama, but almost no time spent on the people, the emotions, the relationship. This book was filled with anger, revenge, etc. I had to force myself to continue through to the end of the book in order to make sure that it didn't ever get better. I thought I would at least feel some happiness at the conclusion, but even that was elusive. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My first JL book was Fires in Winter which I really enjoyed and thus made me want to read more of JL. I really enjoyed this one also. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed that it ended; not that it was a bad ending, it was a great ending, I just didn't want it to end.

This was not baked cheese in the least. It was a crunchy, salty, flavorless lump. There were only a few whole pieces in the bag and a couple of crumbs. Someone was not packing based on weight that day. I will eat real cheese any day. It is more filling to eat a chunk of real cheese.

The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about.

They don't taste that great either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Edible","review":"I was kind of excited about this product before it came in. I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot. I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust.

Can't wait to taste the \\"fried cheese.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crunch on a diet, but watch that salt!","review":"If you are watching your carbs, this is a great little snack, it's what it says it is... baked cheese. It's actually pretty good, but very salty.They come in these little bowl shaped discs about the size of a nickle in little 1/2 ounce bags. Great for control of what you are eating so you don't just pour a big bowl of them (and because they are so salty). They are super crunchy but disintegrate in your mouth pretty quickly.So far, I've tried the Wisconsin Cheddar and the White Cheddar version. The white cheddar is basically the same, just has a little more \\"bite\\" to it. I'll be looking at the lower salt and popped versions soon to change it up a little and maybe cut some of the salt.Worth a try if you are low carb or if you just want something a little more healthy than chips - they are pretty low calorie per bag as well, but the bags are pretty small. They satisfy my mid-day crunch cravings though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst snack I ever tasted!","review":"These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life. Dry as the Sahara Desert, not much taste, and way overpriced.

But they have more of a \\"processed\\" taste than I would have liked. I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag. I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to. The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese. Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors.

A lot of the space in each bag is air. I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.Flavorwise, they're alright. Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of. They're not amazing though. You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.

This is rather boring, it teaches basically 85 words and phrases in each language. They have characters say the words for you, but pronunciation is hard to mimic because they did not actually video tape the people saying the words. They video taped them in English, and then dub the sound over. You cannot tell where your lips are supposed to be, where your tongue should be or anything helpful for correct pronunciation. You do not learn how to order anything or conduct business. You learn \\"Where is the bank?\\" and \\"Where are the suitcases?\\" From there you could probably substitute other vocabulary words, but there are no activities in which you are asked to do so. There are no sentence formation activities. The only thing this is good for is a tiny collection of vocabulary with generic pronunciation instruction. If you have never heard a language before, it gives you something at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for price, but very limited","review":"This is a good program if you are going to a foreign country and would like to know a few words. But, each language is very limited. There is words like Thank you, you're welcome, yes, no, etc. I would reccomend this program for people who like to explore new languages, like me.

The product does not include the foreign words written in English letters, so that it's difficult to tell what they're saying.

Overall, a poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly basic, not worth your time or money","review":"I bought this application thinking it would teach me just the basic phrases I would need as a business traveler or as a tourist.

This was absolutely horrible. Looking back, I would not pay $1 for this. It teachs you a few words in each language. If it's a language that doesn't use the English alphabet, you can't look at the word to sound it out. The people aren't actually saying the words, so you can't watch their lips.

I should have read the previous review more carefully. While every lithograph, woodblock, linoblock and etching is LISTED in the text by title, year, edition number and size, only 62 prints are REPRODUCED in black and white. All reproductions are printed in small size, approx. 5\\" X 3\\". The print quality is very good as one can see small details. Sandzen left a large body of graphic works. I can only assume the publishers included his best western landscapes (mostly), botanicals, animals and portraits in this very slim volume. This is a shame because Sandzen was a major talent and influence as the short bio herein attests. A larger volume is warranted because he continues to be recognized as a leading printmaker/painter of a begone era (See Prairie Printmakers School and Broadmoor Colorado School).

However I felt the film never really came togather and the plot a little thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful enchanting tale about faith and trust","review":"The last sin eater is a story about faith, hardship, love, and greed. The main character is a little girl living in a small Appalachian cove that has endured the tragic loss of a kid sister whom she blames herself for her death. She has one true friend, a boy named Fagan, whose father is a sinful avaricious tyrant. Together, with the hand of God, they set out to make the terrible sins of the cove village people right. Don't want to give away to much... but it is a beautiful story that is suitable for all ages. This movie has not had much publicity, which saddens me deeply, for it is a magnificent captivating tale. The actors and the movie itself deserve much more. It is disappointing that we live in a time where movies like 8 mile and Jason receive Hollywood's attention. Perhaps that is why children like the sweet innocent kids portrayed in this movie no longer exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adaptation of the book","review":"I am a huge fan of Francine Rivers books so when I heard that one of my favorite books was being made into a movie, I was both excited and skeptical. So many times, a story doesn't live up to what the book before it did. But this was an exception. Michael Landon, Jr. did it justice. The feel of the book, kind of a dark, mystical existance for these people came through on screen to perfection. There was some disappointment in the building of certain characters, like Cali's mother but only so much can be done in a 2 hour movie when the book was so meaty. For those who haven't read the book, it may take a couple of viewings to pick up on all the details of the story but this is a very good film and watching it over and over, shouldn't be a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Even more surprisingly my husband enjoyed it also. We do not have small children at home but I'm sure any child over 10 would have understood the limited violence in the movie. It's dark moments were spooky not scary. This is definitely a movie based on Christianity and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Christian. The only thing I have to say poorly about it is that the accents were horrible. They were supposed to be Welsh but sounded like bad Irish accents. In fact the accents were so bad that the only actor who was Welsh sounded like he was speaking a different language than the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and Simplistic","review":"Simplistic and preachy with poorly executed \\"Welsh\\" accents.

There is no way that a film could contain the depth to equal the story as it unfolds on the page. However, this is worth a look see. The agony of the characters in gut-wrenching situations comes across and is well done. I found myself pulled into this sweeping, heart-breaking story that ends with hope. Fans of the book, those who haven't read it but would like to someday and those who are fascinated with ancient cultural customs may want to check out The Last Sin Eater. There are some intense scenes that might be too heavy for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Sin Eater","review":"Very good movie, wish the movie industry wood make more movies like this.

Cadi thinks she caused the death of her sister and needs the sin eater to eat her sins. She then meets a travelling preacher who tells her about Jesus.For such a bad story, the movie certainly goes on for far too long, at almost two boring hours and the acting doesn't make it any better. Liana Liberato (Cadi) is one of the few actors in the movie who do a decent job. The rest range from awkward to awful. Not even the great Louise Fletcher gives a good performance. The accent all sound fake; Henry Thomas is especially painful to hear.There is one scene towards the end that makes me give the movie a weak 2 star rating instead of one. Recommended only for fans of sentimental evangelical movies. Others should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars at most","review":"The Last Sin EaterI absolutely loved Francine Rivers book \\"The Last Sin Eater\\" I am also aware that movies made from books are seldom as good as the novel; However this film was a mess.

However as a movie it really falls short. My main problem with the movie was the accents of the actors (very fake and painful to listen to). I also think if the viewer has not read the book they will not understand the movie (my family did not get the movie AT ALL).

Take a look at some of the locations and magnificent scenery in The Last of The Mohicans.Understandably flavored a bit like Little House on the Prairie, and could have well stood on it's own, but with the truths of story line and wonderful talented actors, this movie is a hit worth time, money and sharing!Real truth in the story... The Old Story is ever wonderful still! K"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story with fabulous acting! Powerful movie.","review":"Since the closest theater where it was playing was in Tucson, we missed it at the box office. But my husband bought the DVD and it was fabulous! The acting was excellent, the movie was powerful, and the details followed the book very closely. I hadn't read the book since it came out about ten years ago, but was amazed at how much I recalled once I saw the film. The director was Michael Landon, Jr. and it was clear to me that he has talent. I haven't seen a better film with better acting than this one in years. In fact, I normally always like the books better but this one was so well done I think the movie brought out even more emotion than the book, and that is what makes it worth watching. If you haven't seen this movie yet, buy the DVD. I guarantee it will be a great investment. The redemption theme in so powerful it will take your breath away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"This is a great family movie!

Though Eitzel ended up leaving the progenitors of Sadcore with a great deal of bitterness and some unwarranted insults trailing behind him, he has yet to find backing capable of filling the void. Even his work with AMC, despite Tim Mooney of the Toiling Midgets on drums, is but a sad echo of his brief tenure as one of the many vocalists who have tried to integrate themselves into the sonic backdrop provided by Craig Gray's soul-rending guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"The clamp was the correct size but it only had one nut in the box and that nut was way to big to fit the clamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good biography of an industrious man","review":"John Pollock's biography of Dr. Nelson Bell is well researched and written in straightforward, easily understood prose. Dr. Bell led an unusually active life, being a missionary physician in China in the 1920s and 1930s when war, thieving, highway robbery, murder, and corruption were pervasive. Despite this, Dr. Bell and his wife managed to rear a family, expand the services of the hospital where they worked, make many friends, and give health care to many in need. As a surgeon, Dr. Bell operated on a variety of ailments, but it was the spiritual ills of the people that ultimately concerned him the most. War and ill health forced Dr. Bell to finish his medical career in North Carolina, where his daughter Ruth resided with husband Billy Graham (the evangelist) and where he, along with Graham, founded the magazine Christianity Today. He lived a long and highly productive life, and Pollock's rendering of it is done with engaging diplomacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto - This is as good as album-making gets","review":"No question one of the finest albums ever recorded.

I didn't want all the bells and whistles, just a good looking, easy to read, easy to set watch that keeps time and looks decent on my wrist. Only two small criticisms of this watch: (1) there's no backlight for reading it in the dark; (2) the date is pretty hard to read -- might not be a problem for younger folk with better eyes, but the dial for the date is so small that it's sometimes difficult to tell which number it's pointing to.

The date dial is extremely difficult to read and can only be set by rotating hour hands 720 degrees to advance the date by a single day! The other two smaller dials are essentially useless. With no lighting, you must depend on the faintly luminous hour and minute hands in the dark.A month after receiving the watch, I threw the box and directions away (necessary for a return) and the watch began to start and stop sporadically. I'd just throw it away, but I've got to figure out how to easily dispose of the mercury battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this watch!","review":"OK, I bought the watch from Amazon figuring it was only $25 and that it looked pretty decent. I probably won't return it because... it was only $25 and that's not really worth the effort of returning. But after a couple of days of wearing it, I've set it aside and won't wear it again.Here's why:1) It's fat! Really really thick. Looks a little ridiculous. Feels heavy and out of place on my wrist2) It's way too complicated. Try to set it without the manual? Impossible. And why in the world do you have to set the hands separately from the digital display? That seems ridiculous to me, like there's a good reason to have the analog and digital displays show different time for most users? Lazy design.3) I'm not going to use most of the features, especially as they'd require me to carry the manual around with me.Now I know. For me, a watch needs to be thin, elegant, and simple. This is the opposite: fat, ostentatious, and complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"This is a fine watch except for the band. I've had mine for about a year. The cheap resin band is cracked where it passes through the buckle and is about break at the slightest strain. I went to Wal-Mart (where I bought it) to buy a band. None of the available bands would work due to the odd configuration of the watch body. I called Casio and learned that their proprietary bands are not available in retail stores and that I would have to order it from Casio - almost 22 dollars, including shipping. I'm left to wonder if this is a deliberate ripoff strategy or poor product design."},{"rating":"1","title":"good watch,very hard to see the smaller dials","review":"i like many of you dont like a watch thats all plastic. and amazon needs to come up with better filtered search results. i searched through almost five thousand watches to find one that had an all metal stainless steel case. this one looked nice and what attracted me to it was the fancy extra dials. i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive. a watch for dress occasions. the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark. which i believe it should have, the smaller dials are extremely hard to read, you almost need a magnifying glass to read them.5 stars for the fact that its all metal. 2 stars for the fact that it badly needs a light and the smaller dials are hard to see.overall, its a good analogue watch to have. and its metal, not resin plastic that the majority of watches are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less than $30...","review":"When I decided to buy this watch I said...

However, this is about 5 years later now, and I ran across this CD in the bargain bin. Excited to listen and recall that enjoyable evening experience, I was let down quickly. It's just so boring. Having listened to much more interesting stuff like Theatre of Tragedy, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and even Left Hand Solution, this doesn't even come close.

The film quality is right there with the first season. On packaging -- Season 1 looks like a book, and each \\"page\\" has a description of each episode including each guest appearance, and the date it was shown originally. The 2nd season doesn't have pictures on every holding page like the 1st season does (subsequent seasons are packaged like season 2). The interview of James Drury was exactly the same as the 1st season interview. On the plus side, there is an interview with Clu Gulager.I'm a long-time Virginian fan, and even have the Owen Wister book. I know I will continue buying every season offered. I'm even writing my own season 2 episode descriptions with guest appearances so I'll know where to locate each episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virginian Season Two","review":"I have season one and now season two. I truly enjoy the show length allowing character and story development (I think a principal reason for it's initial long run on TV). The restored and digitally remastered video/sound is very good.Although some reviewers like the season two packaging (multiple plastic hinged DVD carriers) better than season one, I prefer season one's book like package with title, air date, featured guest and short story description for each DVD jacket.

The songs feel thin in production and the electronic edge lacks the sort of originality that one sensed in \\"No One Song In Heaven\\" (which I never really liked but could appreciate for those who like that sort of synth-rock)It feels like they were trying to get back a bit of their 1970s sound but without giving up the euro-pop feel. And the result falls between two stools and simply doesn't really work.It's only an album to buy for completeness if you're a diehard fan and feel so inclined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.

His lyrics are a beautiful fusion of peyote poetry and barroom blather. But it is his guitar work and songrwriting that carry the day. Think of a style (punk, psychedelia, straight-ahead rock n roll) and Gelb plays it. The mood of these songs is dark and angry, but never cliched or off-putting. Way back in '84 and '85, when desert rock meant something, Giant Sand delivered. This music is so unique I cannot think of three or four different groups to reference. This is as strange and beautiful as a datura plant, poison and perfume. Brilliant.PS--This release lacks one of my fave Sand tunes from the same period, \\"Barrio\\".

This brand and no other. So I ordered enough for the class. There was some issue with the shipping, which after talking to the company, they had reason to believe all or many of their shipments were incorrect that day. I called days after shipment should have arrived. The customer service representative was great, but couldn't do much. The lost product was now out of stock and then backordered. After waiting another week and a half (and getting flack from my class), I called back and the items were now backordered because their stock didn't arrive on time. I asked for and easily received a refund, but that didn't help my case.Moral of the story - apparently it is a great product, but the company has some logistics to iron out. Pay attention to the quantities and \\"arrive by\\" dates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilates ball","review":"I love this little ball! It is the perfect size and has just enough give to be comfortable.

The mini air pump is a piece of junk --- came with no instruction at all, and a needle that can not be fitted to the pump. The ball looks bad as well --- well as you cannot use the pump as they advertised, you have to use a straw to inflate it.I'm so disappointed with these products that I want to return them -- however, I was told by the C.R. that I'm not going to be refunded for the freight cost ($6.49) and I have to ship it back out of my own pocket --- and you can imagine how cheap the company is.

It really did help me focus on core muscles, unfortunately my 5 year old daughter really tested it for me. After one good bounce on the ball it popped beyond repair. I understand that these balls are not meant for this kind of abuse, but I did feel a little uncomfortable using it for exercise at my weight. I really don't want to spend $13 every time a little too much pressure is applied. I've bought exercise balls at Walmart that could put up with more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilates Ball, just OK","review":"The ball works as it is supposed to and it is certainly cheaper than the Bender Ball. Kind of silly how you have to blow it up with a straw( I used a pump from other balance balls) and it always deflates a little when you place the pin. Actually, a children's plastic ball that you buy at the supermarket works just as well and costs a whole lot less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic Words for All Pastors!","review":"This book is simply a must-read for all pastors. Other church leaders would benefit from it as well, but pastors in America today NEED to read this title. Piper pulls no punches as he addresses the professionalism that is draining the godly passion and Biblical piety from clergy across all denominations. His candor is refreshing and reviving. His words are directed not to the minister's head, but to his heart.I am aware of no equal to this book by any other contemporary authors -- I am not aware of anything even close! Not since Spurgeon's \\"Letters to My Students\\" has there been such a useful, practical and godly resource which addresses the devotional heart and habits of the minister of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all pastors","review":"This book is written first of all by one of America's greatest pastors.He deals with issues that futre pastors may encounter in ministry but strictly through the word of God. John Piper looks at these issues through a servants heart rather than the eye of one who pastors asa profession. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Radical? Then Let's live this way.","review":"It made me sick to read the other reviews of this book by people who most likely struggle in the areas that Piper is calling all Pastors to engage more radically in. Like prayer, reading, etc... If more of us pastors lived our lives devoted to prayer and reading of scripture we would certainly make a mark on this world. Unfortunately most of us don't have the robust, dare I say \\"radical\\" faith that Piper calls us to and so we take our spot on the powerless sidelines of the cultural dialogue. Piper is calling us to something great if we only lived what we believe about prayer and scripture then maybe we would be empowered to engage and penetrate our hurting world. But I suppose this to will sound trite and simple to those with no character. Let's buck up, get on our horse and live like Jesus, This is what Piper is calling us to, Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Godward Life, the pastor's version.","review":"Those familiar with Piper's work will find no surprises in this book. That is not disappointing, but wonderful.This is a collection of 30 articles, some of which were written for the GBC magazine, that Piper has written to church leaders. Those of us who have subscribed to his email sermon series and read his \\"fresh words\\" will see some old friends here. All the better. This material deserves to be seen by everyone in vocational ministry.Powerful and pithy, Piper delivers 30 easy-to-read, important-to-do challenges from the bible for today's Pastors. Challenge, reminder, encouragement all find healthy dosage within this book.If you can't wait to read his forthcoming \\"Counted Righteous In Christ\\" book, there's a teaser in one of the chapters.The book also represents a slight shift as Piper uses the English Standard Version as his main bible. Those with their ear to the ground on such matters saw it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers We Are Not Professionals","review":"After reading one of the reviews that claimed this work was not radical, I had to add my two cents worth. The entire text is radical if actually put into use. But Chapters 4-7 are life transforming. Not that it is entirely new stuff, but as is John Piper's gift, he gives us (pastoral workers and hungry Christians of all callings) new ways of seeing. The chapter on the \\"begger mentality\\" is worth all the treasures of earth. I have already given it to a young man pursuing seminary.Greg Bailey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rehash of Familiar Material, But Still a Good Read","review":"Piper's book focuses on the call to pastors to see the ministry as a calling instead of a business. While I have read similar material in other books, Piper's book is still a good read.Among the topics he covers include:1. Do not put your trust in man. Fear God instead.2. We are dependent on God - our job is to wait for Him and let Him work mighty things through us as He chooses.3. We cannot produce fruit apart from God. Time spent in prayer is not wasted time.4. Good thoughts on the importance of reading good books.5. The dangers of legalism.6. Our afflictions can be used to comfort others.7. Live a simple lifestyle so that others may simply live.8. Pastoral ministry is serious business.While the book's contents may be familiar to several readers, it doesn't hurt to be reminded periodically of the basics, lest we stray from the faith.All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so radical","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book has plenty of good stuff in it. However, it is hardly an exhortation to for radical pastoral ministry that departs from a professional mentality. I kept reading this book anticipating I'd eventually read something radical... but never did. Because of this, reading the book was often very painful. Because of this, I rate it as low as I do with only 2 stars.As Leonard Ravenhill? said: we would not think many ministers to be great if they were not announced to us as so. Fact of the matter is, many would not think this book to be \\"radical\\" if it were not presented to us as so.Very little of this book even really touches on the issue of \\"professionals.\\" Nothing really radical here. Some good exhortations in general, but there are better.

Very few animes make a great tv series, but this one is a masterpiece. It covers about every subject concerning humanity and the line between it and the machine age the story is set in possible. It also does not hold back on the money for the top notch animation during the show with lush details and vibrant backgrounds throughout the show. From the start of the show to the end you never really know what is coming and even if you think have it figured out, the writers throw a massive curveball at you. I won't ruin the story for anyone, but I will say it is one of the most well written pieces of work I have ever seen.

However, at the same time, he probably spends too much time on the English history that gave our forefathers the basis for their decisions in the formation of our independent states which gave birth to the national government. Perhaps more space could have been devoted to the intermost thoughts of our founders. It is unfortunate that very few Americans have been taught the truth of the right of secession that our founders reserved to the states and how many of the warnings by some of the federalists about national government power have become true, which beganconsistent movement with the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Constitution","review":"I find this book to be very well written, and well documented.

The Constitution of the United States of America specifically states in a number of places that no state or citizen can form another nation without the consent of the Congress, if at all. By concluding that Southern secession was Constitutional, the author loses credibilty. There are other ways to \\"justify\\" the secession that led to the Civil War, but the Constitution is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes and incorrect info in this book","review":"In this book the author states that he interviewed me, included quotes as well. I never met nor talked with Mr. Thompson, even though he writes that he interviewed me in my \\"Palm Beach home\\". I've never lived in Palm Beach. He claims to have talked with my father. That meeting never took place. Alas, if this part of the book was fiction, where's the credibility to prove that the rest is true? Too many \\"confidential sources\\". Using that as a crutch you can say anything about anyone. I know the many truths in Jack Nicholsons real story and from what I can tell, Peter Thompson has fallen short on uncovering and perhaps even knowing what the truth is. By the way, biologically speaking, I am Mr. Nicholson's half sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Jack Nicholson Book","review":"Alright...I just barely got into Jack Nicholson for some strange reason, and I find him a fascinating individual.

Not only does he amaze me every time he acts, the very personality this book describes him to have is amazing.

This book does not address the gagging with ALL foods that can occur when baby has real physical problems preventing him from eating when he wants to.

Why else do people continue to buy and listen to music that could barely make the charts more than 30 years ago?

In brighter scenes, you can barely see any detail of some of the characters' faces (this is evidence that the original source was a dupe of a positive print rather than a positive print made from a negative) and this probably explains the poor sound as well.

The directions were clear which made it easy for me to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Most important is to take time to look at how to use media player (video already on player) because it makes everything easy. I bought this because it could lock while playing and this is so important for my autistic daughter. Liking it more and more though wish I could prolong the life of the battery"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Philips PMC","review":"I have really enjoyed this device. For whatever reason it did not come with the software for it. After reading reviews and using it, I guess that was a good thing. I have Vista and did not have a bunch of problems downloading video. The only thing I do not care for is that when I use Vista it put everything I had in the media center on my PMC. I did go in and remove what I did not want. Also, downloading from Amazon--Unboxed video and TIVO-converting to the smaller format is a bit slow and the licenses had to be checked too much. But the device is high quality in sound and picture and easy to use-I have listened to ipod and other mp3 players and it has the best sound. I had my first chance to use it on a plane, yesterday, and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips Media Player","review":"So far I've found the Phillips Media player to be great! One disadvantage is that you have to convert YouTube videos to jpeg with a second software application before converting them to the player, but this isn't that much trouble.

I gave it 4 stars because, like most people, I tried to use the Arcsoft software and it took 8 hours to put 1 movie on it and then it didn't even work. I did some research and found a program called CloneDVD Mobile. The longest time it has taken to put a whole movie on it was 48 minutes. Most took only 30 to 35 minutes. I can't say enough about this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little gadget","review":"This item is great for storing and playing media; especially for travelers.

Each song is a masterpiece and John Lennon did a brilliant job producing it. The songs were written by Yoko to reflect stages in her relationship with John and they are incredibly powerful. The performances by familiar and famous artists really take the work to an exciting level. It was the last album John worked on before he died, making it all the more poignant and valuable. I love this album. The title comes from the song John performs on the album, \\"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\\". It's achingly beautiful. Too bad this album is no longer widely available. I wish everyone could own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah!","review":"This product is definately not worth it's weight. I'd much rather purchase HP brand name ink cartridges.

The song gained popularity back in the 1970s, and was a top country single. And, it was so big that it was featured in the hit video game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' in 2004.And, she got a her own compilation in Madacy's 'Golden Legends' series. They take 14 legendary songs from your career and put them on a CD for a low price. Sounds great, right?Wrong. These are RE-RECORDED VERSIONS AND ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS!!! This shows a lack of effort on Madacy's part. And, the sound quality is very poor.No wonder this is so cheap! Do yourself a favor and buy the originals. But avoid this one at all costs.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"prose from a great literary figure","review":"A good selection of prose from T. S. Eliot. After years of reading, I still find his prose more effective and more useful than his poetry. (I know -- sheer heresy.)

It is of very poor quality and the hat is really not at all like the photo. In the photo, the hat looks like the brim would be stiff and the red stitches actually look like stitches. The actual hat that you get is floppy and not at all stiff and the red stitches do not even look like stitches. I ordered a size larger than my daughter normally wears and it is still almost too small. The material feels like it would rip quite easily. Overall, I would not recommend this costume.

Minus 4 stars for remastering (or lack of). The material is the cream of the crop Ellington, but the people who remastered this tried to get too much clarity and the end result is distortion. Definitive releases are usually a good bargain but this is a complete waste of money.Buy the \\"Never No Lament\\" compilation. It's also has suffered the overuse of the original masters but it's the best you can get.Where's JT Davies on this one? RCA probably would let him near these recordings 'cause then we'd have affirmation that most remastering is pretty average.Add One star for the tracks here that are Columbia issues and they are impossible to find elsewhere(Hello Columbia...not everyone wants the Complete...

I liked the dialogue, the characters, everything. I want to read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This was the first work of this author that I have read, and plan to read more. Strike that, I definitely plan to read more. I was captivated by the characters right away and found it intriguing that Ms. Becnel put Lucy at age 28. I know, I know, most Regency ladies are married at very young ages. But it was refreshing to see that a slightly older woman could find the love of her life when she has life figured out, not at a naive 19 or 20.So in all, a good sexy read. Character depth is good too, and you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"Gimme a break! It was slow in the beginning, good in the middle and down right painful in the end! Ms. Becnel does a good job with a plausable romance as far as the characters go in the beginning. But by the end of the book there is no way she would continue to love him. He abandons her completely and she keeps making excuses for him. He never makes amends. Finally on the last page he admits his love, but never truly apoligizes for disrespecting her and hurting her. Plus the heroine is supposed to be so outspoken that she could never find a man to truly love. When she finally does fall in love with this difficult man, she becomes spineless. She lets him walk all over her. Not to mention the terrible ending that's supposed to be a tear-jerker and ends up being just stupid. Not even that event caused him to tell her he loved her. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, if a little slow at the beginning","review":"I thought this book was really wonderful. All though, it was a little slow in the beginning. It seemed to drag for the first 75 pages or so, but after that, it picked up and I couldn't put it down. I guess I am just lucky that I got to the \\"good\\" part after I got home from work. This book sure beats the painting that I was supposed to do tonight.

I can only assume the seller posted that. There is not much in the details here. While it shows the blender in the image and items frequently bought together - when you get to the product detail it tells you of a blender metal shaft that fits models this or that and M5550 , the review talks about whisk attachments and voltage ratings. No where in the descriptions does it mention anything like that. I can understand people being misled to thinking this is the blender and not just the attachment for the blender. It became much more clear what was being sold - looking on the review page. If you are looking for a BLENDER - this is not the blender but an attachment for one.

I do drive about 40 miles a day in my car, but I have had much better success with meguires and even eagle one.

His song \\"Turnaround\\" plays three times in the disc, including the end and the gallery of pictures during the filming. Stan could have written that song for Terry Fox, although he recorded it long before the Marathon of Hope.I have always like Anne Murray, so I thought I'd take a chance, if anything to get that title song.

Good ones include \\"Tin Can Sailor\\" and \\"The Cruel Sea\\" -- NOT \\"Riding on Luck\\". Its flowery writing is a bit too \\"rah-rah, here we go!\\" and doesn't back it up with compelling prose. The author tells you it was exciting, but doesn't show you -- not surprising since he wasn't there. Knight, the son of a Lang sailor, manages to make even cruises with FDR aboard boring and dull, and he fails to describe the destroyer in any real detail. The author provides a backdrop of the war while the Lang is at sea, and I found these explanations a nice try, but overly simplistic. The last straw was bad grammar, dropped words and other printing errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous music for parents and babies","review":"This is one of my most treasured CDs from when my three children were infants and toddlers; in fact, I would go so far as to call it the soundtrack of my beloved babies' infancies.

Add to these and others some traditional folk lullabies and some beautiful original compositions by pianist Brian Finley, and you have the ideal accompaniment to quiet times with your young child.

The book gives countless examples of both classic and contemporary films demonstrating practical application of sound theories.The information in the book has been of great value to me in my film work and to several students I know from USC School of Cinema-TV and its Summer Production Workshops.

What you get with SOUND for Film and Television is like a condensed instruction manual for the study, technical names and mechanics screwed together with lazy, careless language. Forget skipping through to the middle to read up on a particular microphone, the crammed description will be completely composed of references to complex information from past chapters. You will have to read it through, as arduous (and potentially impossible) as the task may be, to access any of the valuable details buried within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use carefully - I had a bad burning reaction to this cream","review":"I strongly recommend you use this once and then wait a few days to see how your skin copes with it - it's very strong. My dermatologist recommended this to treat dark under-eye circles and for the first few days I used it, the colour and texture of my skin did seem to be improving, then the skin itching and going red, and I had a strong burning sensation. I couldn't go out for a week it got so red and sore, and got worse even in the few days after I stopped using the product. I told my doctor, who said reactions like this were unheard of - I must have been using too much, he said. A few months later I tried again, a single application of a TINY bit. My eyes looked better within hours but two days later (with no further usage) they were burning again, so I won't be using it any more. I may well be an unusual case but I recommend you use it with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reaction","review":"I also had a bad reaction to \\"hypoallergenic\\" NeoStrata PHA 4. Initially, I really loved this cream because it went on smoothly, not greasy, no perfumy smell, etc. The next two days, however, sucked with a *maddening* itch, irritation, redness, puffiness, and even little blisters or something of that nature. The upper lids experienced the worst of it all - even had to sleep with a cool washcloth at my bedside.

Sure it's got lots of clipart, but this does not make up for the poor text handling, humungous file sizes, and the ever-so-slow speed (redraw times are particulary snail-like). Plus, it crashes a little too much for my liking.Bottom line is, industry-standard Adobe still does everything better than Corel, so why bother adopting a new learning curve for inferior results?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just a little voice.....","review":"THis album is fantastic. I could go on and on about how amazing it is, but I will spare your eyes. :) This review is mainly for the bonus track that you get with this edition of the CD, Any Way the Wind Blows.

Her music and voice move me each and every time I hear them. While \\"Love Song\\" is a great pop song, and deserves it's popularity, songs like \\"Between the Lines\\", \\"City\\" and \\"Gravity\\" begin to show you the true heart, soul and talent of Sara Bareilles. Every song on Disc 1 is great. Disc 2 has interviews and acoustical performances of some of her best songs. This is a great CD set and should not be missed. Buy her \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" DVD too. It's amazing. She makes several references to how much love she feels in the room, you'll feel it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE SARA BAREILLES","review":"This is currently my favorite cd. I discovered this amazing artist through iTunes, and once I fell in love with her Single, \\"Love Song\\" I knew that I had to pre-order my copy of Little Voice. I'm so glad I bought it. I would classify her as kind of jazzy pop. It's a lot of amazing vocals, piano, and pretty bass lines. I was just a little disappointed that the majority of the cd is slower songs, but they're still really nice arrangements. I would say she covers a few genres however. My favorite of her songs, \\"Love Song\\" is ilke pop, whereas her upbeat song, \\"Many the Miles\\" is very gospal- like. This is a good buy. If you like her sound, then you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome","review":"I first heard Sara in concert in a small venue in Seattle with my husband.

At the end of the article, it said download \\"Love Song\\". So, when I got home, I listened to about 2 seconds of it, said \\"what the heck?\\" and bought it. Turns out, it was a GREAT song. Then, I decided to check out the rest of her album, and, turns out, \\"Love Song\\" wasn't the best on there!! The entire album is totally worth it.She sounds a *little* like like Fiona Apple, I guess because of the sound of their voices, but other than that, their styles are *completely* different.

Deservedly, these women have been somewhat pooled together as far as the marketing aspect goes--what I find that they all have in common is accessible (but entirely forgettable) styles of writing, and average, nondescript pleasant voices. I understand the music industry has waves and cycles--consider these girls post-post Lilith Fair fare. Sadly, though, none of these artists have the vocal chops and writing skills of Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, or Fiona Apple (all of whom have survived the chick/folk/alt. wave of the mid/late 90s--and for good reason). In a year or two, none this new crowd will be remembered. May I recommend some female artists that ARE making music that stands out: Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Kosheen, Thea Gilmore, Zoe Johnston, and Carla Werner.

I bought it for \\"Love Song\\" and had gotten tired of hearing it on the radio. I assumed (you know what they say) that the rest would be pop treacle. Boy was I wrong!This album is sweet and spicy and multi-layered. It's jazzy and bluesy and sophisticated and intelligent. Just when you think you know where it's going it takes you in a completely different direction, much better than the one that you anticipated.

I am so glad that I purchased this cd and would highly recommend it to everyone. Definately a 5 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Mix","review":"I have to say I really like the songwriting and the performance on this CD.

I expect more surprises coming from this fine and becoming artist in the future. Sara Bareilles's LITTLE VOICE CD is actually heard in a magnetically loud voice. Her songs are strong and uplifting as well as real as can be without the punching bag lyrics. I give her high accolades for this effort. Most songwriting (music) today have a lot of punching bag aura. * * * * *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic surprise","review":"This is an amazing collection of music by someone new.

I like some of the pop I hear on the radio and Love Song was what drew me to Sara Bareilles. I then checked out a few of her videos on the internet and found something much deeper to this artist.I bought the CD and I have to admit I love it more with each listen. There are times I hear a bit of Sarah McLaughlin, some Beth Neilsen Chapman, some Ricki Lee Jones. In all while she may remind me of others she has a unique sound all her own that draws you in with the strength of her voice and song writing.Don't count on much else being a hit on the radio but get this album for what the substance it has to offer beyond a catchy hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this cd.

Sending back ASAP. The top is not as sturdy as the one it would be replacing, a Targus, about the same size that I've only gotten 5 months out of. My laptop is a lightweight Acer and the top of the cooler flexed enough that when I put the laptop on the fan, it pushed into the fans making even more noise. If you received one that was not damaged or defective, I hope it works for you, but I don't imagine it would hold up long even if it had worked perfectly upon receipt, so I have asked for a refund rather than a replacement. Very disappointed that I'm having to spend money to replace damaged or defective goods.

It's not just a \\"bzzz\\" sound that normal fans make, but it's more disturbing, like something were stuck in the fans. At first I could turn it over and move it around a little to make the noise go away, but after a while I could do nothing to prevent it. The only solution I could find was to put a little piece of cardboard to stop the fans from moving..I just left one working, which is the one right underneath the battery. Since there's only 1 fan, heat dissipation is ineffective, and this fan has also started to make the same weird noise again. Once the last fan fails I am going to buy a better one, maybe more expensive, but definitely more worth the money than this one. This fan doesn't deserve a cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well, but....","review":"I've only had this product for a little bit, but I'm already sending it back.

And, its especially good for a New Yorker or someone planning a trip to New York, because we will follow the book with a field trip to the Statue of Liberty. Oh, and even though it's called L is for Liberty, it is not an alphabet book. I would have given it five stars but my son enjoyed it once and didn't ask to hear it again.

We thought it was kind of corny and the acting really phony and really bad (especially the pompous horse's behind that talks about the hydraulic hammer), but when our oldest son came home on leave from the military and overheard the audio from our kitchen, he thought we had lost our minds and let the little one watch a porn video. After watching and listening again, yes, the dialog could be taken from a X-rated video and the music, our older one told us, definately sounded like porn music. Its almost as if a porn company is trying to go legit and not succeeding very well. We'll save this one after the little one outgrows it and joke with him about it 20 years from now.

Unfortunately, the book was a huge disappointment.The idea for this book was that the author would take a season off from his job and his editor would finance an account of the 1979 baseball season from a fan's perspective. What resulted, however, was little more than the journal of a neurotic, and a not very interesting neurotic at that. The author continually mentions his shyness, and this gets boring after awhile. His inability to talk to ballplayers severely handicapped this effort.The author's first publisher bailed out toward the end of the season. Seven years later he found another publisher and the book got published, but it wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerns about \\"Calculus: A Modern Approach\\"","review":"I own this book. It dives straight into derivatives and continues on from there - a very steep dive indeed for anyone new to the subject. In my opinion it proceeds with excessively complex explanations of what should be easily comprehended concepts of calculus. It may, in my opinion, be suitable for the calculus-adept student or teacher but falls significantly short in any attempt to teach the subject to a novice. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone attempting to understand calculus on his or her own (i.e. beginners). If this method is considered a modern approach, then perhaps we should fall back to methods that have turned fewer newcomers off to the subject. Consider \\"Calculus Made Easy\\" by Silvanus P. Thompson and \\"Teach Yourself Calculus\\" by Hugh Neil instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine diverse horror collection","review":"This eighteen story horror collection features tales that first appear in this book though some will have probably reappeared elsewhere since. As were the cases of the previous two collections, SHIVERS III runs the gamut of horror from the supernatural to the psychological to the suspense. Douglas Clegg makes his third appearance with several newcomers to the series like Wrath James White provide entries. None of the contributions are sub par. Especially extraordinary are Meggan C and F Paul Wilson's \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\", Thomas Monteleone's \\"Horn of Plenty\\" (Satchmo - enough said) and the haunting \\"This, That's the End of It\\" by Tom Piccirilli.

And if you saw Jesus is his last fight against Erik Morales, you'll know after seeing Split Decision that he has shown the same courage in his personal life as he has in the ring - He fought toe to toe with one of the top five fighters in the world with ONLY ONE ARM for the better part of ten rounds.

She states that male-dominated religions (especially Christianity) are responsible for the atrocities committed against women over the past 2-3 thousand years (a true enough fact) but then proceeds to encourage a view so far to the opposite extreme by encouraging a purely feminist/matriarchal worldview that she completely discounts any male contributions are possible unless he is thouroughly rooted in the feminine. Overall, she understands the history of what paganism/ goddess worship is rooted in but completely misses the belief that equal contributions come from both women and men which, when in balance, benefit all of society."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I found this book used, and am glad I didn't pay full price for it.First, most of it is Christian bashing, pointing out errors and fallacies in the Bible. If the Goddess movement is to become a religion in its own right, then we must stop basing OUR religion on someone else's. It doesn't matter what Christians believe. If they are comfortable with their religion then it doesn't matter if I may percieve some of the ideas as outdated or childish.Secondly, she seemed to spend a lot of time recounting arugments she had with \\"lesser intellects\\" on the subject of religion, all of which she ultimately won. She's never wrong, nor does she ever admit that she had to change her mind on a subject.

Original source material is summarized and analyzed in comparison to other viewpoints, particularly across time. Anyone with further interest in particular areas of culture could skim the footnotes to find the complete citations for the original material.

Unfortunately I thought it would help me even though I am an adult. I had a hard time relating to the stories of the girls/women in the book.

This book needs to be read by mothers who are in denial, heartless fathers and fathers who may not be around very much longer, and by all daughters, even if their relationship with their fathers were great. Chances are, we've all experienced abandonment, even if ever so slight. What most women don't understand, just as I hadn't before I read the book, is that even the slightest feeling of abandonment snowballs and grows into something bigger then we all would like. By then, however, it's almost too insurmountable to deal with. It's worth dealing with, though. Learn from me: don't hold anything in. I did for at least 16 years, and it did more harm then good.

Seven great cuts and one average, best rocked up renditions of It Hurt's Me Too, Chevrolet and Sweet Home Chicago you'll ever hear make this album a Blues/Rock must own. Now add Stone Blue, Midnight Madness, Easy Money and High On Love for some harder edge and you have a GREAT album. This album is in my top 25 list. Hear it, buy it. For other Foghat material worth owning check out the new DVD, Fool For The City, Live II and the latest with Charlie Huhn on vocals Family Joules."},{"rating":"2","title":"very rockin' Foghat album","review":"This is a noticeably harder rock album than Foghat had ever made previously. The sound has a harder edge to it, and has a pretty fast pace. It still has a blues base, but they seem to be drifting a bit from their blues base here. Mind you, it's still a good Foghat album, just different from \\"Night Shift\\" - a little less bluesy, and little more rocking. Still full of slide guitar, as we have come to expect from Foghat - slide guitar is really their signature sound.My favorite cuts on this album are \\"Stone Blue\\", \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\", and the ballady \\"It Hurts Me Too\\". This last one is an interesting one; it starts out as a ballady type song, and, later on, starts to \\"light up\\" as Rod Price cranks on the slide guitar.\\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" is an old blues song, but Foghat really lights a fire under it. It's one of my favorite Foghat tunes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but lacked regional information","review":"This book was good for a 'getting to know you' on certain types of animals, however, it lacked many specific regional animals and it didn't clearly state where the animals were located.

However his ideas were possibly too fruitful often colliding with each other rather then meshing, leaving the story line in tatters.The concept of the \\"Hail A Lama\\" taxi cabs were a stroke a brilliance that could be the basis for an entire novel. However in MIR it is only given a quickly discarded backstory and then used as impersonal plot continuation device. The character's backstories were often just as rashly introduced in brief flashbacks only to be basically ignored. Thus leaving the characters feeling as if they were only hollow pivot points for a runaway plot.

Not only does it frame the debate about the likelihood of life on Mars, but also does a great job of explaning our changing understanding of the planet.It also conveys a sense of Mars as a real place, and discusses how the meaning of Mars changes depending on our sense of whether or not we think there is life there.Finally, it asks a crucial question: what do we mean by \\"nature\\" and how tied up is that notion with \\"life\\"?And it has cool pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well balanced and engaging modern cultural history of Mars","review":"I bought this book on a whim after getting interested in Mars colonization after reading Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, to which Dr. Morton's book is an excellent non-fiction counterpoint. Not only does he set forth a well-spoken, engaging exposition of the 20th century's cultural and scientific history of Mars, he balances this with a keen sense of the limitations of human knowledge, telling his story in the context of real, live human figures at the forefront of Mars exploration.The central theme, of maps and how they relate to place - and furthermore, how we relate to those maps and places - sets off an easily read story of what Mars has meant to recent society, how scientists have shaped that understanding, and how that understanding is both formed and limited by our extended observers, the robot orbiters and landers that we've sent to our red neighbor.Highly recommended reading both for historical and cultural interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I saw the comments that said there were no English subtitles","review":"The series is great, so if you speak Spanish don't pass this up.

Cartoons are listed alphabetically with date and (very) brief credits along with a one or two line review. Although not as in depth as the B&F book it does cover cartoons from all the studios. Fine, but although it covers all the studios it doesn't cover all the cartoons! The introduction tells us that it covers all types of animation (drawn, puppet, computer etc) but only that available on videotape or on TV & Cinema release now or recently. So why doesn't it mention Carrotblanca or Box Office Bunny? Both recent Bugs Bunny cartoons. It has the feeling of an amateur book, a listing of someone's personal collection that doesn't include stuff he doesn't have. I'm sure a book that lists every cartoon ever made by anyone is a practical impossibility but this kind of book (especially at this kind of price) needs to be far more comprehensive than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plue plue go go plue","review":"i think the game is better than the anime but not as good as the manga. i bought but should have just played it at my freinds house [he bought it] and then see if i liked it. i belive that you all will like it though. i rAD IN THE BACK OF VOL. 1 THAT IT WAS A GAME AND BOUGHT IT RIGHT AWAY.

I have all his CDs, and have gleaned other favorite songs from each one, but this is the one CD that I can listen to start to finish, and love them all, just as they are. Listen for the seagulls crying in 'Bluenose', listen for the incredible drive and urgency of the final verse of 'Mary Ellen Carter', and from this farmer - listen to 'Field Behind the Plow' and know that it is true.

I was so disappointed in Liams and Rowans lack of feeling or expression of it. The flipant attitudes of the characters suprised me and by the end of the book I thought was a waste of time.

I can usually finish a category romance in an evening, and this took me several days because I kept putting it aside. I found the hero not very heroic, the heroine was showing a lot more angst than her situation called for (so was the hero, IMHO) and the hero's parents were more deus ex machina than real characters.

I loved her 3 other books in this series so much that I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. However, this one is a total disappointment to me. I hate the hero in the story. How anyone can fall in love with a guy whose morality is so low that he turns into a wolf to watch a woman undress and bath and have sex with her in her dreams without her knowledge and consent is beyond me. It is a waste of my time, money and energy. I should have believed some of the earlier reviewers here instead of thinking \\"it can't be that bad\\".

Their style owes a lot to earlier bands like the Kinks, the Byrds and Alex Chilton, you can certainly hear a link between the db's and later Replacements on \\"Like This\\".For some reason this album is a rarity nowadays, which is a shame. For my money this is the best of the db's albums, less new wavish and a more rocking sound. From \\"L is for Lovers\\" to \\"Darby Hill\\" there's not a clunker on the whole album.The standouts are \\"Lonely is as Lonely Does\\" and the great \\"Amplifier\\" a song for anyone who's had a bad breakup.

He prefers not to use the aid of a cane, and does not, like the stereotypical blind man, wear dark glasses.

Let me tell you something: this guy is NOT BLIND. Every time I've seen him he's been strolling casually, sometimes with a friend, with NO cane, NO dog, nothing. He doesn't bump into lamposts or fences; he just moves slowly. Of course, he's a terrific writer and everyone should buy his book immediately. But I just want to say, he's not blind, and he deserves a lot of respect for pulling off this elaborate hoax. It seems like a very Slackjaw thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who think 'barfly' is an adverb...","review":"Bukowski lovers will hate this book, as it apes the old man's style without any of the payoff. Bukowski haters should therefore love it, as a grim reminder of the late poet's poisonous influence on a generation of writers. This \\"memoir\\" (actually, a lightly-revised collection of articles from a free weekly paper), with its incessant barstool intellectual pretenses, reminds us that the epitaph of the postmodern writer was first written in those classic tuna fish ads of yore: we need less books with good taste, and more that simply taste good.

If you love Mandy Patinkin and Berandette Peters as much as I do your heart will not be the same after experianceing their performances. If you are not familiar with the painting \\"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Le Grand Jate\\" it is an exquisite giant painting all done with pointalism (using tiny dots) to create a gorgeous scene of different people at a park as a period piece.

Mandy, Bernadette, and all the cast does a magnificent job and, trust me, it translates on-screen. I have seen this DVD countless times and everyone of those times the story greatly moves me. Also, the commentary is wonderful as well. I've learned things about the show I would not have known otherwise and really got a glance into the minds of Stephen Sondheim, James Lapin, Mandy Patinkin, and Bernadette Peters.

I never bothered buying any of their other albums after that because most 60's bands, I find, get worse into the 70s and especially the 80s. I also sampled some of their songs from the 70s and 80s and wasn't impressed. This album is good though. If you like Lola and Muswell, then you'll like this. Preservation Act 1 and 2 are pretty good too. Soap Opera, I think, is there last great album. After that was arena rock stuff: okay, but not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favourite Kinks Albums","review":"One of the first Kinks albums I bought, and it remains one of my favourites. I bought it because of a rave review in Stero Review (now Sound & Vision). It is powered by the one-two punch of Sitting In My Hotel and Celluloid Heroes - both are as good as anything Ray ever wrote. The latter is particularly poignant.I wish they had never included the live album in the original release - IMHO it detracted from the overall impact.Completists beware: For some reason this CD reissue deletes the last 25 seconds of Here Comes Yet Another Day (I own both the original Canadian vinyl and the Velvel CD). It's only some noodling by Dave on guitar, but the song seems to end abruptly without it. I'm guessing they ran out of room on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Wonderful, all right...truly excellent","review":"This kind of Kinks is the kind that gets deep into your sould as you play it. Each selection, even the live ones, has that stuff that gives you that \\"WELL ALL RIGHT!\\" feeling. I'm not usually a fan of recorded live music, but the live tracks (track 11 through end) on this disc are a welcome exception. From the rolling goodness of \\"Here Comes Yet Another Day\\" to the plaintive story of \\"Sitting in My Hotel\\" to the haunting B3 reed-organ sounds of the quintessetial \\"Celluloid Heroes,\\" this album is sure to satisfy many a Kink Konnoisseur. And don't forget...turn it up!! Long Live the Kinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Kinks fans.","review":"If you're not a Kinks fan or this album would be your introduction to the Kinks, you should pass, even though it includes the full version of \\"Celluloid Heroes\\". The Kinks are the greatest rock band (yes, I mean it), but this album is among their weakest. Mostly whining about bad food on the road. Pass on this one, and get \\"One for the Road\\" or \\"To the Bone\\" if you want a Kinks live album. If you're already a Kinks fan, sure, you must get it; we must have every note the band has recorded -- I empathize.

Quite often, Andrews will talk about something so far back in the past that it is unverifiable, and not give any kind of source to confirm that this is how she knows that fact.

If this had been written by Thomas Cahill in his \\"Hinges of History\\" series, the whole thing would have been improved.

Gina Gershon stars as Lorna in this dark comedy that takes place in Texas in 1981. Dale (Val Kilmer) her husband of 17 years, is laid out on the floor as Gina's girlfriend Tiny (Kelli Giddish looking like a young Jane Curtin) walks in.As things go on Val Kilmer, who is now tied up in a chair and has confessed to a bank robbery, is accidentally killed. The women suppose the money is hidden somewhere in the trailer. They decide to look for the loot and dispose of the body using household appliances. As the story goes on, the plot takes a number of twists, so much so that the final twist becomes easy to figure out.This is a Coen style comedy, but falls short of the masters. I enjoyed this quirky film in spite of some of the predictability. Several laugh out loud moments as Gina creates a memorable character.PARENTAL GUIDE: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, unexpected plot.

Rod Price (RIP) never rally got his due in the pantheon of British guitarist, but he was, indeed, a fine slide player.And the late Lonesome Dave's blues howl, was unlike any other.This LP was worth the purchase price for the classic, Sarah Lee alone.Although it probably made many a blues purist cringe, for my money, Foghat's debut was their shining moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great (Rock) party album of the mid 70's","review":"Foghat by Foghat was another favorite of my friends and got played a lot at parties when I was in High School in the 70's. For many years I thought that the cover of Muddy Waters' classic \\"I just Want To Make Love To You\\" was the original version, and is still my favorite. The other favorite for me on this album was \\"Trouble Trouble\\", but I used to play the whole album both sides over and over.As I am much older after all these years, I don't play as much Rock as I once did in my sound system, but I still pull this CD out of the case from time to time and reminisce on my commute home from work."},{"rating":"1","title":"ill-fitting","review":"The quality of the material is fairly okay, I'd have to agree with the other review. Do not expect it to be leather, or even an expensive leatherette material. It feels a bit plasticky and synthetic, which I'd have to admit is acceptable for the price of the item.However, what is disappointing is the fit of the phone (I have the Pearl 8120) in the case. It's 0.5 inches too loose on the sides so it feels like it will fall out anytime. It is not snug at all as shown in the photo above. To give you an idea, a Curve 8900 fits comfortably in the pouch with some room to wiggle.

I had it for almost two months and had only disconnected it once. The last time I disconnected it, the RJ45 connector was more difficult to remove than I remember it was the first time, and then the cable would not latch. It would latch but as soon as the cable flexed a little it would pop back out. In the process of trying to get it to latch the little door broke. Linksys says they do not repair them and it was not covered by warranty so I threw away $30+. I would not recommend purchase as the RJ45 connection is very flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Series 2 TiVos","review":"If you are purchasing this for a Series 2 Tivo, don't.

Now that it's broke I am on hold with their tech support and it's a very painful exsperience. They are getting worse and worse. The item itself is VERY flimsy like other users have stated.

Unfortunately whenever I either change the network settings or unplug this device my PC totally crashes & restarts. I suppose this bug could be either XP or this kit but either way if I had another chance I would buy a different one. I agree with the other review that the rj45 socket is less than solid & there are some cables which will not hold in place properly. If you only want a permanant Ether connection & don't switch addresses or cables then this works fine. It even comes with a USB extension cable about 5cm long which you will need if your usb connectors are in line rather than side by side because the unit itself is slightly wider than a socket preventing access to the adjacent usb connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with TIVO","review":"Like others I found out the hard way this device does not work with Tivo because Linksys rolled out 2.0 and didn't bother informing customers that 2.0 doesn't work with Tivo.This is the fourth bad experience I have with Linksys gear, I must be a glutton for punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT hold securely","review":"Just amazed at how poorly this thing was designed! At first I thought I wasn't inserting the Cat5 tip properly (I crimp my own tips on custom lengths of cable -saves $ and its pretty easy!). I tried commercially prepared cables... Well, everything worked (the green LEDS lit up- indicating functionality)- BUT only in a most unsecure way. You jiggle, jiggle, jiggle until after hoping and hoping, you see the green LEDs, then very, very carefully let go- hoping it will maintain that same micro-precise position. I mean you BLOW on it, the lightest breath will cause the tip to move and the connection to be lost. Ridiculous!! I'm returning it.

I wish TIVO would recommend a Belkin USB 2 adapter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Well, But Didn't Trust Door","review":"I agree that it worked well and immediately, but I felt like its door was going to break off from the first time I used it. I don't travel much any more so I won't be worrying about a laptop, but I would be surprised if that door would travel very well. Even connected to my desktop at home, I felt as if I was going to break off the door just brushing against the cable. I used it a couple of hours and then returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for TIVO","review":"First, I am reviewing this for fixed usage with a Tivo and not as a mobile device. This is a valid review because there aren't many wired adapters supported for Tivo. I read the reviews about the cheesy door. They are absolutely true. However; the device came with a USB extension cord. Using this, the device did not jut out the back of the Tivo, it kind of hung down. Then I used packing tape to secure the Ethernet cable into the door. I do not think the door will ever break nor do I think the plug will fall out. As a cheap way to network your Tivo without the issues of wireless, this can't be beat. I would not buy this as a mobile device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful product, DO NOT BUY","review":"This thing is just one of the worst pieces of product design ever.

The design weaknesses around the connector take away from the potential performance that the internal hardware may offer. I was using the device on a TiVo Series 2 - when it was connected, it worked great with acceptable transfer speeds. Unfortunately, the connection proved tenuous and during the process of connecting and disconnecting the cable, the clip that holds the RJ-45 connector to the adapter broke off. A makeshift connection using tape was successful for a few minutes in maintaining the connection, but any movement at all disconnected the cable.I did not receive an extension cable with the adapter, but that would probably help.I am RMA'ing the broken device with Linksys, but do not recommend this model to others. Linksys customer service has been good regarding the RMA (after a very long hold time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"If at all possible do not buy this gadget!!!

And while I read the previous reviews, I decided that since I will plug it in, and probably not move the cable but once a year, surely it will hold just fine. Wrong!

The Ethernet wire doesn't actually plug into the adapter; rather, it rests on the connection at a 45 degree angle. As if that's not bizarre enough, the whole contraption is held together by a hinged flap that has no desire to stay put together. The whole thing falls apart for any reason you can think of.

It was completely plug and play, and I haven't had a single network issue with my Tivo.I think you'll probably be fine with it as long as you connect it once (VERY CAREFULLY) and just leave it hooked up.

After I applied the conditioner, the shoes looked dull and lifeless - all of the benefit of the shine and buff were gone. I buffed the shoes again with a clean cloth, but was unable to restore the shine. The leather might be well conditioned, but it sure doesn't look any better. Next time I will reverse the process: condition on day 1, shine and buff the following day, and see if this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work well","review":"I used this on my brand new buffalo leather duster and I couldn't say whether this has made a difference or not (hasn't gotten cold enough) but all my friends say you have to condition leather so, this seemed like the most economical value. I used roughly a 5th of the bottle to cover my coat so even if I condition on a annual basis this will last a solid 5 applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tried and true classic","review":"I've been using lexol since as far back as I can remember. It is the tried and true classic in leather care, for use on saddles and boots, and everything inbetween. Use a moist (but not wet) cloth, a few squirts of lexol. The lexol will foam and will clean and care for your leather. Wipe it off, apply a light coat of oil to your leather to help preserve it and keep it supple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have used Lexol products for many years. It keeps your leather goods looking new. Apply it to your leather shoes, boots or belts and wipe dry for a great luster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined","review":"This stuff ruined my expensive leather couches. At first they looked fine, then within a couple days it started cracking. The leather was almost sticky at first, and this might sound weird but my daughter spilled some glitter and it embedded into my leather and will not come off because it is so soft and sticky. Since then the leather looks dull and dry. I am so disappointed it makes me sick. Please do not use this product on nice couches."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"nice stuff. it make leather more conditioned like it says. what does that mean? softer shinier, more malleable. Shine could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEXOL 1015 LEATHER CONDITIONER SPRAY - BEST EVER!!","review":"I used this product on my 2002 Camaro Z28. My seats look like new now!! I'm very impressed. I prefer this overMeguires."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy with it","review":"I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results. It does need to be applied every few months, but I've used it on a variety of leather surfaces (worn leather sofa, dining room chairs with leather padding, office chair) with excellent results. As long as you don't apply it too thick, it won't leave an oily residue, and it blends into the leather very nicely. I've gone through the original bottle and a refill, and am about to order another refill.For application, the Lexol sponges work great. They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on leather couches","review":"The leather on our couches was becoming stiff from alot of use. I decided to try this product, and I'm very pleased with the results. It took a couple of coats to soften in places, but a beautiful shine came from the very first coat. It made our old couches look chic, new, and protected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended leather treatment","review":"I purchased this product because it was recommended by a person who repaired leather for a living. What better source for a recommendation. So far I would concur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice product!","review":"I finally got around to treating my big leather sofa and two big leather chairs. After about 8 years, they were l ooking pretty scuffy and bleached. Today they look brand new! I took others' advice and rubbed the liquid in by hand applying twice to most worn-looking cushions and arms. My leather was very thirsty, and I only used about two thirds of the liter. It has a little odor, but not objectionable. It dries quickly leaving no residue, ready for sitting on in an hour or two. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"protection from the sun's rays","review":"After cleaning our leather recliner w/leather cleaner, I then applied this conditioner and followed the directions. It gave the chair a nice luster but most of all, I feel,it will give it some protection from the sun's rays that come through our tinted sliding doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears OK","review":"I occasionally clean and apply this stuff liberally to my cheap leather ankle boots that I use to walk around in somewhat wet muddy areas. They are not really made for such conditions.As for waterproofing, while it may or may not protect the leather itself from water, it does not stop water from penetrating the leather.I haven't tried something like applying it to one boot and not the other, but after a couple of years of 60 days per year of harsh use, the leather of the boots is still soft and in a condition that does not show water damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"get something else","review":"I've used Lexol cleaner before on my Rx7 seats (from the open bottle). This time i decided to get some conditioner on the BMW. Well first of all this product does not need a spray bottle.It would have been easier in just an open container. When you spray it goes everywhere, the back parcel shelf, the windows, the carpet. Its hard to be precise with it.After reading the reviews, lots of people said it felt non-sticky, i disagree. It was very tacky and disgusting. I will get something else to replace this with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile, Ripoff - or mabe just useless","review":"Just the thing if you want your leather to smell like old crayons. Seems to be nothing but mineral oil emulsified in water with a tiny bit of coloring to throw it a hair off white. If you think mineral oil is good for leather, you can mix (emulsify) some with water and soap and save yourself the expense of this nonsense. Leaves a greasy film that is very hard to remove. Real saddle soap has always done a better job for me.Amendment:After a few days the stickiness was no longer evident and the smell was just unremarkably leatherish. Maybe it's good for the leather but I could not detect any change in softness of some areas that started out dry feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem to work well for an iPhone","review":"This item did not lock at all when I tried to use it on my iPhone with the Griffin Clarifi case on it. The bottom opening on that case kept the lock a bit too far out to engage properly. When I removed the case, it kind of grabbed on one side, but not very well, so I'm not clear that it would actually stay locked, given that one side was slipping out easily. It seemed to me that it would just encourage a thief to try to yank it out, resulting in a broken iPhone if not a stolen iPhone.I will be looking for another security solution -- for now I'll leave the iPhone locked in a drawer when I'm not in the office."},{"rating":"1","title":"My deepest condolences to...","review":"...Hvorostovsky, Ciofi, Sacca, and Maazel. Was it for productions such as this 'nightclub' TRAVIATA that La Fenice was rebuilt? I won't waste your time listing the sleazy details of a modern-dress production that displays more flesh than dress. If you insist on an updated staging, get the Salzburg production (2005), certainly far more elegant and stylish than this vulgar interpretation. No stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling modern production of original score","review":"Robert Carsen's modern settting (1960s) for this opera works incredibly well largely because of the committed performances of the three principals: Ciofi is a very moving Violetta, Sacca a virile Alfredo and Hvorostovsky a powerful but nuanced Germont. The updated sets and lighting succeed better here than in any other modern production of an opera that I have seen, even the giant one dollar bills floating down with Verdi's image on them. Maazel leads an at times slow but powerful performance of the original score (which contains many interesting earlier and slightly fussy versions of Verdi's later reductions). This DVD makes a fascinating comparison with the earlier classic, traditional La Fenice performance (Gruberova, Shicoff, Zancanaro and Rizzi); this too will become a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too naughty production & Medicore singing..","review":"I had looked forward to have this DVD because I thought this would be a good modern production compared to traditional ones. At first impression, I admit the performance was quite satisfying. But, the problem that I eventually found is too naughty and ridiculous presentation of Flora's Party scene and not so good singing of Sacca and Hovobostovsky. 2 stars for the Ciofi's performance (not for singing but for acting!) & Mazzel's direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5-star Traviata","review":"La Traviata is one of the most performed and loved operas, and with such demand it is hard to update the story to a believable setting. Robert Carsen was able to set the story successfully in a contemporary world that mixes simplicity and complexity to express deep emotions rooted in love. Patrizia Ciofi in the title role proves to be a convincing Violetta in her stage presence and singing. Memorable are her Sempre Libera and final scenes. As Germont, Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a highlight of the production. His portrayal is convincing and his voice suited for the role. The Alfredo of Roberto Sacca is committed to the role, but vocally he is the weakest in the cast. Lorin Maazel conducts with passion and brings out the best of the orchestra and coro of Teatro La Fenice. For those who love opera and are attracted to new takes of traditional stories this DVD is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"Although Amazon has listed Dr. Seuss as one of the authors of this book, he is not!Instead, the other authors/illustrator are attempting to boost their sales by stealing some of Seuss's characters--the Cat in the Hat, Horton the elephant, and the Grinch.This plodding, predictable story totally lacks the wild plot twists and off-the-wall craziness of true Seuss. The trouble-making Cat in the Hat is transformed into a bland voice of authority lecturing about the importance of sharing. Evidently the authors haven't read \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\", or they would know that the Grinch reformed at the end and is not the incorrigible villain he is depicted as in this book. Even the artwork is not a convincing imitation of Seuss, lacking the bold black ink strokes and wild details. The new characters in the book, Megan Mullally and her grandfather, look like Muppets rather than Seuss characters.Get a *real* Dr. Seuss book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Well Enough Alone","review":"Masterpieces and grandmasters are who they are because they are unique. Derivative works should remain just that, a complement to style, but no more. This is more than a request to this one author, but to the entire publishing industry. Enjoy Ted Geisel's work as it was meant to be, by yourself or with your kids. Trying to re-create it, in particularly, for monetary gains is ethically questionalable. Ted's work transcends markets and brands, it is a reflection on humanity, our strenghts and failures. Failure to understand this makes you no better than the Wickersham brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Voice of the 60s\\"","review":"Gordon had an amazing voice and his movies were a treat to watch.

This latest book of hers is written with her usual fabulous creativity and luminous romantic details. The characters are drawn with sensitivity, puck and spirit. The dialogue is inventive, articulate, and brillant. The plot details fill a romantic soul with longing, fulfillment, and incredible radiance. If you are a true lover of romantic fiction, don't miss this one. It is incredible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More realism would have made it better","review":"I disliked that the main characters' relationship is based on a deception, which is perpetuated for the majority of the book. This book also contained numerous anachronisms, making it seem more like a medieval costume party. And, I just can't buy that Amarinth would have changed so much that Tristan would not have recognized her at all, even after spending time with her. Also, the ending was a bit of a let-down, too neatly and quickly wrapped up."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALE OF WOE","review":"Definitely not a \\"feel good\\" book. This couple's troubles went from start to finish, and I found it depressing. A few lighter moments might have helped. This was my first Shana Abe book. I have another on order.

Ms. Abe has a wonderful way with her prose. My heart ached at the beginning for the young Amiranth. The use of flashback was extensive, yet very well done--not an easy task to pull off. If you like medieval romance with well drawn characters and a nice plot, I reccommend this book whole heartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less emotion, more attention, please","review":"This is supposed to be a historical romance. It has a historical setting, but the hero and the horse must have come from Krypton, and the saddlebags are as deep as Mary Poppins' carpetbag. On their journey from coast to castle, the horse carries not only the hero and heroine (which would be abusive enough), but at appropriate moments the heroine reaches into the saddlebags and pulls out at least two hundred pounds more of blankets, clothing, cloaks, weaponry, and you name it. At one point, the hero also gets to rescue the saddlebags from thieves, at a dead run and while disabled! Hello? Has the author ever seen a horse or carried a load of blankets?I would not have posted a review, except that the Romance Writers have nominated this book for Best Historical of 2001. They should have it up for a humorous paranormal category instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad..fits the bill","review":"This gate does what it says it does...its minorly annoying to take up and down every night and stepping over it can be a little tough. But overall I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"We bought this gate for my son, who is now 3 yrs. old now. The gate left marks on the walls where it compresses to stay up. He could easily get out of it from the bottom and crawl through. It wasn't very sturdy. One good thing about the gate was that the material could be taken off to wash. Also the round plastic pieces that pop onto the sides to secure it up would not stay in the gate, and were constantly falling off. Needless to say we are buying a new gate for my new 7 mo. old son. Sad that we didn't like this one enough to actually use it again. Waste of money since we did have 2 of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I installed this gate to limit my puppy's roaming area. The instructions are not very detailed, and when trying to build it, one side snapped on easily, and the other wouldn't budge, and I had to push so hard that when it finally went, it crushed my hand. Also, installing it is not easy. To install, it says to push in the spring loaded tube, but there is no spring loaded tube. Overall, this product is hard to use, and you can injure yourself setting it up. I do not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and more of a Hassle than anything.","review":"I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often. It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's \\"spring locks\\" to lock into place. It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it. And sometimes it's almost impossible to \\"unlock\\" it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it.Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price. You could find something much better for around the same cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for LOW TRAFFIC AREAS","review":"I should have realized something was up when I noticed that the box listed this item as being for low traffic areas. My husband put it together with little difficulty. When he showed me how it works--twisting the ends with your hands, I decided that this gate just wasn't going to work. It was difficult for me to turn the end pieces. You would have to undo both top pieces and then step over the mesh gate as it drops to the floor. There is no way you could do this while holding a small child in your arms. It was too tall for me to step over, so leaving it up all the time wasn't an option either. This went back into the box immediately and we are going to exchange it for another gate--one that will open and close easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I bought this gate to go between 2 walls below our staircase and it's so easy to use. It tightens up easily and requires no mounting. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"This product is nice for wide spaces where you have baseboard or trim at the bottom. It fits nice and snug even if the surfaces are uneven. The only bad thing is that it is not very easy to put up and down all the time and since its very large, it does not store easily. But it is fairly low for you to step over. Good gate all in all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for the money","review":"We now have two of these gates and they're great. My son pushes and practially hangs on them and we have yet to even see one budge. They are wonderful for wide doorways where you don't want to have to install something permanent. We put them up/take them down at least a couple of times a day, and it only takes a matter of seconds. The width is also easy to adjust if you need to move them to a different space. I would highly recommend this gate to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gate !","review":"We bought the Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate so we can bring it with us when we go out. It's a flexible, lightweight gate that snaps into place across a wide range of places we want to keep the kids out of. Worth the purchase for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"While this gate was too wide to use where I had originally intended, it is now working out wonderfully in it's new location. It is so easy to install and withstands a lot of force (and it's so cute to see our daughter smoosh her face against the mesh). I like the fact that you can install it in an uneven doorway because the top and bottom are adjusted independently of each other. I would recommend this gate to anyone who doesn't want to install any kind of hardware and needs versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I am very happy with this product. I needed gates for two openings that were 48\\" wide. 48\\" is too wide for any other pressure mounted gate that I could find. Since I only need the gates for occasional visits from an out of town grandbaby, I didn't want permanently mounted gates.We used them for 10 days over the holidays and they worked great. They were very sturdy and easy to mount. And since the top and bottom rail work independently of eachother, it is not an issue that the bottom rail had to be a little narrower due to the baseboards.I would highly recommend these gates and they were very inexpensive too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Blocking Off Areas","review":"I would NOT use this at the top of stairs... but perfect for the landing, blocking off rooms, etc. Very easy to use, and can accomodate uneven entry ways, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I love this gate. We have a 4ft wide doorway that most standard gates will not fit. This gate was very easy to put together and install. The gate is very secure in the doorway. I tripped the other day and fell into the gate and it didn't move.My only word of warning. I am about 5'8. The gate is fairly high for me to get over. I would not want to try with one of the babies in my arms. If you are looking for a gate for an opening that you will be going through regularly you may want to consider a different gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works! And no screws!","review":"We have an extra-wide doorway, and wanted a gate that we didn't have to screw into the wall. That does mean that we have to climb over it, but it's worth it because the gate is so strong and stays in place very well. The only drawback is how difficult it is to install the first time, to get a good fit. Pick the strongest person in the house to get that done."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gate!","review":"Love this gate! Bought it because it fits a very large opening between rooms. Pressure mounted so no holes to fill later and comes up and down when necessary, though not often. Looks good. Very safe, my 2 yearold can't make it budge. Fairly easy to climb over, even for a short 5'2\\" woman in her ninth month of pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe gate","review":"I like the soft mesh of the gate with children. I think this is a very good gate for a wide opening. Other gates for a wide space have to be mounted to the wall. The only thing about the gate that I don't like is that it is difficult to adjust for different doorways. However, I like it enough that I will probably buy another one for the other wide opening that I would like to gate off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the baby gate!","review":"I actually use the gate across the pop-out of our 5th wheel, it makes the perfect baby crib!

It is configured to not require permanent mounting at the apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large gate","review":"I like this gate when it is installed but what a pain in the butt to install. It works well when the opening is uneven but do not use it at the top of stairs. They say that it is portable but you would have to go through a lot of trouble to roll it up like they suggest. Overall, I think is is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good barrier","review":"This gate looks nice, can be removed when necessary and is a good barrier to keep my toddler out of a more dangerous area of the house. Good for grandparents houses too since it rolls up and is portable. The only reason for the four stars is that the instructions that came with it are poor. I had to figure some of it out for myself. Also, make sure to tell your big kids to be careful and not lean on it and knock it down. But the gate itself is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good buy","review":"I think for the price this is a great buy. We have it out almost as far as it will go and it holds tight. It is pretty easy to install, but does take some strength. Its not hard at all to put together. Mine was shipped in a huge box even though the products box is just a bit bigger than the product itself. If you have a child that pulls up and puts a foot or leg over a gate then this isn't for you. They can easily pull themselves up and put a leg over this. They would not be able to get a foothold on it though. My husband has tripped over it a few times and did finally fall hard and bend the top bar. We are moving soon so I didn't order a replacement, but if we were not moving I would have. I think it was his fault not the product. It did hold up when he fell over it though. Overall a great buy and even though I have read reviews saying it doesn't do well fully extended ours did."},{"rating":"2","title":"gate","review":"I was searching for a wide gate to go between my living room and the dining room and I ended up ordering this item. I absolutely LOVE this gate. It is very easy to put together (I didn't even have to read the directions!) and you don't have to punch holes on your walls. You simply twist and the gate will tighten between the walls. The mesh is perfect for my baby because he can still see through it to the other room.

Why? I have no clue. Amazon was less than helpful. I had to box it back up and take it to the post office, they would not send me a call tag. Also if the backpack that I didnt order wasnt back in their office in 30 days they would charge me for both the baby gate that I hadnt recieved and the backpack that I never wanted? Doesnt seem fair to me. So needless to say that backpack was out of my home the next day. I didnt want to worry about getting a second backpack so I had them refund my credit card.

But after some research I thought, I might as well just get it instead of prolonging the process. (bought 2 yrs ago)I am very amazed and pleased at how easy it was to assemble and how well it works! Fits very tight and secure in a wide space (with uneven walls). We have not, thankfully enough, had the privilege of watching our lil one, who really loves to climb as well, climb over it and break an arm. My lil one knows not to do that on or around this gate. But I do have to say, if you have really tall children, they are the ones who are clumsy and fall on the gate which therefore makes the gate come loose, which makes for some great family laughs. Mind you the really tall (clumsy child) is 13! It has worked well in our house these past 2 years, I highly recommend it! I believe it would work well for any family, even ones with a puppy, hopefully yours.Just don't have it placed in a high traffic area of the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gate!","review":"I don't normally write product reviews; but news about this gate is worthy to be shared!

It's sturdy and the pressure mounting tightens & loosens easily as needed. Our son's doorway is 60\\" because it's a double door, and this gate fits perfectly - I was a little worried it would be just a tad too short but it's not at all.It is, however, meant for low traffic areas. I would not recommend this gate to someone who needs to go in and out of an area more than two or three times a day since you have to step over it. It's great for us since we only use it at night.Only downside: we have a cat who likes to scratch at the mesh fabric on the gate, so we cover the gate with a sheet at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and Wide Gate best option for climbers!","review":"This gate is terrific. The price is very reasonable, it was simple to install, and it doesn't damage our plastered walls. We can take it down for company, or simply step over it.

He loved trying to climb the stairs in the summer house we rented - we needed a gate but would need something that required zero hardware. Plus, we live in a small apartment, and would have to be able to stow it with ease. This gate fits the bill.We use it now to block all the AV equipment under the TV. I am buying another today to block off the sliding glass door. The little guy can see though and even stick his little fingers everywhere without worry about a pinch.And, it's very reasonably priced, so I don't feel like I'm getting pinched either. Gotta love that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\`simple to use","review":"We bought this gate for our 9 month old crawling baby for use at the bottom of stairs. It works extremely well for areas with uneven surfaces. We use it on a wall that has one side with trim and it works well because you can adjust each side to different lengths if needed.The only negative is that the adjustment requires you turn the knobs and this can take some time if you have a wide opening or if you need to move the gate a lot. I would suggest getting two gates rather than trying to move one if you do so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong 2nd effort highly recommended.","review":"This is a strong second course from the Dolls; highly recommended. I've come to the Dresden Dolls a bit late, so much of what can be said has been. I can say the (4&5 star) reviews are on the money about the album. \\"Yes, Virginia\\" the 1st part of the Dolls second album is more mainstream; \\"No, Virgina\\" being the 2nd/\\"B Side\\". It is a more polished sounding album than the first and also strikes me as being less theatrical. While the production and sounds may have a new glossy presentation, the lyrics, music and performances from both Amanda and Brian are superb and meet or exceed expectations. I consider this a good sign; the 2nd album is both familiar and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"Yikes! This is pretty bad. I'm a big fan of the first album, but something is really lacking on this one. The lyrical wit is still there, and some of the piano work is nice...but the vocals are grating, and most of the songs are either irritating or uninteresting.I expected a great second album, or at least a decent one, but this just isn't it. I've come back to it a few times, hoping it would grow on me, but no luck. I'm pretty surprised...hopefully they'll improve with their next release, but I definitely wouldn't buy another Dresden Dolls album without hearing it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What? You're not into the Dolls?!\\"","review":"Ah, yes... The Dresden Dolls. A band only a rock critic and name checking hipsters could love.The term \\"cabaret punk\\" is being thrown about in almost every review of the band's music. It is more like just \\"cabaret\\" as in Cabaret the musical and movie. The Dolls are seemingly in love with Germany's Weimar Republic of the 1920s, in love with it's sex, it's gender bending, it's decadence and it's dark carnival atmosphere. The bands execution of the music is pitch perfect... for an off-broadway musical. For a rock and/or punk record a lot is left to be desired.Kudos to the \\"Dolls\\" for single handily inventing a new genre term for the rock music critical lexicon. By all means buy this if you are a fan of the musical \\"Cabaret\\" or Bertolt Brecht, all others beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the equation is","review":"After listening to this I decided it's a cross between Aimee Mann and Justine Frischmann of Elastica, but with pianos taking the places of guitars. Decent enough, though I won't be listening to it ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the charts in its own category","review":"This is a fantastic album. Honestly to really appreciate the Dresden Dolls I think you need to see them live, because Amanda and Brian are awesome, and they have this connection that's quite obvious when you see them play together. Also because they play with a lot of emotion, the songs are played differently every time. That being said this is a really good album, I can't compare it to any other artist, I'm normally into heavier rock, but something about the Dresden Dolls fits in with that, I don't know how exactly, maybe it's Brian's rock style drums, but whatever the case is, I'd highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"This disk is competently done -- good melodies, quality instrumentation/playing, gutsy and dynamic singing. The lyrics are interesting, off the beaten path... definitely worth a listen for those who enjoy, say, Rasputina (although I think that Rasp. is superior)."},{"rating":"2","title":"most excellent","review":"what an awsome album. less campy than the debut. i like the live mrs. o better with amanda cracking and stuff but i guess thats b/c i heard that one a bunch of times. great emotional songs with those slightly embarassing theatrical lyrics, which for me is the best part. the first time i heard sing i almost cried and the second time i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary!","review":"I bought this item for my father for Christmas. I'm sure he is no expert when it comes to Tommy James and the Shondells, but he claims that the songs were re-done. I read the reviews on many different versions of the \\"Best of Tommy James\\" CDs, and I thought I was going with the right one. Perhaps he does not remember how the songs originally sounded, I'm not sure. I just wanted to let everyone know because he was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing a few things","review":"This is a very mixed bag album, it has some of the greatest music ever recorded but they could have made better selections.... however, where else are you going to get bootlegs of Crystal Blue Persuasion (with the trumpets at the end), Do something to Me (Tommy's mix), and the unedited version of Sweet Cherry Wine. But they missed some other great songs, like where's the album cut of Crimson & Clover, Smokey Roads, I'm Alive/Crimson & Clover Reprise, Cellophane Symphony, Making Good Time, Changes and Travelin'. So you might want to get this album, the \\"Very Best Of\\" album, and Certainly don't forget the Crimson & Clover Cellophane Symphony double play set, that is only really the only way to have all of their great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"a painful read","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.It has a few interesting ideas in it but is largely ruined by his hackneyed view of robots. They seem no different than humans other than that they are cautious and methodical.Simak also decides to throw a love story in. Hell, why not?Really bad lines like \\"Oh, Jason, I've been running, running all my life\\" had me cringing.Avoid this piece of trash and read City by the same author. Much more worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't judge a book by it's cover.....","review":"This CD is amazing. I bought a box set of CDs and this was included; titled \\"Celtic - Myths & Legends\\" but the songs are the same. The cover isn't that appealling, but the music is so motionally relaxing and inspiring. The soothing chants of Felicia Sorensen put you into a wonderful trance that is out of this world. I don't know how they associated it with Lord of the Rings. I only found that when I wanted to learn more about this awesome album. The small price for the album is definitely well worth it. Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This CD is the brainchild of Trammell Starks, a producer and composer of many new age works. The CD has some decent music on it. The problem is that it is being falsely advertised as having some connection to the Lord of the Rings. Despite its cover design, which blatantly rips off the New Line Cinema LotR movie poster, this CD contains no discernible reference to Tolkien. As a matter of fact, the title \\"Lord of the Rings\\" appears nowhere on the CD in any way, shape or form. The title of the CD is, in fact \\"A Trilogy of Fantasy: Part One.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.........","review":"I am not impressed at all. This is not celtic nor is it Lord of the Rings. I am not sure what it is supposed to be. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trilogy of Fantasy, Part One","review":"Firstly, I ordered this CD on a whim with two other LOTR related CDs. My first reaction to the CD was - this isn't celtic at all! Not close to Enya - per one reviewer and the language escaped me! Was it Elvish or Danish? On hearing it again, and again, I have grown to like it and compare it to the Bond Girls first CD. So, I recommend it for folks who want old world music with fantasy overtones but an hip, rockin' backbone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation for its era, but get Todd's, too,","review":"This is the second best place to start for Todd Rundgren/Utopiacollectors, the first being Todd's own 2-CD Anthology.It has Utopia's essential hits and some of the better albumtracks to satisfy most casual listeners.But for those who'd want to dig deeper(or already have,like me), it's still enough to whet your appetite.Even though Utopia ended up being more or less a part-time band compared to Todd's work, there's still a lotof good material here.The tracks I like best are 'Crybaby,' 'Love In Action,''Set Me Free,' 'Love Is The Answer,' the 2-part 'Overture',and 'Freedom Fighters.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Like Todd's Pop Music","review":"This incarnation of Utopia is no where close to his original band. The keyboard players really added to Todd's ablities and seemed to enhance his creativity Moogy Klingman, check out Utopia Live or Utopia with Freak Parade, The Ikon etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Utopia CD You Really Need","review":"ANTHOLOGY 1974-1985 is a great collection of the finest moments by Todd Rundgren's band Utopia, and really the only CD by the band that you really need. It features all of the essential cuts and then some, which is great, as Rundgren was fairly inconsistent both on his own and with Utopia. Here, his work as a bandleader is distilled into one great single-disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up","review":"Im sick of people putting this CD on the same level as Bark Like A Dog, which just plain sucked, and telling people that Boggda Boogada Boogada is the greatest SW album of all time. Boogada is only good if youre a die-hard SW fan who wants to hear their older stuff. This CD is one of the best ones theyve ever put out. Like Anthem For A New Tomorrow, they stay away from the fun-catchy stuff you hear on Wiggle and My Brain Hurts and write some really good stuff. Take another listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a step up from Anthem...","review":"Green Day's bass player is on this album. If you're hung up on that, you don't deserve this album. With catchy, melodic music, this album is a step back towards My Brain Hurts and Wiggle (I like those two albums), but makes a slight detour towards the pop genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"SW makes enemies and irritates people with this CD","review":"Sorry, punk rock fans, Screeching Weasel screwed themselves with this one.

Very few illustrations, longwinded and dull text, and the few illustrations provided were not easy to understand. The author purports to go into various methods of cutting and thrusting in far more detail than his first book, but he sticks to the 6 basic moves from the first book and barely expands upon the concepts at all.Sanchez provides details for constructing several simple training targets for cutting drills (basically, a strip of newspaper hanging from a string, a thread, and a tightly rolled newspaper), which may be useful for some. His chapter on \\"Deviant Styles\\" briefly discusses how some people tend to attack with a knife, and weaknesses he has observed which may be exploited.With a title like \\"Blade Master\\" I expected far more than this thin book provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent head","review":"I bought this head for my 6 inch LP mini snare drum, because the original one didn't last that long.

Perhaps I will try another author, but this is really a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Tina Modotti had a fascinating life and she is a great role model for women because of her independence and strength.

I have been playing and taking lessons for 2.5 years and would not be able to swing a club without a program that focuses on golf-specific strength and flexibility exercises. I have read many books that claim to accomplish this but I have stuck with Golf Fit (2 yrs) because it is very easy to follow and the entire program can be done at home with free weights. The program also works! When I started it I had elbow tendonitis so severe that I couldn't grip a pencil and such sore intercostal muscles that I couldn't take a deep breath! Now I have only minor intermittent aches and pains.The book is well illustrated, the descriptions are clear, and the number of exercises in each section is small enough to fit into a busy life style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak for THE ONLY guide I will ever need","review":"Could have been much better, weak on the resistance exercise and which muscles for my swing I will work on.

She really liked the watch, and the shipping was fast, overall I would recommend the watch. It was made of better material than I thought it would be for the price, and it is easy to adjust to your wrist size. The face of the watch is smaller than I thought it would be, quite small but still legible of course. And it's digital so the size of the face doesn't matter as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent alarm","review":"I got this watch for my mother, who wanted a watch with a daily alarm to remind her to take her medication.

I LOVE the countdown timer feature for everything from baking to napping to walking to getting out the door. I know it won't last long if it is true to form, but I will always buy a new one if I can. This is far more attractive than the ones I have bought at retail outlets which had vinyl bands and all-black faces. I don't understand the people who say the band clasp doesn't work well. Works fine for me. At the price, three years of use is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH","review":"This watch does not have an adjustable band and Casio indicates that they cannot provide instructions for DIY to shorten. Apparently, it needs to be done by a jeweler with special tools. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY LARGE WOMAN-- OR A GUY. It fits my forearm nicely and I can slide it over my hand. It's unlikely that's what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"I purchase Casio watch for $20 because I loved metal band and digital display, and at first I had trouble adjusting the watch band to fit around my wrist.

The screen could been larger and included the day and date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch!","review":"Just got this watch an hour ago and I already love it! So functional and personally, I think it looks really cute with layering bracelets. I had a problem with the size of the band at first because it was just too long for my average sized wrist. In order to shorten it, I looked up the process on youtube. It was really simple and took me about two minutes (including video watching time). Now this watch is just perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why do they not include instructions for the simple stuff?","review":"I bought this watch and worked through the instructions on how to set all the wonderful features. It was a bit complex but doable.Then I tried to put it on and of course it was too big. The clasp was a bit weird but I figured that out. Then I tried to shorten the band by sliding the clasp up an inch or so. There were no instructions for how to do it. I even emailed Casio and asked but then I tried to do it myself. After an hour of fussing: my eyes hurt, my finger was bleeding and the watch band clasp had disintergrated into two separate pieces that slid ever so easily on the band - there was no hope.I suspect I would have liked the watch, it's pretty and extremely useful, but if I can't wear it, it has no function. I'll be returning it if Casio does not answer my email by tomorrow night with instructions I can follow.I am very sad indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"I love this watch!

These aren't like tarot cards, where you need to do a lot of studying, or need to know esoteric symbolism. You just look at the card and look at your own hand. Can you handle that? Yes, I think you can.The all-over look of the cards is very nice; the cover makes it look old-fashioned, like it's from the days of yore. It almost has a 19th century feel to it.

They will NOT hold a ton of plates or other heavy items, but I didn't expect them to with this design. I am very pleased with these and ended up buying two more for more shelves. To adjust to different widths: the \\"rester\\" shelf (the one with only legs on one side) is inserted (legs down) from underneath at the desired width on the \\"supporter\\" shelf, then you lift the \\"rester's\\" legs-side up to \\"rest\\" the shelf on the selected wire on the \\"supporter\\".

Turns out they are expandable to one size only. It's either 16 inches or 32 inches, nothing in between. To make it worse, they are NOT strong and durable as promised - the shelf sags under the weight of only a few plates, and drinking glasses balance on the shelves so precariously that I am too scared to use them for glasses. Also when they arrived, each set of racks is secured with a plastic band. In order to remove the band, one must jam the scissors in there and wiggle them around to get a good place to cut, yet doing so chips off the paint and rubber coating of the racks- terrible packaging design. Don't buy these unless you want them to be 32 inches long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FASCINATING BOOK ABOUT SOME FASCINATING WOMEN","review":"My sister sent me a copy of this book as a birthday gift.

I already have some deep scratches and paint has worn off in 20 days. The strap is also resin and so you would need to air your hand where the strap lays daily. There is no count-down timer.

The stopwatch is setup the same way. So if you are concerned about seconds or sub-seconds (which are located at the top of the watch face), the numbers are placed in a funny position on the face and they are hard to read at night.I bumped the side of the watch and it broke one of the tabs that hold the band to the watch.

These were one of the only brand thats allowed you to add a second set of headphones without having to buy another transmitter. Since my wife and I sometimes use them together, that was important. The sound quality is very acceptable, though there seems to be a slight hiss. That could be environmental, but in any case it is not annoying to either of us. I would have preferred headphones that enclose my ears, but they used plain foam rubber pads that sit on my ears.

The on/off switch is a hassle, and don't forget it requires 2-AAA batteries [not included]. The microphone supplied [when no audio jacks present] has an adhesive back which when fixed near the TV speaker has a weak reception since the voice pickup side is facing in the opposite direction. In order to work properly you must attach it to the inside of the speaker cover - not easy. A better solution for those with audio output jacks on your TV or VCR-DVD player [one for MONO; two for STEREO] is to connect a headphone [like Koss KTXPRO1] with volume control. If connecting to a RCA plug you must obtain a RCA plug(s) to phone jack adapter.

Why anyone would want to view any opera he is involved in (whether on video or live in the opera house) is beyond me. He has ruined the Rusalka (with Fleming and other fine singers). The action there seemed to take place in a Motel 6 bedroom (including the final scene which is supposed to take place at a lake in the forest!). The MET's recent production of Eugene Onegin was beautifully sung by all the principals, but Carsen's staging made it a bore and a disaster. Too many fall leaves on the set!

Also, her acting is below par, the last scene of her stroking the chairs was ridiculous, and most of the time she seems only interested in looking pretty. I did not care for the costumes, especially the blue dress was odd and almost made Fleming look misshapen at certain angles (just look at the cover!).

They were ok with the actual opera being done in a modern setting, but not the video. Most of the composers are long since dead and we treat them as if they have no rights. Richard Strauss still has family that cares about his legacy of beautiful work and his feelings and theirs should be respected. Perhaps they agreed..in a 12 year time period maybe.

I need to charge the battery every night just in case it won't shut off during the middle of tomorrow.Recommendation: 1. If you live in suburban areas like me, you should avoid this phone for any cost.2. If you don't have a car charger or you travel often, try a phone that can stay up longer. Otherwise, buy a couple of extra batteries if you think you are so rich.Overall, why should you pay hundreds of dollars for this phone when you can get other great cell phones for free when sign up a plan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I haven't received anything.

Minimum of bells and whistles, solid construction and good reception. The thing about it that earned the 2 stars is that the predictive text system is so stupid it qualifies for its own DSM V diagnostic rating. Firstly, it's in Spanish. This is cool as the States has a large Spanish-speaking population. What's extremely *not* cool about it is that the Product Description fails to tell the buyer this. Also, the thing I liked about my previous phone was that I could teach the predictive text function just by adding new words to the correct spelling definitions, a must for anyone with a large vocabulary. Sadly, this phone does not retain the English spellings I repeatedly put into it.So if you're a Spanish speaker and you're looking for a good phone, this is the thing for you.

Most of the material focuses on the Japanese side, covering their social development, consummerism, opinions on life's big issues, and how both the group and school mould their personalities and behavior.

After fighting with the assembly for a week, I finally called Cross Country Furniture, the supplier. The response I received was not helpful. I was told they could not help because all that was available to them was a picture of the product. I was asked to diagnose the problem.

After reataching the wheel it still wobbles. While trying to put the cart together the screws were too small and would not fit through the brackets to connect with the frame. I had to pound out the brackets to make them flatter so the screws would fit all the way through. I should have just dismantled it and sent it back. This product is not worth them money.

The nine stories in this collection fall more into the dystopian category than either of these two definitions. Only Ursula K. Le Guin's \\"Mountain Ways\\" was really intense and interesting enough to make me want to reread it. Stories by Stableford, Resnick, Purdom, Dedman, and Sterling were all just boring -- I couldn't care about any of the characters. \\"Nevermore\\" by Ian R. MacLeod had potential but it was too disjointed to make me feel much. David Marusek's \\"Out of Touch\\" also had a great beginning but a very weak and rather sudden ending. \\"Smart Alec\\" by Kage Baker was well-written but very very sad.

However, it was not long before the potential fizzled out to mundane nonsense. The book lacked substance, the characters were not well developed and the ending - well, let's not even go there! As for \\"Stumpy\\", well, wherever the character belonged, it was not here. He seemed to be a lost soul desperately looking for a plot and, unfortunately for the book, landed here. In brief summary, the book failed to deliver the suspense it initially appeared to contain, the writing style was, in parts, close to rambling and the dialogue of the characters was just too stinted to be realistic. Only robots with limited speech patterns could possibly carry on such an unnatural conversation. This is the first book I have read by this author and, sorry to say, the last.

The characters are so stupid that I kept hoping that they'd get killed. They were far too accepting of all the weirdness in the town, especially Stumpy, to the point where I kept wondering if the author assumed that I was as stupid as they were. I did finish the book, though, so maybe there's something to that theory. I should have put it down right after their first meeting with the ol' Stumpster. If you have a choice, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I can't believe that Stephen King really said \\"You must read this book\\" . . . it was, without a doubt, the worst book I've ever read -- and I've read a lot.The characters are shallow and their conversations are not natural. I agree with an earlier reviewer who complained that the characters are too casual about what they see and hear -- I would add they are way too gullible. I found it inconceivable that someone would see the character \\"Stumpy\\" and alow themselves to be convinced that he's just a quirky guy who lives in the woods and is truly happy and content living that way.I also think there were too many gratuitous sexual references in the book. Truly, how did the scene with Anita and Barry move the story forward? I think it was just a way for the author to try and shock his audience.I, too, bought this book because, as members of an Residents' Association I thought it was a clever idea. Well, that's all it was -- a clever idea that never went anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable thrill ride.","review":"Before I incur the wrath of previous reviewers, I must state that the majority of their points (with the exception of a few I don't care to argue) are valid. This is not Mr. Little's master work. Yes, this book is over the top. Those of you seeking fiction strictly within the bounds of reality might want to seek your reading material elsewhere.For the rest of us, Bentley Little plunges us into a well-crafted alternate reality, leaving us firmly cemented in Theater of the Absurd. I'm not here to debate whether these events could occur within our context of reality, but I was thoroughly entertained and will think twice before entering a housing association, and since these were seemingly the intentions of Mr. Little, I will have to give it my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much gross out, not enough substance.","review":"While I enjoyed Little's novel \\"The Store\\" and thought his short stories in \\"The Collection\\" were okay, I was not really impressed with this book.In my opinion, Little goes for the gross out factor far more then he should. It seems like that's all there is to the story and it just becomes too much. I think he's kills off too many of the main character's friends and allies too. Again, too much.There's also a problem with the main character himself. I was halfway thru the book and was still asking myself why I should care what happens to the main character and his wife. Little just didn't do enough to get the reader emotionally invested in the story.Little definitely has skill as a writer and comes up with some original ideas. However, his execution of those ideas still leaves a lot to be desired. \\"The Store\\" shows that he's done it well once. It remains to be seen whether he can do it again. He definitely didn't pull it off with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad B movie","review":"Starts out with potential, but eventually becomes unbelievable, even for fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This was my first Bentley Little novel. In a word, it was not worth my time. The characters are one dimentional, at best, and the plot calls for a suspension of disbelief that simply can't be justified.

Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First But Definitely Not My Last by Bently Little","review":"This is one of the best books by this author. I have now read just about all of his books. The storyline about homeowners' association is not too far from impossible. The ending was a little far-fetched, but that's what this type of book is all about. I have re-read this book twice and still enjoy it. There's a made-for-tv movie starring John Ritter called The Colony that I feel was for the most part made from this book. I have recommended this must-read book to many friends. If you have read and liked other books by Bentley Little, then you should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be Little's best","review":"I personally find Bentley Little hit or miss. The Association is a big hit however. The outrageous story about this HOA is made believeable through Little's style of writing. This one will keep you on the edge of your set the entire time. Might be better than my former favorite The Store. When B Little is on he's on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for a horror book","review":"Little's imagination really shines through in this book. It's highly entertaining horror. Unfortunately, the actions and the explanations of why no one does anything about them is completely unbelievable, and the ending is a typical Little wrap-up, which means it's rather rushed and hokey. Still, if you can suspend your belief and embrace the often ridiculous plot developments, which are actually necessary to the story, you'll probably enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He lost me with the Stumpies...","review":"I am an avid reader, and a fan of horror. My father gave me this book and it is, by far, one of the worst horror books I have ever read. As one other reviewer put it, it's just \\"silly\\". The premise is stolen directly from an X-Files plot in which Scully and Mulder posed as a married couple moving into a gated community and immediately confronted by a bullying association with a book of regulations which they take drastic measures to enforce. As a fan of X-Files, I recognized almost all of the plot twists as having been pilfered from this episode. The added junk - and it is junk - is not even worthy of description. Skip this book, and wait for the next Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie suspense","review":"Despite becoming overly macabre in places, this novel is compelling and keeps you reading with a bit of trepidation. Having lived in settings governed by a homeowner's association, the basic premise is plausible. We once lived in one where a car parked in front of your residence had to be moved at least 6 inches every 24 hours. People reported our guests for \\"violations\\" and police were knocking on our door to tell us we had to move a car .... 6 inches! So, absurd as this story was, it resonated with me.Not a bad read, really, except for the unnecessary and impossibly gory condition of some of the \\"victims.\\" The denouement is not convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's a reason not to have a homeowners association.","review":"Seems not to many people enjoyed this book. I am a very big Bentley Little fan!! I have a great time leaving my reality and entering his (usually) very bizarre story worlds. I have read almost everything he has written, I have a few to go. But I know that he ends most of his books to quickly and leaves you wondering what happened with something that went on in the story. That's why I was surprised, but also happy, to find an epilogue in this one.In short the story is about a homeowners association that you don't want to mess with. Follow the rules - all those ludicrous rules - or you and/or your friends could end up \\"stumpy\\" or dead.So before you buy a house with a H.O.A. make sure you read the rules and can follow them.

The premise is laughable. The characters are annoying. I wanted Barry and his wife to die in the worst way possible, especially Barry! The lead character could not have been more unlikable.Little comes up with situations that are so over the top and he always has the characters behave in an unbelievable manner. The story has no credibiblity because the story reads like a bad episode of the twilight Zone.I think Little may have some fun books, but the 2 I have read are horrible so I am done with reading Bentley Little.I am waring you, this book is a big waste of time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS!","review":"As I read I laughed a lot at what I thought was \\"dark comedy\\"!But thenm I noticed on the book's spine that this was classified as \\"horror\\". - OOPS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Association\\"","review":"A good book for passing time and thats it.

What's the protagonist's reaction? Basically, \\"Boy, that sure is creepy.\\" Now, imagine what your reaction would be if this happened to you.

After this, the book became completely unbelievable. Most of the critical moments were left unexplained with no follow-up. The climax was messy and made no sense at all. Obviously Mr. Little had no idea how to end it and tie up loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book up until the end","review":"This was the first Little book I read, I really like about 3/4 of this book and then poof the ending was weak. Its almost like Mr. Little gets tired of writing and just ends his books. He did the same thing with Dispatch. I did like the story behind this book and The Association really got me angry as I read the book. I kept going \\"are you kidding me\\"? Its a good read and definitely worth a look. Im begining to like Bently more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Association","review":"The Association,Bentley Little has penned a very entertaining novel \`The Association'.The premise seems to be built around Murphy's Law; anything that can go wrong will go wrong. And do they ever.The story moves at a very nice pace, never bogging down. The reader turns the pages in anticipation as to what will happen next. And something bad always seems to be happening to poor Barry and Maureen. The association seems to have a rule for everything, and the rules are nothing less than a dagger to the heart of this young couple.The ending was somewhat far-fetched and very unbelievable, but this didn't take away from the fun I had reaching the pinnacle. This was a very amusing read, and I would recommend it to any horror fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abomination","review":"This is the first novel I have read from this author, and it will be the last. The concept is interesting (lots of people have experience with meddling homeowner's associations), but the execution is dreadful. Horror as satire just doesn't work for me. Awful, awful stuff. The main characters are unbelievably foolish. This novel is completely contrived and works at no level at all. (...) Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing out loud!","review":"This is one of the silliest books I have ever read! If the author was going for horror, he's really missed the mark. The dialogue is laughable. There is barely any tension in the plot. If they made a movie out of this book, the audience would think it was a comedy. Good concept, but unfortunate results."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kept me guessing","review":"What a suspenseful thriller.... Deborah had it all 2 beautiful kids, a house in the suburbs, and a loyal husband. Then one day her husband Steve disappears... The FBI are asking questions...about a serial killer named The Dark Alley killer... Her closest friends tell her her husband has secrets... Someone is calling her and sends her a present. Is her husband the serial killer? Or is it someone else she trusts? Read this book it'll keep you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but easy to figure out","review":"This was my first Carlene Thompson book and I read the whole thing in a day, which is rare for me. I enjoyed the premise and the story, which reminded me of Wendy Corsi Staub.However, my only problem with this book was the predictability. I knew before I was even halfway through the book who the culprit was, mainly because it was the only person in the book that no one suspected at all -- every other character that it could've possibly been fell under someone's suspicion, and that suspicion was discussed with another character, which is almost a sure sign that they're not the one. Had this not happened, I would've had no clue who did it, been surprised at the end, and given the book five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't thrill me.","review":"I didn't enjoy this novel at all. I'm a quick reader, and it took weeks for me to get through this one because I just wasn't drawn in. The characters are overdramaticized, weak and irritating, and the story drags on. Deborah is not an exciting protagonist by any means - I found myself getting annoyed with her almost immediately. She tries to come off as a strong woman, but she is really just a weak trophy wife trying to convince herself that everything is going to be just fine if she just wishes really hard.I also really disliked the ending, which I felt was thrown together just to find a place to end the story \\"happily\\". The events leading up to the ending and the relationship between the characters just weren't compelling enough to have the story end as it does.This is more eye-roller than nail-biter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu-Teck","review":"Found this on Nu-Teck's website:Nu Teck Corporation Of Englewood ColoradoTerminated ALLManufacturing Operations on December 31, 2011.ALL Legacy, standard or custom productshave been discontinued.Sorry for any inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping Jack Salad Express","review":"The salad express was not what I thought it would be. The spinning part is just fine, BUT, the slicing/grating part is out of this world, or should I say \\"off the countertop\\". It jumps right off the countertop when it is grating/slicing which quite frankly scared me to death when I pushed the button.

This movie compared to others was so sad. The main character who is a movie within a movie because he is a serial killer and as arrogant as they come and from the time he opens his mouth, you wish he would get eaten has no rhyme or reason to his killing. He is a \\"Jason\\" or \\"Michael\\" wannabe. To be honest, my reason for purchasing this DVD was the title. Corny huh? It was just so catchy and cutsie I had to see for myself. Poor Rose the waitress who spends her night shift getting to know \\"Ken\\" and has a meaningful conversation for the whole of 5 minutes and I feel she thinks she has a connection to gets offed along with the cook, but we don't see the cook get the \\"axe\\" (ha! ha!, axe--cook, sorry) but she gets revenge and it takes off from there.

The only problems are that the chapters don't explain anything clearly at all and the solutions manuals don't show solutions at all.

It turns out that the book is only worthwhile for the problems themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not finding this book useful in learning the subject","review":"Currently, I am a student using this book. I am not finding it very useful in attaining knowledge in the subject matter. I find the language obtuse and not very accessible. Besides the reader, I would fault the editor. Someone who is ensconsed in their profession will naturally have difficulty finding voice to teach a subject to someone who is new to it. It is the job of the editor to help ensure the language is accessible to the intended audience. Unless the intended audience is other mathematicians with years of experience on the topic, the editor has failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible solutions manual, DON'T PURCHASE!","review":"As with most \\"official\\" solutions manuals, this one is pretty much junk. It contains \\"full\\" solutions to only odd problems, and those \\"fully\\" solutions generally skip steps, assume that you've already mastered the concepts (which you obviously haven't at this level), and on occasion, don't even solve problems the way the book recommends. Instead of purchasing a solutions manual for this DiffieEq book, I'd just recommend using Cramster. For free they've got AWESOME solutions to all odds which clearly explain what's going on, and for ten bucks a month they got you covered on all the evens as well. For some reason this site is not as well-known as it should be, but save yourself some money and headaches and check it out before buying crappy solutions manuals. Just Google \\"Cramster\\" and you'll be set!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This solutions manual is only minimally helpful...","review":"A good student solutions manual will go through all of the steps of a problem, and show how to solve it. This book skips steps and key ideas. It's not a very good solutions manual. The textbook which it is the solutions manual for is not a well done book, as the problem sets consist of problems which differ enough from the examples that they are frustrating even if you work through and understand all of the examples. The subject of the text is 'differential equations', not 'tricky advanced algebra'. Yet in one of the more difficult fundamental sections (section 1.6, substitution methods), several of the problems, including the first problem, require some not obvious algebraic manipulation to set up and solve. This is not reflected in any of the examples, and it is not shown in this solutions guide - they skip this step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $","review":"Maybe I shouldn't say that, now I won't be able to sell it. Only has solutions to odd-numbered problems. The solutions are usually just the answer, with little or no explanation as to what steps were taken to arrive there. I can get the answers from the back of the textbook. I have found several errors in the solutions and I've only done 1/3 of the odd problems through chapter 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Single Worst Solutions Manual I've ever seen","review":"This solution manual gives absolutely no further insight into the problems. Usually the nice aspect of solution manuals is they may be used as examples of how to work the problems. This one gives little more than the answer.The Text book associated with it is also terrible. Consistently skipping over parts of the example problems. I spend half my time searching back in the book in order to follow the examples rather than them being a reinforcing aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak very weak..","review":"I have decided to change my review for this product, originally I gave it a 2/5 but now am changing it to a 1/5. Since I have written the review originally I have picked up the solutions manual, and although the solutions manual helps a little bit there is no getting around how poorly this book was written.The problem is the lack of worked problems, there is on average only one worked problem that is usually pretty easy, and very different from the problems in the sections the student is to work.the only reason that this book should get one star is that they managed to put ink on paper and bind it all together.A very disatisfied customerThe author does not explain how to do the problems very well at all. For all of us non math majors this book is very hard to interpret, I often spend hours trying to piece together the puzzle the author calls worked problems. Its not unusual that the examples are spread out in fragments across several pages adding to the difficulty in readibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only bits and pieces of information","review":"I actually never received this product at all, eventhough it was promised it earlier than planned. I did see the ones other students in my classroom purchased. It has some good helps in some areas, but is not very complete and doesn't help a whole lot with understanding the subject.

Ms. Sutton certainly has a musical gift, but nothing NEAR the level of Diana Krall or Stacey Kent, just to name a few. Please excuse the layman's terms, but I will say this: If you enjoy a very \\"voicy\\", drawn-out, sans instrumental style of jazz, then you perhaps would like this album. If you prefer a jazz sound containing a more balanced mix of vocals and instruments (such as the afore mentioned Krall & Kent), then I would stay away from this album.

By taking JK Rowlings characters and changing their names, Lisa Eliotte believes she is being creative. Her story is about a child who lives with his extended family and is treated poorly until he finds out he is a wizard. He then gets to go to wizards school where he faces the evil wizard that attacked him as a child. He must use his blue crystal to help defeat the evil one. The only difference comes at the end which i must say left little to be desired. The number of similarities between HP and the SS and this book are staggering.

Do not waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some charm, but in desperate need of grammar help","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, this seems more like an attempt to translate the first Harry Potter novel into something for younger readers than any original story. But it fails to do even that much. I was left with the impression that the author has a lot of good heart and potential, but that she needs to hone her writing skills in every area from punctuation to grammar to better use of description to an understanding that what she has done is complete plagiarism.

Jackowski strings together purely anecdotal reflections, with no hint of scholarly justification, to the effect that sisters (especially non-canonical ones) are guided by the Holy Spirit, where the men are hypocrites and failures.One receives a dim, never-developed picture of oppressive and scandalous priests, as if there were nothing positive to be said for the priesthood or males in general. The references to sisters, which seem based entirely on what Jackowski has discussed with people she knows, are a string of feminist exercises in self-esteem, interwoven with references to pagan customs and goddesses.This book is totally devoid of scholarly merit or intellectual insight. It does not even treat of the supposed topic. I'm surprised it ever was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sister Karol Has an Agenda","review":"Die-hard catholics will be disturbed by this book.

The story is gripping, tracing the unexpected rise, fall and rebirth of a woman who never asked to be, but somehow turned out to be, a very powerful figure in the international drug trade. Even though she's a \\"criminal\\", the viewer has a lot of sympathy for her, as she has a strong internal moral code, and cares deeply about her friends.

After the intro chapter, the author wastes no time in diving into the difficult topic of data retrieval and spends three well-written chapters on this topic, explaining the operations in a clear and easily understood manner. One big example is used throughout the book, that of an \\"online\\" bookstore database. For a SQL (pronounced 'sequel') newbie like me, this book was perfect in its coverage and treatment. Again, the book's clarity is superb.Two flaws: 1) a number of typos and errors, esp. in the chapters on retrieval, which can confuse the reader; 2) intro to relational database is rather skimpy, IMHO.But it deserves a five-star rating. Very highly recommended.

Being a beginner in SQL, I wasn't exactly sure where to go from there.So here I am now, shopping for another book.

I first heard some of this collection in my Beat Generation class in college, and I had to get the collection.Salvador Dali said that Jack Kerouac was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. I don't think anyone can listen to his voice, see his pictures in this collection, and appreciate his writings without agreeing whole-heartedly.This collection of works is more than a few good CDs--it's an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show & Behind the Scenes","review":"I fell in love with this show since episode one.

I was going through withdrawal after The Shield went off the air and I was desperate for a new great cop show. Southland is not it. The keys to a good cop drama are believeable, likeable and realistic charactors, Southland has none of those three ingredients. Southland has instead chosen whiney, annoying, and loathesome actors.

Most of the music this listener hears is too stirring to foster the mind frame necessary for a positive dream time. Enter Coyote Oldman. Some may dismiss this as new age music. There is an understandable skepticism about such music. Ultimately, such critics are missing out on \\"Tear of the Moon.\\" This is the soundtrack to either a profound meditation or a good night's repose. Rest assured, \\"Tear of the Moon\\" is both relaxing and a quality listen. The Native American flutes and Incan pan pipes will gently carry the listener off to another world. Barry Stramp and Michael Graham Allen's aerophones dance in a mystical, reverb soaked state of tranquility. Originally released as a cassette, this version includes a twelve minute bonus track that brings the time up to a respectable CD length. \\"Tear of the Moon\\" is one of Coyote Oldman's most compelling vision quests."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear of the moon","review":"highly recommend this cd very relaxing music.one of my favs.lost my original so i purchased another.i am indeed pleased.Coyote Man has other cd\`s that are very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"The singer can be heard singing the whole song","review":"With respect to the previuos comment, I would like to add that the singer can be heard entirely (not just the chorus) by selecting the second audio channel most DVD players have.

I liked the extra features. The overall feel wasn't bad either, not as good quality as the techics but not a horrible feeling turntable by any rate. After 2 years one of them is starting to die. When I push the start button the platter doesn't \\"catch\\" and I have to give it a manual push to \\"lock\\" it on to the motor.I'm now looking for a second hand pair of Technics like I should have from the begining and saved myself some money, time, and effort.

This, in my opinion, is the best Pinhead Gunpowder release, first because I'm a fan of (early) Green Day, and Billie Joe sings the whole damn thing (unlike other Pinhead Gunpowder records), and second because the songs are really catchy. This is a CD you'll play over and over again (to me, the best tracks are #1, #5, #8, & #9). The only disappointment is that most of us will never get to see them play live, because I hear their shows are few, far-between, and pretty secretive. The only reason I didn't give this release five stars is that I prefer street punk bands like Oxymoron, but if you like pop-punk at all, this will quickly become one of your favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book blows","review":"Terror at the Zoo is a story set in Seattle about two kids who decide to sleep over at a zoo. Unfortunately, they soon discover that they have company; a burglar is also there. The book basically consists on that premise and setup leading to that. Besides being about one little episode, Terror at the Zoo is horribly written and amazed me with its corniness: at the end, the two kids escape by telepathically talking to an animal.So, let's sum it up: one episode, badly written, stupidly corny. A great read if you have Down syndrome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Book, A.W.","review":"I think this book is a awsome book.

I think this book might be a little intimidating to someone who is not familiar with construction or detailing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"I have the feeling that this book presents highly sensitive issues, particularly for people with a religious background. This book really means something to me, because it contains things that I've never heard before. To really understand it I have to have lots of spare time.

The man, as it were, suffered a trama and discovered he had multiple personality disorder. This was, of course, not the same thing.I just don't get this movie. I don't get how someone could be this self centered as to put their family through something like this. The guy waits until age 50 something to confess that he's really a woman trapped in a man's body, confesses it to their minister rather than his wife first, and then expects the world to accept him. Somehow I doubt a town full of guys named Billy Bob would understand, least of all anyone in or outside my family. The guy should've seen a shrink, but then again had he seen a shrink there wouldn't have been a movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I've never written a review before, but I was so impressed with this movie, I felt like I should write something. Even though I personally don't deal with the specific issues in this film, I was deeply touched by Jane Anderson's script and the performances by Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson are nothing short of incredible - definitely some of the best work either has ever done. I do have to agree that Jessica Lange steals the show. Her reactions to what is happening to her are exactly what I imagine someone in her shoes might go through. I liked the way church issues were dealt with as well, although it wasn't surprising that Roy was treated as an outcast by the members of the congregration. Sad, but often the case.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs inspiration. Very powerful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructional","review":"As an entertainment item, this video falls short except for those of voyeuristic bent. As an instructional treatise, this video lends reference to those of the community trying to \\"break the ice\\" and express their feelings to loved ones. For this latter category, I highly recommend this DVD. But be aware, as Irma (Jessica) points out, 'reading reference is frivolous and unproductive.' Those who don't want education will refuse to accept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Normal","review":"It's too bad HBO movies aren't eligible for Oscar considerations because their \\"made-for-TV\\" flicks are far far better than most Hollywood garbage out there. While it wasn't a powerhouse like last year's \\"Wit\\", \\"Normal\\" was still a solid movie that deals with a tough issue (sex change and acceptance) with a great sense of humor, without ever being trite or turning it into a farce as most Hollywood movies would have done. Tom Wilkinson and Jessica Lange are fantastic as always, but it's Hayden Panettiere who steals the show as their daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and worthwhile","review":"Originally made for HBO, this unusual drama follows an Iowa couple whose lives are thrown into turmoil by the husband's revelation that he wants to change his gender. In the central roles of Roy, the husband, and Irma, his at first disbelieving, then supportive wife, Tom Wilkinson and Jessica Lange give superb performances. There is strong work by Hayden Panettiere as their sharp-tongued daughter as well. In a society where people are regularly murdered for trying to break out of their physically assigned gender roles, the relative gentleness with which Roy is treated by the obviously conservative small town where he lives seems a little optimistic. Nevertheless, the performances and an understated, observant script that avoids cliche raise this one above the level of a mere curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Foghat's Best","review":"NIGHT SHIFT is a great Rock And Roll album. Combining Southern Rock, Blues Rock, & Boogie Rock, and playing them with a Hard Rock crunch, Foghat came up with a great signature sound. NIGHT SHIFT features some excellent songs; \\"Drivin' Wheel\\" is a great uptempo rocker, \\"Don't Run Me Down\\" shows a nice tempo change from a midtempo verse to a fast and frantic chorus, and is another great song. \\"Burnin' The Midnight Oil\\" is a great straight-ahead Hard-Edged Rock And Roll song, while \\"Night Shift\\" is a fantastic Hard Boogie song with a great sense of groove. \\"Hot Shot Love\\" is a good Rock song with some nice dynamics, and their cover of \\"Take Me To The River\\" is actually a bit reminiscent of their version of \\"I Just Wanna Make Love To You.\\" The album closes out with a solid Blues Rock song in \\"I'll Be Standing By.\\" There's not even one bad song on the album. If you don't own any Foghat CD's, this is a good one to start with, along with FOOL FOR THE CITY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Disconnect","review":"The item appears to be brass, but is really aluminum that is anodized a brass color. The crimp between the two isolated parts is poor so that they flop apart when the knob is loosened, requiring a few turns of the knob to be sure it does not contact. The end that is like a battery post is smaller diameter than a negative battery post, so the battery clamp has to be tightened to an excessively small size to hold properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective for my application","review":"I use this product on my motorhome. Since the motorhome does not move while the unit is disconnected, I have no problem with the contacts vibrating and touching each other (and no way of determining whether this might be a problem for other applications). And since I have no intention of ever removing this except to change batteries (which should be pretty rare with this in use), any problems with breaking when removed and reinstalled will be rare enough to accept the cost of a new unit. (I'm ordering a spare in case I ever need it.) This is a very simple device that seems to do the job very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I was looking for a well-made battery disconnector made in the USA, and this is not it!

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad fit","review":"This item was a bad fit for me and I suspect others. First the battery terminal opening is none standard and to large. I had to place a shim in it to get it to clamp well. Also the battery cable mount stem is oriented the wrong way to easily mount it cable based on how it was mounted. third the cable mount end moves around when you losen the knob which will allow it to make contact still if moved and reconnect the battery. All in all not a great design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Just half a turn of the knob and done, the battery is disconected and you can travel without the worry of coming back to find your car with a dead battery..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well constructed","review":"It was difficult to get a tight fit on the + battery cable of my van, and as I tried to tighten the bolt, the two halves of the disconnect seperated, allowing the cable to hit the positive terminal, quite dangerous. I was able to put the two halves back together, but even though I was now being very careful, the same thing happened again. Got it on on the third try, but the cable-to-disconnect connection is still a little loose, and I'm in a seaside environment, so I'm concerned that I will not have a good connection due to corrosion. The terminal post on this disconnect needs to be fatter, and the halves need to be crimped together more securely. I've had similar disconnects in the past and not had this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery of Pete's Cafe","review":"I've only seen reviews in the New York Times and another magazine, but the picture of Pete's Cafe in this book doesn't resemble the Pete's Cafe I remember just off of I-70 on old US 40 in Booneville, MO.

The detailed quality of the narration transports me into the daily physical experiences of a privileged western woman on a spiritual search in India in the mids 1950s. The author's stories serve as an example for the reader who can feel encouraged that in spite of her struggles and doubts in her search for spiritual enlightenment she was able to access her own spiritual wisdom through her commitment to her guru. Her guru's method of teaching took her to her limits and in meeting those challenges she serves as an inspiration to the reader. It is fascinating to read about her unexplained familiarity with the ashram, her guru and the complex sacred dances, even though this was her first visit to India."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"An uplifting, inspiring, enthralling diary.

Its title spoke to me and I could relate to it easily, because I was myself in a process of searching.The book is written in an easy language and yet there is depth and insight to it. What I like about the book is that it shows how much courage she had and her determination to make sense of her life. She gave up all she had in Canada in order to go to India, because her need to find the meaning and purpose of her life was so great.I'd recomend this book to anyone who is in search for the deeper meaning to life.

Michael Straczynski and drawn by Ron Garney. Focusing on Peter Parker/Spider-Man's role in the Marvel Universe-encompassing Civil War, the story develops the quasi-paternal relationship between Peter and Tony Stark as the Civil War escalates. Peter's shocking public revelation in issue 533 was the first non-cinematic Spider-Man news in a long time to be covered by mainstream US media. As the conflict intensifies, Peter grows to question his siding with Stark and eventually hides with MJ and Aunt May in a decrepit motel room. The book ends with a cliffhanger that left me eager to read issue 539. Reading the main Civil War TPB is helpful but not essential as there is enough of an independent plot here for those interested only in Spider-Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

If not then stick with the manual that comes with the camera. The title should have been enough for me \\"A Short Course...\\" but at present there aren't too many books out on the Digital Rebel. The construction of the book is of the lowest quality, i.e., plain copy paper that appears to have been produced through a standard copy machine available in any small office. $10.00 would have been a generous price for this product. I expect more when I go above the $30.00 threshold for a publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME VERY USEFUL INFO, BUT NOT ENOUGH SUBSTAN","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this book is simply not worth the money. Admitedly it has a few bits of useful information not easily available elsewhere, but for the most part it is simply a repetition (with a few interesting illustrations to make the point) of what is in the manual that comes with a camera. Even worse, much of the book is devoted to explaining fundamental photographic principles, available almost anywhere else. This is supposed to be a book exclusively about the Digital Rebel, not a primer on photo fundamentals. In addition, the poor print and binding quality is unforgivable in an era where even $5.95 books are professionally printed & professionally bound. Perhaps if the key information not found elsewhere about the digital rebel were distilled form here and compiled with other vital digital rebel info in another (shorter) book, it would be worth getting. But certainly not for the asking price of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for.","review":"I bought this book after getting my rebel xt and couldn't wait for it to arrive.

It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone.

When he had visions it was scary and convincing. It's scary when Devon Sawyer is a better actor than anyone in Final Destination 2.The film starts out with A.J. Cook's character going on a road trip with her friends. She has a vision of a huge traffic accident, she then blocks traffic to save everyone on that roads life. Then of course since everyone on that road was supposed to die death starts to kill them one by one like in the first film.The death scenes are incredibly gory and detailed but also seemed like ways you would've seen Kenny die on South Park. They're silly and heartless at the same time. It's like the film is trying to make death out to be funny a lot of time. Sorry but I didn't find 2 different scenes where young boys die right in front of their mothers very funny. I found the film highly disturbing actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw-droppingly amazing special effects crash!","review":"This movie has a coolness factor high enough to warrant the 4 star treatment! The automobile accident that starts off this film far surpasses the originals' airplane explosion for suspense, originality, and flat-out \\"how in the....did they do that?!\\" amazingness.While this isn't a GREAT film for the ages, it is certainly a film that can hold its own against more than a handful of films of similar nature. The characters are believable and fresh and run the gamut in age - it's no longer a \\"teen\\" flick.Look - I don't want to give away the nuances of the film - but remember it's a sequel to a \\"you-are-about-to-die-but-you-just-don't-know-how\\" film and it keeps that same suspense going, but it takes it a step further and makes it better.This is a case of a sequel being better than the film that spawned it.Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE ROTTEN HORROR FARE! (Spoiler Below)","review":"\\"Final Destination 2,\\" like it's predecessor, is a scary film: scarily bad. With the people knowing what signs to look for before a death occurs, there's no sense of terror: We pretty much KNOW how people are going to die. The few jump moments are put in as almost an afterthought. And the death scene at the end felt like a Monty Python gag than an actual horror film element. The cast does a descent job with what they got, but it's not enough to save this horrible horror film. For straight horror-film fans only; the rest can skip it.Movie/DVD Grade: D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detail to marvel at...","review":"This movie has the absolute best opening (ok, 10 minutes into it) sequence with a traffic accident to... um... die for. The incredible detail and horrific images put you uncomfortably close to such an experience. But why 4 stars? 'Cause ya know what's gonna happen... The plot is laid out for you regarding each character getting picked off. If you're a horror or suspense fan who enjoys special effects and a gruesome, yet eerily possible subject matter - I would recommend this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Destination 2 Review","review":"I said before and I'll say it again:While still bloody & gorey as before its still the same stuff you saw in the first movie. The cast is forgettable. The acting is passable. Some of the deaths here are more funny then they are scary like Kats,Rorys & Tims deaths. While not the worst of film I ever review but its still the same old stuff you saw before. Need I say more?

The way the characters die is just funny! My favorite has to be when the guy escapes the fire in his apartment and goes down the emergency ladder and the ladder stops before it gouges his eyes, he says Oh man that was close and he's smiling then wham! Right on his eyes, and the corpse is still smiling. Funny movie, too silly to be taken seriously, the sad thing is that I don't think they intentionally ment this as a comedy, and what about the end of the movie when they have an arm for dinner, if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, can that be really considered scary? It's stupid to take this movie seriously. Watch this movie if you want to laugh, because if you watch it for a horror fix like its intended, this movie just plain stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine horror flick.","review":"Being a fan of the first Final Destination, I was anxious to see this film. In many ways, I think the sequel outdoes the original in almost every aspect. The entire idea of mortals attempting to beat deaths design is very intriguing, and the director utilized this concept to its fullest. The opening crash scene is fantastic. With multiple camera angles, wonderfully paced dolly shots and flashy pyrotechnics, the pace for the rest of the movie is adequately set. From here the cast is put through some honestly horrific sequences, coupled with some surprisingly gruesome and creative deaths. The PVC pipe dispatch and the barbed-wire scene makes this film well worth watching.

The death scenes and scenarios were captivating. That has all gone stale in it's sequel. Yes, many people continue to die in Final Destination 2 but this time you're actually rooting for them to die. The acting in this film is so atrocious it's not even funny. I don't even know who the hell these people were, but man they cannot act, especially the female lead. This time a group of people cheat death after escaping a deadly traffic accident. Some of the deaths are pretty gory which is cool but the acting is so bad it ruins the film. The ending is utterly ridiculous and all but assures yet another sequel. The only thing I can guarantee about the sequel is that I won't be there! Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless Bluray","review":"I got this BD yesterday & was expecting a better version than the DVD but unfortunately its the worst bluray Ive gotFirstly there is no startup menu no subtitles pop up menu has just one option of sound no scene selection ( if you have to watch a particular chapter you have to start from begining & manually go to the particular chapter which is frustating after paying almost 35$.)

Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) returns to find Kim (AJ Cook) in the same situation as the first film only this time it is a major freeway accident.

Sure enough this happens and the teenager and her friends soon realize that although they cheated Death on the freeway Death is still waiting for them. You can forget the rest of the plot in this movie. It just seems to be an updated riff on the Friday the 13th movies where you get to see teenagers killed in a variety of imaginative ways.

First of all I am one of those guys that has too defy the limits of horror movies, if there is a horror movie that nobody else will see and that my friends'll flake out on...... I'm still there. I rented this movie one day and trust me after I watched it, I was afraid too move it affected me so badly, but trust me people that is WHAT A HORROR MOVIE IS and needs to be.

Way better than the first! Gorier than the first too, Gory straight through till the end, which I laughed my but off at the end. No one in this movie dies \\"normally\\" like some horror movies. Each person has an agonizing, traumatic, brutal death. I thought the death scenes were the most original I had seen in a long time. (for those that thought this movie was too gory, or over done, then they have never worked in the medical field or around death to know this is reality, ...)I also like how the movie leaves you guessing how each person will die, just when you think one thing will happen, something else does. Truly awesome! I will put this on my top list of horror movies of all time, right up their with hellraiser ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sequels I have seen in awhile!","review":"This movie was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while. Final Destionation doesn't have the best acting, but it has the best gore! This movie was thrilling and disgustingly [yucky]! The plot wasn't exactly better, and I didn't like the fact the (Devon Sawa, main character in Final Destination) dies in between the two movies. I can't wait for hopefully the third installment which there should be, and there is many rumors that there will be! This is one of the best horror flicks since 28 days Later, and The Ring. 3 1/2 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death has no Patience Anymore for Nuances","review":"This movie is too contrived, the whole movie consisting of build-ups to a predictable climax. The first movie was better because any action taken by Death is portrayed as ambiguous, something that could have been an accident of Nature or a consequence of circumstances. Here in this movie, it is obviously Death out to get his guy or gal with longly drawn-out events happening that could not possibly occur naturally.Too gruesome and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequal? no","review":"With the success of Final Destination 1, this would have been a great sequal of sort, if they had put more time in writing the story line.

And also this movie is geared towards and audience of 20 somethings that has been warped by watching nothing but MTV and would be stupid enough to believe what they saw in the movie and would accually believe that the reaper is after them. Plus They SEVERELY over exaggerated the blood-shed.The only cool parts of it were the accident in the begining.( But when I watched that part again it sucked.)And the other cool part with the same results when i watched that part the second time was the when the window fell on the kid and crushed him. 2 parts cool once and sucked the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"I too have not seen the movie and really don't care too.I'm with the lady who was saying you can have good scary movieswithout all the gross things they are putting in movies these days.The Ring for example,no real gross stuff....just a good scary movie.I don't know about alot of people out there,but i don't really enjoy seeing people cut in half or on fire or their brains getting knocked out of their head.I really think some writers have sick minds these days.Just give us a good scary movie-a good thriller-without making me want to throw up.I used to enjoy scary movies.....now i can't even watch one all the way through.I end up closing my eyes through half the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Mess With Death!...","review":"FINAL DESTINATION 2 has another group of people who have escaped death, only to find themselves hunted by the reaper.

Small section with lion anatomy and few images in the back of odd animals like a bat and seal, sadly no birds. The book was first published in the 50's and while it says \\"for Artist\\" it's more like a vet hand book.

Unfortunately, this book spends too much time showcasing Herb Ryman's non-Disney art--which is pretty mediocre--and not enough space showcasing his Disney work. The highlight of the book--Ryman's first illustration of the soon-to-be-built Disneyland--is spread across two pages, but the page break makes it nearly impossible to decipher what's in the middle of the drawing. (It should have perhaps been on a fold-out, or at least on a single, uninterrupted page.) Other great illustrations, especially early renderings of Tomorrowland, are printed in extremely small 3\\" images, making them very hard to read. All in all, I'd say don't bother with this book. Ryman's best drawings are already showcased in many other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless with a Macbook","review":"These DVD-Rs became 5 coasters after my Macbook tried to work with them.

Prior to reading Unspeakable Shakespeare, I was not a huge fan of Shakespeare, however his usage and encouragement of pop culture as a source of educating and sharing Shakespeare are remarkable. Although the title, Unspeakable Shaxxxspeare seems frightening to a morally sensitive reader (like myself), reading the book, I found that Burt simply uses everyday issues that are familiar to demonstrate the truly beautiful and artistic nature of Shakespeare. Further his intelligence and appreciation of Shakespeare cause the reader to be less focused on the moral content of the book only to gain a greater understanding and admiration for Burt and Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A savvy, highly informative, yet entertaining work.","review":"A groundbreaking new work by an erudite theorist who has the exceedingly good taste to recognize students of unusual merit.

A great deal of space is used on deriving formulas.It is without a doubt that the authors are exceptional minds in their fields, and have a fine understanding of the material.

We have used ours with our children since 2000. It is to be used with an Advent wreath as a daily devotion. Each day a candle is lit, a scripture read, a reflection on the scripture, a song, prayer and activity. The activity is done with a nativity set. For example the first night the stable is set up empty. The next night Mary & Joseph are place in an area across the room. Each night different figures are added and moved closer to the stable. Finally they all arrive at the stable on Christmas Eve and then baby Jesus is placed in the manger. Through Epiphany the wise men are added and move to the manger. This same author has written a similar book for the season of Lent. I'm sorry they are out of print since they are such meaningful traditions. I have purchased many as gifts.

The bickering between the military and the politicians got overwhelmingly annoying and childish with idle threats this way and that. And the military strategy was simply terrible. The final \\"battle\\" made absolutely no sense what so ever. What were supposed to be strong military commanders of the Vong, the Remnant, and the Republic just came up with the most ridiculous plan of all.

Though the insturments and vocals are all smoothly put together, the songs, which all began sounding the same, don't go anywhere. This album isn't horrible, there's just nothing exciting about it.

Remember 15 minutes later when you stopped doing that because you knew you'd be embarrassed by it later? Hank skipped the last step and published the journal instead. This stream-of-barely-consciousness is the literary equivalent of a toddler throwing a temper tantrum in a grocery store; devoid of logic, impervious to reason and totally unpleasant. Avoid with purpose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I recommend this book to everyone that I can find! It is wonderful in that it gives the reader the imagination to look at the Bible as more than something to guide your life spiritually, but figure out a way to make the people in the pages (who you have very little information on) and they come to life. I appreciate the author for giving us this creative license to start to believe that each and every one of them could be human, much as us."},{"rating":"2","title":"the red tent","review":"An absolute great story. Emotionally moving with every read. I've recommended it to everyone, and My favorite book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Sadly, I could not get through it. Pastor Paul F. M. Zahl wants to reclaim Jesus from the historical movement that wants to reduce him to a simple Jewish teacher, whose teachings were hijacked by the Apostle Paul and turned into a new religion. But, Rev. Zahl spends the first part of the book defending his position against the charge of anti-Semitism. Indeed, he is so defensive that the book just drags as he again and again denies any anti-Semitic feelings.Combining his defensiveness with a general dryness of writing, I just found this book too much to take. Now, it might be that the book got better later, but Rev. Zahl already lost me, I have moved onto another book. I highly recommend AGAINST this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Other works","review":"Try reading 'The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man' for some true scholarship and unbiased analysis of the Jesus myth.Maybe too reality based for some of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you say, \\"Disappointing?\\"","review":"The book is alright, but the information that's even remotely interesting is few and far between.

Its examples are well chosen and well written, and the mix of theory and application make it a great reference for teaching. My only problem with it is that it did not associate itself with a software package, which hurts its use in applied courses. I am forced to use a different Biostatistics textbook for my course (which includes SAS), but I develop my lecture material largely from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Interpretations of Gatsby","review":"I am not sure where the other reviewer is coming from but this is a well-written book on Gatsby - highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GLAM ROCK WITH DEPTH!","review":"Definetly one of the most under-rated bands of the 80-90's. Great albumn from start to finish. \\"Heart-break blvd.\\" had some comercial success, but this band deserves much more. Alot of thought was put into the writing of these songs, and it shows. Their third (and unfortunately last) albumn \\"Violent New Breed\\" is excellent as well, although is very much techno sounding, and sounds nothing at all like this albumn."},{"rating":"2","title":"what rock and roll should be","review":"sad there arent any more bands out there these days that sound like these guys, rock and roll at its best"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best!","review":"By far the best album from Shotgun Messiah as well as any other band in that time frame! The entire song list rocks from start to finish. They have a unique sound to their music that is instantly recognizable. It's hard to compare them to anyone cause they are so far superior on this record. From the slow songs (if you want to call them that), to the mid tempo, to the all out rockers, this release has it all. Take a listen. You won't be disappointed, and if you are, you don't know music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Cody rocks!","review":"I love this recording!

I got some answers going thru papers after he died. (We were married for 3 years but, because of jobs and needing to sell a house - we lived in different states.) But, I still had many whys. I wasn't 100% convienced he was in heaven. This book answered a lot of whys for me & assured me my husband is in heaven. Then gave me a way to heal my hurts and doubts. If you need a book to help you thru a suicide- this is the best one I read. I recommend it highly and I am sorry for your loss. But, God is good- it is not a coincidence you are wondering if this book can help you. It can help you move beyond the grief and dispair. But, you have to make that choice. Mr. Cox will give you the tools and God's word on it.

If I had to pick one I'd probably recommend Max as Rick Steves can come off as a bit boring nearing grating after a couple of hours. Steves books are thorough however and make for a good source (though Karen Brown's are the best for quaint inns and travel itineraries)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn on, put headphones on, sit down and hold on!","review":"For those who have an open mind and ears, this \\"LP worth of tunes\\" is IT! It's an emotional, agressive, funny, and spiritual roller coaster ride from start to end. This LP would be my all time favorite if not for Todd's first \\"Utopia\\" album. The only song on it that I don't love is the last track, Sons of 1984, only do to it being recorded live with a lesser quality sound. Understandably so considering the amount of people playing and singing it.Todd is a multi-talented musical genius that has the guts to go in directions very few others will try. Critics usually hate him for it but that's the best sign of something good, also because it's so different that you need to listen a couple of times to appreciate it. Then you're hooked.I strongly recommend this album, Todd's Utopia album and A Wizzard a True Star album, then buy all the rest of his works while you're at it. All good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Todd at his eccentric Best","review":"This was my favorite record in my last year of school at Boise High.During the summer i had my own apartment-and was allready on my own.I had a nice stereo in my bedroom with four speakers-sort of anearly version of surround-sound.It was the perfect set up for listentingto this fantastic album with it's wild array of songs and an even widerassortment of instrumentation.This album has the most electric guitarof any of Rungrens catalog and if you want to hear some amazing electricguitar playing-this is the one to buy.Rundgren is right up there withthe greatist rock guitarist of all time and this album will show youwhy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 9th grader in Little Rock","review":"Back when this came out I was a 9th Grader in Little Rock. The general mentality among my 'cool' friends was, \\"Dude, he's got green hair'.

With only a handful of Todd gems (Don't You Ever Learn, The Last Ride, A Dream Goes On Forever, Useless Begging) and a ton of throw-away bombast and synthesizer twiddle, Todd seemed to be paying more thought to his hair color than to his songwriting. \\"I think you know...\\" he sings on the first cut. Wrong, Todd. Fact is, we're totally confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have all of Todds solo stuff & Utopia too and I really don't like this record. There are no songs of the calibre of Can We Still Be Friends or Zen Archer and too many 'hey, i'm on LSD' mess around in the studio type affairs. It's kind of like Todds White Album or Physical Graffitti but without being any good. Go and buy Faithful / Runt or anything else really. Except Ra by Utopia coz that's pretty dubious too.Sorry! Todd is still god but this one just does not hit home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"You cannot be a Todd fan without having this in your collection.

There is only one really good song and a couple other songs are okay. I purchased this album because of someone elses recommendation, but I would not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't You Ever Learn?","review":"Todd's fifth solo album and second two record set, simply called Todd, was first released in February 1974 and features Todd's growing interest in synthesizers. This is a great Todd album with most of the songs being classics. This originally a two record set with poster(the new Japan has the mini poster which also includes a bonus different Wolfman Jack). What a great setlist-I Think You Know/The Spark Of Life, An Elpee's Worth Of tunes, A Dream Goes On Forever, The Last Ride, Everybody's Going To Heaven, Useless Begging, Sidewalk Cafe, Izzat Love, Heavy Metal Kids, and Don't You Ever Learn all being highlights. The basic track for Sons Of 1984 was recorded at the first Utopia concert in Central Park. Many of the songs on here would become concert staples for Utopia in the '70's. A must own for all Todd fans and once again, if you can afford it, go with the Japan JVC issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"i think you know","review":"i dont care what anybody else says this is the geatest album of all time.todd is ,was ,and probably will always be over the top!thats what makes us love him and his music!!this album has serious ,funny,poppy,heavy everything all in one,like the other reviewer said put on a pair of headphones and crank em up cause their really gonna help ya on this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"I bought this for my brother in law for christmas, he loved it.

I was astounded how someone could spit in the face of the economic forces that provided him with the lavish lifestyle he so enjoyed. This book does an excellent job of portraying the nascence and subsequent decay of one of the world's most corrupted minds. The breadbasket of Africa was turned into desert by this man. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue of Votes/Guns","review":"2 stars is not a judgment on the quality of this work. No, the low rating is due to the misleading title of the book. As an earlier reviewer suspected, this book simply is a \\"revised and updated\\" version of \\"Our Votes, Our Guns\\" -- which I already own! Needless to say, I would not have purchased this book had I known that. Yes there is a small footnote on the BACK OF THE BOOK, but you don't see that until the book arrives.Furthermore, Meredith doesn't even provide and introduction telling one just what parts he has updated or revised. I'm sure this version contains valuable commentary on events since the earlier book, but there's no easy way to find the new material.Overall I'm sure the book still is a valuable introduction to the insanity that is the Mugabe regime (that's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1). If, however, you have read the earlier \\"Our Votes, Our Guns,\\" save your money and wait for \\"Dinner with Mugabe\\" to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zimbabwe's tragedy","review":"This book looks at the rule of Robert Mugabe, whose story is unfortunately like so many others in Africa. Having fought against colonialism he became Rhodesia's first, and ONLY, president.This biography looks at his background, his political activities prior to the election which propelled him to power and his seemingly never-ending thirst for personal power, regardless of the cost to his long-suffering people. If you are interested in seeing how a country which once was the bread-basket of southern Africa became gripped in famine and despair, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Legally\\" Wonderful","review":"Great musical adaptation of the hit fillum.

I didnt think this was going to be worth my time. I love broadway, but just the fact that one of my favorite movies would have musical numbers was insane. When i heard MTV was putting the show on tv, i decided to try it out. I loved it. It wasnt until recently when Mtv was putting on the competition that i really like hearing the music.All the songs were great. Very good rythem to some of them, and very meaningful. It can feel was Elle Woods is feeling when she sings the songs. The best songs that have you laughing are \\"Positive\\" and \\"Bend and Snap\\"This is definitely one musical you should see and buy the soundtrack to. You will be singing the songs even when you are not playing the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legally Blonde the Musical Rocks!!!","review":"I loved the movie, and was extremely excited when I heard that MTV was going to air the musical. I loved it! I was even more excited when I had a chance to see the show live when the touring company came to LA. My nieces and I had a lot of fun together and I couldn't stop singing the songs afterward. So I bought the CD and now I can relive the show anytime I want. The CD includes photos with the original Broadway cast, as well as all the lyrics. It's like 75% of the show on one CD. If you love the show, then the CD is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a real blonde !!!","review":"This production is not in Australia but my 16yo dd loves the music and it is fantastic.

The opening number starts out strong with such a catchy beat and bouncy rhymes, but it's downhill from there. Most of the songs feel empty and forgettable or else have really bland lyrics (I cringed especially during \\"Chip on my Shoulder\\"). And don't even get me started on that pointless \\"Ireland\\" song. The only song I would really recommend is \\"Legally Blonde\\" which is a nice ballad. I'm a huge fan of fun, musical comedies. My favorite musical last season was The Wedding Singer, whose score is 10x better than Legally Blonde's. But this show's music (and the show itself) just fall flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"this cd was an impulse buy and a huge mistake. having loved the movie and enjoying musicals i thought it might be fun. instead it was just excruciating. avoid this cd at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"When the Amazon Editorial Review said that the score for this was BETTER than Wicked with Idina Menzel I said to myself 'This must be really good.\\" Blah! It's AWFUL! The girls' voices are nasally and annoying, the guys' voices are forgettable and bland, and the songs in general are TERRIBLE. It's like mixing the hoakiest of broadway musicals with soul-piercing cheerleader squeals and the instrumentation characteristic of every bad pop song (of which there are many). My advice, spend your money on something which is actually worth buying. No words can describe how bad this musical is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD","review":"This CD is absolutely fantastic! I had the privilege of seeing the original cast perform in New York, and have been singing \\"Omigod you guys\\" ever since. The quality of this recording is great, and the CD includes all of the greatest moments from the musical. This has quickly become one of my favorite CDs, and maybe it's just because I'm in a sorority, but I truly appreciate how wonderful this production is. I recommend this CD/musical for anyone who likes musicals, fun, and the color pink! Even if you're not a girly-girl, this is still a little something for everyone. So, stop reading this review and start singing along with you own CD! It's so good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Really a cute show. I was pretty skeptical about it (what is this trend of bringing movies to Broadway? Doesn't anyone have any original ideas anymore?), but it's really fun. Don't expect anymore than the movie, but it's a great musical version of that. My only beef is that all the singers seem vocally tired - Orfeh particularly. It seems like none of them really let go and wail, when it seems like they could, and their vibrato is often uneven. The songs are catchy, and overall it's definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun musical","review":"The musical is way better than the movie, except they forgot a couple good spots. Overall the musical is funnier, funner and well done. You have to pay attention though, and think about it, or you'll miss some of the gags."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Legally Blonde the movie and so I was really excited to see the musical. I almost fell asleep and wanted nothing more than to just leave the theatre.

They appear to be made well and represent a good value for the most part. This particular model IWB would be 4 or 5 stars if the belt clip provided more security. Uncle Mike's uses a plastic clip without any spring to it. It relies completely on the little \\"L\\" hook on the bottom to hold it to your belt. Unfortunately it does not do that very well at all.Because of the clip, I'd suggest another manufacture for this model as the design flaw is a big one. That said, the construction of the holster itself appears to be of good quality using a soft fabric which is non abrasive against skin or clothing- which is a plus. I also purchased Uncle Mike's inside the pocket at the same time so I don't yet know how they will wear. I am very happy with the ITP holster.

You can't beat the price. So far so good.UPDATE 5-23-12: I got the size 12 and I love it. Fits perfectly. Very good product and a great value.

Eventually it got worse and I tried to fix the problem by tightening the torx screw (that didn't even have loctite on it) that holds the blade to the handle. All this did was make it a little bit better, but a LOT harder to open, and eventually it started loosening and pulling away again.

Now the format is a bit over the top with all the little captions. The recipes titles get a little annoying- they are so silly and its unclear just what it makes.

He shows how the poor stayed poor, New Haven CT stayed depessed, crime rose, and things got worse all as millions of federal and local dollars were being spent on the city.But then he takes a big step in the wrong direction: he comes out with a immensely favorable view of Mayor Lee - the man who directed all the bad programs and still thought they were successful. Powledge would do better to realize that the Mayor's old-guard paternalism was destructive for the city's revitalization; Lee directed and planned when he should have allowed people to build their own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these sheets!","review":"Soft and cool although they do wrinkle, but once on the bed they smooth out nicely.

As with every other sheet set I have purchased for the deep mattress, the fitted sheet does fit OK. However, if one wants to tuck in the flat sheet on one side of the mattress, there is hardly any sheet left to cover the bed!

The sheets are VERY thin and do not have the softness or body of 100% cotton. I ordered white sheets and the set that arrived was cream colored and yellowed. A bleach wash removed some of the yellow. I would not buy this product again nor do I recommend it. I think Amazon should state that the sheets are made in China. I need 100% cotton because I have an allergy problem with synthetics such as polyester. I hope these sheets are all cotton but the thinness is reminescent of polyester.

Nevertheless, it retains far more direct quotations from the book than any other that comes to mind, and if nothing else it's worth watching Ms. Ehle, who has yet to be surpassed in the role of Elizabeth Bennett. Needless to say, the book itself remains the best of all possible ways to experience Ms. Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good Quality image.

Before I read the book, I saw the movie and fell in love with it and Mr. Darcy. I'm a real fan of Colin Firth, but I never saw the transformation in his character that Matthew MacFayden shows in the movie or how much in love he was with Elizabeth.

Of course, he could get music out of a lamp cord. Not me. I need help. Unbelievable that these are rated as Light gauge, or even medium light. Solid mediums.

It's territory that Dickens has covered before, but this album has a compactness and sureness about it that will stop you in your tracks. Several songs feature a bunch of \\"usual suspects\\" bluegrass super-pickers, such as Jerry Douglas, Blaine Sprouse, Dudley Connell, etc. -- Hazel Dickens is one of the few modern artists who seems capable of getting these slick studio cats to play *her* music, and not theirs...

His master of the English language in writing about a scientific discipline is unsurpassed. The book is a \\"standard\\" for anyone seeking to become a Forensic Document Examiner or any police Investigator who investigates crimes of forgery or disputed documents.

The plot was thrilling and smart--not the typical Hollywood car-chase, shoot-em-up adrenaline rush. Having said all that, they ruined everything good about this movie with an unbelievable 9/11 conspiracy theory twist near the end. Not only is the plot twist stupid, it's been done over and over again--the US government and the CIA are behind everything wrong in the world, blah, blah, blah. In this movie, the government conspires to prop up drug dealing and terrorism--wow, that's brilliant. I've got news for you, drug dealing and terrorism are thriving on their own without government help. Most of all I'm just angry at another potentially good movie wasted with a staggeringly foolish storyline.

The recipes call for a can of non-stick cooking spray along with perishable foods such as hotdogs, fruit, eggs, etc. The recipe ideas are only suitable if one is camping next to a grocery store! There is even a recipe which suggests you let your child make a necklace out of dried fruit and cereal and that the child wear it around their neck for snack food. If you're trying to attract a bear this might be a great idea.I would not recommend this book for anything but the backyard camper.

So, snippet it is; but what has been included gives no introduction, no explanation, no explication, no nothing. The tape is of different bits of Shakespeare's plays which run rapidly into each other. To get any fair use out of this work the listener needs to sit with a printed copy of the complete works sitting on his or her lap otherwise the whole exercise is meaningless. Shakespeare requires understanding what is being said in context. This tape would be better served if it included a brief introduction regarding which play the snippet came from and how the dialog ties in with the action. Without this information only those who have read all the plays will not be lost. There are not many who can claim that background. So, as a stand-alone audio, for most of us, this tape is a sad waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never say Never","review":"It was extremely difficult to put this book down once I started it!

You'll receive one that is threaded and only comes up about a half way as the picture.Besides the deceiving picture, the build quality is low. The floor flange was cast in such a way that it looks like it was done by hand in a sand mold (not in a good way).

It definitely is not for me. Having a rough beard and sensitive skin is...well not so great. Throw in having ingrown hair issues...practically a disaster. That being said, this product does have alcohol in it so it burns like a mother when put on post shave. I figured to get rid of ingrown hairs I'd have to deal with the initial pain as long as everyone dealt with my screaming when I put it on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only issue that I have with the product. I probably didn't use it long enough to see any real results, but what it did do was give me acne(tiny whiteheads) whenever I used it. So I discontinued use, and those little buggers went away. Unfortunately, I'm still stuck with those pesky ingrowns. I'll have to go back to using my other treatment solution. The major reason I gave this a shot was more product for the money.

However, I'm not quite ready for the 19th century mountain man look, so I have to use sensitive skin shaving and skin products, as well as change my razor blades often. Even then I get ingrown hairs every week or so. I use Anthony logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment twice a day, even when I don't have any ingrown hairs. It helps to prevent and treat the few that I get. I won't say it will completely prevent users from getting ingrown hairs, but it will make them less frequent and serious.

Jim Carrey is the greatest physical comedian I've ever seen. I think he was way ahead of his time in this film. Johnny Depp and Sacha Cohen are winning major acting awards for what Jim Carrey was doing ten years ago. The great thing about comedy like this is there is no such thing as over-the-top.

I don't make 20-25 mil per movie like he does. In my opinion, we could all use a lil more laughing around this joint, anyhoo. So, get in the comfy chair or plush sofa and kick your shoes off and prepare for serious chuckles. War? High taxes? 7 Horsemen? Blues?--Whatabout'em?

The Mask, Ace Ventura Pet Detective, Dumb & Dumber and The Truman Show were much better movies in my opinion and I would give them all 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they pay this guy $40M per picture?","review":"Any director or producer will tell you that actors in a comedy must 'play it straight!' Carrey thinks HE'S funny (a kiss of death for a comedy)and has trouble regulating his level of obnoxiousness. Although this is an old film it still rates a review.

Viewers of the first film easily remember Courtney Cox, Sean Young and Tone Loc as witnesses/victims of Carrey's outrageous humor. The sequel, however, is a one-man vehicle that devotes almost every second to Carrey. If Carrey was acting his heart out, it MAY have turned out better. Unfortunately, it seems as if Carrey is delivering lifelessly, in the hopes of moving on fast.No co-stars, bad laughs and no storyline... save yourself the trouble, skip this flick and stick with the original Ace Ventura, as Jim Carrey should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, this was just bad","review":"Ok, first off let me point out I am a Jim Carrey fan.

But this movie was simply terrible. For about 89 of the 90 minutes I sat in boredom, hoping that the movie would suddenly get better, then losing hope very quickly. The twists in the plot-line were about as interesting as the curves in my garden hose. The plot-line was also very very shallow, and did not engage or ensnare me at all.

I don't recall laughing once in the whole film. How anyone could give this piece of cineamatic crap/trash a raiting of 3 is beyond me! Heck there is no way humanly possible that I will ever like this film. The charecter of Ace himself has become horribly different, while in the first film Ace was eccentrice, but then he was likeable, in the one he a just plain jerk and is very unlikeable.

The Merchant-Ivory team, which made movies like Remains Of The Day, used to make movies about India. Jhabvala, of course, has written all of the team's movies, and a fair helping of fiction as well. This dates back to the early days of Merchant-Ivory (1973).Two of the titular travelers are westerners who have come to India, one for apparently no reason other than to relax, and one to experience enlightment. They are offset by two Indians. The paths of all four quickly intertwine.This is a book about two things. On the one hand, it's a meticulous character study. On the other hand, it's all about westerners interfering with other cultures. It's a time capsule look at what the Beatles wrought in the wake of their visit to India. It's engrossing, well-written (simple and straighforward, no flowery metaphors), and, to a certain extent, it's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Stuff","review":"While I'm as much of a Gordie Howe fan as the next guy, these videos (it's a series) are NOT for anyone who isn't ready to listen to Gordie talk.

According to the author, Will Tuttle, these is a direct consequence of the greedy and violent manner in which we acquire our food and the resulting society that we live in. The link between the two, which may appear unclear to some readers, is outlined through the course of the book which relates many of our problems to the choice which we make when we sit down to dinner. The book is easily readable, well researched and offers a solution to the question of 'when will we live in a peaceful world?' Anyone who is earnestly seeking an honest answer to this question should read this book as it offers a solution to the problem which has puzzled humanity for millions of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Everyone should read this book!

Mr. Tuttle is not a scientist.-Phrases are repeated over and over. The book could have used a good editor.-The elites of the meat -military-faming-medical-pharmaceutical-government-media cabal of the dominant herding culture that suppresses the feminine collude to control the underclass and constantly supply their industries with a constant supply of victims.

Author Will Tuttle, who has received a Ph.D. in the philosophy of education from the University of California, Berkeley, examines the deleterious medical, hormonal, environmental, and societal effects of consuming meat or other animal products such as milk or eggs. Forcefully recommending a change toward the higher consciousness and compassion for animals and humans alike that is veganism, The World Peace Diet is passionate in its denouncement of myths perpetuated by the meat, milk and egg industry and its endorsement of the health and spiritual benefits that encompass making a change toward a cruelty-free diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Path To Spiritual Awarenes","review":"This is the most comprehensive piece of work that I have come across explaining the connection between animal consumption and the disconnection from ones consciousness.

Parts of the book are difficult to read. It is not easy for us to realize how cruelly animals are treated. Yet this is something that needs to be made public - not in a judgmental way - in a compassionate way. Once we are made aware of what is wrong - we can make the changes necessary where cruelty is replaced with compassion.

After being messed around every which way, she discovers a young man (they could have found one more attractive, but no less...)she rescues from death by poverty and hunger.

Sacre Bleu!None of these people are very nice, but they don't deserve the mischief Cousin Bette inflicts upon them. And what is Jenny Cadine's motivation for letting herself be used in Bette's schemes. Nothing makes sense, and the whole movie was just bad misfire. Avoid if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mostly good cast, wasted on a poor script","review":"A very uneven and rather unsatisfying, though beautifully costumed, film based on the writings of Balzac. Elisabeth Shue is very much miscast as a singer. She does not convince at all, and her accent is ridiculous. Jessica Lange, Bob Hoskins and Hugh Laurie do better, but the script is lacking. Too bad the latter three actors were wasted on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cousin Bette","review":"A marvellously interwoven plan of subtle revenge. Beware how you treat your poor relations.Jessica Lange was a supposedly helpful characterbut so conniving at the same time, a magnificent performance. Also Bob Hoskins and Hugh Laurie were excellent and Elizabeth Shue played her role to perfection.I couldn't warm to Aden Young, something was lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toby Stephens fans - save your money","review":"Toby Stephens has a very small supporting role in this film (I'd estimate maybe 5 minutes screen time). He is funny, cute, and overlooked in favor of very inferior actors. Bob Hoskins is surprisingly good as a French aristocrat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - before the 1972 videotape disintegrates!","review":"Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD. This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television. Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD. For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available! (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Lange gives superb performance","review":"Although I have not read Balzac's original, I enjoyed this funny yet tragic movie a lot. Jessica's impersonation of an extremely complicated heroine, cousin Bette, is exceptional. Even if you cannot enjoy a story itself, I am sure that you can definitely enjoy her perfomance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash!","review":"I'll never forget the Masterpiece Theater mini-series from 1971. It was a sheer delight. Jessica Lange's Bette is a defanged, declawed pussy cat when compared to Margaret Tyzack's fierce tigeress whose fangs and claws are lethally sharp and carefully concealed.I keep hoping PBS will rebroadcast the original series. Until then, forget the insipid movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent drama about a hauntingly psychopathic villainess","review":"Jessica Lange gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance as an extremely dangerous, shrewd, and mentally disturbed woman. In the drama Jessica, as Cousin Bette, saves a young artist from an attempted suicide and believes that his life belongs to her. Later Jessica's younger cousin steals the artist from Cousin Bette and there begins a tale of revenge. And revenge, as the Italian proverb states, \\"is a dish that people of taste prefer to eat cold\\". Jessica then plots how to destroy those who have caused her emotional pain. There are no limits to the events that she cleverly orchestrates in the background including murder. Jessica validates the saying that \\"Hell hath no fury as that of woman scorned\\". Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her performance in \\"Blue Sky\\"; however I believe her performance as \\"Cousin Bette\\" is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem from 1998","review":"Jessica Lange gives one of her strongest performances in this brutally funny revenge story. This period piece has more in common with \\"Jackie Brown\\" than it does Merchant-Ivory films. I hope this movie will be rediscovered someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stinker!","review":"God awful dramatization of Balzac's story of the same name. Lange and Shue are dreadfully miscast, and the script writer completely failed to capture this wry and bitter tale.If you want to see this story with real meat on its bones, try finding a copy of the 1971 Masterpiece Theatre production. Margaret Tyzack makes Jessica Lange look like milk toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Adaptation","review":"The costumes were great....but this movie did no justice to the novel. \\"Cousin Bette\\" the novel is excellent , \\"Cousin Bette\\" the movie, is dreadful. I understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie, but these changes were awful and they took something very important (the Baroness) away from the story...If you haven't read the novel, you will probably find this movie to be decent. If you have read the novel, be prepared to be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sure not Masterpiece Theatre","review":"After seeing Masterpiece Theatre's version approx. 1982, I was excited to see this. PBS has never reshown the Masterpiece since then, as far as I can discover. Anyways, this movie was okay, just not something to write home about. Still, what could they do with a 2 hr movie, versus 6 one hour shows.However, I ordered the paperback, unabridged book and it is delicious!

Written in an acedemic style that's hard to plod through, there have been some that I've just given up on. I'm glad to say this book is not one of those.Written in a style that's easy to read and understand, this book delves into not only the life lived by royalty and the priviledged in the year of Magna Carta (hence the title of the book), but the lives of various social strata of the time.If you have an interest in medieval history, especially English medieval history, then I would say you would enjoy this book.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful cover","review":"I love these, got 2 chair covers and a couch cover.

I threw it away when I was done - and I NEVER throw out books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as the previous reviews","review":"This second rendition by Pearson is not that bad. Why is everybody so grossed out by this title, if you think about it, not as bad as CSI, and some movies that show graphic medical procedures. This has great characters in Mathews and Boldt. Some humor, action, intrigue and suspense, yes some of the descriptions of the operations are graphic but much more tame than a CSI autopsy on TV and I bet these reviewers show put the book down love CSI. I was skeptical after reading some of these reviews before I read the book but I read it anyway and liked it. Pearson is too good not to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"long, repetitive, mildly interesting","review":"I'd recommend UNDERCURRENTS, but not this one. A good first hundred pages, but the story congeals into a mass of repetitive cliche as you are pounded again and again with the same info, until it picks up pace again in the finale.

I enjoyed this because of the emphasis on God's love / grace for each of us. The author writes about Gods love for us and that the basis for our understanding of forgiveness, forgiving others, loving ourselves, loving others, caring for ourselves and caring for others stems from our ability to be able to understand, accept, and believe in God's unfailing, eternal, and furious love for us. I would highly recommend this book for anyone from non-Christians to deeply devoted followers of Christ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We have two of these bibs. At first I loved them because we had just switched from the cloth bibs. These were bigger, easy to clean and had a pocket to catch food; so I ordered more. However, over time the Velcro in the back becomes twisted and makes it easy for the child to pull off. Also, it can’t go in the washer. If you are going to spend the money buy the Skip Hop. They are adorable, can be thrown in the washer and the Velcro attachment is a much better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bib, waterproof and quick to dry!","review":"These bibs are terrific! They are functional and fabulous to look at no matter which design you choose! The best thing is that they are waterproof and can quickly be cleaned after each feeding. They dry relatively quickly and are ready for another use about five or six hours after getting them fully wet to clean. I would buy two so that you could rotate them out after each feeding.

I drove down to the NJ Pine Barrens and I camped out one night in the Plains (the dwarf forest), no doubt in violation of millions of New Jersey rules and regulations. The benign peacefulness of the place, the smell of the pines, the sound of the wind, all swept over me. I used to live in Manhattan. I'd often make the 2 1/2 or 3 hour drive to hike and canoe and camp in the Barrens. I love that magical forest, the dark bogs, the open plains, the pure rivers, the endless sandy roads. John McPhee's book truly captures the atmosphere of this very special place in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating topic; elegant, yet sparse prose.","review":"Ecological, both natural and social, books abound these days, but that wasn't the case back in 1967 when this book was first published. Hopefully in the intervening years, McPhee's elegant but spare prose has helped remove or at least, temper the damage done early in the Twentieth Century to the reputation of the Pine Barrens and its denizens by well-meaning, if arrogant, social scientists. The Barrens is truly a glorious piece of nature and those who dwell there have their own unique charm and grace. McPhee, a consummate raconteur, reveals both with intelligence and a warm empathy. It's still hard to believe that the Barrens exist, mere miles from the rambunctious urbanity of Philadelphia and New York City, but McPhee's book, still vital and relevant after all these years, truly makes you want to visit and maybe even stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"I spent many years living near the Pine Barrens...","review":"...and for years after moving away, I often found myself struggling to explain their incredible beauty to those I met.

It is a deeply incisive account of his observations and encounters with this beautiful region and its badly misunderstood people. Its simple and engaging style and deep compassion remind me a lot of another great author, whose name is forever associated with those Boundary Waters, Sigurd Olson.I stumbled onto this book in a local (non-NJ) bookstore, and it's a real find.

You almost don't need a user manual. It came with iTunes which is by far the best program I have used to manage my music collection.The iPod has one flaw though. The iPod inserts a sub second gap between songs. This isn't noticeable unless multiple tracks are intended to blend together, as in a live recording. The iPod should be smart enough to queue the next song in memory without adding a glitch. This is a firmware problem and has nothing to do with the way the music is copied from the CD. When the music is played with iTunes from the computer there is no problem. I understand other media players have similar problems so iPod is still ahead of the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast turnaround on iPod Mini from Amazon...","review":"My girlfriend got me a 15gb 3G iPod last month... and I just returned the favor by getting her a Pink Mini for her birthday. While the extra storage of the \\"full sized\\" iPods is nice, there's something very elegant about the smallness and sturdiness of the mini.When comparing the iPod/iPod Mini to mp3 players of other brands, the first thing you notice is the elegance/ease of use of the interface. It just feels like it's been well thought out-- it feels like quality.Other mp3 players often have a feeling of not being finished--- you're constantly checking for firmware updates. A big pain.BTW, I ordered the mini on Aug 25th. I was bummed out because the estimated delivery date was Oct 15th! It turned out the item was shipped on Aug 26th and arrived on the 27th, a mere 2 day turnaround (not the 1 1/2 month+ wait I had been dreading).

Its like they thought we all want to be Mac users and just automatically do everything for us even though we would like control!It's also real buggy under Windows - always appearing to hang. And it is not ergonomic to update the iPod with new songs - it has to plugged in and out again constantly. It will not recognize new CDs unless you restart the software. My advise is to have the iPod unplugged all the time until you are ready to update the songs.There is a long way Apple has to go with this before it is as good as some of the other brands designed for Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within 1 hour of buying it","review":"My wife was so excited to get one, we went to an Apple Store tonight, the first night they are on sale, to buy one.

It should just be called a water bed for dogs. It is great cushion for her though. I'm contemplating if we should fork out the money to return it. The return policy isn't all that great. Bummer.

It was honestly a waste of hard earned money $$$. Take your chance readers, because i know you will. Hopefully it works for you but if you live in a warmer climate good luck!

If your plans are to relocate it often, then it's just too heavy. Again, I have the large one. It is important to note that this mat should not be in direct sunlight.

I've had a few weeks now and he refuses to lay on it. Which is disappointing because i live in Florida and it gets so hot when we go for our walks. Maybe in time he will warm up to it.

Remember, you're filling this thing with water, so you better like where you put it because it's difficult to move. I made the mistake of filling it up outside with a hose and regretted this decision. My dog liked it, but when it was time to move this monster, I had to empty it in order to get it inside.

The lining seems quite durable. It took a while to get my dog to lie on the bed, but once he got used to it he started laying on it on his own. He seems to like it, and I did notice that his belly was much cooler. I am thinking of getting another one for my other dog. The real trick is getting them to lay on the bed without being afraid of something new and different.

The Cool Bed III has a 2 year warranty so we have time.\\"I did exactly as instructed, including paying to have the defective mat shipped back to K&H; only to be told that they will not refund the purchase price of the original or the replacement bed. They also informed me that I was welcome to take them to small claims court but I would lose because I never paid them directly as they are not a retail establishment.

Unfortunately, this disc is not available seperately (like El Topo and The Holy Mountain are) from Anchor Bay. You have to buy the box set to get it. Fando is a great film, quite brilliant in its own way. It's been rarely seen since it caused a riot at the Acupulco Film Festival in 1968. It was subsequently banned in Mexico, and presumed lost. Thankfully, it isn't. The Fantoma release did come with a nice booklet about Jodorowsky and a reproduction of the original press material for Fando; the Anchor Bay edition doesn't.

Twenty-something New York writer Rachel is engaged to her long term boyfriend, now all they have to do is plan a wedding and deal with their friends and family's craziness.A large part of the book is devoted to her parents' issues with the wedding, the finances of it, as well as her difficult mother and stepmother. During the first half of the book, the interaction with her parents moved the story along, but by the end it was just repetitive. True to life maybe, but a bit boring.At the end of the book, Rachel's friends who were less than supportive of the wedding were written off as being jealous which I found pat and condescending. The author never explores the possibility that some of their friends might not be marriage-minded or that anyone could just be tired about hearing about the wedding. Everyone's just jealous of Rachel.As far as bride-to-be books, I preferred Diary of a Mad Bride."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring","review":"I struggled to get through this one.

Rachel eventually pulls off a wonderful event, full of personal touches and special acknowledgments to family and friends. She also grows closer to David and learns to accept all her family (and in-laws) for who they are.I read this while planning my own wedding and thought it very fitting. I was relieved to know that things could be worse - at least I didn't have any parent problems or the issue of kosher versus non-kosher or kosher-style. I think the book drifted off near the end with the author's need to tie everything up in a neat bow of an ending.

The author uses three perspectives to look at what we consider objective reality through several different lenses. His three parts, in which he views the world as social, philosophical, and physical are a nice introduction to the world as we feel it, think about it, and actually experience it. This is an introduction, and a good one, with one caveat. I had hoped that the section on quantum physics would be a bit more accessible, and the use of math was a turnoff for me. Many writers have approached quantum physics in a lively and entertaining way, and I thought he fell short in that respect.

It has quite a few mistakes that are unacceptable. I always notice some mistakes in guides, even the Nintendo one, but never this many.About the only thing this guide has going for it is that it lists where the hidden items are that you would normally need to use the ItemFinder to locate.

At least it shows Gym Leader/Legendary Pokemon strategies and quick ways to get through cetain areas (Team Rockets Hideout for example).PROS:Good Maps.Good Strategies.Shows most visible items and some invisible items.Shows some useful tips.Almost decent Pokedex.CONS:Doesn't show enough tips.Doesn't have a complete PokedexDoesn't show every area (like it claims)Doesn't show all items.Doesn't show nature's or egg groups.Get a different guide (NOT THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete guide","review":"This guide has the basic walkthrough up to the Elite Four. But as other reviewers have noted, the book is rife with small errors and stops abruptly when detailing the end of the game. The largest omission is the exclusion of -any- mention of how to recieve the National Pokedex or how to travel to Islands 4, 5, 6, and 7. This is not a small extra area of the game, it is several more hours of gameplay and isn't even mentioned. Pokemon completists will be dissapointed with Prima's guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wrong guide","review":"So there I was, walking out of the bookstore with the Prima Guide to my Pok'emon FireRed game. Little did I know that there was not enough contents to help me with the game. When I had to fight Pok'emon Trainers, and also Gym Trainers, the book didn't give enough details for the battles, like what pok'emon types my enemies have, like poison, or rock. I WAS FRUSTRATED. Even though I did get my pok'emon experience points properly to level up, the battles were still hard. Also, I needed to know how much health my pok'emon get after using certain healing items, like super potions. Yes, I went back to the bookstore to ask for the Nintendo Power Guide, but they didn't have it. Can't find it anywhere else but online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooo!!!","review":"I have used Prima books for years and except for Verses Bookswhich went out of business, they WERE the best.But now.... I cannot believe how bad this book is, it seems that the writers of this book did not even play the game.I will think twice about buying any Prima product in the future.It used to be that the Nintendo guides were only so-so, butNintendo seems to have learned what Prima forgot.Write a decent guide and you will sell more books & games.If you get any guide make it the one from Nintendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Let me join the rest of these guys indicating my disappointment with this book.There's just too much left out. I think these guys were rushed, and put out what they had at the time, but there is way too much left out to make purchasing this worthwhile.The pokedex is okay, so I'll give it two stars for that. But the walkthroughs totally stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible guide","review":"I agree with the other customers of this guide that there is no detail except for in a few spots at all. I mean what do you do after you defeat all of the the elite 4? And when you walk up to a trainer his pokemon could stink or they might whip yours. So whatever you do DON'T by this guide. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo Power Better, but get both","review":"This is a terrible book, but the \\"Cheat Sheats\\" help in this one.

(in other words, it doesn't tell what stat a nature hurts and helps) it also is missing a list of all the moves in the game. it only has the 50 TMs, but the other moves (non TM and HM) are not in the book. i have to use 2 other guides to make up for this. the only use for this guide is to find items, however, it's not worth it since there is no other information what-so-ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT very good","review":"One of the worst guides! my mom suggested to buy this one but it was not good at all and neither of us knew it.

Gyrados's picture is Weedle, it says EXPOSION instead of EXPLOSION, the basics are like how to use the wireless adapter, which normally the guide that comes with the game should say. It says how to trade (even a person who has Red, Blue or Yellow could be suited perfect.) I think Nintendo Power is better. Whatever you do DON'T BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"half a guide NOT better than none","review":"have to agree with the previous reviews - this was obviously quickly and haphazardly thrown together to beat the nintendo version to market (which is why i bought it). no explanation of natures, of breeding, of berries, of wireless battles/trades, and no list of moves, just TMs/HMs. several obvious mistakes apparent in a quick first-read that should have been caught by a proofreader (such as using the word 'gym' instead of 'museum' in one spot - makes no sense, and to a 9yr old totally confusing until mom explained 'sorry, they were in a rush, we'll buy a better guide later').and we will.i do have to say the layout is nice - big and bright and easy to read. but now i know i need to be aware of mistakes, so how useful is it really? buy anything else, not this. it can't be any WORSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"50% accurate","review":"Was pleased with the promptness of delivery.

The guide not only leaves out pertinent details (such as how to evolve certain Pokemon, where/how to catch certain pokemon, etc, etc, etc), but is also flat out wrong in some cases (It notes Lickitung under \\"Fighting\\" type when in reality it is \\"Normal\\", and many other examples).

Maybe there was 1 type-o, but who cares? That guide was awesome! If you want to beat the Elite Four, you shouldn't even get the Prima! Instead of having easy events it has \\"cheat sheets.\\" That just says go left. go right. go up. get the item ball. (wow!)I really don't know Pokemon's numbers! This guide doesn't show the Pokedex in alphabetical order, but Nintendo Power shows them in alphabetical order. You know, it has a Snotedex!

Then we (I) waste time, money, and huge amounts of energy chasing after it and feeling bad about my \\"failure\\" to get there.

However these types of conspiracy arguments - \\"patriarchy is making you chase an impossible dream\\" - totally miss the point. We are getting fatter and fatter as a society. We were nowhere nearly this fat 100 years ago, and there is hardly any obesity in less developed societies. Do you ever see overweight animals? Only when domesticated. Furthermore, there are myriad health problems that are caused in direct proportion to how fat you are. I state this as a physician whose practice has dealt in large part with obesity related issues.So if anything, the argument should be: big businesses/civilization have made us all fat. Not being overweight is the state of nature and what we should shoot for. I realize this is difficult to achieve in our stressful, mechanized lives but it should at least remain our goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works .. But ..","review":"I ordered this item because it looked just like the original unit I had installed 15 years earlier that had just failed and it was one of a matching set for our two sinks.When the new faucet arrived it looked a little flimsier than the one being swapped out. But so what I thought, it was a good price so I proceeded to unpack and install.My biggest complaint was the faucet bottom .. it didn't sit flat on the sink. Everything worked just fine but the gap left between the faucet and the sink top looked bad and required a lot of caulk. This of course added to the cheap look of the final product.My conclusion is that while this item works fine; I would willingly have spent more to get something that looks better installaled."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book blows chunks","review":"I feel personally abused after trying to use this book to program in autocad.

I have seen 60 year old Bugs Bunny cartoons that dazzle the eye far better than today's animation. The reason so many of these cartoons look crummy on TV is ancient video transfers that were poorly supervised.That said, this is an amazing first round of a collection. Of course it doesn't have the essential 56 cartoons since there will be more boxsets on the way. The Boys From Termite Terrace will be great to see - especially since a VHS copy of the hour long docu cost as much as this 4 DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much Bugs, not enough everything else","review":"Even on the so-called \\"All-Stars\\" discs, every other cartoon stars Bugs.

Blecch !!!I'd love to have a separate collection of all the banned material, in its original form, but of course digitally remastered to bring out the best. There were some darn good episodes in those days. And I'm sure they're still floating around somewhere.But it's about time this collection came out. All the good LT stuff is now on Boomerang! which I can't get in my area, and we have to settle for all those new age anime shows on Cartoon Network, which have no real plot lines nor story IMO.

Rabbit! Duck!\\" (en trio with \\"Rabbit Seasoning\\"). The plot, admittedly x3: It's rabbit (hunting) season. Daffy wants Elmer to shoot Bugs. Ultimately Bugs and Daffy are disguised as each other, and they are imitating each other's voices, i.e. Mel Blanc as Bugs imitating Daffy; Mel Blanc as Daffy imitating Bugs. Also, Daffy coaching a bewildered Elmer (\\"more bweifing?\\"); also, some of the best lines are here: \\"Pronoun trouble.\\" \\"You're dethpicable\\" (iris out).As noted elsewhere, \\"The vocal contribution of Mel Blanc cannot be underestimated.\\" These four 'toons are the late Mr. Blanc at his zenith; WB gave us one on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"I remember these toons way way back from the first time I could think. 48 years on this planet has not dulled my love of Bugs and the gang, and now, nearing my middle age, I love them more than ever, because I finally understand the gags.Every one of these toons is a gem.

It brings back wonderful memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"get serious","review":"no black and white, no wartime, no great piggy bank robbery, no historical organization. a scattershot collection omitting many crucial cartoons. when will warners realize the value of what they have and start issuing it in a way that makes sense for collectors and fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Artifacts Distracting","review":"I love Warner Bros. cartoons, but many of these are marred by dust artifacts in the background. The images themselves are sharp and well defined when played on a Blu-Ray player and I assume the same is true on a standard DVD player. The artifacts, however, are inexcusable and they're distracting. But they're the only game in town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looney Tunes DVD great condition","review":"The product was great. The shows were very clear and the item came in the mail fast!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Collection Is Golden","review":"This is a masterpiece of looney tunes cartoons. I've especially love the Daffy Duck series since. He's my favorite. Also the behind scenes footage is awesome. My only disappointment is I didn't see enough Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. I hope another collection of Looney Tunes cartoons come out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 1","review":"absolutely fabulous DVD set. all the favorites are on this with great extras too."},{"rating":"2","title":"no menu","review":"the Looney Tunes CD's are excellent in terms of content, but they have one extremely annoying problem: there is no way to either view or choose from amongst all the cartoons on each disk using the typical DVD \\"scene selection\\" method, so you have to watch them all sequentially rather than being able to jump between favorites.I have never used a DVD where you cannot view a \\"scene\\" menu to pick what scene in a film you want to watch and this standard feature seems even more important on a disk where each scene is it's own self contained unrelated cartoon, why was this feature left off these disks?This is really unacceptable for an expensive product like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looney Tunes Rock!","review":"Cartoons today may be far more technologically advanced but the pale in comparison to the originals that I grew up with. Now my children will be able to enjoy these classics with me. (Hopefully my future grandchildren too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Awaited DVD - Hopefully, uncut and uncensored","review":"I am ecstatic. Finally these works - masterpieces of laugh-out-loud, satirical commentary for their day - will be available.May I be so bold as to speak for Looney Tunes fans around the world and ask that (eventually) the complete collection be released in this format. And PLEASE - Include those which have been considered \\"politically incorrect\\" or \\"too violent\\" or \\"insensitive\\" - and include them uncut and uncensored.Again, these cartoons are so entertaining and (without trying to over analyze them) sometimes a satiracal statement on the political and socio-economic environment of the day. But if not for that reason, then simply because I laugh until I cry when viewing the \\"original\\".Thank you very much for making these available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful, Paralyzing, Perfect, Pachydermous Percussion Pitch","review":"It's Punny too. These cartoons are a treasure that has aged very well. Not only do you get 56 cartoons full of visual humor, verbal humor, sound and color, but you get a bucket load of fascinating extras. It was fun to learn about what happened when a bunch of creative people, with limited resources, were given some freedom to have fun at \\"Termite Terrace\\". My favorite cartoons are \\"Baseball Bugs\\", \\"Deduce, You Say\\", \\"Haredevil Hare\\", and \\"Speedy Gonzales\\", but all 56 are funny. Now that I'm a dad, I can't wait to share the fun with my son. That's all, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent- but not made for children","review":"When these cartoons were made, they were made for theaters without children. They are considered to be the most violent videos ever made with violence on the average of once every 35 seconds or so. This is not \\"Dora the explorer\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed....","review":"While I think most of us here grew up on Looney Tunes and cherish the memories.... I don't know if I'm alone in that I think after 6 box sets in the Golden Collection series that there were several discs of Bugs and Daffy but not a lot of the other characters. I get they were main characters, but where are all the Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester & Tweety, Yosemite Sam and Wile E Coyote/Road Runner. I know there is a seperate disc out right now for Foghorn Leghorn and others. I just think at the prices being charged for the series, that they all should be well represented in the collections. Hopefully when the next series is to be released, this will be corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Classics!","review":"These cartoons are so much fun! I bought these because you can't find these toons on TV anymore. My 10 yr old stepdaughter and I have been watching these together whenever she comes to visit and she loves them. I'm thinking about buying the rest in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ole looney tunes","review":"if you're tired of your kids watching spongebob, and the adventures of grim and evil, introduce them to the world of looney tunes. don't be fooled by those cheap imitations. this is the real mccoy. i bought this for our entire family, ages 3 to 37 and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. i haven't laughed this hard in a while. looney tunes is something you never outgrow and this is one of the best compilations by far. i can hardly wait to check out the other volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whine whine whine!","review":"I got this set a couple of days ago and I think it's a great collection. Doesn't have everything you want? Well, then be patient. This isn't the ONLY set that Warners will be releasing. What is assembled here is a fine collection of cartoons. Sure, it may be missing faves of yours and mine, but having some out there to own is better than having none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the finest cartoons ever made!","review":"I grew up watching The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Hour on Saturday mornings and thought I would never see some of these again (ie. The Scarlet Pumpernickel, Wearin' of the Grin). I'm delighted they are on DVD so I can watch them anytime!I can't wait for Volume 2 and 3 to show up at my door!"},{"rating":"2","title":"56 ANIMATED WB MASTERPIECES-UNCUT & UNCENSORED!","review":"This collection has (rightly) made dozens of end-of-year lists touting the Best DVD releases of 2003. It is nothing short of superb, and a fitting testament to the legendary genius animation craftspeople who created these great cartoons years ago.DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE STUPID, ILL-INFORMED \\"REVIEW\\" BELOW WHICH INSINUATES THAT THE CARTOONS ON THIS COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EDITED. They have NOT been edited. They are beautifully restored, and presented in their complete, original form, just as first seen in theaters during the '40s and '50s.Don't miss out on this extraoardinary DVD release. It's quite magnificent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, reasonable price","review":"I like this product because it seems to cut down on irritation after using an epilator for hair removal and doesn't have an unbearable smell (but it could be better - smells a bit like a burning motor). Large bottle-good value for the money and a little goes a very long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change what you do in the kitchen!","review":"This book has changed my kitchen forever! Marnie's Kitchen Shortcuts is not just another cook book. It is a food management system that oraganizes shopping, storing, and preparing. The strategies are neither complicated nor impractical. They really work! No need to waste time or money at the grocery store or in your own kitchen any more.My favorites in the book are the \\"make your own\\" recipies. From cream of mushroom soup to sweet and sour sauce, you no longer have to change your menu when you don't have the canned, store-bought version in your pantry. Marnie's \\"make your owns\\" are easy, taste great, and cost significantly less. Many meals have been rescued at my house just by making use of this one chapter.This is less a book review and more the divulging of a love-affair with this innovative book. The strategies and time and money saving ideas in this book will affect your whole life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book--if you cook you need this!","review":"This is an excellent book! The section on substitutions alone makes the book worthwhile, it is the most comprehensive I have ever seen. This book has great recipes, showing you that just a little effort in advance will save you much time, money and possibly fat later. I recommend this book to every cook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it for architects","review":"I really didn't like it for architects. I was work on a theater project, but it is so mechanical. Nothing for architects. No color pictures, only b&w draws."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"Even her name is funny. Janine Ruvacado, pronounced rude avocado. But there's nothing funny about her diagnosis of osteoporosis, so she spends every morning in the gym. While they exercise, a handsome and attentive stranger actually listens to her and offers good advice about her leaning-toward-Goth teenager, manipulative ex-husband, and downright mean mother. Elise Lanier attacks a serious problem with compassion and grace while offering hope splashed with humor to the brittle bone generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to its promising title :/","review":"The concept of flying under the IRS radar, minimizing taxes paid while maximizing returns, etc, all sounds very well and good to a person interested in escaping Uncle Sams financial oppression. The title of this book suggests that it will instruct you on how to achieve this, but aside from vague and intermittent hints to this effect, the book is little more than an ongoing promotion for the authors newsletter, which you must subscribe to in order to divine any substantial tips he has to offer. With various personal anecdotes, hyped up queries about what you will do with all the money you *could* save, and tax techniques that are hinted at but never quite divulged, reading this book felt like a person who realized the motivation seminar he is attending is little more than a pitch for another product or service. Unless you are a devoted fan of Robert Carlson, I'd suggest trying a comparable book with more actual substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"XXX Reported To Amazon","review":"Be Warned... This title has been reported to Amazon, and other authorities. Purchase at own risk.That aside, Jenna Jameson is in the \\"film\\" for all of around 5 minutes.

Don't waste your money or possibly your freedon by owning what is rumored to have underage actresses in this attrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not the book, but the short course notes.","review":"I was expecting the complete book. It is not. This is a short course (one day) presentation complied in a booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for Liturgists","review":"This CD has 19 of the most popular Psalms used in liturgies today. The Psalms are very easy to sing and the compositions are contemporary and varied. If you preside over any prayer or liturgical services, this CD would make a great addition to your resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing Eurocenturism with the Asian equivelent","review":"Andre Gunder Frank compells his readers to expand their view of how the West actually rose to the top of the economic world. He makes a nobel effort but, he lacks the evidence to support his often changing thesis. Instead he supplements it with a biased view of history, and challenges experts with lame assumptions. Frank neglectes to recognize key factors in Europes rise, including the industrial revolution. this book should be read with skepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing my View on World History","review":"Franks has opened my eyes to world history as it really is and was. I must leave my Eurocentric background and focus me at the whole picture. That is the message of 'Reorient' to me. I think this book marks a change in my own academic writing and will certainly reorient my focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kill switch","review":"I order this switch to replace my kill switch on my Johnson Outboard Motor, the orginal kill switch was causing a lot of trouble. When I figure out the problem I was going to replace it with OEM part but it cost over a $100.00. So I found this on on the Amazon and it works great. I had to take a file and trim the inside of the handle on my Tiller handle but, that only took a few minutes, and was well worth it. My motor run rough before I put this switch on, so it was a intermitting short the whole time the motor was running. If you can afford the OEM part I suggest you buy it, but if you need something to get you by until you can afford the OEM I highly recommend this Switch. I will work as a Kill or Starter Switch, and the screw termails is a great plus they are seprated with a molded rib. So I recommend this Switch as a Kill or Starter Switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product.","review":"i used this as a starter switch on my 9.9 hp johnson outboard and it works perfect and just a fraction of the price of one through a marine supplier. a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but spendy","review":"These cartridges last about a month so cleaning up, or not having to clean up, after your cat(s) starts to cost quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sani-Solution","review":"Not must to really review, gotta have it in order for it to work.

I thought no big deal, I can just push the glue stick through. On the second use I plug the gun in and there is a huge spark and the power cord blew from the base of the gun.

Broke in less than 5 min.","review":"The cord for this glue gun is definitely not rated for a device like this. It's thinner than anything I've seen before.I took the glue gun out of the package, put a glue stick in and let it warm up. It produced a glue dot about the size of a quarter and then just stopped working. Unplugged and replugged, nothing. Complete piece of garbage.Silver lining: the manufacturer immediately refunded my money when I told him I wanted to return it. They told me I could keep the broken glue gun as a bonus.Sweet bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trigger broke too easy","review":"Even when the glue was very hot, the trigger spring broke right out of it.

It is cheap for a reason! You might as well spend the extra money to get the better glue gun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"Where do I start? This product is garbage and worse, a serious safety hazard.-The cord is only about 1' long making it useless without an extension cord.-The cord is undersized for a heating appliance, making it a shock/fire hazard.-The product is labeled as containing cancer-causing materials.-The product has no brand-name and no rating/listing details. Typical a product like this would be list by UL, confirming it as safe. The blue label in the picture which appears to contain this data does not actually exist on the product. Borderline fradulent advertising.-Heavy duty? What a joke. The trigger broke after an hour of use.-The kickstand doesn't keep the gun up and the plastic nub holding it in place broke after 3 flips of the stand.If you value your time, money, and frustration level, buy something else.I've contacted the seller for a refund. We'll see how that goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine glue gun","review":"I am not a super crafter. I use this to fix things like hair-ribbons, toys, etc. That said, it seems to be sturdy, safe, and well worth what I paid for it. I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Cord, Overflow of Glue","review":"This hot glue gun does what it is suppose to do, maybe to good. The glue is melting at such a fast rate and the nozzle is too large so unless you are using it constantly it is dripping everywhere. Also the cord is only about 2 feet long so you should plan on using an extension cord or be very close to an outlet. On top of that, the cord is very flimsy and cheap. The wire protection separated from the wire after only about 1 month of use. I would not recommend this product unless you are simply looking for the cheapest glue gun for a 1 time project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot glue!","review":"Cute lil gun if you are not industrial.
