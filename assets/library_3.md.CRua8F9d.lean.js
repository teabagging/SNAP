Putting together was easy (10 minutes) and if the directions are 100% followed, there won't be any problems (collapsing, etc). The rack is perfectly solid and easily holds the weight of all our shoes (however, unless all your shoes are like those shown in the photo, you won't realistically be able to put 3 full pairs on each row).

The picture makes it look like it holds tons of shoes- it will if they are kids shoes, or very narrow, small sized shoes. Myself, a woman's size 11, and fiance, men's size 9, our shoes are probably bigger than average. This rack will only comfortably hold 2 pairs across. You could squeeze in a third pair of say, sandals, if you stack them on top of one another. It is pretty cheaply made- snap together plastic. But it did fill an immediate need I had for shoe storage. And $36 is not the best price- I bought mine for $24, and ebay has these sometimes in the $20 price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is not worth your money","review":"I recently ordered this shoe organizer online and just hate it. It was easy to assemble, but there are so many design flaws in it. The rods that the shoes sit on don't tend to stay in place - they pop out of the sides, they are angled downward and so if you set several pairs of shoes in their box on the rods, they slide off. And, it claims to hold 50 pair of shoes. Hardly!I put the smallest of my collection such as sandals and other light shoes on the top racks and the larger shoes on the bottom. I didn't even get 50 pair on the rack and it nearly collapsed! I even have the rack placed in a corner of the room to add extra support! The plastic sides slide into place and are thin, cheap plastic.

The rods kept falling out resulting in the shoes ending up in the floor. The idea is great, but the design definitely has flaws. No matter what you do, the rods fall out; sometimes only one or two and other times a total 'avalanche' causing shoes to go all over the closet floor. I really liked the concept, so I took it apart and reassembled it putting Gorilla glue in each of the spaces on the sides where the rods fit. I couldn't believe what a difference it made.

You couldn't ask for a better example of what's good about country music than this album. Just listen to \\"It's Not Supposed To Be That Way\\" on the first CD. Waylon starts the song with half a chuckle, then proceeds to break your heart. Add Ralph Mooney's pedal steel guitar and you have a stone classic country album. Merle Haggard once sang a song extolling the virtues of Hank and Lefty's music back in '51. Somebody needs to sing a song extolling the virtues of Waylon, Willie, Merle, and Johnny Cash back in the 1970's, because country music doesn't get any better than it was then. \\"Waylon Live: The Expanded Edition\\" is the way country music is supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"MMM","review":"I sent this to my uncle and aunt in Holland and it took some time for them to tell me the truth.

I was very into the \\"new\\" YES and bought it out of curiosity. I was not disappointed. Trevor Rabin is supremely talented. After listening to songs such as Cover Up, and Eyes of Love showed me what Rabin contributed to Big Generator and 90125. Sorrow had an interesting South African rhythm. It was the instrumentals though that hooked me.Etoile Noir, Sludge, and The Cape really proved Trevor Rabin's talent to me. I enjoyed his talent for composition and instrumentation. Truly amazing!My only complaint is that there is now a definite \\"80's\\" sound lurking through some of these songs. It is not enough to distract from my enjoyment, but that might be nostalgia. Thus, I have given this CD 4 out of 5 stars to err on the side of caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix and Clapton dream of attaining this height!","review":"Trevor Rabin is nothing short of a musical genius! From his early work with South African supergroup *Rabbitt*, it was obvious that Trevor was destined to outshine, and this album eclipses anything he has done before.For anyone who is a guitar fanatic, this album is an absolute must. He plays all but drums on each track, and the guitar work is incomparable! *I Can't Look Away* is enough to make you want to cry, and the crescendo of *Promises* as abso-bloody-lutely amazing! He touches on an old Rabbitt fave in *Hold on to Me*, reminisces about South Africa in the soulful *The Cape*, and thunders through rock powerhouses like *I Didn't Think It Would Last*, *Something to Hold on To*, and the genius of *I Can't Look Away*.Some may stick to his YES *roots*, but truthfully his work with Rabbit was always his best, until this album blew the rest away.You cannot get a better album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trevor is most definetly not the man","review":"After some pretty cool guitar riffs to lead into CAN\\"T LOOK AWAY, the musik becomes contrived and confused. His high falsetto vocals are mediocre and the songs have nothing to say and take forever to say it. The lyrics are cliche and add nothing to these tracks. Throughout the CD I wished this was an instrumental release. The guitar playing is OK and only hints at what might have been. The compositions are complex, but do not benefit from this complexity. I am sure RABIN is a very good guitarist, but apart from a couple of sterling moments, he seems throttled by the need to be obtuse and clever. Yet the cleverness never rises above sounding pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak followup to Yes work","review":"Yes, it does have some of the feel of Yes' 90125.

His guitar playing is skilled in all the gratuitous effects-laden noodley-doodley mush typical of the 80s era of big hair bands, and that guitar style is definitely not to my liking. Unfortunately, that's the HIGH point of this disc. His bass playing sucks, his lyrics suck, his vocals are bland, and the drum beats are boring. This came out in 1989, the same year as \\"Doolittle\\" by the Pixies, the album that would influence \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana which in turn would KILL 80s hair band mania once and for all. \\"Can't Look Away\\" has Rabin sounding caught off guard in the context of the times, like he's been listening to Journey's \\"Escape\\" every day for the past 8 years.

Well, his total lack of rational thinking is frightening beyond belief all right. This book and all his writings clearly show how possessed by the supernatural one can become, basically losing all sense of reality. Cheung and others like him, have rejected reason and find no problem with rejecting 2000 years of accumulated scientific knowledge. The philosophy that Cheung propounds is one that would promote the idea that we are simply passing through this sin stained world on our way to God's kingdom. This is the same philosophy responsible for the 9/11 terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"good as gold","review":"this cd brought back all of the memories I was looking for and more. my friends were impressed, as well as myself.

The murder was almost incidental, the trip to Disney World seemed so incongruous that it came across as an attempt by the author to justify her family's vacation as \\"research,\\" and therefore a tax write-off.The thing the author should realize is that when someone as unlikeable as this victim gets killed, no one really CARES who did it.

But these guys certainly had their own vision which comes out well on this long, finely-produced album.

The other songs seem to go nowhere and the guitar work doesn't grap your attention like their other fine albums.

It really takes a plunge at \\"beachcomber blues,\\" which just never seems to go anywhere. I like the vibe here and the way the band thinks. I can \\"feel\\" the tug of war between emotional pain and detachment. It's a road well traveled by the likes of Red House Painters/Sun Kil Moon and Grant Lee Buffalo, but the invention is not there. Musical ideas are begun but seem not to have been developed. The song has taken a back seat to the sound. Everything is very simple; the chords never take you to someplace new. This disc is going to sound very good to some people, and that's good, but I think I've been around listening to too much for too long because I just felt my mind wandering.

Unfortunately this flat and relatively dull book goes against that completely. Throughout the book he teaches people how to draw to his particular style - rather than introducing them to the concept of art.The pages are filled with extremely bland pictures which quite frankly could have been drawn by a 2 year old for all the difference it makes.He doesn't use a wide range of colours in the few colour pictures he does. In fact if any of his pictures ever are in colour, beginner artists will be shocked to \\"learn\\" that clouds do not have colour in them. They are either white or in very rare cases grey. Overall this is a very poorly written and presented book which has been written by a very bad artist and quite frankly you would be better off spending your money on a book which lets you decide how you want to draw pictures yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Corrosion is the best....","review":"This is a great piece of musical art.

What a pleasant surprise I was in for when I heard sound clips (thanks to Amazon), & then I bought it the next day cuz I just HAD to have it. But WHY should you get this if you haven't heard it before....if you like pounding bass & drum beats with dark dreamy vocals in a danceable form, I rest my case.

Everyone who was around and listening to the Sisters of Mercy in the early 80s knows that the band - the real Sisters of Mercy - broke up in 1985. And then Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams came out with The Mission (UK) and we all wondered \\"what will Andrew Eldritch do now that the Sisters of Mercy are gone?\\" Well, we all got the answer to that question when Eldritch gathered around him a few completely new musicians, and tried to peddle his new venture on the reputation and fame of the Sisters of Mercy brand. It all seems a bit smarmy.Having said that, the sound of the record isn't bad. Its just overproduced, a bit cliche, and not that innovative or exciting. The original SOM (and for that you need to track down the compilation \\"Some Girls Wander by Mistake\\") were innovative and exciting. This is just - well, just bland 1987 trying too hard to be 1982 again."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my fav album of all time","review":"ive listened to this album over and over for years and it never gets old...especailly flood 2.my all time fav album."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best gothic albums","review":"Floodland is one of the best gothic albums together with Clan Of Xymox I ever owned, and the best thing is that I still can listen to SOM despite they have not released anything for years. To me Floodland never gets old, only their fans do I suppose. The music is pretty minimalistic contrary to the layered music of Clan Of Xymox but it sounds just right, every track hits the nail on the spot. The Sisters don't want to be called Gothic as I kind of understand because that implies you still live in the eighties but I see it just as a label tag, just to be able to find the record in the store. I wished that Eldrich would not wear canary yellow shirts live , it does not look cool and the statement he wants to provoke does not work for me. Despite his dismissal of the name tag ( who cares) this album remains a classic. Together with Ronny Moorings he is one of the true singers in the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"very dark","review":"This is Sisters of Mercy's best album, the lyrics are very dark, and his voice is very clam and soothing and dark at the same time, if you like dark music this is a must have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pale Prince's Puerile Pandering","review":"Little Andy E., the pale ponce, spews forth another scary assortment of noises that go pompous in the night.

Not for me in the top four of the band, but it is a work of value and contemplative. Songs are solid and with good variations, is notorious inspiration of the band members.

While other Cure discs bounce around between Latte stand pop and ethereal nightmare primers, Pornography does it right. Some of the lyrics don't rhyme, some of the percussion makes no sense, some of the pounding gives you a headache, but that's what good \\"porn\\" does. I think they named this disc perfectly. If you believe that some bands around today stay religously true to their fans, The Cure laid that groundwork. There's usually some \\"jump the shark\\" moment when bands go south. Some ridiculous song or style that creeps into there music and pisses everybody off. Not these guys.So they built this album, named it \\"Pornography\\", put a hellish cover on it, and sold it to thousands of pre-goth teens. These teens ate it up and felt good.

This, along with bauhaus' mask and Joy Divion's Unknown pleasures is the record that literally incarnates the gothic-feel (sadly it has rapidly become a clich��). All the elements are here: the almost-tribal drumming, the eerie keyboards, the haunting vocals... Someone pointed out that the music tends to get monotonous after a while and they might have a point but the same could be said about post-rock and noise. As with those genres the \\"repetitivness\\" (but I don't particularly like the word because of its negative meaning) is required to attain a trance-like quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Remaster?","review":"Normally I love to hear my favourite albums remastered, and God knows there are plenty of '80s albums that desperately need it (Psychocandy!). However, I think that the decidedly murky sound quality of this album was its best feature. Let's face it, this really isn't the Cure's best album. My personal favourites are 'Faith' and 'The Head On The Door', but 'Pornography' had always seemed really good. That is, until they remastered it. Sure, now you can hear every 'nuance', but on top of that you can also hear just how frightfully mediocre the songs are. With the old version, it sounded like the band recorded the album at the bottom of a swamp, and that seemed to work really well with the overall sound and feel of the album. But now that it sounds all clean and clear, you realise just how weak this album was in the first place. To the original version of the album, I give four stars. But to this remaster, I give two."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God, This Is Even More Awful Than the Original!","review":"Imagine how you would feel if your hands were tied behind your back while somebody held the spinning blades of a screamingly loud gas-powered lawnmower up to your face.

I could scream, if only I weren't so bored.\`Pornography' is the Frankenstein version of \`Faith' and \\"Seventeen Seconds'. It takes all of the bits that made those albums interesting and good, and renders them into something monstrous and hideous.While parts of \`Faith' might have sounded like it was recorded underwater, this collection makes me wish that someone would throw a toaster into the tub.

The gal that introduced me to it was very cute, so needless to say I had a thing for her.I was almost 17 and heavily into hardcore punk, and this (Along with Joy Division) seemed like such a stretch from the caterwauling guitars and rapid fire vocals I had been listening to. I went into the Navy the following summer, and after boot camp, the first thing I did was buy a walkman and this cassette.

I recall Bob himself disparaged this album and Faith when he hosted 120 minutes back in the early 90's, saying even he couldn't sit through listening to it anymore.I owned this on album, cassette and CD.

This time around, Al parodies artists like Eminem and Nelly and sings songs about Spider Man and eating too much cheese. Every track, in my opinion, is hilarious and none of his albums have made me laugh out loud more times than poodle hat. The first time you listen, prepare for a whole lot o' funny.

Al has a knack for catching the pop culture scene and this album has been long awaited. That being said this album musicaly is great and lyricly funny but after playing the album over and over again I found that comparatively Running W/ Scissors ir supreme. Als originals are excellent and the Leper Colony song is classic but I was left dry with the love song. Al doesnt write love songs. I do like the Genius in France song. Maybe Al got a little with political humor which has never been seen before. Parodies are great. Lyrics hilarious. You can also see his vocal talent on Hardware Store. Great Album. Buy them all. They are all good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF HIS BEST!","review":"I am a long time Weird Al fan, and I've got to say this is one funny album! \\"Hardware Store\\" is got to be one of the fastest songs he has written. Yes, maybe even faster than \\"Everything You Know Is Wrong.\\" The part where he sings all kinds of hardware store items in one breath is absolutely amazing. I enjoyed his other original songs as well.His parodies are as funny as ever. I'd say my favorites are \\"Ebay\\"(parody of \\"I Want it That Way\\") and \\"A Complicated Song\\"(parody of \\"Complicated\\"). Oh, and Couch Potato is good too. I guess you'd say all of them are my favorites heh.His voice hasn't seemed to have changed since 1992. Even at 42 he's just as lively and hyperactive as ever and he even looks younger. I guess he has to be when he has a wife and a baby to worry about. Anyway, this album is well worth it. If you're a hardcore Al fan like me, then this is a MUST-HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I swear! It's my friends fault!","review":"I wasn't really a Weird Al fan untill I got a ride home from school one day. My friend (who has always been a Weird Al fan since I met him) popped this CD in and within minutes of 'Couch Potato', I was laughing so hard I litterally could'nt breathe!'Hardware Store' reminded me of my dad's guyish love of tools, and 'Ebay' sounds like the theme song of my next door neighboor.I had to get one of these CD's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected Low","review":"While normally a fan this is the first Weird Al album that I've rather heavily disliked. Some of it is mildly amusing, but he has apparently decided that MTV is still a relevant model of popular culture. Most of the references are pointless and seem to be very short-lived as are most of the parodies. The only time I've heard any of the parodied songs with the exception of \\"Piano Man\\" was while channel-flipping or out shopping. Unlike previous work these song had no need to be parodied and will be quickly forgotten. \\"Bob\\" was ham-fisted and entirely unoriginal, seemingly the work of a complete novice with no sense of humour.I had expected good things after his last two excellent albums, but this is more in line with \\"Polka Party\\" and \\"Alapalooza\\". This is the first output by Al that I feel no desire to own at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rox","review":"i will give a discription of all songs and a rating 1 to 5Couch Patato- Awsome i watch a lot of tv 2 so i love it 5/5Hardware store- i dont get it i hate goin 2 home depot but i luv dis 5/5trash day- very funny 4/5party @ the leper colony- kind funny 2/5angry whiteboy polka- its awsome (my favorate part is the kid rock song balldidit)5/5wanna be ur luvr- oh man i hate it 1/5a complicated song- almost as good as couch patato 5/5ode to a super hero- spiderman rox (ironicly im aracniphobic) 4/5why does this always happen to me- funny yet odd 5/5bob- okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy 1/5ebay- SWwwwwwwwwwwwEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTT- 5/5genius in france- very long- 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent CD...Greatest of his albums yet","review":"El Teriffico...

Listen to Zappa's 'Strictly Commercial' Cd and you'll think Al's song is that much funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Al does it again","review":"In true Al form, this is in a formula we've come to salivate for in his albums: parodies of the popular with a splash of his original work and of course, a polka. This time his original work shines through in Wana B Ur Luvr which had us in stitches! Proving his finger is still firmly on the pulse of American pop culture, Al shows us the lighter side of entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poodle Hat will please","review":"Weird Al is back! After a 4-year recording break, Weird Al establishes once again that he is the king of musical parodies. Long-time fans will have different opinions of how \\"Poodle Hat\\" compares to his previous recordings, but most will probably agree that no one gets a laugh out of music like Monsieur Yankovic. The most creative songs on the album: \\"Bob\\" and \\"Hardware Store\\". \\"Bob\\" is hilarious once you grasp the humor of the song. I wish I believed that Al could actually sing that last verse of \\"Hardware Store\\" without taking a breath! If he somehow actually did, he should be enshrined in the \\"Lung Power Hall of Fame\\". The biggest yawner: surprisingly, the polka medley, which is usually one of my favorites. The best parody: \\"The Complicated Song\\". All in all, a good, but not great, addition to your Weird Al collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Album, Not His Best Though","review":"I'm a fan of Weird Al, and I have to say I was not as impressed with this album as with Bad Hair Day and Running With Scissors. However, I don't think this is so much because of a decline in his work, but rather because of my distaste for much of the music he parodied. For example, he makes fun of an Avril Lavigne song and a Backstreet Boys one... His originals on the album are quite good, and \\"Bob\\" is very funny being a parody of Bob Dylan (Weird Al even sings like him). I was also surprised that the last track takes from a Frank Zappa song, \\"I'm the Slime.\\" I was sold on that song too, being an admirer of Zappa."},{"rating":"2","title":"After four years we have a winner!","review":"I really liked this CD,and Al is in good form on this one. The tribute to Bob Dylan (if you can call it that :-) ) is pretty good..........he sounds better than Bob Dylan to me! I loved the home movies on this enhanced CD and the on screen music lyrics. I think we have a winner here for all the Al fans out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Al's Best Album To Date","review":"Truly Weird Al's best album yet. He's produced some of the greatest parodies of all time and these are no exception. Bob and Couch Potato made me die laughing. Poodle Hat is one of the greatest CDs you'll ever listen to. Trust me, I saw his Poodle Hat concert on tour, this is great music. Make It Weird. Make It Al. Make It Poodle Hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Cents","review":"This album has already been reviewed a lot, so I don't know if my opinion will count for much, but I would like to say a few things about it. I have been a Weird Al fan for over 20 years now. In fact, the first concert I ever attended was by Weird Al. All these years later, Al is still doing a lot of the same thing he always did. Song parodies, songs about television, polka medleys, etc. But his writing has become more sophisticated over the years. I know it sounds dumb to say that a song about watching too much TV can be sophisticated, but it's true. I'm not going to go over every song on this album, but let's take \\"Bob\\", for an example. It must be hard to write a whole bunch of palindromes. So, imagine how difficult it must have been to write a song made up of palindromes, and have it actually rhyme, which it does. Anyway, if you like Al as much as I do, you probably already bought this album. And if you didn't buy it, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop listening","review":"Read all the reviews below - all are covering most of the hot songs like Hardware store - but not mentioned much are Ebay, A Complicated Song, and Why does this always happen to me?Ebay - funny, and the song \\"sings well\\" -and the end gets me!Complicated - takes turns that are greatWhy does this - takes unexpected turns, great keyboards - this is like the \\"one more minute\\" - type song.Get it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not what he used to be","review":"I went out and purchased this new album today hoping that it would at least be better than 'Running With Scissors', but unfortunately, it's even worse (no pun intended). I think it's time for Al to either retire or come up with something new, because his music just ain't what it used to be. Either that, or else I'm simply growing too old to appreciate it anymore.I found the 'Complicated Song' to be midly amusing, but the rest of the songs on this album (as well as the last one, come to think of it) are not even worth a second listen.It might've been funny in the early 80's (and even the early 90's), but I'm sorry to say that Al shtick is really getting old."},{"rating":"2","title":"weird","review":"This is really weird and funny.

I'll stick to true comedy albums done by true comedians."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Weird Al\\" Unleases More Comedy!!","review":"Weird Al's newest release, Poodle Hat, is one of his best. He parodies Eminem in the very funny \\"Couch Potato\\". He also parodies Nelly in \\"Trash Day\\", Avril Lavinge in \\"A Complicated Song\\", Billy Joel in \\"Ode to a Superhero\\", and the Backstreet Boys in \\"Ebay\\". His originals are also some of his best, as Weird Al proves that he is here to stay. Al shows his incredible sense of humor, and simply amazes the listener with his writing abilities. This album gets an A+ whether you're a longtime fan or a recent convert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al does it again","review":"For over 20 years \\"Weird Al\\" has put out some great comedy. Often under-rated, but the enlightened amongst us never fail to appreciate his endeavors. I'm not going to sit here and spout out a play by play of the album. Overall, this is one of his best in at least the last 15 years. The lyrics are as witty and sharp as anything he's ever done. Some are obvious to entertain the mass audience, adults and the younger generation alike, some are more subtle, appealing only to true music lovers and us older folks. He's had the same band for over 20 years as well. It shows. These guys are professionals. The music is excellent, the mixing and editing is very tight. In one beat they can go from R&B to bluegrass to lounge jazz. Al tends to only be known for his parodies. They are always good, but it's his original material and style parodies that truly show his genius.It's woth a listen. Ah heck, if nothing else, he bashes the French!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poodle Hat","review":"This peice of crap is a waste of money.

Definitely!","review":"It's always interesting when artists attempt making a comeback. This one I would say is a successful one. I'm not a huge Weird Al fan but some of his past parodies really made me laugh. The parodies on this album are innovative and funny. The ones that I thought were the funniest are his parodies of \\"Hot In Herre\\" and \\"Complicated\\" (by Nelly and Avril Lavigne). The other songs on the CD (Weird Al's own songs) are nothing spectacular but it depends on what you like from him. This CD is selling pretty well, so I guess it's good for Weird Al to know that his fans haven't forgotten him. Also, the extras on the CD are a nice bonus. Well done Weird Al Yankovic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so good, it's good","review":"This is a top contender for best AL-bum ever. Get it? AL-bum.

Everything else is AMAZING.

The enhanced content includes \\"home videos\\" of Weird Al with him narrating. It's kind of funny, but not LOL funny. And there are also some production/band photos and 8 remixes. The remixes are basically instrumental versions of some of the songs, a vocal version of Hardware Store and a remix of another song. The enhanced content is enjoyable. It would make a good addition to a Weird Al collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"too lean","review":"al's problem is this:many of his long time fans have NO IDEA what it is he is parodying now, thus, unless the parody is extremely well done, it doesn't make any sense to us.his problem also is, there are not that many good songs out there to parody.this effort is a hard listen, and is not his best effort.i did enjoy \\"ebay\\", the \\"bob\\" bob dylan skit, is hilarious, especially if one never could understand the appeal of dylan to start with. the zappa crappa (\\"genius in france\\") is way too long, and like zappa, mostly crap (although, with their actions in the war againest terro, it is an apt title, and song). \\"hardware store\\", must be from a really rottensong. \\"party at the leper colony\\", is vintage weird al, as is \\"why does this always happen to me?\\".all in all.....not very memorable, but, as other reviewers have stated, there isn't much out there for him to work with.maybe more originals in the future?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily his worst","review":"This album makes me want to bash my head in with a blunt instrument. And I'm a pretty big Al fan. But darn it, I can't believe he actually did a Frank Zappa style parody on the last song! Whee!!! But seriously, Al really let me down with this one.

When Running W/ Scissors came out, it was one of his best efforts in years. Unfortunetely, this album's a huge disappointment. I didn't get the references in the \\"Angry White Boy Polka\\" except for the White Stripes. Every lyric here sounds it came from the same song, which just goes to show how truely lame radio rock is nowadays. I won't hit you with spoilers in case you get the record anyway, but the songs he spoofs simply are not that funny. The only reason it gets two stars is the \\"Ebay\\" song (which I'll only say gets a ribbing for a certain boy band) is a spoof that's reasonably well done. Stick with \\"Scissors\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sweet book, but not for my grandchildren","review":"I bought this book for my daughter to read to her toddlers, but sent it back to Amazon immediately.

Wells Fargo: TMG Premier Series. Laramie: TMG Lost in the Dust Series. We could be for warned by which is great and which is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality for My Man Jess","review":"The quality of this DVD set is horrid. It is worse than some all region DVDs I've seen.I love Laramie and will hold out for a better quality product as this is unwatchable. It was with a sad heart I had to return the set as I so loved Laramie as a very small child. Let's hope for a better product down the line with all the seasons.The one bright spot on this DVD set was the extensive interview with Robert Fuller. What a delight he is to listen to with his many memories.

It indeed does look like VHS at the SLP (6 hour) speed. Timeless Media apparently buys the legal rights to put some of these TV series out but good prints or video transfers are not always available from the source (NBC Universal in this case) so TM sometimes has to scrounge whatever prints or videos it can from collectors. They have put out some excellent quality western TV series such as \\"Tales of Wells Fargo\\" but this is not one of them. Think the worst of Alpha Video releases and that's what you'll get with this set. Shame on Universal for not providing some source material and shame on Timeless Media for putting this crappy set out with no word about the substandard quality on the packaging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laramie, The TV Series DVD Set","review":"The listing at Amazon says not available until March 30, 2009 but it is on sale at Costco now (March 2, 2009).

This DVD set includes just the colorized episodes.I found the DVD's to be either poorly made or all 3 were damaged somehow because they played poorly and there were mismatched video throughout with the audio. Too bad for the stories themselves were just as good as they were when I was growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Settling For Mediocre\\"","review":"The sound and video detracts and distracts from the show and it's characters.

However, this information is arranged in an ambiguous, haphazard manner, which makes it very difficult for the reader to sift out specific material. He incorporates his own views into those of his references, and the outcome is a very confusing, un-reader-friendly text.If you are intending to purchase this book as a textbook for your studies in Psychology, I strongly urge you to reconsider. There are many other texts which provide a far clearer and more concise package of information, with much less unnecessary rambling. However, if you are looking to buy a book merely for the purpose of general knowledge or interest, without having to take an examination on the topic, then this may be a suitable book for you. Still, you will need to be really determined to read this book, otherwise you will probably be defeated by its dullness and lack of clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all good","review":"I was so disappointed in this cd which, among other things, features a weird salsa version of Make Believe.

These people have taken the Robert Russel Bennet symphonic arrangements and have turned them into a sound that is akin to holding your finger on a record so that is slows to an agonizing tempo distorting the whole sound. It was horrible that the music is performed in a 20's jazz style, sung far to improvisationally and with a hint of blues. Oh and the SALSA! WHAT?

It's about one of those homeless guys who rides around with the large black garbage over the bar. The lyrics \\"...with his living room on his lap\\" and \\"he doesn't know where he's going, but he's got a mirror to see where he's been\\" are my personal standout favorites.This one is a must have for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are marvelous books","review":"...

Children love to have the story read to them of how this young child has to decide which of three kittens to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful illustrations, but story very out of date","review":"The drawings by the author are wonderful. However, the story's basic story line is one of disregard of a child's feelings. April is told not to be naughty by expressing her feelings.

However, in this day and age, a child's emotional state is known to be an important factor in the life of that child, all the way to adulthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for the concert footage","review":"I bought this for the concert footage.

At the funeral, she meets Mile's son, who takes one look at her and claims that they have to be related because they have the same fine, fly-away hair with gray flecks in it. That just about sums up the book. From there, it's like the author didn't know in which direction to take them, so they just kind of drifted along day to day accepting this new knowledge and trying to figure out where to go from there. It was a very low-key, nondescript story with no particular aim to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, even though it was very light reading.","review":"I agree with the other reviews, in that this book didn't pack as big a punch as the rest of Lipman's work... but I really liked it anyways.She writes the best characters with the best dialogue, and that's good enough for me.The story revolves around the character's, Sunny's, mother's death, and the plot then spins out to involve everyone in this NH town with every character having their own fun quirks and mini-plot.Wait for paperback if you must, but it's a must read for Lipman fans. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the great elinor lipman i know","review":"I agree totally with the review of my fellow new yorker below. I love Elinor Lipman, but even the one other book of hers I didnt care for was better than this. It's as though she got another good idea, but wasnt really paying attention when writing the story. There are too many bit players in too many subplots that go nowhere. The main character is almost a complete blank. All we really know about her is she plays golf and seemed to have a rough time socially in high school. The main plot is also neglected. About halfway through I was asking myself, where is this going? What's the point? The usual snappy dialogue and feisty characters seemed to be watered down also. This is NOT typical Lipman. I found five of her other books to be excellent. If this is the first one you read, try one of the others. Even if you think this book is good, youll see how much better she can be. I'll try for better luck with her next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Elinor Lipman but...","review":"I looked forward to the release of this book so eagerly because I have loved- LOVED- everything else of Lipman's I have read... Ladies' Man, Inn at Lake Devine, Isabel's Bed, etc.But I was so disappointed by this one that I left it on the airplane rather than drag it back home.While it is Lipman's usual collection of eccentric characters with interwoven lives, I felt like nothing HAPPENED in this one. What did Sunny want? What was she after? She was a protagonist without a rudder. And the big revelation at the end is that her mother was slutty? So what? In the end it affected no one at all, apparently.If you have never read Lipman I definitely would start with some of her others. In my opinion, she is usually a much better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"raja anwar is a lier","review":"I KNOW THIS PERSON SINCE ALONG TIME. HE IS AN OPPORTUNIST.

The first time I brought home leeks I found them full of soil. Not to worry, on page 211, Mr. Grausman taught me how to clean them. What a relief to find that I was not the only person who might have found that a challenge. The Coq au Vin, fragrant and soul-satisfying, would be enough to recommend the cookbook but every page yields a happy new choice.

By the fourth day, it barely worked at all, and if it did, it was being held a certain way and it was very dim. 5 minutes later it was demolished and in the trash. Take my word for it. Save up another $10 or so and buy a more expensive one. This one just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"The light flickered on and off, then really stopped working except for intermittently.

Nothing too special about it, except that it uses AAA batteries instead of the flat ones. That is a huge advantage, and the reason I bought it.As for performance, it works very well. The button to turn it on is a little flaky and sometimes takes a little playing with in order to get a good solid dot. But, other than that, it is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a while.","review":"My cat and I loved this for a while but after about a year it stopped working - unless I shake and bang it, then it works for thirty seconds or so.

Maybe it was just a fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty scary... could have caused a fire!","review":"Had this for a couple months, and it worked fine for a while (except for the loose batteries inside which sometimes prevented it from turning on or staying on if tilted a certain way). The light was bright and it looked nice -- certainly looked more expensive than it really was. HOWEVER.... one evening we went to take it out of its nice black magnetic-flap box, and when touched it felt burning hot!!! We could not even pick it up! My husband immediately dropped it and said it felt like it was on fire! We managed to get the batteries out of it, and tossed the whole thing out. We are very lucky that this did not cause the black cardboard box that it was in to catch on fire inside our kitchen drawer!!! What if we had gone to bed that night without knowing about this issue!!!? We should probably contact the company about it, but I am sure these are made in China or something. You get what you pay for I guess. :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Housemartins still are the best","review":"I think ' The Housemartins ' are one of my favorite bands.

I've been listening to it since I was in college. I love the wry, subtle political and social commentary present in most songs. I love their voices and harmony. The slow songs like Build and The Light is Always Green and especially Johanesburg are the best. And any pop band that is willing to throw in instrumentals is cool in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop mastery at its best! Run and find this one now!","review":"'TPWGTTD' is one of the best brit-pop releases ever! If you want a good example of wry, tongue-in-cheek, up-tempo, quality pop muzik (talk about, Pop Muzik!), look no further. It is bands like The Housemartins and The Church that made me realize most good pop rock occured years ago, compared to the mostly garbage that's out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just Mindless Fun","review":"At first listen, this CD sounds like it's just fun, danceable bubble-gum pop. Well, the fun and danceable part is true, but it's much more than that. You will find that most of these songs are searing social commentaries. Take the title song for instance, which is about the shallow class of society that is so concerned with outward appearance and social standing that they don't even notice their own children starving. Yet the song is as foot-tapping as anything written in the 80s. Heaton's voice is an instrument in itself, and it is, in turn, haunting, joyful, anguished, mocking, empty and proud. The Housemartins (and their subsequent incarnation, The Beautiful South) were far too good to remain in obscurity. This is their best album, and it belongs in the music collections of vapid pop fans and music snobs alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good dish washer, sprays more like a shower head.","review":"A bit smaller than my original but it screws on and fits. The functions seem cheap but at least it doesn't leak, not yet. My old one had half as many holes for the sprayer and were much smaller, which was great for high pressure washing which this does not do. The holes are bigger and squared which requires good water pressure to fucntion as a dish washer. I wish there were more to choose from, it was this or something else twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attachment isn't standard","review":"I had this shipped directly to a rental in a remote location. The renter dismantled the broken sprayer only to discover the new unit would not screw onto the existing hose. Despite going to the only two local hardware stores and my willingness to pay an additional $40 for an adapter to make this work, he could not get it attached. So he bought another sprayer and we returned this one. He said the design looked pretty good, like it wouldn't break, but it wasn't metal as we had hoped and most importantly, he couldn't get it to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"I bought the Radial 6 months ago after researching the most popular loudspeaker docs (Bose, Klipsch, and JBL) for my wife's ipod. I am very happy that we decided on the JBL. Since purchasing the Radial we have had the opportunity to play it side-by-side to the Bose. The JBL has superior base, more volume, and better over-all sound quality. I have been impressed at the level of sound quality that comes out of this small apparatus (and its pretty stylish). Completely satisfied - love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average","review":"I receive this unit recently and was really surprise by the sound quality. Very good at low and medium voulume.

It would be nice if it included a usb cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sound, Little Package","review":"I've got four ipod speaker systems from portable to Bose to Klipsch with sub woofer and this one is my favorite. It fills a room with good thumpin' sound, it takes up very little space and it looks very cool. Highs can be a little weak so you have to adjust the ipod EQ for your room but other than that it is the most bang for your buck and people always remark on the looks. I just bought a second one for the game room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound, worth the price","review":"I first bought the JBL Radial Micro for my iPod and thought the sound was ok. But after reading numerous reviews about the JBL Radial High-Performance iPod Loudspeaker, I decided to return the Micro and bought the larger one. It is worth the difference in price! There was a huge difference in sound quality. Not only does it sound amazing (crisp sound with great bass), I love the way it looks! After buying mine, I bought two more as gifts for my nephews. They love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!","review":"I purchased this unit for a vacation rental rather than having a tradional stereo. The quality, sound, and especially the bass is great. Dont expect earth shattering sound but the size vs. peformance is best I have heard. I own a couple of Imation units that are more compact units for traveling but by far this JBL dominates them. The bass is awesome for a unit of this size, to repeat myself again.Great for a small place or bedroom. Or in my case, a rental property.JBL provides all these different adapters for different Ipods but for some reason, the adapter doesnt fit in that well for the 80gig ipod. Its cut out a few times and the remote isnt working that well with that adapter. No worries though, you dont need those adapters and all the Ipods dock in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote quits working..two different units","review":"I bought this product and the remote quit working withing couple weeks.

I did a lot of research for a great-sounding iPod dock/speaker system before buying so I expected it to be great, and I have not been disappointed. It has great sound and great power, more than I can ever use in my flat without infuriating my neighbors. It's attractive and compact. My only complaint is that the volume moves up/down in noticeable increments, so it's occasionally difficult to get it at the precise volume I'd like (again, the neighbors), but that is a very minor annoyance. The little remote takes a bit of thought to use but is quite easy once you get the hang of it, and there is a handy sticker guide to the buttons on the back of the remote, if you need a hint. It wasn't the cheapest one around, but once you listen to it the reason why is obvious; it is absolutely worth the extra spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sound from a small package","review":"Incredible sound featuring amazing bass response. I found it to be more impressive than it's Bose counterpart. After 6 months of daily use, I'm still in awe of it's sound quality. People come over my house and cant believe the sound is not coming from the much larger stereo system it's sitting next to.Note, Do Not confuse this model with JBL's micro versionMinor...My only complaints are; 1. A difficult to access power button. 2. An oddly shaped remote is cumbersome to hold and use in my large sized hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBL I-POD DOCK","review":"[..] I've had other i-docks and they just don't compare.

The heroine, Merry Mitchell, has a true past we learn about and learn to care about. The characters are not, for the most part, caricatures or stereotypical but drawn from life, believable.

When I received it for Christmas, I though it would sorta mix things up - that you could play it several times with different results. Unfortunately, once you get the guilty verdict, that's it. And this is very disappointing to me.Otherwise, it was fun. I thought it was difficult to see all of the clues in some scenes (like the scrap yard, it took me forever to find the crowbar). It was interesting to put together all the parts for a search warrant and arrest warrant. The graphics and characters were good too (Lenny even gets in some of his famous one liners).I've never played the first Law & Order game, but this one was fun. Very few technical glitches; in fact, it comes with a couple of patches in the event you have some problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Headache.","review":"I enjoy detective games. CSI, Nancy Drew, etc. However, I did not like Law & Order 2. First for the large cost the graphics are stiff and appear cheap. But my BIGGEST complaint (it may not be a problem for others) is that in order to search for evidence, the scene pans around. I found my self nauseated and had a severe headache. I am unable to complete this game because of this problem. In CSI and Nancy Drew games if you wanted to turn left you could move the mouse left and the screen will move slowly with the cursor moving on the screen. In this game if you move the mouse left, the cursor on the screen does not move....the whole picture moves in entirety giving you the sensation of the rug being pulled out from under you. Please do not think I am \\"fragile\\", I am not.This may not be a problem with most people.

Woo Hoo! The acting is great and the story was just what you'd expect to see on TV. It was easy to learn how the game worked, and it really kept my interest. I liked finding new people to talk to and more places to look for clues. I don't want to give anything about the case away (it has lots of surprises!), but it is definitely of the ripped from the headlines variety that I love the show for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun to be this short","review":"First off, the game is totally worth the price - the plot is good, it's challenging without being too hard and the voice acting is way above what you find in most games.My only real complaint is the length - I played this one in just a few sittings (and that was even with panicking for half an hour thinking I had thrown out crucial evidence).But you can't beat the fun you get for the price. The story is compelling, and I enjoyed using interrogation, evidence collection and surveillance to solve the case.I'll be first in line to buy any more Law & Order games that are released; I just hope there's a little more to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures, but a waste of time","review":"I bought this book expecting to see a lot more information on the archaeology and actual history of Cleopatra's palace and Alexandria, but instead, found a sappy, pseudo-romantic fictionalized treatment of Cleopatra, Caesar, and Antonius.

But that's not to say that this disc is disappointing. This is a good performance with thrash riffing, strong vocals and a tendency to lean toward the epic (as in the two central compositions, 'Anthem to the Estranged' and 'Badlands', both over seven minutes each). As far as late-80s thrash metal goes these fellows had a good grasp of the style, though they also ventured out of it occasionally, with acoustic guitars and such. The only thing that really bothers me about this album is the sub-par production, which is a little murky and unclear. Apart from that, it's a more than decent metal release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes It Easy For Men to Bottlefeed.","review":"Not being women, we men are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to feeding the baby. Babies can be very, very fussy and there;s not a darn thing we can do about it. So it's important that we have the best tools, as it were, to take on the task. And believe me, anyone who's tried to feed a baby that just won't take the bottle knows that a daunting task it can be. The Playtex Drop Ins nurser takes much of the uncertainty out of the feeding equation and makes for not only a happier baby, but also a happier dad. It's simple to use, the results are excellent -- a quiet baby is a happy parent -- and with the drop-in liner, keeping the bottle sterile just became that much easier. Definitely recommended for both a happy baby and a happy father (and mother)/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles no mess no fuss","review":"I love these bottles. They are so easy to use and they also work with the breast pumps. That is one of the things that had made these bottles stand out amongst the others. they are so easy to use and have no mess and no fuss.

Not only is clean up a breeze, but they are also quick and easy to fix. My daughter had acid reflux, so it was very important that she not get air in her stomach when she ate.

I also love that they are quick and easy to heat up, and you can feel the temperature of the milk through the liner.I only gave them four stars because by the time my daughter need the 8 ounce bottle she also need the fast flow nipple instead of the slow flow, so I had to buy separate nipples, but I consider this only a minor inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off","review":"These come in both boy and girl colors.

It is a great improvement over the previous 8 oz inserts.I tried a dozen different bottles ans nipples before my breastfed baby took this one.

I prefer the older ones more. I like them because you can take the lid and snap it into the bottom of the bottle.

The Avent ones measure up nicely, but what we like about the Playtex Drop Ins is that our daughter won't suck in as much air as she might from other bottles.Yes, they can measure expensively in the long run, but we'd prefer that over our daughter, who drinks a ton, drinking in too much air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good set.","review":"This is a good, light nurser.

Only then did we realize that you can't go by the markings on the bottles (and you can't read the markings on the liners either) because it is so far off. Now I have to measure the formula into the measuring cup first...as if you need an extra step. Not to mention that if you don't rinse out the liners, your garbage will smell SO bad.I also agree with the other moms who wrote about the formula running down the sides of his face.

My 2 1/2 month old does very well with these bottles. I had to go back to work full-time at 8 weeks so the convenience of this system is great. I have a Medela Freestyle pump and I bought thePlaytex Nursing Necessities One Step Breast Milk Storage Kitso that I can pump directly into the drop ins. It saves me a lot of bottle washing time. However, my big complaint with this system is the nursers themselves. I've had to buy 3 different sets because they keep getting warped. First my husband boiled them to sterilize them, not realizing it was just the nipples that were supposed to be boiled before first use. They shrank and warped. Then he put one in the bottle warmer (against my advice) and it also warped. I understand that Playtex advises against boiling these bottles, but would it really be such a big deal to manufacture them with plastic that could withstand a little heat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipples Don't Work!","review":"I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter. I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us, and after 2 weeks, 8 of the slow-flow nipples didn't work. They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut. I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 (?). Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples, which will probably just end up clogging again. The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles, but I can't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't push the liner up straight, it can come undone and leak","review":"I really do not care for these bottles.

This is an incredibly flawed system. If you try to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag your chance of either pulling the bag free or putting a whole in it is large. Plus the hole at the bottom to teach said bag is way to small for the average adult hand and has a sharp bottom edge to boot. Finally as the baby finishes the bottle the bag collapses into the nipple making it nearly impossible for her to truly finish whatever milk is at the bottom. And! If she breaks suction air gets in anyway! Steer clear of the for your own sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrinks when boiled for sterilizing","review":"Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush. I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth. This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size. Strangest thing I have ever seen.

Realized that when you do order, you have to be careful and don't just order because they are cheap. You have to be sure of the colors they will ship to you if you're particular about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"I had no idea what I was getting when I purchased this item. Yes, they are \\"cute\\", but they are made out of a very cheap, rigid plastic. This is not like the traditional Playtex nurser and will, literally, crack under pressure. What's more, this bottle was completely melted when I used it in my steamer bottle warmer. I do also have the traditional plastic nursers and have used them happily (with and without the bottle warmer), with great success.Do not get suckered in by the flashy packaging. Spend the extra couple of dollars and buy the tried-and-true original design.Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Original Nurser 8-10 OZ: TurquoiseUpdate--My comment is not about the liners, or excess air, etc. I have done just fine with the drop-ins and I love that I can still buy rubber nipples for the nurser. I'm speaking specifically to the quality of the actual plastic bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible bottles!!!","review":"pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to \\"burp\\" them to get all the air out...would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle.- measurements are WAY off (8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz)- extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces. i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough.- my kids had more gas with these.- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I love these bottles for my son, i usually just buy them in the store, but since they were less then they are in the store, i figured why not. But when I ordered them, I was under the impression that they were going to be the bottles in the picture, since there is no option to choose which bottles you would like to order. I received designed bottles for girls, when i emailed the seller she refused to refund all of my money and told me simply to \\"give them to a friend\\" or to ship them back and I would be refunded half my money, which is completely pointless since the cost of shipping would probably be the same as not sending them back at all. Not worth ordering these bottles & it was a waste of my money. DO NOT order bottles from this sender. Colors really do vary, since I got pink and purple butterfly bottles for my son. The bottles are great but don't waste your money and just buy them from the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles, but newborns beware!","review":"This bottle is excellent in producing less gas. But, I DON'T recommend these bottles for newborns. The nipple is so wide at the top that my son kept getting a blister on his top lip. We had to switch to Gerber for newborns.

I like Playtex when on the go, when I don't have to worry about washing the bottle.The 4 oz is a good size for infants and because the nipple is soft my son had no problems with adjusting to new nipple (even with only occasional bottle feeding).I have to say that for mixing formula in later stage I prefer regular bottles.Overall it is neat idea with drop in holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Gas for Baby","review":"My daughter has been using these for the last (6) weeks and loves them.

Unfortunately inconvenient when they can't take a good boiling or steam cleaning...Measurements on side aren't accurate, but I wasn't too put off by it, since these were meant for supplementing breast feeding & I'm not too structured.This makes baby work way too hard-I actually considered widening the whole. I even tried sucking on it myself to get a better idea of the issue-Wow! The strain actually hurt my mouth. It was tough just to get a bit of liquid (and it only worked for us on an incline-I did not want to encounter broken bag trying to push drink through.Sadly, too much air injested=fussy baby and frustrated mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, nice design","review":"Baby takes well to this design. Since he is breast fed, it has been difficlut to find a bottle that he will accept. The bottles are simple and plain. I think the cutesy designs on some bottles are probably more for parents than babies so I don't mind the simplicity. This is very nice gift for any mom--even one who plans to breast feed. Each bottle is 8 oz--a very convenient size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ounce markers cute but not helpful","review":"This newer, cutesy version of the Playtex Nurser has a major design flaw - the ounce markings on the side of the rigid plastic shell holder are not horizontal LINES, which you expect for an accurate measure. Rather, the ounce gradations are marked by adorable but basically useless rounded leaves, bubbles, raindrops, etc. Where does the ounce mark truly begin? At the top of the icon? Bottom? Smack dab in the middle?? (Try eyeballing THAT at 3 AM!) Because baby is on a strictly liquid diet for at least the first 4 - 6 months, being able to obtain correct & exact measurements at feeding time is VERY important.I'm sticking with the less attractive but much more practical ORIGINAL Playtex Nurser. They are hard to find but worth it! They are also made of a much sturdier plastic than these flimsy bottles. My baby seems to be doing just fine with them and they're working well for us, though I'll probably switch to a non-liner bottle system once he passes the 3-month mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"The playtex drop in bottles are very handy and are great for a busy mom. The drop in liner makes it easier for moms to wash bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan...baby hates them","review":"I was really hoping that these bottles would help my baby take in less air, like they advertised, but never really got around to figuring out whether or not they would have because she flat-out refused the nipple. I realize that babies have varying nipple preferences, but aside from these bottles, my little one will suck on anything you throw at her (and a lot of things you don't). But these nipples are long and hard and kept slipping out of her little mouth...frustrating for everybody. I'm sure the drop-ins are convenient, and it would be lovely to have her spitting up a little less, but unfortunately these are not the bottles for us.(Avent's nipples are much more like the real thing...baby loves them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY -- OLD BOTTLES THAT CONTAIN BPAS","review":"I received bottles dated 2002 when I purchased this product.

I purchased this bottle. The first time I used it I thought that it seemed like the ounce lines where off. When I got home I got out a measuring cup and the liners for this bottle are off by a little over a 1/4 of an ounce per ounce. This doesn't seem like a lot until you think about the fact that for an 8 ounce bottle you are only putting in enough water for roughy 5 ounces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be perfect with one small improvement...","review":"I use only these and the Playtex Ventaire Natural Shape bottles. They've both worked great for me & my boy. These bottles are especially convenient since you really only have to sanitize the nipples. My son rarely spits up and both bottles keep air out more than any other bottle I've ever used. One thing that would make these bottles better is an easier way to squeeze the air out of the bag, I guess my fingers just aren't long enough. I know there is another bottle by Playtex that has this feature, but why not make them all as convenient? One other question I have is, why are the 8 ounce bottles only marked up to 6 ounces?

I am a repeat buyer so the pros definitely out way the cons. Very realistic texture. Keeps you nice and wet after. and the most important for me is it didn't irritate me when things like KY and other store lubricants make me burn *down there* (NOT FUN!!) The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it actually turns to like.. a glue residue? Not really sticky, but on your *kitty* it will dry up and look like dry glue, or on your toys or whatever else it gets on. and if you can imagine.. rolling your hands together when there is glue? you get those pieces of rolled up glue, it's kind of the same affect when you are having intercourse or toy, it leaves those little rolled up pieces. but it's nothing too serious, this is the first one I have tried off amazon and I liked it otherwise so just sticking with it. great price too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value but needs antibacterial antifungal feature","review":"As advertised, this lube remains slippery for a long time.

It feels sturdy and should be able to take some impact and waterproof.Things could be better:1) quicker focussing: you cannot use this for sports since it's quite slow2) no photo preview right after you took the picture3) better strap: the little loopy thing which hooks to the camera should be more sturdy4) optical zoom would be nice.5) video is very low res (400x320), and sound is choppy. And you cannot use zoom during the video.6) white balance is sometimes inconsistent between shots. If you're pickyperhaps you should set it at a setting instead of autoOverall, for the price, nothing comes close at the price point you get it at Amazon.

I had no issues at all with water seeping in. Since I used it for snorkeling, I really did not take it too far underwater. The zoom seemed to work well for a \\"digital zoom\\". There were a couple of down side items though. First, the display was sometimes hard to see, especially underwater. Second, the buttons are rather close together and I think could be arranged better.

It does have a 4x6 section with perforated edges, but that doesn't help me at all unless I have the software.

With *very* close inspection I can see that there is a boldfaced narrative as promised, but it's not especially bold. It's hard to distinguish the boldface from the regular font. And I don't care for the little titles over the various subsections.

If you watch it, expect your only entertainment will be from taking in the ironic disconnect between the producer's serious intentions and his risible results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Movie....Just a few dislikes.","review":"I turly loved the movie and thought the actors play their parts good (especial Tinny Lister, He stole the movie for me), Everthing was Beautiful.My only problem was the story line, so much diffent from book of which I read three time(I so Loved it). One part I thought should not have change was Esther meeting the King before her (one night with the King)the whole point of the movie's name and the scriptures truth (prepuring a year for one night).I was still blessed, will be showing it at my Youth meeting.

Way way better dialogue and acting on the Bible series movie \\"Ester\\" which was actually better than good. F Murray Abraham and other good actors plus great writing. This is kind of a Ester meets Lord of the Rings type fantasy flop. Some computer (yawn) special effects that in no way reflect the biblical world and some beyond boring dialogue which makes for a 13 year olds dream. Anyone who thinks they have to \\"add\\" drama to this Bible Story is out in left field. I shelled out 14.50 plus shipping.

It could have been a great movie, if they had only stuck to the original script that is the book of Esther. My copy of this DVD is going into the garbage. I wouldn't want my children or anyone else watching it, since it's not the biblical story of Esther, though it purports to be, and I don't want anyone believing that it IS the true story. The truth is MUCH better than this made-up nonsense. They should have stuck to the original, or else called the movie by another name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book!","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. It was boring and not true to the book of Esther. Just read the story in the Bible, it is very exciting and touching. Why they have to change the story is beyond me.

Not perfect but still very good and those who would prefer to critize it instead of looking at its good points should remember that in this day and age we are very lucky to find something that is worth watching. How many people hear the movie was not very Biblical and therefore didnt watch it. what does that tell the media and movie producers?

It's not terrible, just don't go in expecting a whole lot of Biblical accuracy.

It could have been done a lot better.

No, Esther did not run through pouring rain, with thin slip-like material turning it into a wet t-shirt perversion. \\"Esther 5:1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes. She stood in the courtyard of the king's palace, facing his throne room\\". She was not dripping wet. No, she did not have a boyfriend that is mentioned in the Bible and no she did not dump him because he was turned into a eunuch at the kings palace.Those that care about not distorting Almighty God's word by adding to or taking away from and for sure not demoralizing God's truth please do not take this as fact, simply because this was taken from a book in the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY","review":"This is such a good movie.

After purchasing the video we were extremely disappointed. Many aspects of the Biblical account are changed that destroy the beauty and purity of the biblical account. One of the most distressing ones is that the King and Eshter are shown to have a long standing lovers quarrel over the misunderstanding that each of them has been messing around with a member of the other sex that isn't resolved until the day of the banquet. We don't feel that it is pleasing to the Lord for His Word to be handled as it was in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrenched","review":"I was quite shocked after viewing this DVD. The story is wrenched, filled with fantasy and magic, nothing near the original story.The Esther in this story has a special necklace (amulet/talisman) that shines stars of David when light strikes it. She loses it and gets it back a few times in the story. This special necklace is what finally comes to her rescue. If they really wanted to squiggle this shining light effect in, they should have thought up something with the urim and thumim.To me it's pure paganism. Although you don't see her literally worshiping the thing, she does often grasp it when afraid. An idol, no matter how small is still an idol. I would recommend the \\"Bible Series\\" version of Esther, which is very good.I give it one star because at least there aren't lengthy love scenes. Some \\"bible\\" movies like to stretch the amount of human flesh shown to the uttermost limit. This one is moderate in that aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night With the King","review":"I received the DVD very promptly.

It is Biblical as well as enhanced and the time sequences are a little out of order, but to be able to get everything in in 2 hours must have been a difficult task. It still was a very enjoyable movie, and good actors for a short budget film. But the most memorable actor in this film is Luke Goss as the king.

I had read the story of Esther several years ago, so was somewhat familiar.While watching the movie, I did not know if the movie was bibically correct or not, but after I went home, I took out my bible and reread the story, and it was surprisingly accurate. There of course were some Hollywood details that were added, but I do not think that they distracted from the bible story because the bible does not talk about them.I do have to agree that the filming and lighting could have been much better, but I think that once you get past that aspect, the movie is pretty well made. There are some pretty moving moments with music, such as when Esther approaches the King. It would have been nice if the entire movie could have been filled with that passion.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and have just added it to my wishlist from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie strayed way too much from the original Bible story. If you are an unbeliever and never knew the story of Esther you would wind up very confused watching this! the character of Esther was a breezy and casual woman, when Israelite women in those times were very humble and meek having been broken by the tragedy they had witnessed after being taken into captivity. Although it briefly touches on her losing her parents, her overall attitude does not reflect any seriousness of what was historically going on at the time. It reflects the casualness and rebellion in this modern era. We were very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonderful Love Story We've Been Waiting For","review":"I am reviewing this DVD based on seeing the theater release today. This movie will satisfy both women and men. For women, it is truly the wonderful love story we have been waiting for. Here is a young woman who wins the heart of the king by her inner beauty, innocence, and purity of heart and spirit. The movie is free of vulgarity, sexual content, and the other things that keep me away from so many movies. For men, there is intrigue, suspense, the threat of war, strong and noble men, and the sudden ironic twist of fate at the end. I would encourage you to buy this video because it will inspire you, and it will inspire your teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to its potential","review":"I don't remember seeing the release for this movie at the movie theater but once I saw the advertisement on TV I had to buy it.

So, I went to see it one Monday afternoon. The first part of the movie was easy to follow but as it went along it made less sense. I felt as the movie neared the end; it was like they put things in that came out of nowhere. The scenes between Tiffany and Luke were so plastic; lovers just don't behave that way! Anyway, as I walked out, I said to myself,\\"Is that the best you can do?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie!!!","review":"This movie seems to have been made by a bunch of amateurs who had hollywood connections and money. Scenes of the city with waterfalls.....just a little overdone! Looks like they tried to borrow from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" just a little too much. And what is it with that Star of David necklace? When did the Star become a Jewish identifier? Actors??? The only saving graces were Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole and John Rhys-Davies (just because a movie has big names in it doesn't mean it's good). I couldn't quite understand Luke Goss's character, Xerxes, most of the time. This story could be made into a good movie in the hands of talented professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted to like this movie","review":"I really wanted to like this film. I love the biblical story and had looked forward sharing this film with my catechism class. Unfortunately, I am not going to show it in class because it's not a good film.The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible. The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?). I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed. There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone. This one unfortunately missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and Good Parts","review":"The bare skeleton of the plot of the biblical book of Esther is in this movie. Actually, they ended much closer to the original story than I thought they would. However, they added so much to the story that at times it was hard to recognize. Yes, they took a beautiful dramatic, but very short story in the Bible and stretched it into a very long movie. At times, it seemed like an eternity. However, there are some good points. Esther use of the stories of the Bible was very good. Some of the scenes were actually touching.It was a good try, but they took too many liberties with the story, historical facts, and the CGI. A seminary student should go through this story and point out all the historical inacurracies. That is a little sad. However, they did try to place the story in its historical context, which I did enjoy. The dialog at times creaked and at times soared. I don't know if I recommend the movie, but the producers' hearts were in the right place."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is...","review":"I did not watch this movie critically but I thought it was great.

If the screen play writer had used the facts, the movie would have been much more interesting. King Xerxes was portrayed as sympathetic and caring. He was just the opposite, self absorbed and out of touch with his kingdom. Esther had 2 banquets for the King before making her request known and she did not run in the rain, looking haggard to see the king. She was dressed in her finest gown after 3 days of fasting and came before the throne, beautiful, yet unannounced. The movie length was fine and for entertainment purposes, it was worth my time. Just don't go in thinking it will be much like the Biblical account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible butchering of the real story","review":"Honestly, I will make this short and to the point.

The good news is that this movie was, for the most part, was in accord with the Old Testament Book of Esther; however, the production itself was more of a Hollywood extravaganza than one that accurately depicted the dress and lifestyles of the historical period.

The beautiful story of Esther and how she had to put her faith in God and trust that even if she was killed she had to tell the truth in order to save her people.This movie can be understood by even those who do not know scripture.

It was not a believable film at all to me, therefore, I could not continue watching it. The acting, directing was just horrible in my opinion. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This movie was quite well done. Naturally, as always, Hollywood takes its liberties. The one scene that was drastically changed was the idea that Ester came to the King inappropriately dressed.The Bible says the opposite.Also,the King was not upset with Ester as he offered her up to 1/2 his Kingship for her petition. Yet, true to the law of the Medes and Persians, the Kings edict could not be changed. Yet, Israel was given the freedom to defend itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have/must see","review":"this is a great love story from the bible once you watch it you just want to keep hitting rewind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"My wife and I enjoyed watching this. I wouldn't say everything in it is accurate, but it had many interesting ideas on the interpretation of the book of Esther. (historical knowledge of that time period won't allow every gap to be filled anyway, so obviously some guesswork or interpretation will always be involved in a movie like this)I didn't give it 5 stars because during some scenes I thought it wasn't exactly accurate with the Biblical account (maybe the makers took dramatic license, but I prefer accuracy). But other than that, we really enjoyed it. It made me think about many of the aspects of life back then that I hadn't thought about before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Even if you watch this movie never having heard of the Biblical book of Esther or the other book \\"Hadassah\\" by Tommy Tenney, from which this movie is based, it's terrible. The acting is lousy. The actors seemed so unsure of themselves that they mumbled the entire time! So I assume the director must have been MIA or lousy, too. And the editing is the worst of all. A few scenes that needed that \\"fade to black\\" moment rushed right into the next scene, while others dragged. Some dramatic moments were lost because of this. I feel like the whole thing was rushed in the making.

I should have known from the instant it was pronounced \\"good for the whole family\\" that it wouldn't be a filtered and weak version of the book. The book was amazing. I really enjoyed it because it went above and beyond the normal story of Queen Ester. The movie cut out half the book and took out all the violence in an effort to make yet another movie full of good, clean family fun.However, the costumes and the acting were very good. They should have had more of Peter O'Toole, though. This movie definitely had great potential, especially with Sharif and O'Toole part of the cast. However, by taking out half the book and editing it for content, we loose a lot of the story, and this movie just becomes one of the many Queen Ester movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Night With the King","review":"If your looking to get the true story of Esther, look to the Bible not in this movie.

It's a childish, trite, terribly acted mishmash. The girl who plays Esther can barely say her lines, and she is not always understandable (she is cute, however, in that prom-queen way). And as bad acting goes she's not the worst of the lot (Xerxes is).On the other hand, it appears to have cost a pile of money to make, and one can pass an idle evening before one's TV screen watching the images flicker by.

It even added a little 'magic' in the film when only those who had God could see the stars that Esther's necklace gave out.Perhaps if I had not read the novel, and was moved my 'enchantment' in a 'non-enchantment' movie, I would have liked it.That is truthfully all that was wrong in my eyes: Hardly anything like the book, and no part of 'fantasy' belonged in this kind of story.If you haven't read the book, I will admit that you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are fan of the book, the movie just kills it to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of Esther.... Sort of","review":"I was glad I saw this movie for free on T.V. Now that I saw it I'm done. It was dramatic, and cinematic... but hopelessly flawed. It would have made a better picture book than a movie. It was cheesy, kind of like a forties bible movie; but with better costumes, sets and effects... and only slightly better acting. It was very unscriptural, with many of the changes damaging to both the characters and the overall story. Both were filled with unpractical holes. Esther in particular was played as a flighty, silly, goofy girl, who somehow still wins the heart of the king. The biblical Esther was not recorded as flighty, silly or goofy. She is portrayed as having a habit of going out alone after dark, something an unmarried girl would not have dared to do. There is a much better version out there, titled Esther, far superior in every way to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One night with the king","review":"I read the book of Esther and watched the movie twice. Very good. I have passed it on so others can watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible film","review":"I'll give it one star because the quality is much higher than any other Christian produced film I've ever seen. The sets and costumes were nice That's about all it has going for it though.Poorly acted, overly complicated, unnecessary love interests, no attempt at any historical accuracy when it came to dialog. The accents were all over the place. The drama was dull. Even on fast forward it bored me.I've not been this disappointed in a movie for a long time. The Bible is chock full of excellent story lines. Why must they be butchered so? If Christians are such a big consumer market, give us something that is worthy of consuming. Not this \\"based on a novel that was based on a Bible story then with our own extra twist\\" tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Inaccurate","review":"I was disappointed with the producers and writers putting their own spin on this movie instead of keeping the facts of the Bible. I was so hoping that after I read the story of Esther in the Bible that this movie would help give more understanding of how it really was. There was a lot of fluff and some of it was so opposite of what the Bible said. I wish more realistic and factual movies would be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"I was really excited about this movie coming out, because I love the story. But even the first 20 minutes were disappointing. It was filmed and acted out like some cheap movie you would see on tv in the afternoon. It was almost like they assumed we should already know the whole story. It moved way too fast, and just didn't keep my attention at all. Not professional in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"When it came out, the movie was highly recommended to me. We showed this movie to a group of about 25 women. The costumes and settings are visually stunning, and there are bright spots in the acting, but it was historically inaccurate to my knowledge and was too slow for all our tastes. The King mumbled and the story line does not follow The Book of Esther, which makes a good story on its' own without the added plots. Not terrible, just wish it had been better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Roy Rides again","review":"Great deal for the old fans of John Astin.... Not only the 2 movies but a great looking tin embossed box... WHAT A DEAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"standard TV movies","review":"I'm not going into the story lines, since those have been covered. I just found these movies to be pretty standard TV movie comedies that did not have any real laughs. They are humorous, but not that funny. I did not hate them, but can't really recommend them either. But at the sales price offered sometimes, you can own 2 movies for less than renting them, so maybe worth buying at that point to judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product crappie service!!!!!!!","review":"well for starters i paid for 2 day delevery and it to almost 2 weeks for it to be sent out so i guess i'm just screwed on the extra fee i paid for speedy delevery. so i don't think i'll ever order from here again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Roy Slade/ Brothers O'Tool","review":"A good family movie, just funny in so many ways.

This is one of the greatest RTS games ever made and this battle chest has everything you could ever need to enjoy it. It has the expansions, the strategy books to those expansions and its all specially packaged. I have had this product for several years and I still go back every few months and play the whole thing over again. Its a lot of fun and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best RTS/RPGs on the market","review":"Not only a great deal, this game has stood the test of time and is still enjoyable today. Play solo in campaign mode, multiplayer RTS classic mode, user created maps, mini games, tower defense, DOTA, castle defenders, and the list goes on!If you like to command and conquer, this game is a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warcraft III","review":"I like this game immensely!It's fun, and addicting. I guess you could say that about the whole Warcraft line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Deal!","review":"This thankfully is exactly as the description describes: Warcraft III, and The Frozen Throne Expansion. I am running on a Windows 7 computer and it runs outrageously smoothly. Also, the product got here in 3 days as was the basic shipping. If you have never played Warcraft, it is probably the best multiplayer RTS that exists. The amount of variables and complexity are just amazing. You have full control over every aspect that you could want to control, but units will act on commands you give them and you don't have to constantly watch over them. Very balanced, very awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun","review":"Warcraft III in itself is a very good game with excellent graphics and exhillerating gameplay but what really makes this game is the multiplayer and how you can download games like DotA and battle tanks. I highly recommend this for all who love RTS games and mythological worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle for lifetime, RPG for one week","review":"I love this game the most. I've played W3 and extension FT for a long time, and I still enjoy it. This chest is way better than the single CD case. People who purchased this one should know what I'm talking about. Perfect contents inside!!!I gave this one 4 stars out of 5 because the RPG is boring. I believe it is the only negative part of this great game. I almost finished all storyline for one week. However, I think there will be some update on the internet. But that will never be the reason to keep your hands away from this chest, it's the best game in the best case after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great game and still has life.","review":"I recently bought this in anticipation of Defense of the ancients 2 so I could play the original defense of the ancients. The original game is still great and the dota community is still going to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! If it weren't for the winter Steam sale, i would be playing this non-stop","review":"The game includes a manual for both Warcraft 3 (WC3) and Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne, AS WELL as little cute strategy guides for both of them as well. The best part of this game is not it's Campign, which runs a good long while with a very nice story, but it's Mod-ability (or ability to modify the games).The two biggest downsides I found were:1. Even on Easy, the AI skunks you in Multiplayer2. LANing with your mates is harder, and I was expecting Starcraft 1's easy ability to create a game and play with local friends easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE WARCRAFT 3 BUT....","review":"i love warcraft3 but BLIZZARD is shooting themselves in the head by not updating there games. i baught a new MacBook Pro, Game clearly says OS X on the cover, but when i try'd to play it says i cant play because the game needs PowerPC to run the game. really BLIZZARD you used to be the Macintosh of gaming and now your no better than any other company.. i've play'd since the release back in 94 and have bien a long time fan until the last few years. IF BLIZZARD DONT FIX THESE PROBLEMS SOON THEY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old hat, same advise, Movies don't play in Windows 7","review":"I owned this game when it was pretty much new, but it wasn't exactly mine. Therefore years later, I chose to purchase so that I could attempt to get reasonably competent. The game was always a challenge for me because of the liberal use/requirment to use spells. Knowing the hotkeys to Heroes helps. I just wanted to make a comparison between SC2 and WC3. Problem for me being that the copyright protection for the two are polar opposites. You don't even need disk for Warcraft3. Starcraft2 forces me to sign in and, would be okay if it weren't for, mandatory updates. Satellite High Speed has limited data usage. What am I supposed to do? Internet cafe everytime they rearrange game dynamics... how about don't play it. That's why a nine year old game is far superior to SC2! End of diatribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only own one game..... this is it.","review":"The real gem in this package is \\"The Frozen Throne\\". Sure the Campaigns are really fun and well done;but, the online play is what really shines. If you have a decent internet connection, you can sign onto Blizzard's Battle Net and play against players all over the world for free. Thousands of players are ready to take you on in solo matches or with partners in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 games.For nearly 3years I have played this game almost on a nightly basis. I am a leader in a top-rated clan where I can meet up with my clan-mates and game.If you need a change from the ordinary game, you can always play one of the free custom games based on \\"The Frozen Throne\\" like Battleship Pro, footmen frenzy, footmen vs grunts, tower defense, or the fantastic custom called DOTA { Defense of the Ancients\\" ([...])Go check out some game footage on [....]Get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent","review":"el producto esta en buen estado y funciona, a pesar de una cantidad grande de rayones en su superficie pero es utilizable..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warcraft III Battlechest Review","review":"I enjoy playing strategy games.

Honestly this is like the first Civilization - a horrible blast from the past. Poor graphics pointless sound, Overall just awful game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Time management gets overwhelming","review":"The Battlechest is pretty good. You get both WarCraft3 and its expansion (the Frozen Throne) and 4 manuals: a base manual for each game (although the base manual for the expansion is tiny), and a quest manual for each game.I think I would have loved this game had it been turnbased. But it is real time, and managing a group of warriors here, your workers there, your buildings somewhere else, another group of warriors in another place again all in real time is a huge toll on me. Ok, there are hot keys (to switch among groups of units) that make your life easier, but it is still boring to have to care for so many things at once.I stopped playing this game very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is one of the worst games I've ever played. The RPG element is almost non-existant. The RTS element is incredibly dumbed down -- just build a few soldiers, a few archers, a few spellcasters, and a few artillery, and attack, and that sums out every campaign mission and online game you'll ever play. The story is ridiculous, it's a copy of Starcraft/Brood War almost to the letter -- you start as good guy, good guy turns bad, you play as formerly good bad guy, then you beat the bad guy who commands the formerly good bad guy. Every creature you face talks trash to you right before you kill it, along the lines of \\"you fool, you DARE challenge me!\\" Every single time. Just about every cutscene involves some idiot getting tricked into joining the bad guys, like in Brood War except even dumber.If Blizzard hadn't built up so much goodwill with Warcraft 2, Starcraft and Diablo, this game would have been in the bargain bin after two weeks. 0/10 and may god have mercy on your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'm a big fan of Starcraft and WCIII. Blizzard creates amazing products for its customers. It's story in campaign mode is very entertaining. It's great if you need a RTS fix, and also great for those that play a lot of UMS maps. Dota anyone? Overall a great diverse product."},{"rating":"2","title":"GG","review":"i own the chinese version of this game. since everytime i play this game i have to use a loader to play, i just decided to buy the english version. well,i really love this game although i don't play it that much anymore, but i still want to have the full set just to collect it. i highly recommend this game to whoever likes games from Blizzard. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"For an older game...","review":"For an older game it looks great and runs surprisingly smoothly.A real time strategy (RTS) game, which is not my favorite... with some elements that are like the game Civilization (also not my favorite) would make me think I would not like this game, yet for some reason, I do.I don't know how long it would keep a speed gamer happy and playing, but I am still playing it and enjoying it.I recommend Warcraft III for a fun game and the Battle Chest version is simply a great value, getting the expansion modules and core game bundled."},{"rating":"2","title":"old but fun","review":"I didn't try this game till I had already played WoW for years. So it's old and no longer got that polished look it would of had when it was first out. Yet that doesn't mean it's not fun.

If you're a WoW player, I would suggest playing this to learn more of the background story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to buy it again.","review":"I owned Warcraft 3 Reign of Chaos when it came out and bought the expansion shortly after. The game is incredible. The story line pulls you in and the online mini games are amazing. I play all the time and I'm a full time student and I work full time.

Love this game, Had to buy it again after losing the old disks. :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good RTS game.","review":"I just got this game, like maybe 5 hours ago from a local gamestop store. I've played many RTS/STRATEGY games, I like this most. It has superb graphics, for it's time, it was amazing. Still great for now. Yeah, I know there's like StarCraft II and Diablo III and all that new games, but it's good to try the taste of more classic games. This game is good for adults and children, and it's not ridiculously hard. It is a well-balanced difficulty game, but if you want a challenge, try hard. There's 4 races, but since I've got it for a short amount of time, i used Orc and Human race. I enjoy the human race more, because its more challenging. So if you wanted to buy this game for yourself/someone else, go ahead. Buy it. You won't regret it.Graphics: 4.5Gameplay: 5.0Sounds: 5.0Difficulties: 4.4Controls: 5.0Overall: 5.0If you havea few extra bucks, And you have a Window XP/Vista/7, OR a Mac, go ahead and get this game.

All the characters are squished on my laptop and even cartoonier than intended.2) There are harsh and constant limits on unit production... So my fond memories of attacking the enemy with massive armadas are but memories.3) Because of that, the gameplay really depends on leveling and managing one or two hero characters. Micro-managing single characters is not why I came to this game.Conclusion: I got this game hoping to resurrect the fun of WC I&II; and Starcraft that I played in college... No such luck. I would be better off with Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listed for the wrong platform","review":"Although this game is listed to work as a Mac game it does not. It is not a Mac game.

The OS system could not even recognise the format of the disks. It just ejected them after 3 minutes of spinning.

The only issue is that although my love for the game has stayed true, its has not kept up with computers.[blizzard] doesnt care about its customers that they wont make money off of. They must figure not many people that don't already play warcraft won't be buying it all of a sudden, so they won't update the installer to work with a LION on mac.

It's a great game and I have a lot of fun with the single player campaign.There is really on one issue I have with the game. Macs running the newest versions of Mac OS can not install this game. At this moment (Feb 23, 2012) Blizzard does not have a patch for this issue. If you are a Mac user, check Blizzard's compatibility information on their website.

The same could be said for Ultima Collecton which stated it was for windows 95 RIGHT ON THE BOX and doesn't run on that os. Please put the correct OS for this game.Deception #2: This game only contains what BG Saga contained, Baldur's Gate. It is not an \\"Ultimate\\" Collection, so don't expect BG II or ToB. It is just another name for the same thing(and for bux) bottom line, if you have BG, stick with it and play it on your old windows 98 system that your so fortunate to own, don't mess with this!

I prefer the printed manuals as well, but for the game plus expansion and bonus disk I paid only $13.77, including shipping that took 3 days.

The mage battles are the best, with the most amazing powerful spells rocking the scene and terrific sense of gritty realism. The game goes on and on; I played it obsessively for months, and it just gets better and better as your party get more and more powerful, and in turn take on more powerful and sinister opponents! This game is astounding value, when you consider how much enjoyment you get out of it - and especially now that the price is so low! I want Black Isle (the creators) to be successful so they'll write more games like this (maybe even another sequel??), so please support them!

First, the plastic carrying bottle and squeeze delivery system makes it great for carrying in my purse or pocket and using it at restaurants. I bought one brand that I had to shake to get one drop to come out. That got old quickly. Second, it doesn't have a funny after taste like some of the other brands I tried. Third, it's clear and thin liquid, not dark and syrupy which is more appealing and less messy to use. Fourth, every powder that I tried clumped in my beverages and liquids, where this just blends in without any effort. I also use it for sweetening dessert recipes, both baked and unbaked. Previously I purchased it off the shelf at GNC but they stopped carrying it, so now I order it online, buying 4 at a time to stay stocked up. By far the best Stevia I've ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Stevia","review":"All other stevia brands that I have tried have a strange taste. This one is just sweet.

The final 10 voices meld together nicely on Bacharach's new arrangement of his classic song...especially the end part with lots of lovely, overlapping harmony. The second version, with only Clay, Ruben and Rickey seems like a hastily thrown-together b-side. All three have wonderful voices, but they all sound disjointed and out of place in this arrangement. And.....if any American Idol higher ups are reading this, why isn't Ruben's first single \\"Imagine\\" and Clay's first single \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water?\\" With a television show that stressed the importance of song selection, I am surprised with both songs selected as first singles for Clay and Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies are of Poor quality","review":"I would not buy this product or any other DVD made by Timeless Media Group.

So, what does he bring to the party?I recommend you buy one of the others rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have an issue","review":"My two biggest problems with this movie are the scary bad-guy character and the language.I got this for my 2 year old. He's sensitive and if he sees a cartoon or a person on TV fall down, he gets all upset. So imagine him watching this and seeing the big, scary, bloody-eyed (that's what it looks like) bad guy constantly trying to kill and eat the \\"kid\\" dinosaurs! It's just too much for him.My other issue is the language. It makes me nuts, and I fear it will set my son back. Instead of rain they say \\"sky water\\" and instead of \\"leaf\\" they say \\"tree star\\", and on and on. If you know the words \\"tree\\" and \\"star\\" then you would certainly know \\"leaf\\". Same for the others. I want my son's vocabulary to grow, not regress. He repeats new things he hears and they become part of his little lexicon.I try not to let my son watch this one. Maybe when he's older...but that language issue will still make me nuts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiseguys just that-Wise!","review":"Wow!

I love the dinner plates...I'm a male and don't usually like floral patterns, but I was looking for something that matched green kitchen decor. The salad plates are also unique, with the scalloped edges and blue dots. There also seems to be plenty of of accessories in this pattern, although I have not purchase any yet. The only bad thing about these dishes are the extremely small bowls. They are too small for soup or cereal for a normal person. I use them for salsa, dips, etc. I think they'd also be good for cream or rich soups served in small portions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Comic. Terrible DVD.","review":"Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD. A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating. And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads. Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs. This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour. It's a beer coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"deja vu?","review":"i m a huge fan of richard pryor, and i m very disapointed by this dvd, i was waiting for unreleased stand up, and all i had was a \\"not too bad documentary\\" hbo level, with extract of already realeased show...live on the sunset, new orleans stand up and the late 70's one with the monkey's joke... i m very very very very dispointed, and pissed off, not for the money but for the joy i made myself about wieving something new about pryor, no just exploitation of the goldmine...hope more dvd will be released with old treasure that i don t know about...plus on the dvd it is nowhere written that its a documentary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a look for fans, little else here","review":"As you have gethered by now, this is not a complete Richard Pryor stand-up show. I Ain't Dead Yet, originally aired on Comedy Central, is a tribute/biography/documentary of the legendary comedian, showcasing clips of his various acts shuffled in with interviews and opinions from Steve Harvey, Jamie Foxx, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Dave Chappelle, Denis Leary, Whoppi Goldberg, and Robin Williams among others. The program itself, which is less than 45 minutes long and is here in all in uncensored glory, is worth a look for fans of Pryor who didn't see it when it originally aired, but the DVD features are scant, and considering the price of the DVD, this is a rip-off. All in all, worth a look for fans of Pryor, but for all others, this is worth avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off.","review":"My husband and I just finished watching this and to say we were disappointed would be an understatement. We were under the impression that we would be watching Richard Pryor doing his amazing standup and what we got were small clips of him interspersed with comedians putting their two bits in, copying him, and all this other garbage. I don't even understand how this was supposed to be entertaining in any way - it was quite simply totally annoying and pointless. We fast forwarded through most of it that didn't involve Richard. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nosferatu17 fom Soweto","review":"Let's be honest here, this IS a rip-off. After all the cut and paste done by the editors, one would expect a proper show to begin, preferably with some unseen material, then it ends briefly in the middle of a huh! moment. The marketing and packaging was good cos those who bought it, like me, thought it was another obscure, raw and previously unrealesed material by Mr RP the genius. It does this great man a HUGE disservice, may he rest in peace. For someone who got a standing ovation as he entered heaven, this dvd does not do him good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"I was expecting a glimpse of some of richard's funniest acts. the DVD does not do that. It merely interviews people who knew him and give you a glimpse about his career with some takes from some of his stand up shows.I was under the imppression that I am purchasing a DVD that shows some of his funny shows, stand ups and maybe a DVD of something new about richard. (A never before seen show or something like that)Never the less, He never fails to be the funniest comedian that ever lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Never Had Bought This DVD!","review":"Waste of money! If this DVD would have cost one dollar it would have been too much money. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying it, I would have saved myself from getting the worst Richard Pryor DVD ever made! I don't care to type anymore about it because once I really get started I won't shut up and this DVD is not worth my time.

But something very strange happened as the 1980's began, and gold turned to dirt with a few exceptions. I just don't get it! How can a band that gave us so many unforgettable tunes end up in this mess? \\"No jive\\" includes only one good song and that's \\"Every time it rains\\". Although that one is very good, the rest of the songs are just bad and clearly below average. If you want a dose of the great Nazareth you should invest in the albums between the years 1973-1977, which are:Razamanaz (1973)Rampant (1974)Loud \`n' proud (1974)Hair of the dog (1975)Play \`n' the game (1976)Close enough for rock \`n' roll (1976)Expect no mercy (1977)Start with the masterpiece \\"Expect no mercy\\" because that is Nazareth's proudest moment.

This record is politically and socially charged with less emphasis on the musical qualities that first attracted me to the Maniacs. The only reason why I might pop this disc into the player is to hear \\"The Lion's Share\\", a song about social inequities brought upon the political tyrants of this world.Consider \\"In My Tribe\\" and \\"Our Time in Eden\\" before picking this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes your cards look cheesy","review":"My unhappiness with this product has more to do with the incomplete description.

The book was almost identical to the show, usually when programs are made into books there is always an added story line or an extra twist that did not happen on TV. This was exactly the same and the only few sentances the auther did add in were stupidly thought of and were inconsistent with the show.

(At times Jeter's fiercely ironic style made me wonder if I was in fact reading a \\"lost\\" Phil Dick novel!) Jeter's perverse, dark vision of the L.A.of the future envelops your senses with a mixture of revulsion and fascination as the story unfolds. Other reviewers here have already summarized the plot and setting, so let me just add that the book is disturbing and brilliant, and if you can stomach the sexual perversions and gore, you will come away astonished that somehow \\"Dr. Adder\\" (written pre-1972, anticipating cyberpunk by at least 12 years) has escaped your attention until now. The afterword by Dick is noteworthy too. One of the characters in the novel is based on Dick, although Phil mis-identifies that character in his afterword, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"look no further","review":"I bought this based on reviews I've read regarding Jonas Hellborg's playing.

After the Alto Wore Tweed I wasn't going to read more in the series because they were rather silly with one story written by the police chief/ detective story writer/ choir dierctor popping up from time to time in the other mystery story involving the same person, Hayden.This story was more interesting and involved clever thinking to solve the murder. Again some strange characters are in it.I am now a fan and am reading the third in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny read for high church nerd","review":"The combination of classical music, noir detective references, and liturgical church details mixed with absurdist humor provides a great read when you need something funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH NO ANOTHER COMIC GEM","review":"Be prepared to laugh out loud again.

I slammed through the first one and had to force myself to not read the 2nd one immediately. When I finally did allow myself the pleasure, I had just as much fun with #2 as I did with #1.The Liturgical Mysteries are just downright silly in the best kind of way. This story proves once again that things aren't always what they seem. The entire premise of the story had me giggling the entire time I read.I will admit to being a little distracted by the number of errors, but this in no way made me sorry I bought the book, or the next two in the series. I might have said this before, but these books are a must read for anyone who loves to laugh and even be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"sour note","review":"If I want to read a mystery then there should be significant amount of writing about the mystery in the book.

I didn't mind the main character so much but felt everyone else was bland beyond belief (yes, even the dwarf). Within the story, we're subjected to excerpts from Hayden's attempt to write a mystery. I know it's supposed to be awful, everyone tells him so, but it was so awful I started to resent having to waste my time and money slogging through it, so I finally stopped. I finally finished the book, but only by starting to skip through about half way. I know this wasn't supposed to be a serious mystery.

My biggest regret is finishing the entire book when I got so bogged down less than 1/2 way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncharted should have remained Unpublished","review":"I rarely say anything but the best about books I read but I feel that a warning to the wise is in order. What a terrible story. It is a play on a parable that Jesus told but there is nothing about this book that is uplifting, encouraging or hopeful. Hunt's presentation about how to avoid hell is not even good theology. It's Jesus or nothing and the author does not make that clear. What a waste of good money for so depressing a story. If you read it, don't say you haven't been warned (just like the characters in Uncharted)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an amusing adventure novel -- starts out sad and never gets better","review":"The cover and description on the back cover seem to imply that this novel will be an amusing and thrilling novel of college friends reuniting and getting stranded on a tropical island. \\"...A blend of the movies Castaway and The Big Chill... thrown together with the biblical story of ...C.S. Lewis' The Great Divorce.\\" I wonder if anyone at Publisher's Weekly even read this book.My biggest problem with the novel was that the plot starts out with the sad death of a gifted philanthopist doctor and turns a humanitarian mission by five surviving college friends into a never-ending downward spiral of despair. There is no escape from this island, and no redemption for these friends. This is NOT a book to read for enjoyment.The characters are mildly interesting, if somewhat cliched. Of course there is a womanizing serial killer. And the Southern Belle who vainly frets her loss of youth and beauty. You get the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Skin Deep","review":"This page turner is full of mirrors in the most unexpected places.I couldn't put it down. Angela Hunt deserves her best-selling status. She is a masterful storyteller and this book is one that shows her skill from start to finish.The twists, turns and excellent characterization are enough to recommend this book to anyone who loves a compelling read. However, the underlying spiritual themes are powerfully written, convicting and unsettling. Another reason to read it. After all, eternal destination is not worth leaving to chance.This is the first of Angela Hunt's adult novels that I've read. I will be reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have read other books by Angela and enjoyed them. After reading this one I have not been able to bring myself to read any more of hers. I don't know if I will in the future or not. Are there actually church bodies that believe this? It is COMPLETELY unscriptural. Angela is like an unhatched egg trying to imagine what it is like to soar like an eagle. The finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite and the temporal person cannot imagine the eternal. The two realms are as different as a caterpiller and a butterfly. When we die, that is it, we do not go into some holding pen or waiting room. When we leave time we enter eternity. The judgement for us occurs at the time of our death. It's done and over. And we do not get a second chance. I absolutely would never waste my time or money on this book.I gave it one star because they won't let me give a zero or a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Hunt","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer - it's difficult to review this one without spoiling anything, so I won't go into the one or two minor plot problems I had with it. I read it in one sitting, but thought about it for days afterwards. Suffice it to say that no matter what you believe about God or faith, this book will probably provide some serious food for thought. Everyone who is being honest will recognize themselves in various characters. Definitely worth reading, then passing on to someone else to read so you can discuss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant rip-off of TV Series \\"Lost\\"","review":"This book is a blatant rip-off of the TV series \\"Lost,\\" but lacks the creativity, character interest or complexity of the TV series. It is poorly written, repetitive (e.g., every character has the same exclamation of disgust, surprise, anguish, etc., i.e., \\"good grief\\")and the thin plot could be contained in far fewer than the 300 pages. Do not read this book if you are interested in a truly good mystery or intriguing and/or sympathetic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian lit, marketed VERY deceptively","review":"The blurb promises it's a cross between Castaway and The Big Chill; the blurb talks about five friends marooned on an island; everything about this book's marketing has been planned to get you to read it without realizing it's Christian lit. In the interview in the back, tho', Angela Hunt explains she wrote it \\"because Hades is a terrible place. I don't want anyone to go there\\" and explains the entire book through references to Scripture. I don't mind Christians writing and reading Christian lit, but I resent them marketing their books in a way that is intended to deceive non-religious (or non-Christian readers). This book is an evangelical tract; if that's not what you're looking for, it's not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"The more I listen to this CD, the more I love it.

Secondly, the production quality is utterly amazing. Bob Rock and the Crue really knew what they were doing with this album. Tommy and Nikki never worked so well together, and if anyone ever had any doubts about Mick's guitar playing, all they would have to do is listen to this album.

It showed me than you don't need to be drugged-up and alcoholic to be cool.Motley Crue are cool and will forever be cool. Sober or not! That's the bottom line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motley Crue's most popular album -","review":"In addition to the songs on the original album, the Dr. Feelgood remastered version has demos for Dr. Feelgood, Without You, Kickstart My Heart and an unrealesed song called Get it For Free. The Dr. Feelgood demo is good because it has totally different words (which are unintelligible for the most part) and Vince's vocals are real raw. The Without You demo is a throwaway..nothing interesting. However, the Kickstart My Heart demo is great and funny. It has the big \\"ooooh yeah\\" stuff in it that sounds like doo-whop. Get It For Free is not bad...it could have easily been on the album instead of Sticky Sweet or Rattlesnake Shake. I know that Dr. Feelgood was their biggest album, but it also has the most filler material in my opinion. I just wish they would have made a video back in 1989 for my favorite song on the album - She Goes Down. The possibilities for a great video of that song would have been endless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motley Crue - 'Dr.Feelgood' (Hip-O)","review":"Nice job on this CD reissue,that is IF you originally liked this album when it first came out.I never did,I mean 'Dr.Feelgood' was just TOO commercial for me.Talk about a sell-out.Three tracks here I could never take,which were \\"Don't Go Away Mad\\",\\"Same 'Ol Situation\\" and the title cut \\"Dr.Feelgood\\".However,all is not lost,there are six(6)bonus tracks tagged on,that I think I actually like.Those being demo takes of \\"Dr.Feelgood\\",\\"Without You\\" and \\"Kickstart My Heart\\".Maybe there's hope yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album; crappy re-release","review":"Re-released to coincide with their upcming Cruefest 2 Tour, where it will be played in its entirety, this version of Dr. Feelgood shows that some bands are too high in their laurels to pay attention to their released product.When Motley was struggling in the mid 90s to stay relevant, they released the excellent Crucial Crue series, which included demos, instrumentals and unreleased versions. Dr. Feelgood's Crucial Crue is excellent and complete. Including FOUR demos and the unavailable Get It For Free, it encompassed the process that led to the success of Dr. Feelgood.However, this new version, includes only the five singles in live versions previously found in 1998's Motley Crue Live Entertainment or Death, which, in itself, is a very bad live album.So, do yourself a favor and hunt for the Crucial Crue version, if you don't have it, and stay away from this re-re-release that adds nothing of value to this magnificent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dr is in good form","review":"The first album to be taken seriously by the critics, as I recall, and it still sounds great 20+ years on.Only downside are the live tracks - Vince Neil, bless him, is not the world's greatest singer, and if these tracks are anything to go by his memory for lyrics is heading south as well.Still, a small issue when you consider the quality of such tracks as Dr Feelgood itself, Kickstart My Heart etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocks","review":"i had this cd for 6 years and i still jam it on my way to school and at home dr. feelgood is one of motley crues best cds ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUMS OF THE 80's","review":"Motley Crue never was, and have never been a consistent band. Their older albums were so-so (GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS is the exception), and their newer albums are nothing special. In general, most of Motley Crue's worthwhile material can be found on their greatest hits album. So what happened here? I have no idea, but whether by sheer musicianship, or complete luck, Motley Crue made a true classic here that eclipses all of their other work, and is, in my opinion, THE hair metal album to beat. Every song on this album is great, with the best being \\"Dr Feelgood\\", \\"Same Ol Situation\\", \\"She Goes Down\\", \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", and one of the 80's best power ballads (beaten by Motley Crue's own \\"Home Sweet Home\\") \\"Without You\\". Therefore, what I'm saying is that ANY fan of hair metal needs to own this album, as it is the prime example of why that era rocked. The only thing that's sad about this album is Motley Crue never came close to matching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Motley's Finest","review":"One of the best by the Cr��e, Dr. Feelgood offers up a heapin' helpin' of blues infused, hard rockin' music. \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is a classic track, and is complemented by other killer stuff such as \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" and \\"Sticky Sweet,\\" as well as four (!) other well known Cr��e tracks in \\"Kickstart My Heart,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Same Ol' Situation,\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad.\\"This is, in many ways, the Cr��e's pinnacle.

After all, I could not waste the bag of whole coffee beans. It is a given that men do not return items. Of course I am not affluent, erudite or a gourmet, so I could not spend much money on a coffee grinder. My local store prices were not in my comfort zone. However, my Amazon search revealed the Hamilton Beach 80365 Custom Grind Hands-free Coffee Grinder. Great price and it works wonderfully. I can never go back to off the shelf pre-ground coffee.

I loved it, 5 stars. It ground beautifully and I loved that it was removable and easy to clean. I started using it for raw ginger , nuts and spices. It was great! Everything came out smooth and consistent. So I went on line and was happy that they still made it. Mine, now 10 years old, the plastic is cracking. I ordered 2 and used it with my raw ginger and I thought it was me, there were chunks. I tried again and I had to violently shake it and still chunks. I tried in the old one and no problem. The next day I did walnuts and again chunks just spinning around in it. So I compared the two. They changed the shape of the blades, that's why the new one sucks. I mean SUCKS. I am so disappointed. I am going to try to put the old blade on the new grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"This item was exactly what I wanted: a hands-free coffee grinder, one that I could preset to a grind time, press the button, and then leave it there to buzz the beans while I got the coffee maker ready.

I was pretty happy with the design and the variable pre-set grinding times. Plus, it was easy to remove the cup and empty the grounds--a feature that I found more appealing than the setup on my ancient Krups grinder. However, yesterday, it just stopped working. I tried cleaning it carefully and making sure the top fit tightly. But, no luck. Luckily, my good ol' Krups was waiting patiently in the wings and came to the rescue.The grinder was relatively inexpensive so I don't think it's worth the time and effort to put up a fuss and get it replaced. I'll just stick with the Krups. It works fine after 15+ years. I just thought it was time for a change. Lesson learned.

I thought it was a fluke, so I took it back to the store and got another one. This one worked, and I liked the little features like the brush & the winding cord.

So I tried many different combinations & locations in my kitchen, and it would still just not work. Eventually it would start again, but now, after only about a year of use, it's officially dead.

Flaxseed, it did a fine job with. Nutmeg, however, killed this unit. Granted, nutmeg isn't really an appropriate thing to put into a coffee grinder. I know that now. However, after running multiple cycles consecutively (during which the blade did a fine job obliterating the nutmeg), it began to smell like burning. Then black smoke began wafting out of the unit. Rather than risk a full-blown electrical fire, I retired the unit. I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a $20 appliance, but I would hope for a \\"don't obliterate your insides\\" safety cutoff.Was also hard to clean flaxseeds.

The motor was only mounted with double stick tape and the plastic snaps that attach the silver housing to the black grinding bowl. The tape came loose from the motor and then the motor and grinding bowl eventually worked their way out of the housing. Otherwise it worked well, but a product such as this should last a lot longer than two years, especially since I was only using it on the weekends.

Does have automatic shut off.......if you give it a chance. Also, for those who complain about the \\"short cord\\"...........try reading the instructions. The bottom black part PULLS DOWN and the extra length of cord is tucked away in there. It's wrapped to make for a clean counter or uncluttered storage. I'm amazed at the amount of people who dont bother to read INSTRUCTIONS that come with the products they buy, then complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently you get what you pay for","review":"I purchased this grinder two years back since the bowl was supposedly top-rack dishwasher safe. About 5 months after I bought it, the plastic portion of the bowl cracked. This didn't stop my use of the grinder since it didn't leak grounds, it was just annoying.But, over the past month, the lid - also plastic - has worn down and won't lock into place. This causes you to have to have a tight grip on the unit so that it will work. I wish I'd searched for a hgher-quality one from the get-go. Not at all satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"Attractive, useful, easy to maintain, good directions for use and care, good pricing. I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it works","review":"I've owned three of these. They're cheap so I just replaced it with a new one. It works well when it works. I find I have to set the grind up to espresso to get it fine enough for drip coffee. If I want espresso grind, I just have to run it through twice. No biggie. BUT, this is the third one of mine that has gone out. The first two had a little plastic piece on them that chipped and then it would no longer work. This last one just quit working this morning and I have no idea why. I've had it less than a year, maybe 6 months. All of the ones that I have owned have lasted less than a year. Right now I am searching for a new grinder for a little more money that will last longer. I will update with what I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Grinder","review":"I had this grinder for 4 months. I make my coffe via Fench Press.......I work alot of hours during the week, so manly used this on weekends. Within 4 months its motor burned out and totally stopped working. Very disappointed. Will never buy a hamilton beach product again......you would be better off buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a Lemon","review":"The grinder worked great for 46 days, after that the unit stopped working. It completely went dead. Since the order was over 30 days, Amazon would only give a partial refund. It's a $20 dollar item. I'm not going to jump through the hoops for that. When it did work it was great. I'll probably order another one later after I cool down (maybe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands Free & More BUT IT BROKE, AS WARNED","review":"It's sleek looking and it does its job well, especially for the price. The grinder we had before this one wasn't hands free, so this was a nice step for us. It can grind down to the quality of cinnamon powder, so it can grind your coffee finely for espresso or cinnamon sticks into cinnamon. It's a very effective, hands-free grinder and we've been quite pleased with it.REVISION (EDIT WITH WARNING): Less than two months after receiving it and, most importantly, shortly after the return window closed, like other reviewers warned, this grinder broke. Specifically, the motor stopped. Push the start/on button and nothing happens. It started making loud, whining noises before it stopped working. It's a piece of junk. If it starts making noises, return it ASAP. Better yet, don't buy it at all. Shame, because it's a pretty unit and works well--when it runs, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This cute coffee grinder is ideal for me.

I put it on the espresso setting and it worked PERFECTLY! I love how you can roll up the cord and store it in the bottom (it makes for easy storage). A great product for a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AFTER SEVERAL MONTH, IT DOESN'T WORK!","review":"This coffee grinder is a waste of money. At first it works fine, but after couple months later, I need to push down very hard and even hit the top to make it work. Now it totally die just 6 months after I bought it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I got one KRUPS coffee grinder which is much cheaper than the price of HAMILTON BEACH ONE at target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I bought one and had to return it, I couldn't turn it on after about 10 uses. However, I really liked the design, I figured I just got a defective one so I bought another. About two months in the exact same problem, I pressed the button and it won't go on. What a piece of junk, too bad I like the removable cup. Do not buy, this is the lowest rating I ever gave to a product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven grind / minimum cups to grind is 4","review":"This is my first grinder since I became a coffee drinker. I bought it because it met 5 of my criterias:1) Affordable price;2) Hidden cord3) Grind size is selectable4) Removable grind chamber5) Small footprint.One criteria it doesn't meet, however, which is also the MOST important criteria, is that the grind size is uneven.That is a HUGE problem because for someone whose needs a coarse grind for french press, I always get powdery grind mixed with coarse grind AND whole ungrind coffee bean. The result is a lot of sediment in my coffee after brewing.The other problem is it grind 4 cups minimum. I only need to grind about 1-2 cups of coffee at a time.Grind size can be more consistent if the beans are grind longer. In short, this grinder is only good if you need a fine grind. I think this is a consistent problem for all blade grinders.I am getting a burr grinder to replace this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of junk!!!","review":"Another piece of junk!!! I've only had this thing for 3 months and it will not turn on anymore. For what little I used it, you would think that I would get at least a years worth of use out of it.

Just load beans, set grind and push the on button. It's done when it turns itself off. That was then, today grinder stopped working. And it was made in China, of course. Warning to buyers, you may get a dud too. Received replacement grinder and it lasted a whole ONE HOUR. They are making too much junk in China. I want a refund. Unbelievable, two duds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I really liked this product, but it only lasted about two months. I ordered it April 10, and it is June 15 and it stopped working this morning. There is nothing wrong with the lid; it locks appropriately. It just stopped grinding in the middle of a grind, and will not start back up. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died an early death... too young!","review":"I used this coffee grinder for no more than two weeks and it conked out on me mid grind and just died.

The operation was perfect while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I bought one of these for my dad a couple years ago. He has both a drip coffee maker and a french press and he could never get an even grind with his old grinder. He loves that grinder gives him an even grind at whatever size he chooses day after day, so far without any issues. I am now ordering one for myself because my current grinder is too difficult to clean when I want to change the grind setting and am eager to try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"I was given this as a gift and the very first time I used it, it started smoking from the base. I had to toss it out the window into the snow to prevent my kitchen from catching fire. What a waste of good coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working Within 2 months","review":"It worked fine the first month I had it.But then the locking mechanism started acting faulty. I would have to twist the lid on and off and on and off because no matter what, the thing would somehow not latch properly. Usually after working with it for a few minutes I could get it to latch properly and then away it would grind.But it just kept getting worse and worse until no matter how hard I tried, or how careful I was to turn the lid all the way, and no matter how certain I was that the lid had latched properly, it wouldn't work.So now it's in the trash where it belongs.What a waste of money. Gosh, I guess it's unreasonable for me to expect that it would last a year... maybe even two years. Or *gasp* maybe even 10+ years which is how long electronics would last back in the days they were made well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless junk","review":"I bought this to use for coffee and continued to use my old Krups grinder for spices. The Krups grinder has finally failed, after 30 years; this piece of trash died after @ 8 months. The top will no longer stay tightly closed, so it doesn't grind at all, after a couple of months where the grind was very inconsistent and a lot of partial beans were ending up in the mix. I would strongly advise against wasting money on this appliance. I'm going back for another Krups."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for what it was intended","review":"For complaints about the grind consistency... This is a blade grinder and blade grinders will NEVER create an extremely consistent grind throughout. If you want a consistent grind, spend the money and get a burr grinder. But after reviewing all of the burr grinders out there, you may end up with similar problems. The burr grinder I just ordered was $150... so for $125 do you want your grind that consistent? I do, but you may not.After a few uses you will learn the grind & cup setting for making your coffee. The two different settings are wonderful.This model can be extremely clean and looks good enough to leave out on your counter.I have had this for almost 2 years, making a pot of coffee 5+ times a week with no problems.Would definetly buy again if I wanted a BLADE grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Broke Too","review":"Used it for flax only; lasted about a month. Dead. No warning, no strange sounds. It worked one morning and the next it didn't.It is truly galling to buy, and then have to chuck into a landfill, an item like this.Going back to Braun. Or maybe a non-electric mill or grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine until it breaks","review":"I liked this grinder very much when we bought it. The hands-free feature was great, but it stopped working a few months after we bought it. Now, after about a year of service, it has stopped working completely. My old Braun had worked for about 10 years. I won't buy this grinder again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died After a Few Months of Use","review":"This grinder was great... until it died. I appreciated the handy cord storage, the nearly hands-free operation, the removable grinding chamber, and the hidden brush for easy cleaning. For those features, I'll bump it up from one star.However, it pooped out on us after about three months of approximately weekly use for grinding spices. It was working fine until, one day, it simply wouldn't turn on. No amount of cord-jiggling, lid adjusting, or creative button-pressing would revive it. After 10-20 uses? Inexcusable.I'm going to take this back to the store of purchase for a return or exchange. If I had it to do over again, I would save my money and spend a little extra for a more durable machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Grinder","review":"I really like ALL the features of this coffee grinder. Having the Grinder lid & Grinding Chamber removable for dispensing ground coffee into coffee filter and for cleaning is a great feature. I did have a problem with the grinding chamber retaining water (must have been a bad seal) I have had to return it for an exchange. Hope I don't have the same problem, if so that would be the one bad thing about the unit. Because there is NO way to get the water out! I like having the cord wind up in the base of unit along with the ability to change the settings of grinding and for how many cups of coffee your making. Also the backside of unit holds a nice little brush to assure you get all your grounds out of the grinding lid. It really is the nicest grinder I've had. Just that one little problem with the water being trapped, otherwise recommend this over any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The bottom came off this thing before I used it the first time.

I bought both because they were the only ones I could find that actually let you select the grind. I drink espresso, and this is the only grinder (countertop type) I have found to do this and do it well. The only reason I had to replace it was the first model I had, the plastic part on the lid that locks it in place wore out. The motor was still fine. I actually replaced that lid once from the company. This newer model is still plastic but the connection/lock is bigger and bolder and will probably last a little longer. This new one is so easy to wash as well, the whole grinder separates easily from the motor. I would happily pay a higher price for the same grinder made with metal instead of plastic. Too bad everything is so \\"disposable\\" in this day and age.

Used it once or twice to grind coffee beans, and when my little one had just begun weaning, would put some toasted quinoa in it to make a single-serve, quick-cooking powder for porridge. He loved it. But what I love it most for is spice grinding. Breaks down even the freshest, sturdiest cinnammon sticks, and beats to a powder cumin. Now, I've learned that you must let your cumin and other spices cool after roasting (which is imperative if you're going to put them in a masala, or any mix, including Chine five-spice,taco and chili seasoning, and so on. Brings out the flavor like nothing else.) If you don't your cover's going to get cloudy and eventually start showing cracks. That doesn't bother me as long as it keeps pulverizing, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopper, not a Grinder","review":"This is a coffee chopper (blade); not a grinder (burr). I can chop coffee in my blender. Returned item without testing it. Might be a great product for quick chopping of coffee, but not for grinding $40 a pound beans. I Ordered a BURR Grinder to replace it. Item arrived in pieces, possible though UPS mishandling in the bonus day they spent delivering the item. It did not appear to be packaged to Amazon's high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent grind = terrible grinder","review":"The problem with this grinder is that it leaves some beans barely ground and others too finely ground. I like how it closes and that you can fit a lot of beans into it, but the fact that the grind is so inconsistent makes it an undesirable product.

They sent back a new one (weeks later) and I was amazed to discover that it, also, leaked at the rivets when water was brought to a boil in it. I called the company again. The man I spoke to had me return the pot to him (this time they paid for it) directly so that he would be sure the issue was resolved. Yet another new pan was mailed to us weeks later. IT, TOO, LEAKED FROM THE RIVETS! Clearly, Scanpan has a serious design issue in this particular pot. I would warn anyone away from ordering one or one like it.

I love this game it is one of my all time favorites. Thanks Amazon for having it and at such a great price, who could go wrong. I highly recommend it as an easy to medium playing game.

Basically, every time one plays through the game, it will be pretty much the same. There's hardly any development or customization of the main character.

I disliked my character's movement. I disliked the environment and what you have to do to move ahead.I'm not an expert gamer, but this was too much work for so little fun.

But Fleur persisted in acting so stubbornly stupid, acting against her own best interests, that at one point I began to wonder if she really was crazy, as her step-father portrayed her to be. I needed a better explanation for her stupidity than that provided in the story. Anyway, despite Fleur's idiocy, it was a good read, and overall, better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Fleur","review":"I had to put the book down when I learned the reason behind her fear of intimacy. Because she seen a birth when she was young and two friends died during child birth. Are you kidding me?? That is not a valid reason and makes her seem overly dramatic and childish. She should be embarassed by her ignorance. Then the way she trusts Siddel and blatantly ignores her husbands warning. And furthermore she does nothing to halt the rumors. In fact, she feeds oil to the fire by continuing her walks alone and having a jealous fit at her re-entry into society. She had no right to react that way when she made the marriage white because of her childish fear. Uggghhhhhhhhhh!!! i hate her so much I can't even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Sinner Madeline Hunter","review":"The other books in this series were OK. I found this book too slow paced to stay interested for long. It was very easy to put the book aside in favor of other books. I think the reason Fleur Monley desired the 'white marriage' was a weak excuse considering the extent of her fear. When her reason was revealed I thought,\\"That's all?\\" As for Dante, I didn't care for him much. He seemed too juvenile to me. He was very irresponsible. While this book isn't awful, the others in the series are better. The only real reason I can see to read this book is that the reader would want to finish up the entire series, not leaving a book unread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side-splittingly awful","review":"I read the first chapter online and was dying with laughter, so I promptly ordered the book.

In fact, I haven't laughed this hard since some friends of mine and I put on sumo fat suits and knocked each other down in the park. And Atlanta nights is just as highbrow and meaningful an experience.I plan to use parts of this book as a teaching tool.

The book contains notes by Mr. Harmon, wherein he repeats for us what his educators repeated to him about each poet and poem; there's a dedication to Mr. Harmon's daughter, who matters tremendously; and there's even a special thanks to \\"all the poets, critics, and editors whose judgment has propelled these works into the position of the \`Top 500 Poems!'\\" This is a book for bedside tables; all that's missing is some sort of wake-up call."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection spanning 500 years","review":"This compilation is wonderful.

What I can say is that you can get familiar with the legal jargon and procedures that will inevitable happen should you chose or need to file. What I found most useful is that it puts your mind at ease in terms of protecting your hard earned property and some assets. In other words, don't let creditors or there representatives scare you to death without learning all the facts yourself. Bottom line you can learn a lot from this book and use to know what your attorney will be doing and talking about so your not going in there blindly. It's for those control freaks like myself that like to know as much as possible even when referring to an expert.

It is quite thorough and if a layperson were to read the book several times and follow the directions carefully, one should be able to handle one's own Chapt. 13 bankruptcy.Anyone considering bankruptcy should be aware of the consequences of such action and if he does not feel completely comfortable doing it on his own, he should consult a qualified bankruptcy attorney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Key Point","review":"This book totally missed a key point.

In the back of the book are many, many forms that you may need to fill out. Do not let this discourage you. Regardless of whether you hire a lawyer or not you will need to dredge out the information on the forms.Even if you decide to hire a lawyer, which would probably not be necessary if you did whatever this book says to do, your fees should be negotiated lower than usual because of the thorough preparation you are able to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertisement Blocks View","review":"The name of Belkin's internet site is written in black on the bottom of each overlay.

The singsong-y text is annoying to me and confusing for my son, adding words that don't quite belong in order to rhyme. The illustrations are cute but unsatisfying and confusing-- even an 18 month old knows that birds don't drive fire trucks, and there's no context like there is in Richard Scarry's books to make that whole animal-community-worker thing make sense. Sorry to be so negative, but honestly, these books just completely grate on both of us. Try Scarry's Things That Go for whimsy, Lois Lenski's \\"Little\\" vehicle series for straightforward, calming and realistic text with childlike but beautiful illustrations, or the \\"There Goes A...\\" video series for real-life view of vehicles at work.

I have slightly wavy, waist length hair that I often blow dry and flat iron. This stuff has kept the ends looking healthy and has prevented my hair from drying out or ever smelling burnt when using heating tools. It's lightweight and not sticky at all. The only reason that i give it four stars is that the spray top doesn't always spray even and seems to get stuck a bit at first. A few pre sprays into the sink are all that is needed but still slightly annoying. It may only be this one bottle though so I definitely would not let that deter you from purchasing.

Period.","review":"I saw so many sucky reviews I was inspired because their not true! I've been using this product for years. The thing that I love about it is that it's affordable and I think my hair is better protected at home then in the salon. There have been many times that people ask me if I went to the salon to get my hair done and the answer is - No darling I did it at home. This spray helps preserve the length of my hair. I can go longer between cuts & trims. As you can see from my main profile picture I try my best to protect my hair from heat styling and for the most part it does look great when I style it myself - and I'm not even a hair stylist connoisseur. It may leave a film on some of your brushes, but nothing serious if your hair is greasy after this you may be using too much. Clarifying shampoo (like from Neutrogena) should help with product build up & hair brushes should be changed every so few months anyways. Otherwise - Definite recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!","review":"I read reviews on this heat protective spray.

Easy to spray hard to reach areas. If you overspray it gets a little stiff( I found this to be a bonus while straightening my sections stayed sectioned).

Last night, it happened again--clock time was 1 hr and 53 minutes ahead of real time when I woke up (and no, the alarm hadn't gone off almost 2 hrs early).For what it's worth, I have both LaCrosse and Oregon Scientific satellite-set clocks in the house, and neither were affected by whatever is causing this Sony's time warp.

Also, if the power goes out and comes back on, the clock may or may not reset itself and acquire the current time. And there is no battery back-up option. This has made me late for work a few times. On very important days, I need to set a second alarm \\"just in case\\". One last annoying feature is the backlight.

There's a little insert with the commonly used prayers (like the Glory Be) but nowhere does it tell you where you're supposed to say them! Then, if you throw in saints' memorials it is completely confusing, flipping back and forth between the regular daily prayers, saint's particular prayers, and prayers for martyrs/virgins/etc. I don't see how anyone could use this book without something else to help them.I think it could be organized a lot more clearly, and it wouldn't be that hard to put a little note as to where the Glory Be and sign of the cross should be...Unfortunately this seems to be the only option if you want to say the Office (other than online versions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the real deal.","review":"Get the Liber Usualis from either 1952 or 1958.

It is a little confusing at first but with the help of the INCLUDED St. Joseph's guide I'm finding my way around this lovely book. Do not bother buying a separate St. Joseph's guide because one is included in the box. Don't be discouraged by the confusing layout at first. It will make sense very soon whether you teach yourself or have someone teach you.\\"Never pass up an opportunity to pray\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and reasonably priced","review":"Over the past few years I have used the complete 4 volume LOTH for daily prayer. I sold it and bought Christian Prayer. Although I miss the extras eg: poem section of the LOTH I find Christian Prayer far easier to use, esp early in the morning. I am a bit unconventional in my usage, ie: I sometimes choose only shorter parts to pray and meditate on. For instance, a particular psalm or reading may speak to my heart so I focus on that rather than plough through the entire section for the day. Christian Prayer is far less expensive as well. It is an excellent value for the price. I recommend it esp for those just beginning to pray with a breviary. It's not the quantity, it's the quality! The peace of Christ and St. Benedict be with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl of Great Price","review":"I originally purchased this book for my sister and she loves it. So I thought I would try it since I needed more in my prayer life. This is a fantastic prayer form if you want to pray the same prayers as the ordained clergy only without all of the hours. I can't say enough about this book. It certainly has changed my prayer life for the better. You will not be disappointed.Takes some getting used to as to where to place the ribbons for easy access. I originally had all the ribbons placed except one, so I called my sister and she helped in re-setting the ribbons.You just have to buy one and see for yourself how much you can immerse yourself in this form of prayer life. It is the BEST for those who are working throughout the day; morning prayer before work, day time prayer at lunch, evening prayer after dinner, and night prayer before retiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes some getting used to","review":"When I first received Christian Prayer I was a bit lost with all the page turning needed for saying morning and night prayers. I didn't know if I was using the book the way it was intended. I think after using it several times I know what I am doing now. All it takes is some time to \\"stick with it\\" and learn generally where everything is. There is a guide that comes with the book and some inserts with the more common readings on them which really do help. I'm happy with my Christian prayer book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great One Volume Prayer","review":"I own the four volume Office and I find that this single volume contains all of the prayers that I use.

This is the public prayer of the Church and everyone can learn how to pray the Office. Five star review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praying the Hours","review":"This volume has provided a wonderful introduction to the ages-old practice of praying the hours.Though abbreviated, for one living in modernity's fast-paced western world, the opportunity to enjoy fellowship with the universal Church as she collectively reads, prays, and chants the Psalms has proved itself to be more profound a blessing than expected.The construction and pleasing form are well designed and executed.

Good to have it at last, then, because it's one of the best films to come out of the Soviet 1920s-- a work of rat-a-tat editing on a par with Gance's Napoleon and an example of slowly-smoldering drama finally delivering with a vengeful wallop worthy of The Godfather. Pudovkin consistently displayed the human touch that colleagues such as Eisenstein and Dovzhenko lacked, and the story of a Mongolian peasant who is used as a puppet ruler by the British until he finally unleashes the force of his people upon them is gripping throughout. In short, a masterpiece that is also a cracking good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undivided Love built 2 last","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on the covenant of marriage and the way God ordained it before sin came into the world with Adam and Eve. It is written with scripture references which I found to be great. It's not just the author's point of view but God inspired him to write such a true grit book on the state of today's marital relationships in our society. He potently tells you the right way marital relationships should be the way God intended from the beginning. Anyone that chooses to read this book will not be disappointed. It's great reading and hopefully it brings those who read it into enlightment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master P is a wonderful actor.

This story of the the Lost Boys, as they came to be known, manages to be pleasant and uplifting. It leaves you not with revulsion at the horrors the boys experienced, but with hope for their future.The film follows three young men who are among 3,800 survivors handpicked by an international rescue committee to start a new life in the United States. They must leave behind friends and siblings in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp for a cultural crash course in the U.S.What impressed me most was the mature humanity of these very young boys in taking care of one another and creating community. The lack of community in the U.S. is stark by comparison. Some of those trained here are now using the gifts the U.S. does have to provide leadership in Africa to overcome the past destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, pretty, lovely platter","review":"This platter was purchased to go with the entire Winterberry dinnerware set.

The player runs for few seconds and loads the song into its memory and then plays from it for 3 mins, the motor stops for this time, this helps the CD player to be skipfree and conserves the Battery. This is a excellent idea implemented by Sony. Several reviews remarked about its usability, playing-software etc., but being a software professional I find this software excellent. The buttons are bit tricky to use mainly the radio button. Believe me I was initially searching them badly but when I found it I couldn't control laughing myself. And once you are used to it you will realize why they have designed this way. Its really skip free I even wagged it and the song was playing uninterrupted. Regarding MP3 it even goes into folders inside a CD.

Grant and \\"Reflection Of Evil\\" by Graham Masterton are brilliant. E.C. Tubb's \\"Mirror of the Night\\" fits nicely in this terror anthology as well as does \\"The Fourth Seal\\" by the ever prolific Karl Edward Wagner. \\"The Chimney\\" is an excellent Ramsey Campbell short and \\"The Circus\\" by Sydney J.

Side 1 is breathlessly mangificent from the heavy Sonic Attack, through the best ever song by Huw (Rocky Paths) featuring great guitar work... relentless keyboard patterns into the heavy Angels of Death. Side 2 is great as well.. only pales slightly compared to Side 1.

Now they are all so dull - almost over-detailed. This book is no different. While the premis of \\"para-psychology\\" could have been interesting the language developed by the author to describe the different types of psychics is confusing and over-used. I found myself skipping huge chunks of this book just to get to the point of the conversation. Don't waste your money -borrow it if you are a die hard fan or wait for it at the local library.

I really liked how this book was written. The storyline kept me just as enraptured as the first and maybe even more so with the current developments in Lydia and Emmett's relationship.The budding relationship between Lydia and Emmett was really the highlight of the book.

But she has added a new dimension to the the short story, and to the literature of place and time. Set in Jewish neighborhoods in an around neighborhood, this very powerfully written collection of short stories captures a rapidly changed world from the eyes of an equisitely sensitive young girl. This is the Newark, and the America, of the pre-60's, pre-riots era, captured at the precise moment that it changes forever. It's also a wonderful story about growing up, about the fragile place of religion, culture and family in a sometimes brutal and incomprehensible. If the publishing world were sane this would be on the NYTimes best-seller list intead of all the junk that's there. But we're lucky to be able to get and read it anyway.

Unfortunately, most of this book meanders aimlessly while the crimes that are alluded to happen far from the reader's eyes. Richman spends far too much time describing the social settings surrounding the story. The actual story that is waiting to be told is put somewhere on the back shelf. Murders happen, crimes are committed, and everything gets solved. Yet somehow, the reader has a feeling that he or she is always on the outside of the action. Storylines are interjected for what turns out to be no reason at all.

This would certainly hold true for their requests for the content the teachers pass on.

After a while wearing it however you get used to it and appreciate the weight and look. The more I wear it the more I love it. I went on to look at many of the LUPAH models and they all seem to be this thick and that was comforting. I have had so many compliments on the face of this watch as it is truly unique and compliments all that I wear. The band is awesome as well.

It conveyed emotion and an enormous amount of energy without sinking into repetition. \\"Bamboleo\\" of course has been featured on a hamburger commercial recently but it doesn't do justice to the rest of the album. My personal favorite is the instrumental work, \\"Moorea\\". It is on this particular song that the band seems to lose itself in the moment. They show their true potential as musicians in the harmonies and intricacies of this one. Even on their lower points (for example \\"A Mi Manera\\") they show a potential to rise to great heights. This Cd is great for a quick burst of energy but repeated listening shows that there are layers to be delved. I definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for any CD Collection","review":"In you enjoy Flamenco music at all you will adore the Gipsy Kings.

To say that this is a great example of how the Spanish guitar should be played and how Spanish music should sound is an understatement! The guitar sounds like a person, an identity of its own and the male voices blend in harmonies that no other nation (except Spain) could concur. I was left in a state of awe the first time I heard it, and now (after MANY instances of replay) I get chills every time I hear \\"Un Amor\\", \\"Bamboleo\\", \\"Djobi Djoba\\", and \\"Faena\\". Even for a non-Spanish speaker this is a great album to own; anyone can easily identify with the rhythm and feel of each song.

I have to say though that I prefer some of her most recent work to this CD. Her music has always been good, but I do think her music gets better and better.

I can hear her working her way through Priceless and Good Enough in a live arena. The best cuts are without a doubt the title track, which always makes me want to fall in love, as well as Good Love, which Anita sings with such beauty and depth it's irresistable.

Both tragedies and comedies overlook each other, ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of Vasavi, go back to soil, resounding what great Tagore wrote, \\"Lets go back to earth\\", which took shape of developmental NGO, PRAGATI, which is a dream in our life, not unreasonably.

I shudder at how they would have done my favorite song, \\"On My Own\\". And I'm fairly glad it wasn't one of the clips. I would never buy this CD. It is not worth it.The people aren't terrible singers- but they are NOT singers that should sing Les Mis. I didn't think that the instrumental was too bad- but everything just sounded deliberate- it was not at all like it was real. I could name a few casts that DO make it real in case you are wondering. Go try the CD clips from a CD called \\"Les Miserables: The Musical That Swept The World (10th Anneversary)\\" or something to that effect.

The keyboard is great. I'm even running Linux, and had no problem with drivers for it. The keyboard and mouse have a range of 6 or 7 feet, which I found wonderful.However, the mouse goes through batteries about once a week, which seems surprisingly fast. This is partly due to the fact that there is no way to turn the mouse off. For future reference, when the batteries start to die, the LED on the bottom stops shining, except for about 2 seconds after one of the buttons is clicked.

No help from M-Audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known what I was getting...","review":"I read all the bad reviews and I also saw reviews with flawless installs. So I tried it and mine was not flawless. I emailed the company's support address with my issues and never received a response.

I may try it in a future new build."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This card is not only clean but it has some of the quietest electronics I've heard in a PC card. I use this for acoustic measuring with a microphone and it has more dynamic range than my mic. I also use it as an accurate AC voltmeter and as an oscilloscope device to measure raw speakers before they go into cabinets. It has over 5 volt input capability which means it does have 100db of dynamic range. The output is also Audiophile grade when playing lossless media such as FLAC or WAV files. Very high quality and I don't need a separate preamp to play music through my amp. I recommend this card if you are looking for a card to use with ARTA, HOLM, Speaker Workshop or any other similar software package. It's perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Input recording levels too low,, card worthless.","review":"I have three audio interfaces (USB and Firewire), but wanted a card with no Preamp built in to it as I use a higher end one.

I'm not crazy about these things. I bought a package thinking that a clear screen overlay for my Clie might be a good idea, and perhaps even essential for protecting against scratches and glare. What I got was something akin to a do-it-yourself lamination effect. No matter how meticulously I applied the overlay, carefully using the included \\"smoothie card\\" to eliminate those inevitable fine air bubbles, the finished job just didn't sit well with me. What I expected was total transparency, however, that's not the case. My PDA screen was clearer and had less glare without the overlay, so I eventually ended up removing it. Fortunately, the sheets come off easily, leaving no visible residue from the adhesive backing. On the plus side, using the graffiti pad with the overlay didn't seem to be a problem. I really did have high hopes for this one, but it just didn't work out that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy again!","review":"I usually buy B-12 dots from Wal-Mart but they were out of stock so I decided to try these.

It is very light weight, doesn't crush your eye makeup and has an area that allows for your nose so that it blocks out all the light. I bought this for an airplane trip. I couldn't use the earplugs, however. I think my ear canal is too small. My husband could use them just fine, however. But for an airplane, you want your ears to adjust to the changes in pressure, so I guess you'd have to wait until you're at cruising altitude and then put them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye shades","review":"For sure a cheap product where you get what you paid. The plugs are just a couple of small sponges which fall off the ears, and the shades work if you don't need to cover all the light in the room but just to dimm it.Would not buy this again, rather spend a little more money and get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I was surprised at how cheap and cheesy this product is.

The problem with this approach has been pointed out to the author many, many times but she consistenly rejects such advice. Her health is suffering because of her weight and she consistently denies this, refusing even to discuss it with her doctor. The book is exceedingly tedious to read. One sentence went on for over half a page. I read it through primarily because of the excellent references and statistics that are scatterered throughout the book. If it wasn't for that, I'd have deep six'd it after a few pages. Oh, the Epilogue was good...but hardly worth the 192 pages to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Family Guy Yet","review":"This collection is nothing more than previous editions with the foul language included in the dialogue. I don't suggest this volume for anyone who has children, or if you're sensitive to recursive and excessive use of cursing for no apparent reason. The only highlight of the discs are the change of menus, but you still can't skip the fricking opening theme song by clicking next on the remote. Seth has lost his touch. This was a horrible purchase and does not live up to my expectations. Do yourself a favor and don't bother wasting money on Family Guy after Volume 4. They keep slipping in old shows mixed in with new shows to make the Dvd appear more full. It hardly has any new material. NOT HAPPY! Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be...","review":"I used to enjoy family guy...seasons 1-3, late nights on the cartoon network. But seriously, i think they are running out of material. for that I mean, almost every episode they sing and boy do they sing. 5-10 min worth of singing (most of the time its not original stuff) and it isn't even funny cuz the joke passed a LONG time ago. Or they'll just sit around and talk about nothing for 5min. What happened to the stewie who wanted to kill lois? That stewie was AWESOME. this new one is lame. back to the basics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This episode sucks","review":"There is a 3 minute music video of Conway Twitty performing one of his songs in the middle of this episode. This is not an animated goof, it is an actual 3 minute video clip of Twitty performing on the Grand Ole Opry or Hee Haw or something. It's just stupid and I don't watch this show to listen to country music. Then there is another minute or two of another song while Peter roams around in his mind or something. Maybe this episode was written during a writers strike or something. This show often succeeds wonderfully at being just plain stupid in a funny way. This was not funny. It was just annoying. I know that the Twitty thing had some relevance in some way that I did not get but 3 minutes was overkill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy Vol 7","review":"Some of these weren't the best episodes, but all together it's good to watch the set without the censors bleeping everything or having to change a word in dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best season but still pretty good","review":"I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if you could do half stars here. Not their best season ever but there are some really stand out episodes here that make this completely worth watching. \\"Long John Peter\\" is one of my favorites all time, and \\"Road to Germany\\" is emmy worthy. And everyone complaining about the format of releasing volumes instead of actual seasons can blame George Lucas for proving that a dedicated enough fan base will shell out money every time a new version is released (Still waiting on Star Wars films on Blu-Ray)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This show should have stayed cancelled!","review":"I used to watch this show, but stopped during the most recent season. During its original run it was funny & unique. When it returned it wasn't as good & just got progressively worse. The show nowadays takes old jokes that worked before & stetches them out in newer episodes to the point where it is no longer funny. Often it looks like they add things just to fill air time (how was that Conway Twitty thing supposed to be funny?). It seems like Seth McFarlane has become so powerful that everyone on his staff is afraid to tell him when something isn't funny (This seems to be the same problem George Lucas had with Star Wars Episodes 1-3). Seth has also gotten greedy by splitting up seasons into 2 DVD sets to make you pay twice as much. I think I'll just go back to watching my Season 1 & 2 box sets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not enough Meg","review":"I like Family Guy but lately they have not been doing much with Meg and Chris. The only main episode with Chris in it was Long John Peter. Meg does not have much of a part in these episodes. By the way why does the product say season 7 part 2 and season 8 part 1? It should really say season 6 part 2 and season 7 part 1. Oh well its not that important.I hope volume 8 comes out in less than a year. Also the deleted scenes were horrible. The other volumes had at least 10 good ones but this one had awful ones. I also hated The Juice is Loose. What a bad idea for the last episode on this volume. So if you don't mind all this stuff buy the volume. If you do mind you should buy it anyway that's what I did and I guess I'm glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD content is great, however it is falsely advertised.","review":"The content of Family Guy Volume 7 is great stuff, by all means buy it. However, when you receive it, you won't get what's pictured. The DVD no longer comes with the sleeve featuring the Griffins, just the bare-bones case, which doesn't make much sense. I was a little miffed because I bought it as a gift, and the person it was for knew there was a sleeve for the case, so it just made me seem cheap when I gave them a half-assed copy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"McFarlane needs better writers","review":"I was rather disappointed with this one. I was glad I purchased this at Wal-Mart's post Black Friday special. The writing is just not there! How many times can you watch Conway Twitty singing, knowing that is saving Mcfarlane money on writers and animation time! The only thing I enjoyed was the deleted scenes. Seth should take the cast of American Dad and Clevland's Show and combine them in cross over episodes. The Simpson's lasted over 20 years with good characters. Family Guy will have to employ the same qualities if it wants to stay on the air.I don't want to see this great show go off the air; but if good writers aren't employed by Seth, this show will soon off the schedule on Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Under-funny","review":"Fox continues its practice of releasing 13 episodes for what they used to charge for a full (~24 episodes) volume. It's just not worth it until it goes on discount for around $20.But more importantly, the content of the show has suffered a serious decline in quality. There are far fewer laugh out loud moments, fewer genuinely funny episodes, and fewer plots that are even worth animating. There are several episodes that didn't make me laugh once (and that has never happened in any previous season). I hope this is just a hiccup and not a trend, but I'm losing faith.In short, it's too much money for too few episodes of declining quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting old","review":"let me start off by saying i have loved family guy since day 1. however, it is starting to get old. it's to the point where the characters will go off on a cussing tangent for 5 minutes. *News Flash for the writing team*...it's not that funny after a while. once or twice maybe; every other episode, no..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Spend your money on the earlier seasons, those gave non-stop laughs.

The actual product can't be that much different than the other Family Guy DVD sets.Seriously, if a show that these trolls claim to either used to like or never liked can generate this much vitriol, then this show should get five stars just for that. Definitely don't see this much passion for \\"Dharma and Greg\\"!IMO, this product deserves five stars just for \\"I Dream of Jesus\\". Plus the FG people have wised up and recognized that no one wants to pay over $30 for a DVD set and have priced it more reasonably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Left Ideology on FOX","review":"A great show undercut by Seth MacFarlane's far left ideology. Family Guy was the funniest show on television, but it's so full of liberal BS that it's losing it's fun.

If you like Family Guy, you'll enjoy this set.The extras are pretty good. There's a tour of their offices, a mix of commentary (some with and some with MacFarlane), and probably the funniest part - footage of the crew's talk at Comic Con 2008, which reminded me a lot of seeing Family Guy Live in Chicago.I have only one complaint, and it's the same for the last several DVD releases - MacFarlane is screwing us with these half-season packages at a full-season price. Come on, give us an entire season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a ripoff!

Why is volume 7 actually parts of season 6 and the first half of season 7.. what the duce? Why can't he release these as complete seasons as he did with season one and two? I own all of the Family Guy releases, and volume 7 was a dissapointment. Rather than relying on true humor and funny set-ups, Seth and team have decided to replace that with more F-bombs and other not funny references in the name of being \\"edgy\\". The censored TV versions are funnier than the DVD's. Perhaps this is Seth's way of letting the seriers die... especially since he's actually convinced Fox to air the spin-off \\"The Cleaveland Show\\".. this is sure to be a crash and burn!

You may complain about the Simpsons, but they gave us five great seasons and three good ones, Family guy three great, and two good ones. As soon as American Dad started this became about money. Hense why we get 16 episodes and not a full season. It has nothing to do with season 4. Think about it, best sold DVD TV show=sell out from fox...

An Englishman, he felt drawn to all things southern American and re-enacted the Civil War south as a soldier of that time. His visions and syncronistic events were steps that led to the revelation of the mystery - that he in fact, had (in his past life) been a Confederate soldier from McIntosh County, Georgia.

Had she stayed there wouldn't even have been a misunderstanding.The misunderstandings were really unnecessary.The hero was ok but for the first half of the book, I didn't get any real emotions from him even though there was his point of view.

In the grove is ok and pump it up....i just hate the 5-panel and menu intergration. A lot of people think In the Grove is a better game just because the steps for the songs are hard, which doesnt make the game itself good. There isn't any orignality with the songs or steps. Every song is just some generic techno. At the highest diffuclty all the songs play the same, no matter how the song sounds. I do like sound quality of the system though. its among the best.

The biggest drawback, in my opinion, is the lack of a backlight. It can be hard to see in dark rooms and a backlight would be a great addition. That being said, @[...] bucks you can't beat the price.

I loved hearing their best work from previous albums all put on one c.d., it was like listening to them for the first time again. When I heard the import german version of The Mix I totally freaked out. To hear the masters of electronic music singing these great songs in german gave me goose-bumps. If you are a Kraftwerk fan you owe it to yourself to get these import c.d.'s from Amazon.com because it will make your collection complete and it will amaze you to hear the music you love sang in german.

There is currently a shift in modern house/techno toward that electical Krafwerk sound, so it is pleasing to see how they anticipated a yet-another trend.

However, when presented without the context of the original (concept) albums these tracks often appear lightweight, somehow less than the sum of their parts. Tracks that stood out for me were Pocket Calculator / Dentaku, which is much funkier than the original; The Robots, which is a little more up-tempo this time round; and Radioactivity, which simply rocks! The rest - while often having their moments and certainly sounding polished in their digital reincarnation - are ultimately disappointing. Especially annoying is the percussion, with meretricious bursts of very un-Kraftwerkian flourishes, especially on Computer Love (check amazon's extract).

On 'Try A Little Tenderness' David Murray and company start smooth, close to the original melody then Mr. Murray's solo explores the variations of tenderness and the rest of the group join in the adventure. Very sensual, easily the most fascinating covers of these two classics I've ever heard.

I bought this to save space on my kitchen counter but should have stayed with my small boom box. I sent an e-mail to Sony to complain and all I received was an offer to replace the unit I have. I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is REALLY worthless!!","review":"Rarely do I write a review but this product is so bad I had to. Expecting Sony electronics to perform well, what a disappointment, this one is a bummer. Save your money. There has got to a better under cabinet radio out there. While the concept is good and the design sleek; don't be fooled by the packaging. Nothing works well. FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive. To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted. Forget listening to the rest of it. This product is really ZERO stars. I've tossed the whole works in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound & Design","review":"I ordered this unit for my sister and she loves it.

I have always wanted a radio in my kitchen, one that did not take up too much space. After the two hour installation I plugged the unit in expecting it to work and low and behold, the CD player would not open. I read that there were similar problems with this happining from the other reviews but bought this product anyway. (stupidity on my part) I called sony and they only pay for shipping out a new replacment not for you to send it to them, even though this is a brand new product and I am a brand new customer. Sony sucks and this crappy radio sucks. I hope sony reads these reviews and will start to make better products. I will never buy anything from sony again!!!

In fact, his record was one of continuous failure. In at least three major cases (the Jackson Family murders, the Boston Strangler murders and the Michigan Coed murders) he falsely implicated innocent parties. In the Jackson family murders he caused an innocent man to be incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane. The man was only released after the FBI caught the real murderer -- without any help from Hurkos. Hurkos's involvement in the Michigan Coed murderers was even more tragic. When Hurkos went to Michigan to investigate the murders the murderer committed yet another as a challenge to the great psychic sleuth. I am currently working on an article about the Jackson family murders and have found that most of Browning's statements about the case are contradicted by contemporary news articles in major newspapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdated, but good introduction","review":"It helped me as a lay person to get some insight into genetics and genetic technology.

I know the words and melodies to every song on this album, and i'm just listening to it for the first tme in a long time! It just stays with you, is ALWAYS a great listen, it's definitely music, not comedy, not childish nonsense, but a truly cerebral pop album that's just amazing. One of the best albums ever made, although most people probably won't listen. If you have any sense, you'll want to give this a listen, and let yourself love it!

Well worth buying, I paid AUS$32 for it but it's worth twice that."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars Isn't Enough","review":"This album is one of the greatest in the entire history of the universe.

No size listed in product description: my bad, since I believed the 1st reviewer who said it fits \\"Maximum Round Size Diameter = 2.75\\" or 6.985 cm,\\" which was exactly what my earphone size was. Totally wrong information, probably for a different product: these cushions are less than 1.5\\" I.D., and the maximum round size diameter earphone they would fit is 1.75\\" - a full inch less than the reviewer said. The O.D. is only 2.125\\"! I'll take the $2.64 loss; especially since they arrived by Fedex at my rural address in a 1 ft x 1 ft x 1/2 foot box, when a small envelope via USPS would have sufficed.

After a couple of years the foam was worn down so far that it was hard plastic on my ears--and it hurt! I ordered these inexpensive replacements just to see if they might work.At first I was disappointed that these wouldn't fit my headset because I didn't know how to install them and was trying to hold a space with a screwdriver and stuff the edges of the foam into the ear piece with the other hand. Finally I figured out that I can unscrew part of the ear piece and now the new foam fits nice and snug.It is thicker than the original foam so it obscures the on/off switch a little but I can still operate it just fine. They are now much more comfortable than they were when they were new! I'm happy to have found them and that they were not expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work!","review":"My husband needed new ear cushions for his plantronics head set. At first we thought they were going to be too small, but because they are foam, the worked really well - served their purpose - and were WAY less expensive than buying a brand new head set for him! I would say if you have a plantronics head set, and you need new ear cushions for it, try these out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!","review":"This game was very entertaining.

I bought a couple of their discs for 1 or 2 songs. But, this disc has been in my car changer for several weeks. Thirty songs! Even if you only liked 1/2 of them, you're still way ahead of most discs out there. Most of the songs end and go right into the next one, making for a seamless, continuous enjoyable 80 minutes. And the index/break between the songs is such that you can still add the songs to your mix-discs without cutting off part of the song. There are so many fave tracks...just add this to your cart NOW and be done with it! Alternative/powerpop of the highest order!!!! Lots of different pop styles going on here, sometimes within the same song....Sloan Rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They shifted gears again, and I still love it!","review":"My first thoughts when I realized this thing was 30 tracks: okay, there's got to be a lot of filler, right? Not so, thankfully. Actually, quite the opposite. Given that most of these songs are in the 2-3 min range, the songs have no room for unnecessary passages. They just dive right in and serve it up. One thing they've done on this disc is lessen the arena-rock sound (taking out the bottom end) and gone with more melody. It's not what I was expecting, but damn they just have written some great music and lyrics on this one.Another satisfied listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"In agreement with most everybody here","review":"I got this CD in January, fell in love with it immediately, and told friends that, early as it was in the new year, there was no doubt this would make my personal Top 5 Best of 2007. Well, here we are at the end of 2007, and Never Hear the End Of It is still entrenched at the top of my list. Unlike many of these other reviewers, I was NOT a passionate Sloan fan before. Sure, I loved their many tremendous singles; who doesn't? But this album takes me to a whole new level of appreciation. I cannot remember the last time I actually tried to learn the words to an entire album!! The music, melodies and hooks... just fantastic. I LOVE this album. And, a year later, this is the CD I'm sending to my music-loving nieces and nephews for this year's Christmas gift. BTW- 30 songs may seem like a lot, but they are all, for the most part, SO good that I actually downloaded the 3 free tracks offered with the CD when I got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely There by Precious Accents","review":"The charm I received from PRECIOUS ACCENTS had an imprint barely visible to the human eye.

Also offered good advice to the \\"but I don't want to hurt anyone\\" mindset and how to deal with the guilt that might accompany some of the actions defined. For those of a squeam-ish nature, some of the material may be considered graphic. Not a thrill seeking book, very much a reality check.

The texture is nice and crunchy and has the right amount of extra goodies, without being too sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloying taste, not as good as Bear Naked","review":"Since there were many positive reviews, I thought I'd give it a try to see if I like it as much as I loved Bear Naked.Quite disappointed with the taste. Its a little sweet and cloying. While I had success in getting my wife hooked onto granola with Bear Naked, she can't eat more than a little of Udi's and leaves the rest of her bowl in disgust - it just tastes a bit too sweet. I'm a little more tolerant in general, but I think in the taste test, Udi loses by a mile.We're not looking forward to the rest of the sampler pack :( My recommendation to anyone interested in trying this out is to buy a single pack and compare it to Bear Naked.Also, the size is 13oz and not 16oz as mentioned in another review and my shipment did include the Hawaiian and Bananaberry flavor - didn't find them great as well. The only flavor thats good and not too sweet is the Cranberry flavor. I will not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This cereal was really good but I only gave it four stars because Bear Naked is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The \\"best by\\" date is in less than a week and I am only just starting the second bag. It is Cranberry. The cranberry pieces are like broken glass. The granola itself is very so-so, not particularly tasty at all, in fact boring. Usually one can eat stuff that's good for you even if it's not too appetizing, because you have the big picture in view, but granola isn't even that healthy!!! So it had just better be good, and this isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious","review":"Very yummy, loved all of the flavors and have ordered the sampler more than once (can't decide on a favorite flavor). The only qualm I have is with the cranberry flavor. The cranberries are VERY chewy on the verge of hard. I eat the granola with milk and my jaw still gets sore from chewing the cranberry chunks, still very yummy though if you can deal with the chewiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be CRUNCHY to like GRANOLA but it helps!","review":"I love Udi's because I have a number of allergies and had to find something that was natural and contained MINIMAL ingredients but still had a great taste. I have tried the few granolas out there that fit the bill and Udi's is the BEST by far.It is light and crunchy and fresh tasting, not too sweet and definitely not boring. I prefer the Au Naturel and that is simplest of all...just great tasting oats perfect for adding to yogurt or with a little milk.One thing to consider- You had better have a big family or LOVE granola since a little goes a long way and one bag lasts me a couple of weeks. Get this 6-pack and you will be all set for a while with plenty of variety!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reissue of a really good album","review":"It's really too bad that the Three Degrees never really got their due. With two very gifted lead singers, Sheila Ferguson and Valerie Holiday, this talented group had true vocal power that surpassed so many of their peers. Their trademark harmonies, tight and lush, are showcased on this album's title song as well as the other tunes in this collection. If you think you never need to hear \\"What I Did For Love\\" again in this life, give a listen to the Three Degrees' version. And Sheila's lead on \\"In Love We Grow\\" demonstrates why few singers can work a ballad quite like she can. If you like the Three Degrees and have never heard this album, get it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"I received the CD in record time. The CD itself was in great condition and I had the added surprise that some of the songs were ones that I had been looking for and couldn't find via ITunes. I'd use them again and would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"We bought this album to enjoy listening to with the kids after a fun movie. Instead we became a driving hazard on a road-trip because the only thing it's good for is putting everyone to sleep. There is nothing on this CD but slow mood inspiring short orchestra pieces - strings and horns and such. The only song with more voice than a French Horn is the last one, #40, that played during the credits. Yes, I said \\"40\\", I doubt there's a 2 minute song in the bunch. P.S. Amazon gave it the star, not me, as there is no zero option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie. I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words. Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words. It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I was pretty disappointed by this.

We walked through the mall following the movie and stumbled into the soundtrack cd. We all thought it would be a great purchase since the movie was so good. Wrong!Oh my, have you ever listed to an orchestra play movie music without wathcing the movie. Right, boring! Out of 40 tracks on this CD there is only one song that has words! The kids were fully disapointed and so was I.There was no singing by the characters like other Disney titles. All I can say is stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... the movie was good...","review":"I tell you after watching that masterpiece of a movie you find your self susceptable to buy anything you see. That's what happened to me here, and let me tell you i'm not a happy customer. These are some of the most boring songs i've ever heard. It's like they're taken straight out of a childrens movie. My life since purchasing this has gone down hill. Not only did my dog die, but my car was stolen just the other day. I write this review not to scare any of you away like this soundtrack is cursed or something, but... yes this album IS cursed. Stay away from it, and don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for driving in the car","review":"My 22 month old son loves the movie Finding Nemo and has watched it countless times. He loves this CD and recognizes what parts of the movie many of the pieces are from. He asks for it most every time he gets in the car, and believe me, its very pleasant for adults to listen too. The pieces are beautiful and relaxing. My only disappointment is that the songs are all very short...not much longer than they were in the scenes of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved the movie you'll love the soundtrack!","review":"I loved the music that Thomas Newman played in the movie and i knew a soundtrack was out there , and I was right!They have every song from the movie in the soundtrack too!(except for one or two.)You should buy this soundtrack even if you don't like F.N. because the music is just incredible.I like how on #29 they added Dory's song:just keep swimming.There's a total of 40 songs and they're all from the movie but I think it was #14 or #13 , it's called fish-o-rama.All of the songs start out kind of slow then after at least 20-40 seconds it starts to get fast.The only problem is that the songs are really short!Each song is only 1-2 minutes!Ohterwise this soundtrack is fabulous!If you like F.N. or not,you should still buy this soundtrack!I worship F.N. so of course i bought it.The other soundtracks suck anyway.sincerly,kenny(i don't know why i say \\"sincerly\\"?

I was referred to a website with the updates and downloaded the update (beware, some SD100s don't need this update and a download could render such cameras inporable -- except as a door-stopper). So far everything has worked fine, but everytime I press the shutter, I am jittery.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone and any canon products since then I have bought the A 70 and could not be happier with both of them. This is one though hombre of a camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the E18 error","review":"I bought this camera in 2004, and it worked very well. I would agree with most of the other good reviews. However, all of a sudden the lense would not shut down and I kept getting an E18 error on screen. Apparently this is common on these types of Canon camera's (ie. the lense getting stuck), and will cost approx $150 - $250 to repair, which is more than the original cost of the camera. I did not drop it or mishandle it in any way, so it looks like a defect in the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera despite some setbacks","review":"Previuosly I have used Sony Cybershot P3, p2 and Pextax Optio S. I decided to buy this one as Canon has a good name in camera products. The picture quality is the best so far for me. The optical zoom is limited but enough for an amateur like me. The problem is the movie mode as the camera will not adjust itself to white balance or light exposure. For example, if you first started your recording in an indoor environment such as your room and then proceed to record the view of outside your window(bright sunny day), the camera would not be able to cope with the bright light as it has been set for the light exposure of the room. The screen would just be flat white. It's a major setback as all my previuos camera would adjust the white balance. Other than that, the camera doesn't have a battery indicator. It only appears when the battery is almost depleted. Not helpful enough. Other than that, the size is awesome, compact, but not as small as the Pentax optio s."},{"rating":"2","title":"dance dance dance!!!","review":"\\"sorry\\" the second single released by madonna from \\"confessions on the dance floor\\" album. love the music, love the song, love the artwork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice flexible little system","review":"I found this to be a nice flexible little unit that works equally well as an MP3 amp as it does with my electric ukelele.

There are some songs on here that \\"rock out\\", too. His voice sounds a little like another Jeremy (Camp), but the instrumental sound is a little more airy and atmospheric. It's a pretty unique sound, but familiar enough to keep you comfortable with it.Just after I typed the previous paragraph (this is an edit), I decided to listen to it in my living room while holding my 1-yr-old son. He never falls asleep while someone's holding him. He must have liked this song. He wasn't even tired, and he was OUT. It was precious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I heard Jeremy's single \\"Sweetly Broken\\" on radio just this past Tuesday and it immediately caught my attention.

It is hard to do anything but praise God when I am listening to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not the caetano of beautiful songs","review":"Although a beautiful album in its own right, Estrangerio is one of Caetano's least commercial efforts. Guitarist Marc Ribot and producer Arto Lindsay provide a spare and harsh sonic landscape where the color and texture of Ceatano's modernist (post-post-modernist?) poetry is given center stage. The sweetness of a bossa nova and the rhythm of Carlinhos Brown tune lighten the overall tone and round out the album -- a very satisfying whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back - and better than ever","review":"This album means a lot to me. I'd been a PT fan since Makin' Magic and after playing Reading Festival in 1980, he disappeared from England for ten long years. This was the comeback album that preceded the tour and it's stunning. It's got everything. Rock, blues and a beautiful instrumental (Via Veneto). Fourteen tracks and there's not a dud among 'em. Pat was always the most exciting guitarist I ever heard, but he's a great songwriter too...and it's all here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Album","review":"Like my title suggests, this album is just plain awsome. The album is very dynamic and each song in the album is dynamic. Most punk songs sound the same and have the same tempo throughout the entire album. Lost at Sea doesn't bore you with a stagnant repeatative beat. Everything about this album is great, the lyrics, the vocals, the actual music, etc. If you like punk, but get sick of every song sounding the same, like a dance album, give Lost at Sea a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Girl's Effort Comes Up Short","review":"I thought this CD would keep me entertained, but obviously I waswrong.

Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"With \\"Life In General\\", both punk rock and MxPx shine","review":"The trouble with lots of pop-punk bands and their releases these days is that the songs have little variety to offer from one to the next. That said, MxPx, in its best album to date, is an exception to the rule. Plenty of variety abounds this 17-track treasure chest of power punk. If you like pop punk or melodic punk and haven't heard MxPx, prepare to fall in love with their sweet guitars and ultra-catchy melodies. There's also plenty of variety in drumbeats--hardcore OR slower pace--MxPx isn't limited to one or the other. \\"Middle Name\\", \\"Move to Bremerton\\", \\"Doin' Time\\", \\"Chick Magnet\\", \\"Southbound\\", and \\"Destroyed By You\\" are just a few of the great songs on this must-have CD for MxPx fans...or punk/rock/pop fans in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is a very good CD. Definetly worth getting.","review":"This CD is very good. It has 17 tracks. All very good. In case you didn't know, MxPx is a Christian punk rock band. Compared to some of their other albums, Teenage Politics for instance, it's basicly the same kind of music. In this album they sing more about life in general. Hence the name. Some of the main things they sing about are girls, their hometown Bremerton, and of course, growing up. As in Teenage Politics, they also sing a lot about government and politics. There is no swearing or crude language in this CD. Don't let the mohawked hair or the earings fool you into thinking that they are stupid teens trying to get public attention. At first you may think they sound exactly like Green Day, but MxPx's lyrics are worth listening to, unlike Green Day's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool C.D (or casette tape, or vinyl record)","review":"This is one of MxPx's best recordings. This CD definately has some of the best sounds produced by this group. All of the songs have a good beat and understandable lyrics. Although it dousn't have very many references to Christ or God like they've had in their previous recordings, it is still a good CD. Also, the lyrics to the songs are clean compared to many of the songs people may hear in today's punk music. The less 'hardcore' sound is definately more catchy and enjoyable. A must have for any collection whether you like Christian music, punk, rock, country, pop, R&B, Rap, hip-hop, Nursery Rhymes, Dogs, cats, sheep, cows, ferrets, chinchillas, parakeets, eggs, beef, chicken, lamb, veal......Great CD!(or cassete tape, of vinyl record.

I feel that most punk bands seem to write all there songs to sound exactly alike. MxPx has some nice stuff on their cd. such as \\"do your feet hurt\\" and \\"The wonder years\\" but most of the rest of their songs are a spunky on-ward drone of guitar riffs that seem to sound EXACTLY the same no matter what song your listening to.

The Raaga Bilaskhanitodi is a rather sad raga, Shujjat who lacks classical training transforms it into more of a folk melody, which is sweet and relaxing. Other musicians such as Ustad Shahid Pervez Khan Saheb who are structurly trained and practiced in hindustani classical music bring out the original quality,essence and depth of such raagas.

The sitar sounds sweet, Shujjhat plays very sweetly and i like to hear it during bedtime. The raaga bilaskhanitodi is performed melodiously,although its definately not in a classical format its more of a gazal or folk type. Of course I didnt expect this album to be classically serious such as Pandit Ravi Shankar or Nikhil Banerjee or for that matter Shahid pervez (Pervez and Shujjhat are of the same style)I think artists like shujjhat khan and other semiclassical musicians are ideal for weddings and parties.

I appreciate Amazon's superb customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks.","review":"I like the safe, but it STINKS. I mean, literally. The \\"foam\\" interior smells like moth balls.

After I corrected my error, code entered easily and the unit works flawlessly. Would recommend it to anyone that needs to secure their pistols."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for 8 months","review":"This safe worked well for 9 months until one day when the buttons no longer functioned, making the safe inoperable without the key.

It is a total POS. Worked well for a few months, then stopped. I put fresh batteries in it (dated 12/2013). Still would not take a new code. After reading several posts about various problems and supposed solutions, I bought new batteries again. Tried over and over. Would not \\"learn\\" a new code. Now I have a key-only box. Total waste of money. Go ahead and Google GunVault problems and you will see that I am not the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works with key","review":"I hope to be able to change this review in the future, but as of right now it is a 1-star. I've tried two different brand new batteries and it doesn't seem to recognize either one. I called the technical support line but after hearing that it would be a 45 minute wait (which was after 5-10 minutes of already waiting), I hung up because I don't have time to wait on hold. We are on vacation and I got this for use in our hotel and vacation rental. Yes, we can use it with a key, but that isn't why we got it. Unfortunately, I discarded the original packaging somewhere along the way on this trip.We do own the mini-vault and haven't had a problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Purchased this safe and immediately had problems with trying to program.

While it fit his handgun and a clip, one out of every three times it would not open properly. The light would flash green and we could hear it unclick, but it wouldn't pop open. A gun vault needs to open smoothly every single time. Maybe it was just our particular vault that had a quirk, but we returned it and won't be replacing it with the same type vault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems great","review":"Bought this as a gift.

Worked great. The cable is not the strongest (but hey, what did you expect, a 10-pound anchor chain??) While it is not likely hold up against determined attack, it is not really intended to do so. The programing of the access code was pretty easy. Total 'set up' out of the box less than 5 minutes (maybe 2).I am able to store a Glock Compact and extra magazine with plently of room.I have been using it for about a month now, so I cannot comment on long term durability.PROs;- Inexpensive- Small / light enough to go in medium size satchel or packpack.- Easy operation / programing- Comes with 'security' cableCONs;- Not high security- Lid is not spring loaded (must manually lift)Overall, glad to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect solution","review":"My gunvault is the perfect solution for a bedside drawer gun storage.

Sure enough I just received and the electronics acted erratically. I thought it was me just learning how to operate it - most of the time it required me to enter the key sequence twice for it to open. Then after 2 hours of being n service it would not unlock at all with the exception of using the key. I tried switching batteries with no change. I'm sending it back for a replacement. Hopefully the second one will work correctly. My guess is that GunVault doesn't spend a a lot on quality control.BTW - This is of no fault of amazon - they had the order to me within one day of ordering it and their return process couldn't be easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"Need a secure place in car to store weapon. CCW has limitations and did not want to just leave weapon under seat to in glove box. The Gunvault along with the included cable solves this problem. Cable will not stop someone with the appropriate tools (large cutters) but will stop smash and grab thieves. The interior is padded and large enough to hold a full size 45 auto and spare magazine. Also, it can double as a lock box in home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mv500","review":"Perfect for my glock 21 and extra mag. Works reliably every time. Easy to set up and use.

However, this isn't their best effort. The Gunvault MV 500-STD I received had a significant gap when fully locked which seems to invite prying. The cable was extremely thin and the internal mount for the cable was also suspect. The foam padding was thin and didn't extend to the edges of the safe (plus as another poster recounted there was no padding along the sides so if your contents slipped they would rub against metal and the cable mount. I didn't have a problem with the key or the push buttons as other posters stated. Last, though I understand branding and advertising, it seems extremely unwise to display the words \\"Gun Vault\\" on the top of this device, announcing to all who see it what might be inside. The GunVault logo is welcome in my home, but not so much in my car!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product, worse customer service","review":"One day after I got this, two of the buttons stopped working, forcing me to rely solely on the key to open the safe. When I tried calling Tech/Customer Support, I rarely ever got through to a person, usually I got a recording telling me to call during normal business hours, even though that was exactly what I was doing! I left a message to call me during the morning because I work at night, and...you guessed it. Tech support called me in the evening during work! I had to ask Tech support to call me back the next day in the morning and they never did. I am trying to return this for a refund, but my attempts at correspondences have gone unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke","review":"After about a year, the first button just stopped working.

I was initially quite enamored with it, had updated the combination, etc, and was in the process of deciding where to put it. That's when one of the keys stopped working. After playing with it, I found the cable running from the top cover, down past the hinge and up to the internal electronics in the box had an intermittent open, only working when the top was open by about 45* or more.....not the security feature I was looking for. If I can not trust the Key pad & cable to function properly, it is not an effective home security tool. I will be looking for the minivault instead, where the key pad it connected to the electronics in a way where the cable does not have to flex and move, even though it is a bit bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"No service if it breaks","review":"I have three of these safes that I purchased when they hit the market. Today only two of them are operational. Both have keypad problems. In an emergency you cannot get into this safe. I called customer service (waited 53 minutes)and they stated that if it is out of warranty (which mine are) they do not service them. This means my three purchases are useless. I cannot recommend products from Gun Vault if they do not service what they sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vault, great size, smells aweful","review":"I actually have a larger gunvault that I use under the bed. This one is a perfect travel size when I go on trips. For some reason, there is a strong smell (glue?) in the vault. I had to let it air out in the garage for a few days.

As good as he is on a studio album, he (and his band) are even better live. If you are familiar with him, most of the favorites are here. If not, you are in for a treat.Although this is listed as an audio CD, this is, in fact, a DVD with a bonus CD. There are a few differences in the track listing for each, but all of the songs are golden. I prefer the DVD as you get to see him telling some of his (in)famous stories that go with the songs and see him and the band in action.This is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live is the best","review":"This is really a DVD with a bonus CD.

First, adolescence is confusing and crazy for a young boy, especially when he discovers girls. Second, there is no stronger adolescent bond than a boy and his dog. Third, war is tragic, hurting innocent victims far away from the battle front. Sherlock helps the reader feel the highs and lows of a young man experiencing his first dog, his first love, and his first war."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS The Cure!","review":"All you have to do is hear the beginning of Plainsong and you will be hooked into the beatiful echoing refrains from The Cure.

There simply is something about the unique guitar sounds layered together and the beatuiful words of Robert Smith.If you are interested in The Cure - this is their best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud......","review":"The bass has been overblown on this remaster, and the louder tracks suffer from quite a bit of clipping.

Dunno why. I guess the moody, broody feel of the album reminds me of something that a bored, teenage suburbanite would write. That said, I was sucked in to the soundscape of this piece and found myself unable to turn it off until the end. Took me an hour to become happy again afterward, but I'm so glad I gave this a chance. Lullaby is one truly incredible song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest rock CD ever","review":"I am a rock fan that listens to everything from heavy metal to alternative pop to classic rock and everything in between.Distintegration is without a doubt the greatest rock CD ever. All the songs are incredible. It transports you to another world.Your life will not be complete until you own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my top five albums","review":"This album definately ranks as one of my top five most favorite albums. I've a rather eclectic taste- albums in this goth and proto-goth genre only make up 10% or less of the albums I own. This is the perfect winter album, raining album, or somber mood album. The transition between when \\"Same Deep Water as You\\" ends and when \\"Disintegration\\" starts is very much the closest thing I come to an orgasm or endorphin release- the build up is so perfect and the pay-off primed that it never fails to hit me with an immense power when I'm listening to the whole album from start to finish. This is one I never listen to just a song or two, though there are some songs that made it as single-song hits, this album occupies a much more important place in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carreer peak recording","review":"breakthru album awash in meloncholy & regret with shimmerings of hope....a 72 min ride of emotion. a must get!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"The Cure is one of the very few bands of the Alternative Rock genre that I like.As other reviewers have stated, this is The Cure's best album, hands down. Disintegraion has some of the most gothic, romantic and enchanting songs The Cure has ever written. \\"Pictures Of You\\" is deeply emotional and melancholic. Two other favorite tracks of mine are \\"Fascination Street,\\" which is has a dark and witchy-ominous quality, and \\"Lullaby\\" which is seductive and haunting.Disintegration can be considered a greatest hits album as it truly has about all of The Cure's best songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever","review":"As was iterated by Kyle in South Park, this is the best album ever, of the cure or anyone else. Yeah, I used to do my hair like Robert Smith. Yeah many of their other albums are great and can be argued as to how good they are. However, none come close to the brilliance that is disintigration. It is a depressing CD, but somehow the world seems to be a better place afetr I listen to it. Other classics of the Cure just leave me in a disturbed mood (Faith for instance) the rest of the day. Again the other albums are great, but are just the warm up to best act of the Cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I think this is one of the best post-sellout albums by The Cure.

But I wasn't really into them until a few months ago. But now I find there music is beautiful masterpieces. This album is a perfect example. I play it on surround sound at night with all the lights out and just zone out on the melody. Its pretty dark. Which I love. I can't really explain totally how I feel about this album. But I know it will never get old to me. I wish I got it sooner.PsI got the mp3 download because I wanted it right then but it is so good I bought the 3 disk special edition. Gotta be one off my top 25 albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Disintegration (Deluxe Edition) (3CD)From the dark ambience of Fascination street to the poppy Lovesong, you have the essence of the Cure in Disintegration. My favorite album, period.It's not surprising that Pictures of You is in a commercial. They write memorable hooks that stay with you, and the mood is always palpable in a distinct, and deep way.The different versions are great because you get different takes on each song. For a collector, this is a must have. For a Cure fan, it's \\"Just Like Heaven\\".Some of the other reviews harp on audiophile pickiness, and while there may be flaws in that respect, it's still a great deal, all things considered. A must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted the original","review":"My bad for not reading. I overlooked the remastered part. The sample of the song I wanted had no words in it. When I listened to it I thought I was going to fall asleep. My real disappointment was finding that the original is not available as an MP3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and dull","review":"Puzzlingly popular Floyd-like prog rocker from Smith. Songwriting at an all time low with tuneless dirges such as the execrable 'Closedown' and 'Untitled'. 'Pictures of you' goes on and on boring the pants off the listener. This sort of filler would never have seen the light of day on early cure. Touching lyric on 'Last Dance' though. Only two worthy tracks are 'Prayers' and the title track but even that was overproduced. Talented and imaginative, Smith never had the juice for a long term carreer in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Cure Fan","review":"Love the Cure, enough said. This is their best album, and anyone looking for some music when they just want to be in the dark, it's a great pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proto-emo","review":"Epic goth-pop with sumptuous production at times recalls label 4AD's pioneering sounds but with The Cure the sound is completely fleshed out for an accessibly dark enjoyment. Although the pacing and sometimes stark minimalist instrumentation veer towards plodding, the band had a knack for letting these confined compositions stretch out and breathe on this very solid, often considered quintessential, release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best...","review":"Its been said before but its the absolute truth...Disintegration is absolutely the greatest recording of music our generation has and honestly deserves a place in history as one of the best albums EVER!...beautifully ugly,complexly simple,deep,moving,emotional and raw this is everything music should be...i simply cannot envision the universe without it...no joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER RELEASED","review":"What can I say, this is #1.

How do you (well, how do I) describe a work like this? This isn't an 80's album, or a goth album, and it's most definitely not an inconsequential album. This is a work of genius of a kind we rarely get to experience so directly (and that's not hyperbole); and if you haven't already, you must experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever made","review":"There's lot of reviews titled that way. The thing is that it's true. What, better than the Beatles? Sure, tell me there aren't weak spots on the White Album. There are none here, this is a seamless work of art that conveys the full drama of life and the sorrow of how quickly it passes.With Trilogy being released, it's a good time to remember how great this is. I predict people will be listening to this album hundreds of years from now, wondering who that genius was pictured on the cover, peering up from underneath the flowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Most of these songs are soft slow tunes. Most of them also have long boring intros. It takes a little getting used to, but after a while I guarantee you will love this CD. The tunes get stuck in your head and the lyrics are incredible. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Power and Melancholy","review":"This is the album of sheer power and melancholy. The standout track is Disintegration, for its incredible and annihilating hopelessness. The other tracks are moodily beautiful and remarkably accessible, occasionally verging on sentimentality. Only quibble - the Mixed Up version of Fascination Street is stronger, longer, tougher and better than the track here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, Great Condition","review":"I bought this album used and it was in great condition for a great price.Loved the album itself too, as I'm a major Cure fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER","review":"IF YOU'D HAD TO OWN ONLY ONE CD IN YOUR LIFE, THEN DISINTEGRATION IS THE ONE YOU SHOULD HAVE.BRILLIANT...ATMOSPHERIC...MELODIC...SENSITIVE...MUSIC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and melancholy","review":"I heard the Cure a few years ago. I had no idea who they were. About a year ago, I decided to buy one of their albums. I had read a review for 'Disintegraton' and bought that. When I got home, I listened to the entire thing, beginning to end. When I was through, I had smiled and cried.This album is poetry. Robert Smith is one of the greatest and most underrated singer/songwriters of our time. His voice is impossible to describe. There are some catchy singles on this album such as 'Love Song' and 'Pictures of You', but there are also some epic songs, like 'The Same Deep Water as You' and 'Disintegration' itself.Usually, I rate all the songs on the album from 1-10. Every song on this gets a 10. Every song is beautiful and worth it.If you are even remotely curious about hearing what The Cure have to offer, BUY THIS.It is worth 10 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misery loves company","review":"Disintegration is the CD I reached for in college when I couldn't fall asleep (that's a compliment!). Within 1 minute of hearing the opening track, I would feel myself floating away, riding the wave of Robert Smith's vocals and the ambient synth & guitars. Hearing this CD for the first time is like reading a poem that strikes you in the heart and stays with you for a very long time. Feeling miserable has never felt this good! You can completely immerse yourself in this CD. My favorite tracks are \\"Disintegration,\\" \\"Plainsong.,\\" and \\"Fascination Street.\\" The raw emotion and intensity of the song \\"Disintegration\\" is simultaneously heartbreaking and lovely. If you don't already own this CD, you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered 3-disc edition to be released in Spring 2010","review":"Just to let you know about this new remastered version out in Spring 2010: it will sound better than this one which was released 20 years ago.

All the way from 'Plainsong' to 'Untitled', this entire album is the definition of perfection, with highlights that include 'Same Deep Water As You' and 'Disintegration'. Robert Smith is an absolute genius. This is my first favorite Cure album, Pornography following shortly after. Pornography is completely filled with sorrow and pain. The feelings of suffocation in pure agony. However, Disintegration gave me feelings of both depression and hope. 'Same Water as Deep as You' can accompany a suicide and be very fitting for the occasion; whereas 'Fascination Street' seemed to be a little more optimistic. The whole cd is an epic masterpiece. Must have for anyone that even begins to claim to like music."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE FIRE!!!","review":"This has got to be my favorite from them, then kiss me kiss me kiss me.

There was one thing about this movie that prevented me from fully enjoying it, however, and it took me a while to pinpoint what is was. Surprisingly enough, it was Miss Day herself. She seems to be taking the dizzy blonde American character to an extreme here, and comes across as trying too hard (almost frenetic in the last half) throughout the entire film. Rod Taylor, on the other hand, appears as relaxed and effortless as ever. The chemistry the two demonstrate in The Glass Bottom Boat is sadly not in play here, and the movie suffers for it. Great Sixties fashion and snappy dialogue still need well-rounded characters to provide that special interplay that can draw in repeat viewers. Only for hard-core Day or Taylor fans, although perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon while flipping through magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of Film","review":"There is little positive to say about this bad script, miscasting of actors and poor acting in general.

At points it feels like he was getting paid by the numbers of pages he wrote, and, he figured that since he is the author of the highly popular \\"Enders Game\\" he has the license to subject his readers (listeners) to his views on Mormonism, while, ironically enough, MIScharacterizing non-Mormon \\"religion\\".This is the first time I've understood when people have said that characters in books can be caricatures rather than characters. The people in this book are most definitely caricatures. Real people do not act as melodramatic and over the top as his characters do.I 100% agree with previous poster about it being especially difficult to LISTEN to this book. I got to the point where I simply skipped whole chapters and found out I hadn't missed anything.Very Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product - Not so Good Vendor","review":"Using this product to cover wood project.

Having read the 'handbooks' some of the passages are drawn from, I think there is more out there. Likewise I think there is more evidence for how gladiators lived and were viewed/treated by freepeople that could shed further light on the causes and reactions to the three biggest slave wars in Rome's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"has not arrived","review":"I have not recieved this book it was to arrive with the book Earth. the arrival time has not yet expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"you know, this girl is talented","review":"How can this woman NOT be experiencing the same success as mariah??? her range is higher and more accurate than 'miss M. i love her vocal tone. she should be massive. i first saw her backing Luther and was totally gobsmacked. i love this album. if one listens to it twice the first time, i guarentee you will be humming at least one melody!!!just don't try the high notes...leave that to LISA...she's got it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Fischer SO INTENSE","review":"I loved Lisa Fischer when she sang background for Luther Vandross, and I loved her first and only solo album!

I could even walk through a truck stop parking lot with several trucks running, but the other party heard nothing. The headset is absolutely awesome, but the windscreen helps greatly!

However listening to this album one can hear it is possible for a highly trained classical musician such as Tejendra Majumdar to be able to play with a non classical or folk musician like Shujjhat. An intresting duet would be Tejendra Majumdar and Ustad Shahid Pervez Khan Saheb (According to the times of india one of the greatest living sitarist) here Tejendra would be able to unfold his true abilities.I reccomend this album because the sarode is just superb"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"This book is a reprint of the 1913 edition published by Cosmopolitan Magazine.

If you are truly interested in reading English translations about Sikh Scripture, there are much more accurate books available about the Sikh Scriptures.

Like most poor souls who will buy this book I was a teenaged fan of Shep 40+ years ago. Shep deserves more than this hack \\"cut and paste\\" job. It's a compulation of easily available previously published material and long quotes from Shep's shows that anyone can get on the web. The author's personal opinions are totaly lacking in insight and add nothing. The author has unearthed absolutely no original information about Shep's career, marrages, Army days or education.

The writing is genuinely awful, with all the personality of a washing machine's instruction booklet. Even worse, the author repeats his not-terribly-insightful insights over and over again: I literally lost count of the number of times he professed to be shocked, SHOCKED!, that perhaps not everything in Jean's monologues was strictly 100% true. It's like he doesn't even understand what storytelling is. It would almost sort of be worth it to read the transcriptions of Shep's radio monologues, but since literally hundreds of hours of same are available online for free, it's not even worth that. Skip this, download the podcasts, buy Shep's own books, and hope that someday someone will do the job right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is about some cranky old bore, not Jean Shepherd.","review":"I bought this book hoping the author would get to the heart of Jean's unique philosophy and discuss Jean's opinions and wry humor. Instead I got some sketchy details of superficial themes often slanted towards a portrayal of Jean's alleged bitter side without any details on how or why it came to be. Considering Jean made a career on broadcasting offbeat ideas, I was very disappointed with the authors choice of banal topics, e.g. Jean disliked commercials, Jean didn't get along with some of his coworkers.... yawn.I'm not sure what this book was supposed to be, but it was not a biography, not philosophy, not anthology. Whatever it was, it wasn't an enjoyable read, and not one that gave me any deeper insight to Jean Shepherd.

Bergmann does a fine job of explaining why Shep's fans are so loyal; what were Shep's best contributions to radio, TV, film, literature, and stage; and does this while making us aware of Shep's enigmatic less-than-perfect personal life. This latter subject, however, does not detract from portraying the man as an overall likeable character or significant artist. A great read for anyone, whether familiar with Jean Shepherd's work or not. Thank you Eugene Bergmann!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine work","review":"Jean Shepherd was an inspiration to me as a teenager which carried over into my career as a writer.

True, most of her songs deal with the same subjects, but you can at least depend on her music to deliver thought-provoking views to such serious topics as racism, injustice, freedom and much more. The booklet accompanying the CD contains the words to the songs. \\"Freedom Now\\", a song she has dedicated to Nelson Mandela, really stands out as one of the CD's main focal songs. The CD ends with a slower melody, \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\", causing reflection on materialism, truth, and life. The second stanza reads: Don't be tempted by the shiny apple/Don't you eat of a bitter fruit/Hunger only for a taste of justice/Hunger only for a world of truth/'Cause all that you have is your soul. In this CD, Tracy Chapman delivers her songs with a piece of her soul in each song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Racist and Political","review":"Enjoyed her first album. So I bought this one thinking it would be good as well. But, she's taken a bite out of the Racist/Political pie. Most of the songs take swipes at White Men and Conservative viewpoints. Same thing happened to Iris Dement when she compromised her style for her political viewpoints....She bombed. This is a stinker except for a select few including \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Looks like I'm in the minority on this one, but I'll say my piece anyway.Crossroads, the title track, is why I bought this CD. I heard it on the radio and decided right away I'd have to own it.I should have bought the MP3 track and saved myself the trouble of downloading the entire CD onto my computer. I deleted every one of the other tracks after listening to them. My reasons:A) Tracks 2-9 all sound the same, and none of them sounds anything like the title track. Not even a little.B) They're badly mixed, with the volume difference between voice and music hugely out of balance. If you turn it up loudly enough to hear the music, the voice is overpowering. If you turn it down low enough to be able to enjoy Tracy's incredible voice, you can barely hear the music.C) Along the same line as 'B', the music in 2-9 is minimal, barely audible acoustic guitar with little to no accompaniment.Very disappointed. Still glad I have track one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"emancipation","review":"This is an excellent CD. I have all of Tracy Chapman's music on old tapes and now I have them in a digital format.

I love this lip balm, it does not sit on top (you actually feel your lips moisturized) and it lasts a long time. I also tried Jack Black and found the scents were too strong, it sat on top, and was a bit sticky.

Sam leaps into a detective who is investigating a pretty gruesome murder. He may well me next on the murderer's hit list and the only ones who can help him are the victim's catatonic son and her husband's psychiatrist. To make things even more interesting, Sam is experiencing horrible flashbacks. Written by Deborah Pratt (who also wrote \\"Shock Theater\\" for the series), \\"Dreams\\" has guest stars Jocelyn O'Brien, Alan Scarfe and Bill Marcus. Certainly an interesting choice for inclusion in the video collection, which is a nice way of saying there are other episodes I would have selected first (the Lee Harvey Oswald ones being my first choice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow what a ugly pose!","review":"Well i do like a new pose from mcfarlane but wow this pose is ugly.

Just that this pose looks bad for the colors or something. When you get it in person you will agree. Looks even worse opened & posed. This is why this one is one of the leftover ones last to be sold out when it first came out. It is not even good for a custom. I just hope mcfarlane scrapes this pose.

As we watched it the students were rolling in the floor laughing at this clown. Steve Finger had to keep him on task. Cameron Weber is a classic example of someone who might be very smart but is a horrible presenter of information. The video has comedic value, but has the educational value at around zero. In terms of \\"supply and demand,\\" I hope you don't have a big supply of this DVD. I will be selling mine soon.William L. Wilson, High School Economics Teacher"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great primer for kids on economics","review":"I watched this with my nine year old who was learning the fundamentals of economics in his third grade class. While Mr. Weber certainly seems less than totally at ease on camera, the information presented was clear and easy to understand, at least to a third grader. Having seen the video, I purchased Mr. Weber's book, \\"Economics for Everyone\\" which, while it did not displace Harry Potter as one of my kid's favorite books, did engage him sufficiently so that we were able to have a coherent conversation on economic issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good tool in language learning","review":"First of all, the use of the word \\"t��picos,\\" which in Spanish is more commonly used to mean clich��s, makes me feel uneasy about the validity of this book.

There are many problems to work and they are presented in various formats. However, there isn't much explanation for new concepts, so this is left up to a parent or teacher to explain.

At first, I was disappointed by the \\"slick\\" pages that don't hold pencil well. It doesn't matter how hard you push on the pencil, you still can't see the writing very well. Erasing, even with a good quality eraser, is impossible and just leaves smudges. I was going to use this (along with manipulatives) for our main math curriculum, but there was next to no instruction and I found it to be a little too fast moving.

There were worksheets for the 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's and 10's. I was quite surprised and felt that rendered this book incomplete.

I recommend you set a clock for your child and let him experience the real test feeling and get rid of procrastination.

It consists of short, just the facts ma'am, listings with all the basic data, e.g., name, address, name of the contact person(s), listing of recent sales, whether or not you'll get hit up for a fee, etc. This book's big weakness is, not surprisingly, that its compilers take the agents' side rather than the writers' side, which means that the info tends to be very bland. Another big weakness is that many prominent agencies (e.g., The Wylie Agency, the Endeavor Agency, and a number of others) are not listed at all, because they asked to be left out, in order to minimize the number of incoming submissions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money, if you need a pipe drafting book...","review":"This book is clear, easy to read and well laid out. It does an excellent job of introducing pipe drafting to a person with a general drafting background. However, very little of the book has anything to do with the 'how' of piping design. All it does is explain in simple, concise terms why the items in a piping facitily are put together the way they are. In summary, if you looking for a good book on piping drafting, look no further. If, on the other hand, your focus is piping design, then you need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasing To Look At - But Just An Advert For Pro-Pipe","review":"At first glance this book seems impressive - good illustrations, easy to read and seemingly well organised.

I bought this in 89 on vinyl, then I bought a cassette for the car and then later I bought the CD because I needed it. This CD encapsulates perfect pop for me. It's very abrasive and if your brain is simple it sounds ugly but if you listen hard you can hear catchy I-wish-I-wrote-that hooks beneath the noise. It's like abstract art: under the layers of muddy oil you will see the beauty. I only wish I had purchased many Pixies t-shirts back then as I would still wear them. See Frank if he passes through your town. He occasionally rips through a Pixie tune or two and it brings tears to my thirtysomething eyes. Death to the Pixies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of All Time","review":"This was my FAVORITE album in the early 1990's and 9 years later, it is just as awe-inspiring as the first day I heard it. This is the Pixies at their best. Though it's not as rockin' as their earlier stuff, it's moody balance of pop-ish tunes and darker songs (such as \\"Tame\\", and \\"Silver\\") is both enigmatic and evocative. Definately one of the best albums EVER produced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a classic.","review":"This album is a classic. The pixies changed musicians view of music forever. They have inspired many modern day bands. This is the most famous of their albums, mostly because it contains the popular \\"here comes your man\\". If you have never heard the pixies before, you will be very surprised. They are incredibly unique and seem to be able to create the most amazing sounds which will make you go \\"I didnt know a guitair could do that\\".Their is a strong punk influence here as well as some other strong 70s influences, like David Bowie. 15 years after it's original release and it still sounds fresh, if you like grunge, you'll probably like the pixies, they were a sort of \\"pre-grunge\\" band.The pixies was the high point in both black francis' (now frank black) and kim deal's (of the breeders) career and neither have them has since topped it and probably never will. If you are a fan of the breeders or frank black, you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock perfection","review":"Doolittle is the perfect combination of Black Francis' misanthropic attitude, compelling songwriting, and pure rock playing. The songs are direct, mostly brutal, but played without a wrong note. The great songs (Here Comes Your Man, Debaser, Wave of Mutilation, No 13 Baby, Hey) more than offset the weaker ones (There Goes My Gun, I Bleed, Silver). The emotion in Black Francis' voice and in the Pixies' playing on Hey and No 13 Baby show they found a new way to play the blues. They plugged a cord right into their souls and that's what came out of the amplifiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! A MASTERPIECE!","review":"Stated simply this is a great album.

The first time I heard the Pixies I fell in love. This album is probably thier most mainstream, but it is no doubt a must have. SOme of my favorite songs are \\"Hey,\\" \\"Tame,\\" and \\"NO.13 Baby.\\" If you like this CD I def. suggest buying Surfer Rosa, Come on Pilgrim, and Trompe le Monde."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS?","review":"If you are a Pixies fan and don't give this album Five stars you obvious should be killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey. This album is pure genuis. From the cool guitar in 'debaser' and Blacks screeching voice in 'Tame' The poppiness of 'Here comes your man' The simpleness of 'La la love you' It is all just classic. My personal fav Pixies disc, and it is hard to pick because Suferosa has it's moments. If you like bands like Nirvana, The Toadies, Local H, you may not know it, but you like the Pixies as well. Every now a then I'll be listening to this album, and catch Cobain stealing styles. For example listen to almost any song of the second side of 'Incesticide' and you'll find Pixies influence, big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the greatest rock album, ever!","review":"Anything recorded by the Pixies is essential listening and this album is the epitome of their art. Doolittle captures them at their artistic peak. Every song on this album is a classic. After listening to the album for hundreds of times over the past 16 years, I still get chills down my back when I hear songs like \\"Tame\\", \\"Dead\\", and \\"Gouge Away\\". Aside from Nirvana's Nevermind and the first Velvet Underground album, I'm hard pressed to think of any other album that comes even close in terms of originality, excitement, and sheer greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will change your life","review":"Buy this album, put the stereo on as loud as it will go and stick your head in the speaker - it will blow you away! I'll never be the same after buying this album. 'Debaser' will vie with 'Smells like teen spirit' as THE song of the 90's....... Absolutely BRILLIANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the best","review":"the pixies are my all time favorite band, and out of their albums, this is the greatest. if you have never heard them before, start here. you won't regret it. although my fave song isn't on here (isla de encanta), debaser, broken face, and, of course, gigantic are all songs worthy of listening to repeatedly. so, check out the pixies. they rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Looping rhythms, crazed singing, great melodies, and songs, intelligent and odd lyrics... quite simply one of the most perfect rock albums ever made. It's up there with Revolver by the Beatles or Who's Next. If you can own only one Pixies album this is the one to get baby. Name another band who's written a song (Debaser) about Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's movie Andalusian Dog. I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely crafted gem of pop-rock songsmanship","review":"This album is, from beginning to end, a finely crafted work. A collection of songs which have been wrought in the classic power pop style, but with far more of the indy-rock/post-punk attitude that helped the Pixies make a name for themselves. If you don't own this album, buy it. If you don't like this album, give up on rock-and-roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"go out and live","review":"I know that radio sucks... and that a lot of radio bands these days claim there roots in Pixies and Pixies inspired (Nirvana) music. But like the aformentioned; these guys are great despite that. So what if Everclear, Bush, and Harvey Danger borrow these sonics and destroy the dream in the process.... so what. This is one of the best and most consistent records ever. Every track is well written and as a whole the album is incredibly diverse. The whole time they manage to have FUN and shout the joy of god into these wonderful toons. Timeless... in the same way Murmur by REM is. Bits of ancient myths and biblical messages all over. Husker Du meets Brian Wilson and gives him a hand job. Get this and understand the \\"pop secret\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I tell ya, no better album has come out since Doolittle. No band has been better than the Pixies. Rock me, Joe. The Pixies are more pop-ish than people think. No. 13 Baby (my favorite song here) has a chorus that people could dance to in beer commercials It's just that the general pop crowd wouldn't appreciate it. So they've become somewhat of a huge cult band, and like Velvet Underground, only the hip know about them (though I've never met a person that didn't particularly like either band). There's no filler here. Every song was handled with care and sprinkled with genius. Silver is the only song I don't like on this, but it's unique and such. If you haven't heard the Pixies... man, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe so few people know about the Pixies.","review":"But at the same time I'm kind of glad that so few people know about the Pixies. No, forget that. I know I listened to crap before I found out what good music was. Sometimes I need to warm up to a band a little, but with the Pixies it was love from the beginning. This is my favorite Pixies album, I think. But Wave of mutilation is a good CD if you want to listen to your favorite Pixies songs. I don't care what people say about best of albums. They are convenient. Seriously though, awesome CD. You can call them Post-Punk, but I'm always gonna think Punk Rock when I think the Pixies. I never really understood that label. Didn't know Punk was a period of time. Also, I don't you you should review things you don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"... why'd you silence kim?","review":"Beautiful, that's the only way to describe this.Less upbeat than Surfer or Bossanova. Hey is amazing, but kim makes the record. The production is pretty, pastel shades rather than surfers' clear black and white, bossa's shimmering colours, and trompe's polarized gleaminess, but, unfortunately dave's drums sound false, he's one of the best drummers in the world, why make him sound like an EMU-drumulator? That's my only complaint.Or for those who haven't heard the pixies, they're:Far better than nirvana, or any imitators, the pixies trick was the 'soft start, loud chorus' stolen from 'petty theif lout' by the fall. the pixies are sort of like a slower, generally less [good] husker du. only better than the husker.p.s. buy all pixies LP's and about 15-20 of the fall's ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The postcard you wish you could send...","review":"Diane Gessler has written (and painted) the perfect travelogue of her trip through California. It won't serve well as a guide book, even with the maps included, but her watercolors and anecdotes capture perfectly the mood and the spirit of the places she and her husband have visited. If you have been to California, this should make a much nicer souvenir than the standard-issue t-shirt with the cable car picture, and if you live here, it's the perfect reminder why one might be willing to endure the rolling black-outs or the excessive housing costs. Aside from that, the watercolor illustrations are very, very nice and made me think of taking out again my own watercolor set.

It will be welcomed by all who want a scholarly, balanced and clear introduction to the difficult topic of the Hebrew Bible. In over 600 pages the Hebrew Bible is discussed, based on solid research. However Professor Collins does not get bogged down excessively with erudite \\"on the other hands\\", which might confuse excessively.Professor Collins skill as a teacher in Yale comes through clearly, as he covers such an amount of material with expertise and knowledge.This book fulfills a real need for educated, interested readers who wish to gain an insight into the Hebrew Bible, which underlies our civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude and Shortsighted","review":"Collins' book is a shortsighted and often rude introduction to the Old Testament and its corresponding history of interpretations. Collins treats his modern vantage point with such arrogance that it is simply embarassing to read him dismiss the OT as 'legendary and folkloristic' without providing evidence for such claims. Certainly there is better scholarship out there, if at least more humble. Teachers and students can do much better.At the time of this writing I am a Princeton Theological Seminary student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, unusable CD-ROM","review":"The text is a superb overview of the Hebrew bible, appropriate for an undergraduate course, personal reading, or an introductory graduate course.Lamentably for an era of inclusiveness, the accompanying CD-ROM is Windows-only.

The Skywalker Symphony Orchestra compliments Linda's style very well, however David Campbell's arrangements are a little heavy-handed and overly dramatic when compared to Nelson Riddle's earlier work with Linda. But, all in all, this is a fine addition to Linda's discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest voices of the 20th Century","review":"Linda Ronstadt's work on \\"Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind\\" confirms the fact that she has one of the greatest female singing voices of the 20th Century. \\"Shattered\\" is quite possibly the most beautiful ballad I have ever heard and is perfectly executed by Ronstadt in every respect. The sweeping symphonic arrangements add to the overall dramatic impact and power of the songs and her vocals. Aaron Neville's voice is adequate although sometimes unfortunately an irritant (he has never been one of my favorite male vocalists). Ronstadt's work deserves merit and attention, however, and is well worth the purchase price of this beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Center Stage","review":"Even from its well-executed art direction of the album package design, \\"Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind\\" deserves center stage. With 12 sumptuous tracks featuring a full orchestra and, at times, a massive choir, all recorded in George Lucas' state-of-the-art Skywalker Ranch, this is how an album ought to be made. Linda Ronstadt's voice is often at a zenith here. Ably abetted by the Tower Of Power Horns and the spine-tingling falsetto of the ever awesome Aaron Neville, all the songs are infused with a breathtaking quality that greatly compliments their original covers. The duets Don't Know Much and All My Life are so good, they practically have Grammy Awards written all over them. For lovers of gentler and kinder music, this one is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time around","review":"I literally wore out this cassette after years of listening enjoyment. Had to get a new CD and will continue to enjoy this wonderful mix of powerful vocalization, choral and instrumental orchestration, and soulful ballads.

If you're new to PM5K and like the more hard rock type music, my best bet would be to get either \\"Transform\\" or \\"Tonight The Stars Revolt!\\" My favorite song off this CD has got to be either \\"Free\\" \\"Top Of The World\\" or \\"Hey, That's Right!\\" If I'm not listening to this CD, I'm listening to Blindside.

I was a huge fan of TTSR. I was devastated when they pulled AFD from the shelves the day before it's release. There's no simple way to put this....this cd BLOWS. These songs lack energy, intsensity, and creativity. I don't know what the band was thinking...but if this was the direction Spider wanted to go, then I can totally understand why the 2 other members bailed. First off, this cd is NOT metal...not even close. It's pop rock at best.If I can stress one thing...SAVE YOUR MONEY. Download three tracks and that'll be all it takes for you to understand what I am saying. I cannot understand how other people have given this four or even five stars. It must show their musical tastes. There should be a NO - Star rating...and this album CERTAINLY would've achieved it.I feel betrayed. As a fan of the sci-fi...and the pounding riffs and space imagery of TTSR...even accepting a \\"transform\\"ation...this CD [is bad]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I'm sad that PM5K has changed. The album that was supposed to come out before the line-up change was supposed to include the single Bombshell. In fact I have heard many of the songs that were supposed to be released but never did because of the line-up change. Although Free is a great track, probably the best one on here, the album just feels like its lacking something. The industrial edge that PM5K is known for. Overall this album really isn't that bad, and I'm sure that alot of you are going to like it. I recommend you listen to the samples or ask your local record store to let you listen to it first before you buy it. It's definently different. I'm biased because I was looking forward to the release that we will never see. This probably would have been a good follow up to that album.

This cd is a huge disappointment. Powerman 5000 was one of my favourite bands because of their unique brand of metal with a space and electronic atmosphere. \\"Transform\\" sounds similar to a Smashmouth cd, which needless to say [is bad]. If you were a big fan of PM5K after \\"Tonight the Stars Revolt\\" skip this album and hopefully PM5K will revert or \\"Transform\\" back to the way they were for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellouts","review":"I loved PM5K's way of rocking the house. Their hard beats and techno grooves set the vibe for a really great record.After hearing Bombshell i couldn't wait for Anyone for Doomsday to hit...but when they recalled it and made a totally new CD, i wasn't too skeptical..though i should have been.PM5K dropped their hard beats and techno riffs, lost the space man idea and went mainstream like most bands do.Download a few songs before you buy this album...i waisted 12 bucks on it...dont do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming From a Huge Fan of TTSR and AFD","review":"This album surprised me. I was pretty much expecting to dislike it, mainly from many negative reviews from fans of TTSR and AFD era of PMK5. I can see why you wouldn't like it if you're expecting the album to sound like that, but nevertheless, it's still a good album. I'm going to keep this a relatively short review, since their's already lengthy reviews analyzing every song on the album. The stand-out songs to me are: \\"Theme To A Fake Revolution, Shape of Things To Come, Hey, That's Right! That's Entertainment,& Stereotype. Spider-One actually uses some of the lyrics from the \\"Anyone For Doomsday\\" album on \\"Transform\\" It's actually pretty cool.Anyways, I guess if you go into this album expecting Tonight The Stars Revolt/Anyone For Doomsday-esque album, you'll be a little disappointed. I recommend at least listening to \\"Shape of Things To Come\\" it retains that sound that would be on TTSR/AFD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"I wasn't expecting that much from this cd. WEll, as usual, not expecting much= great cd. This is awesome. It's better than both of their other two, seeing as how theyr not acting stupid anymore and pretending they are alien freaks (even though that was kinda cool and set them apart.) Is it just me, or does Spider 1 look alot like Billy Idol? The only thing bad about this cd are the zombie-esque \\"hey yeah's\\", \\"come on's\\", and, of course, \\"Let's go!\\". They add a little bit to the music but they are amazingly cliche. the guitar work is nothing short of amazing. go buy this right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerman 5000's Transform Will Knock you Off Your Feet!!!","review":"I originally bought and adored their previous album, I still listen to it constantly...

If this album was by anyone else I would give it another star or 2 but I hold a higher standard for PM5K. They used to have a truly unique sound, but this cd sounds exactly like every other wannabe rock album in the past few years. I hope Powerman goes back to their old ways for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change","review":"I think that Transform is one of the best PM5K ever, but it doesnt beat Tonight The Stars Revolt. The promoting track \\"Free\\" is the best PM5K track ever released. My favorite tracks on the album are Free, Transform, Thats Entertainment, A is for Apathy, Theme to a Fake Revolution, and Song about Nuthin'. I did like the Spaceman music a lil' bit better, but in the music business change is always necissary and I like this change."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTICO!","review":"This is Flamenco at its best. The Gipsy Kings(known as Los Reyes in Spain, and are actually French) are such masters at capturing all the beauty and angst the tradition of Flamenco has to offer. Nicolas Reyes' voice is so unique and powerful and the Baliardos brothers are guitar virtuosos. Some of my favorites include: \\"Caminando Por La Calle,\\" one of my favorites of all time, \\"Viento Del Arena,\\" with a real Gypsy feel to it, and the emotionally charged \\"Trista Pena,\\" which still brings tears to mis ojos.

The movie \\"The Insider\\" only touchs on all of the secrets and manuevering that surrounded the issue.Dr. Kessler discusses it all. And, we learn along with him as he walks the reader through what he had to uncover. I think he is very fair in presenting his involvement in the investigation without skewing the truth as he knew it.While you may not agree with every conclusion Dr. Kessler reached, this book is a fantastic glimpse into a most-dramatic form of policy making and corporate cover-ups. The only criticism would be that at times the book provides so much detail it becomes a bit tedious. I encourage you to stick it out through these rare moments, though. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Odyssey through the Science and Politics of Tobacco","review":"David Kessler's book, A Question of Intent, is a gripping account of how the FDA chose to investigate the tobacco industry, ultimately exposing the industry's calculated intent to cover up the deadly and addictive nature of its product. The dedication of Kessler and his team is ingenious and inspiring. Each chapter leads the reader through a maze of investigation and discovery. The narrative is so engaging that it makes the reader want to stand up and cheer as more and more incriminating data is uncovered throught the efforts of this tireless FDA team.

Instead, the historical information is about what one would find in a typical encyclopedia article on Poland. The rest of the book consists introductions originally written for the three volumes of the trilogy in the Kuniczak translation, but no longer published with them, and some discussion on the history and problems of translating Sienkiewicz. These latter seem intended to glorify the Kuniczak translation, but I for one was not convinced by the examples provided. I read With Fire and Sword in the Curtin translation and The Deluge in the Kuniczak, and I was put off by the modernisms and obvious inserted connective material that appears in the latter.On the other hand, it was fun to read about how Sienkiewicz produced his work, and his relationship with his contemporary translators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhubarb Jam?","review":"I was very disappointed in this product.

It's not bad as a generic sort of jam, but, had I not know it was listed as rhubarb before I tasted it, I wouldn't have been able to guess.Admittedly, I don't have a great sense of taste, but I had some of my co-workers taste it, too, and none of them felt it was particularly rhubarb-y."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power-packed with the \\"RIGHT STUFF\\" to defeat the devil!","review":"Reading this book opened my eyes even more in recognizing the enemy and what he and his spirits try to do to the saints daily.

Shadows Fall is an amazing band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"I don't understand how bands get away with this. Every album sounds the same. War Within was a great album but this is so watered down. What happened? And some review said that Brian can sing well. Are you kidding me????? He is a below average singer and it works well with them. That's all. Not great. It is what it is. But this album is not good by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"This Album is just awesome! Plain and simple. Riffs are awesome, solos are insane, and Brian Fair's vocals keep getting better. It's nice to hear a band that grows and stays true to themselves too."},{"rating":"2","title":"AF OWns end of story","review":"This album is amazing. Redemption was the first track that caught my eye and personally I am happy that bought this album. This was one of the great albums that I have heard so far in the past year. It plays no stop in my Ipod. Final Call is my favorite Track. Shadows Fall owns!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows Fall Threads of Life = Testament Low = thrash crunch","review":"Shadows Fall Threads of Life has the same feel as Testament's epic 1994 album Low. Equal albums with the same impact which is great. Every song on Threads of Life is filled with great thrash crunch thats catchy. Being signed to Atlantic is a great sign for a band that deserves the recognition. The album starts off with Redemption and from that point its just rocks out...Brian Fair vocals take off.. sings very well and with a nice mix that sounds exactly like Chuck Billy which so awesome. Love this cd... the only song ithink that is ok is Failure of the Devout...not bad just ok...every song on here is an easy 5 out of 5. The ballad on here...Another Hero Lost...is a great one and is a classic in the making as Threads of Life is as a whole. Redemption, Burning The Lives,Storm Winds,Final Call, and all the rest make this album awesome...strongly recommended \\\\m/!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They got Godsmack disease, same riffs, same melodys","review":"ZERO inspiration here. I kinda liked their last album a little but the guitar players (while technicaly sound) rehash the same riffs and pinch harmonics over and over and offer NOTHING new. the vocals and the same thing. Listen to the last album and you will here the same thing especially redemption which seems to be their favorite chord progression!To date they have pushed 59 thousand copies. There's no way a major label is going to put up with this. bye bye shadows fall, your not even close to All That Remains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"Threads of Life is really disappointing. Shadows Fall once showed great promise. What happened? We get the same guitar riffs, same song set up and same bad vocals. Brian Fair has to be one of the worst and most predictable singers out there. Anyone who has seen them live (like me) can tell you that. Guitar work is good but we've all heard this before. Nothing new or innovative. Some solid but predicatable drum work. Do they have a bass player? Metalcore is on its way out.Stick with \\"Art of Balance\\" or \\"The War Within\\". Or save your money and buy the new CD from Machine Head or Dark Tranquility.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Support our Dying breed of metal","review":"While this album fails to deliver that \\"special feeling\\" that 'The Art of Balance' or 'The War Within' did when I was first introduced to Shadows Fall, I still feel that all metalcore fans should support these bands that have been keeping it Real. Most of these bands make crap for money and they work their a$$es off trying to satisfy critic fans (like some of the reviewers here) only to be thanked with poor reviews and NO sales. Don't like the music? Piss off! It's better than Justin Beaver and I'm glad to shell out my 10 measly dollars to keep bands like this alive......Amen to that.Shadows Fall you're hardcore!!! Keep up the good work guys! Looking forward to seein you guys in Texas!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album (Why the Hate?)","review":"I know this album has been out for quite some time now but I was curiously looking through albums I've purchased over my years and checking their reviews and noticed a lot of bad reviews for this album. Frankly, I was suprised. I thought this album was an excellent album with solid harmonies and great vocal work. Granted, it was a some-what generic turn for SF in sound, but I actually quite enjoyed it. Personally, I think 'Final Call' is my favorite SF song of all time. Something about the chorus just hits home with me.Anyway, I would give this album a 4.5 star. Overall a very good release from SF. They definately didn't break any boundaries or create some huge masterpiece but I thought it was a good release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price !","review":"Just picked up my unit before Thanksgiving.

I've set up to record the WUSA womens' soccer games for the rest of the season, all-inclusive.I can see why these DVR's have seemed to drop off the Websites (sales locations) rather precipitously lately - they are incredibly handy to have, esp. for the inveterate couch potato!!This setup does all it's promised to do, and I had no installation or programming problems. 5 Stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ILoveItAndYouGottaGetItNOOOOOOOOOOW","review":"The combination of TiVo and DirecTV is awesome. Before I tried it I was skeptical about TiVo and whether it was really as good as the media hype. I was dead wrong. It is fantastic and is a great advance in the ease of use and convenience of Television. It's so good that I'd recommend TiVo even if all you have is an over the air antenna. It is that good. But the real benefits come with the combination of the high quality audio and video of DirecTV with TiVo. This Phillips unit was easy to setup and combines DirecTV and TiVo very nicely. My advice is to get it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Features","review":"This product does not let you watch or record local channels that are on an antenna.

Now I have to exchange it for a new one. That cost me $25 to do so (shipping). I just wish I read the online reviews before committing to this Tivo Receiver. I wouldn't be suprised if my new one does the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth about TiVo","review":"This is an amazing product. I bought this because it came with a $100 mail-in rebate which made this very appealing to me. There are a few errors made by other reviewers that I think should be corrected. The first being that there is a \\"go back\\" button, called \\"jump\\" on the remote. Also, at the end of Summer 2001, this model is going to have the capability of digitally recording 2 channels at the same time. This feature is already on Ultimate TV, and will soon be on this TiVo as well. Once that happens, TiVo will be 10 times better than Ultimate TV. Make sure you buy this TiVo now and take advantage of the $100 mail-in rebate, and then you can be a happy TiVo owner like myself. One-Click this product now, and laugh at Ultimate TV. You don't know how helpful TiVo is until you buy one yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware Tivo lifetime service subscription","review":"I purchased a DSR6000R to replace my older 30 hour standalone Philips Tivo that failed after about twenty months of use (it was somewhat flakey over the last few months and then completely died). I had purchased a lifetime subscription from Tivo and fully expected to be able to transfer it over to the new receiver. I was informed that this was not possible and that I would have to return the original Tivo to Philips for service or replacement. As I had thrown away the old one, this was impossible, but they still would not allow me to switch over my subscription. In retrospect, I presume they expect most of their lifetime subscriptions to expire with the original equipment. Decided to return my new Tivo and try UltimateTV instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"When they work, they're great!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I love the Tivo DVR's, the functionality is fantastic.However, I have owned two DSR6000R machines for about 18 months and have had reliability problems with both. One has just failed, it resets itself every 10 minutes or so. The second one has never worked satisfactorily and been replaced under warranty by Philips with a refurbished machine which loops endlessly through the power up cycle.When they work they are really great, but I really question the reliability of these Philips machines based on my experience and suggest you look at other models. Hope you have better luck than I have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"The price may be great...but after 8 months I screwed up. The hard disk in the machine totally shut down. No option but to send it back to Philips...or buy a new one. I should have known I would have probs as I probably had to reset the machine 3-5 times a month. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"** Unsatisfied Customer **","review":"I purchased this product, and although I love the concept the TIVO has to offer I personally have had problems with bad reception! I have been on the phone with tech support, with level2 tech support, and I have gone through the returning and recieving of three different units. I have changed the cables and the connectors, I hooked up our old sat dish reciever and had no problem with reception, The last tech said \\" It has to be something in the environment,try an in line amp.!\\"We did thatand still bad reception. All I want at this point is to return the unit and get my money back since NO ONE can seem to help me.I don't know where to go from here, I was told I can't return it for a refund it's too late, so are you gonna tell me I'm stuck with a unit I can't use?! I really hope not. I would appreciateany guidance you can give me. Maybe even credit toward another brand. We have been messing with this problem for the last 3 months.ThankyouSheri Cleary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tivo is obtrusive and a waste","review":"Tivo is a pain in the a**. If you want someone picking shows for you, get it. Personally, I don't like shows like MacGyver or In the Heat of the Night, programs that it has been recording at random. I finally turned that feature off. My guess is that its reporting back what our viewing habits are by random sampling.The lifetime service agreement is pretty pricey when you consider that it only applies to the life of the receiver. Do you plan on getting HDTV in the future? [...]DirecTv HDTV tuner.Its a shame they don't make an integrated PVR that doesn't require a service agreement that bleeds you like Tivo or Microsoft does.

The same tuning problems are coming back. I have FOUR other DirecTV tuners in my house and they have zero problems. The same tuners work superbly in the location of the DSR6000.

This is my second - and last - bad experience with Philips. I will never buy a Philips again and I highly recommend you avoid them also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Get Tivo! Must!","review":"I'm not a huge TV watcher, but a friend was so big on this that I decided to get it when I installed a new DIRECTV system. Tivo is an absolute must-have that totally changes the way you watch TV. I'd give up color before I'd go back to TV without Tivo. One practical bit of advice -- only get it with a unified receiver, not a standalone which limits flexibility. You will see twice as much of what you like to watch without adding any time in front of the TV (although you may well spend more time and see even more). This is not a glorified VCR; it is a life-changer. My editorial can't do justice; visit a friend who has it or just trust me and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing rocks!","review":"Before I bought this I read people's reviews and thought, \\"yeah, right, like it's really that good.\\" Well, surprise...it really IS that good and then some. TiVo changes the whole TV paradigm. No more sitting down and thinking, \\"gee, I hope something's on\\" and channel surfing for an hour and walking away depressed. Now we sit down with TV and there's a ton of programs recorded and waiting to watch, more than we can possibly get to. We keep finding more and more things that we like about TiVo, more ways to search for programming that we like, and the TiVo suggestions are getting more accurate, even though we have eclectic tastes. The picture and sound quality are much better than our previous DTV receiver (Sony).Overall, TiVo tames the TV beast, especially the TV beast that having 200 satellite channels can be. Only drawback; I'm watch way more TV than I used to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great mudvayne album","review":"Let me start off by saying this is quite a change for Mudvayne and I know many fans of LD50 will be disappointed. I personally prefered The End Of All Things To Come over both LD50 and this one but anyway this CD took awhile to grow on me... unlike the last. It's quite a bit softer and shows a more \\"mainstream\\" side of mudvayne. I am slightly disappointed in this album but i think that it's because I had too high expectations for it. There are some instant classics on here such as Determined,IMN, Pushing Through, Just and I even liked Happy? (many fans weren't impressed by this). Overall this shows a more melodic and softer side of Mudvayne but don't get me wrong there are still some incredibly heavy parts reminiscent of LD50. If you are a true Mudvayne fan check this out and if you're not check it out anyway you may like the change. Great effort and I hope they release many more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Why do people let this album down so much they were trying something new ok so get over it.

Edited versions should never have come into existence. If you dont like the cuss words, what makes you think you will like the rest of it. Besides, a big ole blank space in the middle of a song just ruins the feel of the song. It would be like listening to the radio, but without commercials.So what have we learnded. Mudvayne is a great band and you should buy their CDs, but edited versions of CDs are bad and should not be bought because it ruins the songs.Just listen to the radio if you dont want to hear cuss words, or look into a different band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment.......","review":"Very Important: Before you buy this album, make sure you listen to other songs besides \\"Happy?\\" and \\"Determined\\". I heard both of those songs and was pumped about this album months before it was actually out. I wish I just bought those two songs via mp3 for 99 cents each instead of paying 15 bucks for this garbage.I'm a metal fan, I love everything from Killswitch to Lamb of God to Slipknot. I simply can't relate to the lyrics to this album, (\\"Eeeny-Meeny, Minee, Mo,\\" anyone?) and Chads screams drown out the sludging, sloppy riffs that sound like nothing more than a super-heavy jam band. I swear that they only focused on those two songs I mentioned, then the rest of the crap they came up with on the spot and called it good. And the music industry wonders why people \\"steal\\" music. It's because who wants to pay 15 bucks for two decent songs and have the rest just complete garbage?Yes I'm in a bad mood, and you may be too if you jump like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mudvayne's back...","review":"With that said, Lost and Found is a vast improvement over the heavy-handed blunder known as The End of All Things to Come. Tracks like IMN, Pushing Through, and Determined are standouts, although there are some bland ones among the bunch (ex: TV Radio). My only main complaint with the album is that the bass is mixed WAY too low in the mix. On L.D. 50, it was right in your face and sounded great. Overall, it's a recommended purchase for those who were disapointed with their last release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found","review":"A great album. They do a little of everything in this album. Of course, you need to like metal, but every song is ok-great. Happy? is probably the best. I like the RainSunGone/Choices combo. They flow right into each other, and are each great songs. To truly understand what was going through the band's minds around recording time, pick up this month's Metal Edge mag. A great review with singer Chad Gray is in it. Lost and Found is great, dont let anyone tell you differently, don't listen to what mtv and the radio tell you to, listen to what truly you enjoy, and its probably Lost and Found by Mudvayne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help theres Mud in my viens!","review":"ok so this is the first mudvayne disc ive heard and im impressed. There heavy enough to be non mainstream but soft enough to listen to. Fav songs on this album are Happy? Forget to remember (sounds kinda wierd on the SAW 2 dvd though) Determined and Tv Radio.

I love screaming along with determined though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost... and never to be found again","review":"This isn't an album, this is an overpriced single. Happy? F*CK NO!!! I'm so glad that I didn't waste my money on this album, I heard it on myspace and was so disgusted that I haven't been able to bring myself to even listen to the brilliant LD50. Mudvayne had potential, they had potential to be a modern day metal band that made critics eat their words, a band that had the potential to be around for years to come and build a loyal fan base (like Metallica in the 80's). What the f*ck happened? This album has no heart, no passion, no balls. It sounds like they decided to re-do a bunch of the mediocre tracks from their last album and write 2 or 3 radio anthems... if that is the case, well done Mudvayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst mudvayne album","review":"this ablum is okay but it is too soft, the only song i like is Determined, the song Fall Into Sleep could be a song for Hurricane Katrina because it talks about dreams of disasters like Hurricanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell....","review":"This CD makes me sad. You can tell that chad, ryan, matt, and greg went with a different aproach on lost and found.

I don't know why I feel compelled to write a review on this album because I'm almost at a loss for words as to how bad it blows- maybe I feel obligated to warn Mudvayne fans from five years ago not to purchase this steaming pile of pop garbage. As bad as this album is, I still listen to L.D. 5.0 and the Beginning of all things to end, and both of these albums are phenomenal and I would highly recommend anyone who doesn't already own them to do so and leave this album on the shelf out of protest; I wouldn't even burn this thing- unless there's gasoline involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"With Teeth\\" of NIN, this is a major dissapointment","review":"I heard this album, tried to get into but just couldn't.

I mean, it to me lacks SO MUCH of what mudvayne was, where is the heavy and complex bass of Martinie? Where is the heaviness that made them good. I feel as though they just took a different direction on this album and strayed away from what was Mudvayne. Even dropped the makeup, which is cool, but still play the killer music that you used too play and still can play. You have to have a REAL open mind for this album, and I have an open mind, lol. And you have to be a die hard mudvayne fanatic to like this album.

While TEOATTC was technically sound, I never cared for it much, and was jittery when they announced this new album would be a return to their experimental, neo-progressive sound.If anything, this album is just Mudvayne fattening their wallets and equally fattening their chords. The ruthless complexity is completely gone, the lyrics are blatant and angsty, and the bass has been completely buried (although the bass lines on here aren't standout anyway...).Mudvayne may have removed their stage antics and image from the equation, but everything that would appeal to a devoted fan of their early sound has been trashed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with you people??","review":"Because of you bands like Inflames, Soilwork, Dark Tranquility, and NightRage will never get the praise they deserve and instead we get more albums by these clowns and their clones.

Lost and Found may not catch your attention like earlier efforts but the melodic metal is still all here, same style of vocals, everything ld50 had. I wouldn't compare it to their debut album but i would say it is right up to par. Do yourself a favor and go pick this one up, you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"This is my favorite album by the band. This is Mudvayne at their best. Every song is good, I definitely suggest checking this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost & Found","review":"This album is killer. The opening track is outstanding, can't stop listening to it. Sure, songs like \\"Happy, Forget To Remember\\" sound like radio type songs but the rest of the album does not. Hard hitting songs all around, every band changes it's course every once in awhile. We as fans and listeners have to adapt to the change. Mudvayne did in this album that and it worked in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"mudvayne was cool","review":"this cd sucks. saw them in concert in ventura a couple years ago. it was the loudest show i've heard. there was pain in my body. this new cd indicates to me that i will not see that show again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it's Mudvayne","review":"I have every Mudvayne album, because I keep hoping that they will stop having 2 or 3 good songs per CD and come out with a full good one, and this just proves the point once again. And I also find it amusing how they change their image after every alubm. First they are aliens or whatever, then they're some kinda Kiss look alike with face paint, and now they are Hardcore, but at ozzfest they're still pullin gimmicks with bleeding masks? I don't think they even know what kind of band they want to be but I wish they'd stop messing around and dedicate their time to msuic instead of a halloween costume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Straight UP AWESOME","review":"Ok I just got this cd and by far its one of the best cds i've heard in along time! I mean the first 3-5 songs get you pretty stoked and the rest of the songs on this cd just keep it going. There is some slow songs but it doesn't really affect the whole setup of the cd. Its pretty freakin awesome how unleashed they sound on this cd. However I still think L.D.50 is still there best I would say this cd is 2nd best of there 4 cds. I love Determined and Happy? and just all the songs are good. If your into heavy music then you need to check this cd out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing effort","review":"What can I say? There are few bands who only get better with each album. Mudvayne has taken an amazing step toward perfection. I cannot say much about this album, because it is too damn good. I won't bombarded people with a lengthy review, but give this album a listen. You will not be let down. If you do purchase, purchase the regular issue of the album. The DualDisc is just not worth the extra couple bucks for a few videos and a tad bit better quality sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"I was very suprised listening to the new Mudvayne..To tell you the truqth i did not expect much after hearing the first single. This is a really solid album, i'm very suprised about soem of the negative reviews. Most people seem to be comparing this album with the other 2 which is stupid. You gotta listen to any album and rate it indvidually. True this album is softer and probably will appeal to a wider audience than the last two..but i don't see anythign wrong with that. A band really shouldnt try to copy the style of past succesful albums, rather they should move foward and evoleve, and i think \\"lost and found\\" is a perfect example of a band matruing and evoloving its sound without sounding faked or forced..thanks..my favorite tracks are probably happy and forget to remember"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faceless NU-Metal","review":"These Nu-metal bands are face-less. There all alike, Korn, Linkin Park, Adema, Taproot, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot....

I love it.I find the picture exceptional for a 7\\" screen. Remember this is a kitchen set, it isn't made to be the primary tv in the house. I also have it mounted under a corner cabinet so fit was not an issue. I find it reliable and an efficientuse of the space."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 30 minutes the TV went black and never recovered","review":"After 30 minutes the TV went black and never recovered. Further the provider Sandadeals did not honor a return as they have a no return policy per Amazon. Makes it tough. Sony will only attempt a repair or give a refurbished unit. The downside when a product fails, its better to buy from Best Stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...untill it stops working!","review":"Installation was not difficult with the right angle coax connector. We would use this unit for approx. 10 or 15 mins in the morning. We were very pleased with it's performance untill one day we pressed th ON button and nothing happened. No clock, no radio, no CD player, no TV, no power. We have had this thing for 8 months. $200.00 for 8 months of service. That doesn't rate very high in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Unfortunately, Sony has stopped making this product. The TV function on my first one wouldn't transfer from the CD to TV (locked up and was apparently not repairable???), and I finally found another one on the internet as is the TV that I use most. The radio and CD player still play fine on the first unit. This under-counter TV has an EXCELLENT picture. It is in my kitchen, and I use it daily. No other under-counter unit had good reviews when I bought the first or second Sony. This product needs to be put back on the production line!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FM Poor Reception. \\"Weather\\" Not Available. Misrepresented. AM Antennae poor.","review":"This is a big, big disappointment. I needed to buy an extra Am antennae to get it to work OK, and the FM still doesn't work and I have another radio sitting right next to it on the same counter and FM is as clear as a bell. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the weather band station, or looking back on the description, it includes the word weather, but it specifically does not state \\"weather band\\" so maybe I am expecting too much. I have yet to find it to hear it.As for slim, I have since looked at others in some stores and it is bulkier than many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with the Sony","review":"So far so good with this product. I was surprised there was so little choice in this niche. Despite its great reputation I've had nothing but bad luck with Sony over the years. I was a little reluctant to buy this unit especially because the Polaroid was much less expensive, but I went ahead based on the other reviews given here.Yes, the unit is pretty big and wouldn't fit under most of my cabinets. Fortunately it fit in the spot I wanted to put it. It installed easily and worked as advertised. The AM reception is not very good, but otherwise I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"This particular machine fits nicely. Although the LCD display in on a small size but it meets the sporatic viewing some TV programs while chowing...The sound could be a little better since Mega Bass doesn't cut it. Still, Sony products is always a plus to have around home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to check the width of your cabinet before your purchase","review":"I found that my cabinet was a little small for the LCD-TV but was able to install with a few minor adjustments. You will also need to purchase an ell type adapter to attached to cable to the set. Overall the picture is great and the set works very well also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice unit for the kitchen","review":"The sound and picture quality is quite good.I give it only four stars because it has no battery backup for the clock, or radio presets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy","review":"I like the TV, the FM reception is good, and the TV is great. If you install cable make sure to use stereo not sap. Directions were easy and it takes little space from the counter. I'd buy it again; unfortunatley SONY has dicontinued this model, a mistake if you ask me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed when the machine would not fit! It was exactly the depth of the cabinet, which prevented us from being able to attach the cable to the back.

'Tattoo' is my favorite! I saw F.P. on this tour and it was obvious that they wouldn't be around forever, but at least they put some great tunes down while they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this an Aerosmith cover band?","review":"Well, on this album they could be. This time around, the production is slicker and the songs are quite forgettable. It seems that Mr. Downe has spent time between albums perfecting his Steven Tyler impression. The riffs and licks on this album sound largely like Aerosmith outtakes. Lyric-wise, cliches abound, and the sleaze sounds forced (for examples of both, see \\"Slip of the Tongue\\"). \\"House of Pain\\" is right up there on my list of \\"Worst Ballads of the '80s.\\" Mr. Downe's vocals just cannot handle a ballad and the lyrics are sappy and cliche-ridden. I had bought this album, hoping for some genuine sleaze-rock, but was disappointed.Don't get me wrong, it does rock (occasionally), but in an \\"I've heard that 1,000 times before\\" kind of way. If you just find yourself unable to live without a Faster Pussycat album, pick up the self-titled debut. It's much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Sleeze Rock","review":"This is a bland and genereic late 80's LA sleeze metal album. Nothing here stands out at all. There are lots of pre-teen level sexual innuendos and riffs stolen directly from \\"Rocks\\" era Aerosmith. Taime Downe's voice is un-spectacular at best and seems especially strained on the lackluster hit ballad \\"House of Pain\\". \\"Where There's a Whip There's a Way\\" is a cringe-worthy sex anthem without even a decent hook to save it. The rest of the album shambles along a similarly predictable path and never comes close the legitimate frolicking sleaze the band's debut album. This kind of music doen't have to be intelligent, or even all that original, but it should at least be somewhat fun, energetic or catchy. \\"Wake Me When it's Over\\" is none of the above."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's metal at it's best!","review":"GREAT ALBUM TO CLOSE OUT THE DECADE. STAND OUT TRACKS INCLUDE \\"POISON IVY\\" AND \\"HOUSE OF PAIN\\" WHICH WAS A TOP 40 HIT. I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY ROCK FAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"FPC's best","review":"This is definitely Faster Pussycat's best album! It is a great collection of songs and they were one of the best glam bands of the 80s/early 90s. You can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Heather Small's album version","review":"I bought this because I love the album remix featured on Heather Small's album \\"Proud\\". That version is the 7th District Radio Mix and I was hoping to hear more great remixes. This CD was beyond disappointing. Even the original Tom Jones album version is terrible. Save your money, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This product isn't the greatest. It doesn't add a lot of shine to my hair it just makes it go flat .I prefer Garnier Fructis Style Brilliantine Shine Glossing Spray , it makes my hair very silky and shiny with lots of body ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is the only de-frizzing product and gloss that works with my fine hair. Normally I look like my hand was in an electrical socket with my hair literally floating up of its own accord. This product makes it look shiny and smooth. Works on curled hair too. Doesn't weigh my hair down at all, and literally shines it right up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake or extremely old","review":"I ordered this product from this seller and I got a bottle that was not sealed or packaged at all. The bottle looks worse than the empty one I currently have, the label is chipping off and it looks gross. The product doesn't smell right either, I've used this shine gloss for a long time and ordered it off the internet because it's either not being made anymore, or my local store quit carrying it. Whatever is in this bottle IS NOT JOHN FRIEDA FRIZZ EASE SHINE GLOSS, it smells as if they filled a bottle with robbing alcohol and sent it to me (the real product has a very faint hint that smells almost like strawberries). No wonder they marked the price in half so quickly. DO NOT ORDER THIS, IT IS A SCAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Not at all like Karizma","review":"I bought this CD because I heard Landau for the first time with Karizma. He was great on that CD. There were no samples of this one on the web site so just bought it figuring it would be great too.Was I disappointed. I am a guitarist, so I was hoping for a guitar album. It wasnt. It is a bunch of so-so songs with so-so profuction.Music is subjective, so you may love this CD. But listen to samples somewhere first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it when I was 17","review":"just wanted to make 2 points clear:1. Covenant rapes Lena in what he believes to be a dream - he doesn't think its real. He ends up being the Unbeliever because to accept the reality of the Land is to accept he is a rapist for real. This act is absolutely never condoned and shapes the rest of the series.2. Incest - Covenant does later sleep with his daughter, but only when neither of them are aware of their relationship. He is not 'capable of committing incest' - he has no idea he is doing it.Good people sometimes do bad things, and just because an author writes about something it does not mean he condones it. Ok?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bored to death..to captured","review":"I bought this book when it came out in 1977. The first chapter bored me to death and I threw it in my closet and didn't read it. I had just finished reading the hobbit and couldn't get into this new job fantasy. About 6 months later I picked it up again and gave it a longer read. I was blown away! And from that day I was a Stephen Donaldson fan. I waited for each book to come out with great impatience. It took forever. 35 year's later I still think about and love the Giant's and all of the land absolutely an amazing story. I have often thought Clint Eastwood would have been the perfect Thomas Covenant. This is the best fantasy of all time. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The series tortured my Heart, and redeemed it. All 6 times!","review":"I have read this series several times, and each time it has played the full spectrum of my emotions . These books will take you from the depths of despair, to the heights of inspiration. And you will learn alot about yourself on the way. While I consider Tolkein to be a great fantasy writer, Donalson writes about the Soul. These books are as much a study of humanity as they are fantasy. In my opinion, Donaldson's work outshines all others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Some may consider it churlish to 'review' a book after only reading twenty pages before throwing it across the room. Yet I feel I need to warn the potential reader of the mangling of the language that takes place within this book.Here's a quote from the first page of the novel: \\"As he walked, he flicked his eyes up and down himself [...]\\"'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding! Protagonist, Covenant, is a worm.","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews on this book/series. I have struggled through Book I and Book II holding onto scant hope that the author would somehow redeem the main character, Thomas Covenant. He is an unlikable, egocentric, cowardly, whiny, sniveling, and I'm afraid, unredeemable worm. Try as I might I can't like him. I don't care if he lives or dies. I can't even feel sorry for him. I've read quite a bit of fantasy, some very good, some not so good but this is really awful. I'm afraid that I would find the author's style to be quite tedious even if I did like the characters. Do yourself a favor and read George RR Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams, almost anyone else, but don't bore yourself with the Unbeliever."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst series I've ever read!","review":"This entire series was an enormous disappoint to me! I read every single book in the series - I admit, I was curious to see how things would turn out. I wanted to see the bad-guy get it in the end. The problem is that one of the bad-guys is the \\"hero\\" of the story, and a more undeserving man I've never known! He's a dispicable man with pretty much no redeeming qualities.Leaving aside that issue, the books themselves are depressing, cynical and down-right unpleasant to read. I've never liked that kind of story, so I admit that if you do, you might enjoy these books. I certainly didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst fantasy novel ever? maybe.","review":"This book has the most masochistic following I've ever heard of. Lord Foul's Bane was pure, unadulterated torture to read. It had nothing to offer me. The world is boring , it is filled with boring creatures and characters,but the very worst part is the \\"anti-hero\\" Thomas Covenant. Don't be mislead by the term anti-hero when it is applied to Covenant. This is not some loosely moraled but otherwise entertaining character, nor is he the hardcore kill em all and take no prisoners hero/villain.He's more the wimpy, whiny, irritating, rape a girl who has designs on you anyway kind of anti-hero. Save yourself from some of the worst reading imaginable, pick up a copy of Game Of Thrones, Dune, Eye Of The World[series],Tolkien etc... Sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved this when I was 15, now I know better","review":"I thought this book (and series) was great when I was 15 years old. I recently re-read Lord Foul's Bane and wondered \\"What was I thinking?\\"Now, I simply cannot get past the whining main character. Thomas Covenant tries to justify raping a 16 year old on his Unbeliever schtick and pules and whines throughout the book. Frankly, I wanted to smack him. I suppose when I was 15, his excuses seemed reasonable. Now I know they're ridiculous nonsense.I suppose in 1977, The Thomas Covenant Chronicles were an epic fantasy in a genre with a wide audience looking for another Lord of the Rings. Today, there's a whole library of superior epic fantasy to choose from. Don't waste your time with this thin gruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord Fouls Bane","review":"This book is hard work. It uses extra, superfluous,unnecessary words wherever less would have sufficed. At 75% complete I remain uncertain about the purpose of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Nothing redeeming about Thomas covenant. An anti-hero should have at least some skill or trait that awakens some sort of admiration, or at least be a character we love to hate (joffery from ice and fire comes to mind). Covenant rapes, whines, and hisses \\" I'm a leper, don't touch me! \\" all over the Land ( original name there eh?). I trudged through the book hoping Thomas would be killed off by the giant or the ur things. Also lord foul? Dhrool? Ur \\"vile\\"? Mount dhoom? Some original names would have been nice. The last few pages I was skimming entire paragraphs, hoping The Doctor or Ghandalf or someone would show up to save the ending. At least I can understood why TC's wife left so quickly, seeing what an ur-vile he became. The title of the book is pretty lame too. The book uses English, has somewhat understandable phrasing, and has a plot.. That's about all the pros.. Don't waste your time is my verdict, life is too short"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheerfulness doesn't make a good story.","review":"This series is for anyone tired of the typical hero. Lord Foul's Bane makes the reader so disgusted with Thomas Covenant - the main character - that you have to read on. The writing is incredibly descriptive and the plot is rock solid. If you're looking for cute, lovable characters, look elsewhere. TC is brutally unaccepting of his situation and it does make you start to hate him. Donalson's ability to evoke such emotions is evidence of the high quality of his art. Like most other fantasy novels the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant have their fair share of mythic creatures: sapient horses, Giants, wights, etc. The tale is brilliantly woven with few detectable flaws. Definitly worth reading sveral times. A warning though: bring along a dictionary, you'll need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"hero\\" rapes a minor.","review":"It was frankly impossible for me to get past that, and find it hard to understand how any well-adjusted person could do so.The so called hero of the story has many deep character flaws, and I frankly did not find that entertaining. This world he creates is torpid and bland. I just don't see now anyone could consider this book entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Covenant Trilogy Ranks With the Best","review":"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever are quite simply the finest fantasy books since Middle Earth. I envy the fantasy reader who gets to read them for first time. This is not another Tolkien rip-off. Donaldson crafts a rich world with characters that add a new dimension to his stories. Once you pick up the first book, you won't be able to wait to get through the rest of the books. For the lover of pure fantasy, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Definately not a book for everyone, and not \\"light reading\\" but an amazing story by an excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read","review":"The story is typical fantasy, which is okay, however the main character completely ruins the book. This person is someone I could never root for, identify with, or think heroic. I kept reading, expecting the story to improve or the main character to change somehow. To put it plainly, this guy is a coward and complains throughout the entire 400+ pages of the book. It truly becomes a bore when the story focuses on this man's angry inner condition and jerk attitude. The supporting characters do not have enough depth and the fantasy of the book's world is not interesting enough to keep the book from being a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery, waiting for something to happen","review":"I love so many fantasy books, but I'm completely puzzled as to why so many people enjoy this book. An actual event will happen only every 60 pages or so. The rest of the time the author drones on about the trees and rocks, or about the main character's pessimistic view on life. Even a slow-moving philosphical tome such as Atlas Shrugged moves very quickly by comparison.Many of my friends recommended this as a wonderful book, but the reasons for that are complete mystery to me. Move along and select a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea....too much groaning","review":"I liked the idea; leper, outcast and unbeliever as a hero who causes more harm than good in some cases. That idea got me through some of the worst writing I have ever read. Everyone is groaning and spitting. No one says anything. They all groan through their teeth. After hacking through it all, there was a payoff of an idea. And that was worth the read to me. But the jungle of groans is hard to slash through. I do not wish this book on anyone. Go read Orson Scott Card instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I truly hated this book. I cannot say that of many books. But I think this is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life - including technical manuals. It teases you with just enough story to keep you going, but it takes you nowhere. This \\"unwilling\\" hero is the worst excuse for main character I have ever read. He starts the story being a bitter and mean person, and ends up that way by his own choice. The book is well written as far as dragging the reader along. But the story is horrible. Don't even waste your time reading the back cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeliever? Try Unbelievable.","review":"I have never had to fight my way to the end of a book like I did with this one, and by the time I turned the last page, I wasn't sure that I'd won the bout.This was literary agony. I should have never even bothered finishing it. The main character is an unlikeable, self-absorbed whiner, the writing is plodding, the overall effect is depressing. Covenant himself is the most unlikeable part of this book; when he's not feeling sorry for himself, he's behaving abominably (won't say how, it's sort of a plot point ... at least as far as a plot exists here).I don't object to anti-heroes. They're valid literary devices. But an anti-hero always manages to have at least one redeeming characteristic, and Covenant has none.Save yourself the waste of time. Go read some Eddings, Duane or Stasheff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"I've read quite a lot of books in my time, but Lord Foul's Bane holds the dubious honour of being the first book that I have been unable to complete.Reading this book was like watching grass grow. I found the pacing to be excruciatingly slow. I felt as though the first 100 pages could have been condensed into about 25 pages. I forced myself to make it halfway through because a friend had told me about the plot and I thought it sounded quite interesting; however, I found Donaldson's writing style to be incredibly painful.Obviously Stephen Donaldson appeals to some readers, but I'm not one of them. I've tried another of his books and I gave up on that too. His style does not suit my taste at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razberries for Books I can't Finish","review":"Normally, I would not write a review of a book I couldn't finish. But then I thought: don't the people deserve to know if a book is so terrible that it can't be endured to the end? Yes, they do.With painfully wooden dialog, and a ho-hum world, Lord Foul's Bane is a true bore. I get sleepy after reading forty pages of travelogue. I don't care which way the river flows, or what kind of trees grow where. All of it empty filler, and all of it flaunting an unforgivable lack of imagination. There's a Magic Ring, and an Evil Mountain, a Cave Monster named Drool, and a Dark Lord named Foul. Send it all back, please, I don't want any more.I stopped reading somewhere in the middle of the book, when a legion of ferocious demons is stopped from killing the hero by an army of wild rabbits, dogs, and badgers.

Hmmm.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, second time around","review":"Great book that I read in college, and am now enjoying it the 2nd time around just as much as the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was as painful as a spinal tap.","review":"I very much enjoy the fantasy genre and was looking forward to a this series. Instead I find an anti-hero, and that is too kind a description, who is a whining, despairing and hate filled rapist. From the other reviews he commits incest with his own daughter later in the series.What in Donaldsons background would make him think that a rapist capable of incest would make a great hero. Flaws and questioned abilities to round out a character and make him or her believeable is one thing, but a supposed hero that leaves an innocent young girl with emotional and physical scars for life is entirely something else.Anyone that thinks Covenant is a hero, has never had a close friend or family member raped or experienced the devastation that incest brings.Covenant is such a reprehensible and disgusting creature that the other characters and the Land could not save this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"Everyone has different tastes, but I just didn't get this book. I thought the protagonist was a self-loathing whiner and I couldn't stand reading about him.Also, I could never get over a particular scene in the book that occured within the first hundred pages. Something Thomas attempted to attone for by sending a horse to visit. That won't make sense unless you actually read the book. But, it really freaked me out.The other two books in this series are sitting on my shelf and I can't imagine ever picking them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful just truly awful","review":"Thomas Covenant is a whining, angry and despicable character. A young girl saves his life and he repays her by raping her? And he justifies it all because it is just a \\"dream\\". But everyone that meets him thinks he is some great hero.

I didn't even make it half way through this book. It was torture even getting as far as I did. I always read through the entire book no matter how I feel about it because sometimes a book starts off slow. However this book just sucked more and more the further I go into it. I only brought this book because of the reviews others gave. This is the 1st time that the amazon customer reviews has let me down. I don't write reviews often but I had to review this book. I didn't want to give any stars but that is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"Poorly written, cliche, with a scumbag main character who I would personally beat to a pulp if I ever met him in real life. What a waste of a good evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I love to read fantasy novels, and my favorites are \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and \\"Wheel of Time.\\" Since I have read LOTR about 5 times and I am waiting for the next WOT book to come out, I thought that I would try something by an author I hadnt heard anything about. I know not to make that mistake again! I had to skip about 15 pages in the beginning of the book just because Covenants talk of leprosy is so monotonous and boring. And maybe its just me but I enjoy action, and the hero's have great power or skill. Covenant has nothing; no power, no skills, NOTHING. But then again, maybe he does have something, I dont really know. I made it halfway through the book before I put it down to collect dust. So do yourself a favor, if you like books that you apparently have to read half way through to get to anything interesting, buy this book! But if you dont like to sit and wonder when something is going to go down, dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celebrating rape","review":"Donaldson must have a soul blighted with darkness and self loathing. Many of his characters certainly do. The most vile, odious, and despicable of his characters is the anti-hero Thomas Covenant, a self absorbed, narcissistic leper filled with self loathing. Fairly early in the book Covenant rapes a child. The account is short, but detailed. Only a reprobate would stoop to using the details of rape to propel his career as an author. The main impetus of the book thereafter seems to be for the reader to hate Covenant for an absolutely worthless hero who refuses to do any good to anyone. He has a magical ring of power (how derivative), but he refuses to use it to help save the land. He has to be impelled, for hundreds of pages, by better characters to ever do anything of worth. Whenever Covenant actually accomplishes anything worthy of note, it is inadvertant, or forced without his volition. I kept hoping for a terrible death for Covenant as I read this book and each subsequent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Crap","review":"This was the first fantasy series I ever read. This was in 10th grade. I read both trilogies. I thought they were amazing. Which shows what a simpleton I was at the time. I read The Lord of the Rings shortly thereafter and realized that Donaldon had lifted much of his story from Tolkien. I have heard it called a \\"derivative work\\" in relation to Tolkien. It is a derivative work in the sense that generic pharmaceuticals are derivatives of name-brand pharmaceuticals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this series","review":"This series of books was highly recommended by a man I worked with. I ordered the first 6 books all at once and part way through the first one when I realized these books were very depressing.Before I was finished with the 2nd one (why did I keep reading?) I was in a depression that lasted 3 years. The devestation that these characters see in their world put me into a major depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"A good friend practically forced me to read this book. I got through it but I am not happy about it. The protagonist is completely unlikable (he rapes a young woman in the beginning of the book). The author abuses dramatic license by providing a completely inaccurate description of leprosy (in this book an incurable disease). I found myself rolling my eyes while reading the author's horrible use of metaphor. The ending is every bit as dumb as the beginning of the book. The only interesting part of the book is the bloodguard. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this series to all","review":"Although Donaldson is a great writer, if you like a good hero and fun reading, this is not the series for you. I've read hundreds of fantasy books and by the end of this series, I just wanted the main character to die and end all of the depressing reading. So don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Dark","review":"I felt the characters in this book weren't well developed. The situation Donaldson creates is so dark and depressing, that I could not enjoy it, even if I could get over the belabored descriptions and details. However, I would highly recommend \\"The Mirror of her Dreams,\\" another Donaldson book, so it's likely I just didn't like the theme of the Thomas Covenant chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a DRAG !","review":"I regret wasting a good few days of my life reading about a wishy-washy hero who needed THAT much convincing that he was the man for the job.The story was a drag, and there is nothing I can remember about the storyline except that it repeated itself like a broken record player.The only excitement came at the ending, partly due to the fact that I kind of got excited finding out that I was about to finish Book Three,and hence the series.To be avoided unless you have nothing better else to do with your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....Adult fiction?","review":"While I believe that the characters could be real in the work, such as having flaws and such, the plot line is sorely in need of originality. I'm sick of fantasy novels in which the main hero is suddenly whisked away from his normal life in to some imaginary dreamworld. If the book started there it would be fine, but too many fantasy novels try to cause plotlines by impossible events like just moving around characters through time and space unknowingly. The reason for the second star is because at the end Covenant questions whether or not the dream was real or fake..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing I can say will do this book justice!","review":"I LOVED this book. It took me to a land of fantasy, where I accompanied Thomas Covenant on a journey of conquest where he battles for and against his own instincts and emotions. This book is defintely a winner, and I'd recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I live my life by these books!!","review":"On numerous occasions I have tried to explain to my friends the story of Thomas Covenant and halfway through I give up because I cant articulate all the nuances, the details, and the feelings that these books have. There are no other books that I have read that can make my heart rejoice while at the same time makes it break. No other novels mix joy and tradgedy like The Covenant books. The characters that Donaldson creates are the most amazing literary creations in history. If the people in our world today had half the dignity, unselfishness, integrity, and love that the people of the land have, we would not be in this social nightmare that we find ourselves in. Concerning the movie, Harrison Ford should not be Covenant, the role belongs to Tom Hanks! Scincerely, Jason"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fantasy trilogy","review":"One of the best fantasy trilogies I've ever read, not as good as Lord of the Rings, but better than any other. A man on Earth, thomas covenant, contacts leprosy, becomes a pariah, and is transported to a magic place called the Land. His ring is the key to victory over the arch-fiend Lord Foul. Creepily, Covenant rapes a girl but is allowed to live and is sent to fight Lord Foul and his minions. I highly recommend this trilogy; I reread it after 15 years and liked it as much as before. I also recommend the sequel to this trilogy, The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb high fantasy literature!","review":"Donaldson is one of the best authors when it comes to character and storyline development. His attention to details and interactions among his characters is flawless. I have read the double trilogy 3 times and will read it again soon. All of my friends have read it as well, and agree that it is high fantasy at its best. I wish Mr. Donaldson would write another book about The Land and its people. There is plenty left to write about without being redundant. Thanks to Mr. Donaldson for a true masterpiece!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I've ever read","review":"Ok, even if from all the other reviews of this book I am supposed to accept the main characters faults because he is \\"only human\\", how am I supposed to relate (as a human) to a leper (they still exist??) who hates everyone around him, and RAPES SOMEONES DAUGHTER THAT HE JUST MET WITHIN THE FIRST 100 PAGES OF THE BOOK!?!?!?!?I'm sorry but there is only so much I can forgive a main character who is supposed to be the hero of the entire series. That, coupled with the incredibly hard to read dialogue and this is the absolute worst book I have ever read!!As some other reviewers have said here, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The Gap Series and Skip This One","review":"Donaldson is an excellent writer. Lord Foul's Bane is his first effort, and it simply lacks the character development of his later works. While we are supposed to suspend our disbelief for a fantasy novel, this books demands more: that we throw our common sense out as well. Sorry, Donaldson, just can't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty","review":"Newer fantasies all seem to want to be \\"gritty.\\" I understand the desire, since there are plenty of fantasies that don't seem to have any sense of realism. But in the slew of books that fight for this moniker, this book precedes and in many ways surpasses them.There's obviously Thomas, who is a complex character. We're given a picture of why he is the way he is, and does the things he does. But when it gets down to it, he's a very polarizing figure. I know some readers who put the book down and never went back to it. So, there's the grit.The world is fascinating, to be sure. And there's a true sense of epicness, mostly because of what's on the line. I won't spoil that for you. But it all comes back around to Thomas, and he is one of the best written anti-heroes I've ever read.This is a very good fantasy series. Well worth going back and reading if you haven't read it before; and if you have, it's worth returning to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book might be considered good if...","review":"... you consider the fact that many of us have coffee tables that need to be shimmed up under one leg. I hated to hate this book. I think that many of the side characters were interesting and deserving of living in a fantasy world where TC should never show his face. I read both TC trilogies hoping that somewhere along the way, TC would develop a spine and mature emotionally if not intellectually. My brother recommended the series only to tell me after I had finished that he had never made it all the way through as he couldn't stomach the depressive quality of the main character"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader's Bane","review":"Like the others who gave this book one star, I agree that it is poorly written. The simplistic compound names lack imagination. The book seems a near rip-off of Tolkien's works. Maybe this series is meant for teens or younger, but so is Harry Potter and those books were great reading (although nothing new there, either.) Check it out at the library before buying the first book. I couldn't get through half of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Story - Bad characters","review":"The story is pretty good and all three books in the series are relatively fast reads, but the main and central character is so unlikeable and consistently annoying that it ruins the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for anti-hero fans","review":"Donaldson\`s Covenant trilogy is a very strange undertaking. He chooses an unlikely hero, a leper who is anything, but your average fantasy hero. In fact his major concern is how to keep out of things. Of course this doesn\`t work for him and he unwillingly destroys everyone around him. For three long volumes we see him struggling. The choice of such a hero and the idea that whole story unfolds only in his imagination is exciting, but the ending is not true to itself. At the very end (after nearly everyone has died)the main character who has not been able to do anything positive in the past three books, suddenly transforms into a real hero, who defeats the enemy with his supernatural powers. This is a very, very disappointing ending to the story, because it goes against the whole plot of the book.One other thing. This book is strictly for native english speakers (even they will have difficulty)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donaldson's entry into the world of fantasy","review":"This is the first of what started out to be a Trilogy. After the first Trilogy, the story wasn't complete so Donaldson wrote several more books to complete the story. I have read and reread this series since high school. Hands down some of the best story telling and character development ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I read this when it first came out in the 70's. Now I am reading it again and enjoy it just as much. If you are a fan of fantasy, this is a must read (the whole trilogy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems pretty cliche..","review":"I'm sure back when this one came out it was fun but these days it seems a bit old-school and cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - must read!","review":"When I first started this I wasn't too sure. The first couple of chapters are slow. But once you get into it, there's no mistake you HAVE to read on. Covenant I can relate to, he's not just your average hero, he's REAL. And guess what I'm back here to buy - yep, the next two in the trilogy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Covenant the Unbelievable","review":"To their fans, works of such perrennial popularity become impervious to critism, but if you're a careful reader and demand (as do fans of Hard SF, for example) a fairly high standard of verisimilitude and common-sense in a character's behavior, you may find The Chronicles too vulnerable to logic to be entirely successful. On a lesser note, I was continually reminded that Donaldson's indebtedness to Tolkien is too significant to go unacknowledged by the author. Those who seek the dark, introspective Fantasy departure that this book strives to be would be more challenged by Mervyn Peake's brilliant, underappreciated (in the U.S.) Gormenghast novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad Book; A Very Bad Trilogy","review":"This guy cannot write worth a darn! He makes stuff up that is not realistic! Thomas Covenant is a major league jerk! I could write a better book than this, no problem. I will not tell anyone to read this book because it is so bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: The protagonist is a rapist","review":"Seriously, the protagonist rapes a woman almost as soon as he gets to fantasy land and can feel pleasure in his nerve endings. If that squicks you out, avoid the book. Otherwise the book then deals with the consequences of that rape, as do books following. This series is designed to counter all the fantasy tropes, including the idea that the hero has to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dull, boring, bad, boring, uninspired, boring, no depth, boring...","review":"Okay, I could write a review of this book, but it was so UNENJOYABLE that I quit. You heard me I QUIT, and I'm still writing a review. HAHAHAHA!! You can't stop me...and you shouldn't. If a book is so unenjoyable that I just couldn't go on, it deserves my honest review. But I'll save my time here, too. Find on the webpage for this book where to click to see all of the \\"one-star\\" reviews and you will see people say everything that I want to, only they say it even better.Avoid this book. So bad. Seriously, I don't know how people see this as some \\"epic\\" \\"masterpiece.\\" If you want epic masterpieces, check out George R. R.

It is the most forced and laboured prose I've ever experienced.The idea is fine, and in the hands of a competent writer would have made a decent book. But in the hands of Donaldson it is painful. It creates as much interest as reading company tax legislation.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain BORING!","review":"I was about 200 pages into this book before I realized that I just did not want to read it. It was becoming a huge effort just to pick it up and plod through a few pages. You will hear other people here complain about how Thomas Covenant is hard to sympathize with, and how he rapes a girl, etc. I was prepared to deal with that. What I wasn't prepared for was extremely long, boring and contrived descriptions of \\"the Land\\". Donaldson spends WAY too much effort in trying to convince the reader of how the Land is this magical place to which its inhabitants are connected in a vital way unlike here on earth. What he suceeds in is only creating an extremely boring novel that is pathetic in its attempt to engage the reader's imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"great writing - not so great character","review":"I really enjoyed the writing of this book, but the maid character, Thomas, really let me down. he was the sort of person who always throught the world was against him and would not believe what life threw in his path. i put this book down after a hundred pages, to \\"hopefully read later.\\"But if you are looking for a book where the writing is great and draws you in from page one, then this is a book you'd enjoy. but if you like likable characters and does not go into unnessary discripions, then i would not recomend this book to you.hope this is of use to some one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasy!","review":"A classic story of Good Guys and Bad Guys, with a twist.

Maybe!","review":"This book is defenitly one of the greatest fantasy-books ever. Stephen Donaldson surely takes me to a world which I never want to leave.

Don't ever stop writing Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Doorway into self- perception","review":"Reading all six at a young age(15)I found the adventure to be unmatched.

Never has life been pictured in a more abstract-realism pastiche of trial, error, depspite and purification. TragicHero Thomas Covenent is the best and most philosophizing character of all time. He revels in pain and despair, dealing with the ultimate social paralysis, leprosy. He lives in a land of spite and distrust and is transferred to another place, The Land. What happens next shakes up Urlord's reality. Everything changes and rather than be ignored, he is honored and charged by expectation. This is the perfect story for all infirmnities. The introspection of TC is revolutionary, as it discusses the battle of despair. If you have not read this book, I cannot help you. Feel the Land work, take away, work, take away...ARGH Covenant! If you cannot fall in love with every character for the subimation of their craftedness, there again, i cannot help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 10,000 word essay on trees and bushes","review":"A painfully boring read.

He had lots of praise for the book and was sure I would enjoy it. He was wrong, wrong, just wrong. It seems to be \\"A.D.D.\\" in print. It jumps around and around, and rambles on and on. I loved Terry Goodkind's \\"The Sword of Truth Series\\", I enjoyed Weis & Hickman and all that they have written but Donaldson is killing me. I will finish this book but I will not read any more of Donaldson. I guess it takes all kinds for the world to go around. I will take a pass here."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is there to like?","review":"I did not enjoy this book one bit. I read fantasy because I enjoy heroes. I enjoy reading about other worlds. I want likeable characters and a plot that moves along. I want to be happy.I just could not get myself into the character of Thomas. He is angry and bitter. He RAPES a young girl. Why am I going to cheer for this character? Why am I going to care what happens to him? I spent the majority of the book hoping he would get killed.I gave the book two stars because I in some ways appreciate the fact that this is an original work. The main character is highly flawed and has leprosy. The world building is done well. The writing style is very good.If you like dark fantasy, or do not mind a flawed hero, then by all means try this book. I personally did not like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denial is really tedious","review":"My problem with this book is the main character, Thomas Covenant. His self-absorbed denial gets really, really old after a while. For instance, he refuses to eat because eating would mean that he buys into the Land which \\"obviously\\" can't exist.

I think the story would have been a lot more engaging and zippy if the reader weren't forced to wade through his rotten attitude on every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK --- This One Is BAD","review":"I can't describe what these Chronicles meant to me. It is an ungrateful job to be critic or the judge... anyway the First and Second Cronicles of Thomas Covenant purport to be full of knowledge about anything that has the roots in divine pure. Hah!

The story has yet to captivate me and realizing there are 2 more books after this I believe I should quit while I am ahead.

I'll give it two stars because It has resale value at the half priced bookstore down the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been a while.","review":"It's been a long time since I attempted to read this series. Convoluted, overdramatic, derivative. It's got some great descriptions in it; I still remember loving the Land just from the way it was described. But. 1) High Fantasy really has to work hard not to re-visit every bit of Tolkien. This one didn't start out different enough not to suffer by comparison. 2) The main protagonist is both annoying and loathesome. Theoretically, I know the books are about his redemption. In actuality, I can't care. We're never given enough reason to care. He never seems to have the potential to be *smart*, never mind heroic, or even humane. Even trying to read it again, going in with the knowledge that no, he's not all that admirable? He doesn't come across as interesting. 3) Slow book is slow.If you like it, more power to you.

I find the subject matter extreamly interesting. I've always wanted to personally go through a mothball ship yard and explore the vessels. The book really doesn't do it for me. I wanted page after page of descriptions of layed up ships with information on how they were mothballed and being maintained. I did not like the way the book jumps from operational history to lay up. There are plenty of books about WW2 battles I can buy. I wanted to hear more about the process of deactivation and possibly more first hand accounts from the workers involved. I also wanted to know more about the reasons some were kept longer than others and how some were brought back to service. There is not enough info on more modern ships from the post WW2 era and almost nothing on current preserved ships. definatly a keeper but not all that the reviews so far have made it out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"off target","review":"This book is not about the so-called mothball fleets per se. Instead it is a somewhat morose homage to selected US naval vessels from World War Two that seems to imply something better should have happened to each of them.There is virtually no explanation of why these vessels were collected, how the process was carried out and what were the outcomes. There are a few - very few - good pictures showing the various ship collections from its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. Overall, one is left with the impression that the book is the output of a google/wikipedia search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acapella","review":"I have this on vinyl but wanted it on CD. I could have used my USB turntable but I was too lazy to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Worth it.\\"","review":"Pun intended, this CD is worthwhile, but for Holdsworth addicts only, since there is indeed too much idle noodling from all the band members thoughout this early disc. This album was recorded before Allan Holdsworth had fully defined his sound and found his own unique voice on the guitar. This disc is mostly of historic value to the hardcore Jazz-fusion collector. I am a big fan of Allan and his I.O.U. project especially and found track 6: \\"Golden Lakes\\" the most accomplished composition in this set. His singing actually isn't too bad either.His 1983 album \\"Road Games\\" was also re-released recently and that is a disc I highly reccomend, it is from his greatest creative period. Every song is flawlessly executed.Jack Bruce and Jeff Berlin are feautured guests on \\"Road Games.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Milking it!","review":"Don't buy this if you even remotely like Holdsworths current stuff. Sounds like an unrehearsed, below average 60's bar/cover band. Unfocused hippie vocals with unrelated guitar nuddeling. The poor recording quality doesn't help either. Somebody's really trying to make money on everything that can be dug up with Holdsworth on it. Sad. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor grammar and editing","review":"The humor in this book is somewhat sophomoric but more distracting are the numerous grammatical and stylistic errors that detract from seamless reading.

I mean it's a basic sleep mask but it's very cute and stays on well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute","review":"Received in the mail promptly. It's very cute but does not cover light very well for me. The inside is pink also, usually it's black so that you would not see light shining throught he fabric. The strap is not adjustable so it's sort of loose on my small head. Did not do the job for me but it looks cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty in Pink","review":"Adorable little sleep mask with average light blocking ability.

Get a more heavy duty mask for every night."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"The dean of my college gave me a copy of this book because he thought I could relate to the problems TAs have, as narrated so expertly in this masterpiece. I could, and I loved this book! Anyone who wants to read a highly intellectual account of what is going wrong in our nation's English departments should read a boring (and they all are) and useless dissertation. This book is meant for those who want some lighthearted reading and the chance to live out their imaginations through the actions of Mr. Meade. The Meade solution may well be the best laugh you'll get out of school-related material for a long, long while.

I got this disc way back when it first came out and it quickly became one of my favorite hard rock albums. The title track and \\"All I Want\\" are two of the most obvious sex-tinged rockers you'll run into from the early 90's. \\"Dance of the Dogs,\\" \\"She's Evil But She's Mine\\" and \\"Hell Child\\" are all excellent rock tunes as well. \\"Rain,\\" \\"Sweet Sister Mercy\\" and \\"Through These Eyes\\" are especially good and highlight Oni Logan's vocals.The entire album is a wonderful treat from the era that Grunge killed.

My personal favorite tracks are \\"Wicked Sensation\\" which I believe there was a video for), \\"Sweet Sister Mercy\\", \\"All I Want\\", \\"Dance Of The Dogs\\", & \\"No Bed Of Roses\\". So if you like \\"Dokken\\" or just like heavy blues rock 'n roll, do yourself a favor and pick this up..the whole album is good. I might also add their second album simply titled \\"Lynch Mob\\" is pretty good as well, they do a killer version of \\"Queens\\" \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" on that one.

HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just Woolf being cute","review":"FLUSH probably gets the least respect of all of Virginia Woolf's books, and many critics at the time of its publication in 1933 (and since) thought she was being more than a bit twee in telling the satory of the Elizabeth Barrett-Robert Browning courtship from the point of view of Barrett's adored cocker spaniel. But this experiment in biography is much more than that: it's an attempt to understand the world from a non-human point of view, and it also is Woolf's most overt look in her fiction at class difference and (more unusually) at the world of crime. It's also a terrific addition to Woolf's extended engagement from an early 20th-c. perspective with the world of genteel Victorian society and its snobberies and hypocrisies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another release","review":"I like this series even though it tends to be a bit simple and low budget. Most previous and current DVD releases are all under the title \\"The Veil\\" and for some reason? they have retitled it which muddies the waters on what it is.

Just type in the search box - \\"The Veil\\" and you will see the other releases of the smae material. - Steve"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good waist pack","review":"I use this for short to medium hikes, and it is very good. I drink a lot of water here in hot So Cal, so the fact that it has two water bottles and holders is great. The bottles are easy to reach, remove, and insert while wearing the waist pack. The pack itself is small but you can squeeze in a lot, and it can be unzipped and zipped easily while you are wearing it. Now, FINDING the item you want is up to you!I did find that the belt tended to slip down as I walked and sweated - but I think that is more a result of my geometry (somewhat big belly, and no butt) than of the waist pack. I bought some broad suspenders to hold it up and it works great. I felt a little silly wearing this get-up the first time, but it is very comfortable.One last point - the supplied water bottles have no pop-up \\"sport\\" top - you have to unscrew the whole cover.

What a difference. The Spaulding has the bounce, grip, feel that you expect from a good ball. This Baden...it's very poor quality rubber and nearly no bounce at all. The feel is not good and overall it's cheaply made and a real disappointment. For maybe 2 bucks more, pick the Zi/O, every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarrely disorganized","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it is so disorganized as to be essentially useless. Each page is a jumble of illustrations and instructions, but there's no way of telling which illustration (if any) goes with any given set of instructions. Some of the instructions begin at the bottom of the page and continue at the top of the same page. And the instructions themselves are hurried and unintelligible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I found the instructions in this book difficult to follow. Much of the time the author refers to products I have never heard of, and the way the directions are presented is confusing. I do get a lot of inspiration from the pictures, though, so use it to try new ideas. It is easier to try to figure out what to do from the pictures than it is from reading the directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's finest recording?","review":"Whether you agree with Billy's politics or not, you can't help but be impressed with the emotion of \\"My Youngest Some Came Home Today\\" or the sharp lyrics of \\"Marching Song of the Covert Battalions.\\" It seems that musicians just don't record this sort of gutsy material anymore. Nowadays, \\"taking a chance\\" means offending as many people as possible with obscenities or lewd behavior, but there was a time when musicians believed that taking a chance had to do with performing intellectually bold content that had real social value. Billy Bragg is one of those people. Steve Earle is another. It's a shame there aren't more like them anymore. If you want a stellar example of a talented musician performing gutsy, meaty songs, then listen to this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into the politics that make Bragg tick.","review":"Something for the latent communist in us all. Billy Bragg brings us deep insights into his political consciousness, entertaining and informing all the while. Some of my favorite tracks include Bragg's updated and moving version of \\"The Internationale\\" as well as a very different take on Blake's \\"Jerusalem.\\" My four-star review is more a function of this CD's length (sadly only seven tracks) rather than its quality.

The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing. It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand. The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live. This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash. I won't miss it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Sound - Blinding Display","review":"The CD sound from this compact unit is virtually unmatched. CD's sound magnificant. Unfortunately, the backlit display was bright enough to warn overhead air traffic to stay clear of my bedroom. The display is transparent and, as a reuslt, its light shines through the front and the back of the unit. Even on the lowest setting my bedroom was significantly illuminated. Sony should have included a hood to put over the unit at night, or perhaps a black-out mask for your eyes. If you intend to use this in your bedroom, forget it. Otherwise, it would make a great appliance for another room in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of a value for the money","review":"Too many disadvantages:1. No battery backup2.

As other reviewers have said, even at the dimmest setting, the light from the clock radio is so bright, your neighbors may ask you to turn it down. The sound is excellent, but ergonomically, the controls are small and poorly laid out, which is surprising, since Sony's old Dream Machine was really well thought out. Finally, after less than a year, the CD player has nearly given up the ghost, skipping the first couple of tracks on all CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design... If you want to read by your clock radio","review":"I was so looking forward to this item, because it seemed so feature rich, but was extremey disappointed.This design is aweful... There are 3 settings Bright, Brighter, and Brightest. The problem is you can only see the clock at the brightest setting.. the contrast for the clock is horrible. Also the power supply is HUGE.. no really it's HUGE! Which is not a problem unless you want to plug in others things into your six outlet power strip.

The book is well laid out, and describes various spreads in a way easy for the beginner to understand. There are reproductions of each card, followed by a description of its symbolism and meaning, which are also easy to understand.

I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and deeply spiritual images","review":"Not only is this deck visually stunning, but it is easy to use and accurate as well, and amply conveys the spirit of the Celtic tradition, though in a new and evocative way. Some digital decks suffer in that they are overly surreal, but that is not the case here, where the full spiritual import of the card meanings and the atmosphere of the sacred has been portrayed wonderfully. The order of the Major Arcana has been altered slightly to fit in with the authors' interpretation of the journey of the Fool through the major cards, but that doesn't cause problems as the archetypes are still recognisable (besides, many other tarot artists have played around with the ordering sequence, including Crowley). The images on the cards are beautiful, vibrant and mysterious...absolutely gorgeous!The book which accompanies the deck is clear and informative, and the part devoted to explaining British paganism is absorbing.Elen Hawke (In The Circle, The Sacred Round)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please put this book on Kindle","review":"Beautiful cards wonderful book full of information.

As I looked at it, I found it to be less Celtic than Wiccan. The \\"Lord\\" and \\"Lady\\" cards are just one example of their misinterpretations of Celtic lore.

Lets not forget here people that the reason anyone would even bother to make a \\"debunk\\" film is if they are afraid of something. If you knew you were in the right, then you would have nothing to worry about. A fellow reviewer stated that this film is full of historical evidence that proves the outlandish claims in the Da Vinci code are false. I'm sorry but I don't see the King James Bible as a historical reference. Keep in mind children, I don't buy everything the Da Vinci code say's either, but don't let some frighten old men think for you. Never be afraid to think for yourself, and that is precisely what this film does not want you to do.

Very good monoral recording, but only downside is that recording engineers made unforgivable mistake to adjust recording level too high from the start, then suddenly turning the level down to contain the massive climax. So the climax is really anti-climax as far as the recording quality is concerned. Only way to solve this problem is to record this on your MD or re-writable CD while adjusting recording level very low from the start and put it at highest level towards the climax. Then, Mravinsky's intention, to create the truly apocalyptic ending to this extraordinary work, is fully realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Pops Frosty Chocolate Mint","review":"Amazon, I wish you would taste some of the item's your selling.

Long time Gong fans need to except that this is University of Errors and NOT Gong. However...There are times on THIS record where I feel that Daevid is reaching further into his heart and soul. Compared to the others, the song writing here is excellent. He even has hints of some of the conceptual ideas he first presented on his Good Morning solo album back in 1976. But again, this is NOT 1976 and this is NOT the Good Morning album or sessions.

The Kohler robe hook is heavy chromed brass, nicely made, so I immediately went online to a Kohler wall bracket that looks like the American Standard one--sure that I'd find it to be brass--and found customer statements saying, contrary to claims, it too is plastic.

As I grow older I find it harder and harder to feel the pluck of heartstrings, but Michael Feinstein does it with his rendition of the Anthony Newley classic. He takes me back to an innocent time with his infectious joy in this music. You can hear the smile on his face, hear the love he feels for the melody and lyrics. Most of the songs are happy and silly, but curiously there is one that every parent should listen to and take to heart. If you have heard this album, you'll know the song: Because We're Kids, from that amazing and surrealist movie The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T (From which the crazy Dressing Song also came.)

Feinstein is often singing in too low a tessitura."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed","review":"I was looking for a lighthearted CD for my four-month old son and was disappointed with this one.

Of all of Miles' songs of that period, my favorite is Calypso Frelimo, from this album. Unlike most of his music which has a mood of sadness about it, \\"Frelimo\\" starts off energetic and uptempo. It slows in the middle and then picks up the tempo to match its pace at the beginning. This is most exciting music from the reborn jazzmaster himself. Mtume, Hocky Tonk, Maiysia and Red China Blues are additional offerings for lovers of Miles Davis' music (of this jazz fusion experimental period).But the selection, Calypso Frelimo (at over 27 minutes in length), alone is worth the cost of the recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat for percussionists organic beat-driven free jazz","review":"Get Up with it is a nice overview of Miles Music from the early 70s. Recorded between 1970 and 1975, all of it is true to that period, he was exploring electric music and there's lots of free jams. The percussion is incredible, Airto and whoever else is on it. Some sounds like Santana, others just like Bitches Brew, but it all jams. A word to some, who have given this bad reviews: There are definitely those who would find this music boring, or even maddening. There is little real melody going on, more like blips of motifs happening, and it mixes together in a jazz manner, an improvisational \\"stew\\".Always organic, and When you have the caliber of musicians here the likes of Miles, Chick, Keith, Airto, Billy Cobham, Michael Henderson, and on and on, the result is really some of the best jam music ever made.But it isn't for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"wierdness","review":"This is 2 discs, about 2 hours of music, about 1 hour is taked up by 2 very similar tracks, that are basically just variations on a droning, monotonous theme.

My personal favorite songs are World Clique, Who Was That, Power of Love, Good Beat, Deee Lite Theme and Groove is in the Heart, but all the songs are good. Just recently I saw VH-1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders, and Groove is in the Heart was in the Top 20 and rightly so, though I am a little surprised that they didn't have more success.

How do you say deee-groovy???","review":"World Clique, the debut album and most original Deee-Lite record, is a pretty funny mixture of soul/funk, house and experimental electronic music. Although they claimed more attention for their retro-fashion style and only archived real success with the massive first smash hit, Groove Is In The Heart, the band's signature, Deee-Lite kept seducing their fans with groovy songs and much fun. Power Of Love, the fan favourite, features a kistchig early 80's-like synthethizer and makes everybody shake; Lady keer also asks for a Good Beat in the best possible way and jazzy opening track Deee-Lite theme just confirms they deserved classic place on pop music's history. In general, this is a great album, and the best possible preview of the changes who were gonna come on their last and more forgotten 2 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing!

If you're looking for a different wave of dance music that makes you wanna sing at the top of your lungs try this out! Deee-Lite is just the best, and this cd is definitely worth looking into.Don't forget about Dew Drops in the Garden, Sampadelic remixes, and the Infinity Within LPs. Those are a good dosage of Deee-Lite vibes for you there. And to those who do not think that World Clique is worth getting (SAM MARTIN) think of getting a life, and actually commenting on a cd that is in your realm of music.

It definitely shows it on the crystal, with a few good scratches across the face, however, mechanically it is precise as the day I received it. I've never had a problem with the watch, which is surprising considering all that it goes through. I love the look of the Ocean Ghost, it goes with just about anything! It's definitely a noticeable watch, smaller than my Russian Diver, but definitely bigger than any seiko or citizen. It's hefty, which could be considered it's only drawback since it did take some getting used to. Anyways, if you're thinking about this watch, get it. It's definitely worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plugs, great price","review":"I have several CAT 5 wires with broken plugs from various moves and wanted a cost effective way to continue using them.

I type a lot and give any keyboard a workout. The Tru-form Pro Media Contoured Touchpad Keyboard, is not durable enough for my use. I mean, a functional space bar is essential. I also noted that almost all of the keys have to be depressed exactly at the correct angle or there is a crunching sound. I approached Adesso for an exchange for a different board, but, after a month, they are still dragging their feet. Do not purchase this keyboard if you need a durable piece of equipment. Iam out a chunk of change and still typing on a keyboard I purchased at Goodwill a good while back.

I have an Evenflo convertible carseat which I am still using rear facing for my 19 month old. I did not get the seatsaver version with the taller part on the back because I already had a kick pad for my son to protect the seat back. I have a newer model Honda Civic and this seatsaver does not fit well from front to back, the pockets are way up on the seat and unusable for storage. The carseat also slides around on the hard plastic top of the saver. The saver does NOT move around on the seat and it is easy to get to the LATCH system since the notches are large which is nice. Wish this product was larger overall and had the no-slip grip on both sides. So no I would not recommend it for a convertible carseat in an '09 Honda Civic.

After seeing Ladysmith at the Simon concert I became intrigued with the complex chord structuring and hauntingly beautiful intertwined harmonies.

This random, never shown again performance on PBS was truly great in my book and I'm so glad to finally have it in my collection. Now my little girl is going to hop and sing around the living room trying to imitate the high kicks and octaves of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. That was my first introduction to a now lifelong devotion to a remarkable group. I'm so happy to finally get to introduce this soundtrack to my family! And this is by far the best recording of the Lion Sleeps Tonight ever. Disney should've snapped this up and put it on their soundtrack of The Lion King movie.***From this review, maybe a year after posting this, someone with the vhs let me buy their copy and also sent it over with it burned on a dvd.

What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Word of God, spoken","review":"You can follow this movie through the Book of St. John in the New Testament, and see that it is a word for word representation of that book. What a wonderful blessing to find a movie about Jesus Christ that has not been \\"adpated\\" to someone else's interpretation. I have watched this movie more times than I can count, as I love to hear the Words of my Lord being spoken to me; I often turn it on at night as I climb in bed, and find comfort falling asleep to His words, with the assurance that they are true to the Bible.Thank you for making this film true to His Word! Very well acted and produced; very realistic; really brings the Book to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having a turd in your brownie","review":"This comes with two versions. A fairly accurate version that is based on a flawed but reasonable bible translation. The acting and thematic elements are very good.The turd in this brownie is that they discredit the authorship of John for this book at the beginning. There is much to say about that. Considering the church went hundreds and hundreds of years knowing it was authored by John, for them to come out and use modern critical foolishness to discredit the book at the beginning really makes me angry.It's crazy hard to extract the content, remove the offending intro & reburn the dvd. that is the only way I'll be able to keep this in our household. Otherwise it is going in the trash.What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer than most, but still with errors","review":"This is one of the better Bible movies I have seen (not a big compliment). However, it is filled with errors. The one glaring error that stays with me is when Jesus heals the Centurion's servant (Matthew 8). In this movie, Jesus acts like he despises the Centurion and is going out of his way to do it, when in actual Scripture (Matthew 8) Jesus admired and honored the man for his faith and humility.This is just another example of sloppiness and error with Scripture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospel of John","review":"Great dvd....follows the bible scripture in detail, narrations and the character of Jesus wonderfully done.

It did well in showing Jesus' passion and brought alive how shocking some of His teaching was to those who heard Him. I'm not used to the translation, so some of the verses seemed off from what I expected, but it was good in that it was easy to understand and follow. I praise God that He uses movies to give a greater idea of how these events took place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best portrayal of JESUS ever!","review":"I do believe I have seen every movie possible of Jesus and this portrayal, for me, vividly brought to life just the way I had imagined Christ to be.

I have watched the 3 hour version of this movie many times. It follows the scriptures from the New Testament book of John from beginning to end. It feels like you are right there with our Lord Jesus, (wonderful) and His word does not change. I would recommend this to a mature Christian or someone who has never heard of the story of Jesus. Good for the whole family (not too graphic), so younger viewers may watch too. It will touch your heart. Enjoy the acting, but let the living word of God feed your spirit as you are entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible portrayal of Jesus.","review":"This high-quality production provides a close look into the life of Christ from the eye-witness testimony of the Apostle John. Not only does this film do a decent job of incorporating the culture and atmosphere of ancient Israel, it achieves a natural depiction of Jesus' personality and character by portraying him in the way the Gospel account describes. There are some geographical aspects of the film that are somewhat exaggerated (e.g., the Lake of Galilee appearing like the ocean front on the Oregon coast, elaborate housing structures in villages where Jesus walked). But the message is maintained and this film does an incredible job at incorporating realistic graphics of Herod's temple in Jerusalem, the rolling hills leading down from the Mount of Olives, and structure of the wall surrounding the temple.This film is entertaining, but can also be a great learning tool to visually relate to the Gospel of John."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospel of John","review":"The information and portrayals were very nicely done. Some of the dramatizations are among the best I've ever seen. The depiction of the cruficifictioned was weak but that holds true for most re-enactments that have been produced. This is a good production overall that I would not hesitate to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed my Sheep","review":"This is one of the best DVDs depicting the story of Jesus Christ that I have ever seen. Narrated by Golden Globe Nominee Christopher Plummer(also plays Herod in Jesus of Nazareth), it gives the viewer an excellent look into the life of Jesus as seen through the eyes and gospel of his disciple John. It is exciting and very moving from start to finish - THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES! \\"a definitive and scriptural masterpiece.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Piece","review":"This is a wonderful piece that truly captures the essence of the story St. John puts out on paper. The narration by Christopher Plummer is wonderful and spectacular performances by Stuart Bunce as John and particularly Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus. He has changed the way Jesus is portrayed from a cut off savior, to a very human man. Also beautiful cinematography. The film is very well put together and a treat for any Christian to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought the Gospel of John was Fantastic!The scenery, costumes and of course the Gospel were beautiful.Some of the other reviewers complained that Jesus smiled to much, why?! I believe that Jesus is the embodiment of ultimate Love, so why wouldn't he smile from time to time? I found this portrayal of Jesus to be the most personable and loving that I have seen on screen to date. I would love to see this cast and director tackle other books of the Bible. WELL DONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I highly recommend this film. It's superb!!! A beautiful production...simply gorgeous.

It is also an excellent study aid for children. Worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful movie!","review":"I was blown away by the beauty of this movie and the accuracy of the dialogue. Coupled with the awesome THE ROCK & THE RABBI, which is a live performance showing in Orlando, one does not need to see anything else to make a decision whether Jesus is God.This movie should be seen by everyone interested in what is happening in the Middle East right now, and those searching for answers about God, Christ and Isreal. It is a must-see for all humans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite New Testament movie","review":"I teach religion at a Catholic prep school, and I often use video clips in class. I have lots of films I like for teaching the Hebrew Bible, but I've had a hard time finding New Testament films I like. This one is great!This movie is based on the \\"Good News Bible\\" and is very faithful to the biblical text. The production values are good, and the acting is generally good. I especially like the portrayal of Jesus by Henry Ian Cusick, who played Desmond in the TV series \\"Lost,\\" and my students get a kick out of seeing him in this role.The DVD set includes the full three-hour version of the film and also an edited-down two-hour version.A warning: This film has been incorporated into the \\"Visual Bible\\" series, but the other two films in the series, \\"Acts\\" and \\"Matthew,\\" have nothing else in common with this one. They are poorly acted and poorly directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"the gospel of john on this dvd is really made profesionally.it is done so acurate that it brought me back to the times of JESUS at least that's what i think.it is a must see movie for everyone.thank you very much.bogey..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Magdalen?","review":"I saw this film on the big screen, drove miles to see it. It started great, the photography and costumes were beautiful, character portrayals were better than average.But who was that woman hanging out with the guys all the time? Apparently the screen writers thought they could improve on the Gospel-as-originally-written and made Mary Magdalen into a sort of 13th apostle. Why, why, why? Why isn't the Gospel good enough as it is? Why do people have to throw in their private improvements? I can only suppose that, if they were Jesus, they would have done things differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gospel of John","review":"Unfortunately I am unable to provide a review for the 'Gospel of John' DVD that was sent recently because the DVD that was sent is for replay on NTSC.

The Lord is certainly glorified through him.I had a small problem with the rest of the cast, like why wasn't Peter (Daniel) playing Judas, (wouldn't have to over and under-act so much) and the supposedly intelligent Nathanael was played by an actor who looked just the opposite...my little daughter said: well, he's gotto be the laughingstock.So in my opinion the cast was better in the old Jesus Film, but both the Jesus characters were equally good.I guess it's just like in reality...Jesus is perfect, and the rest of us...well....thanks for the great movie....make more please"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of John","review":"This video quotes come from a book that was written as someone other than God wanted to tell the story.

Among other shortcomings, this is by far the worst. Catholics beware. This is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Jesus have that weird smirk on his face?","review":"My brother raved about this movie, and so I foolishly bought it without seeing it first. What a disappointment. It was long and boring, but worst of all, Jesus walks around the whole time with this odd, vacant half-smile on his face, as if this is just a game. If you want to see a realistic view of Jesus' experience, watch The Passion. Gross, but true-to-life.My last word on the subject: \\"loving\\" does not equal \\"always smiling and soft-spoken.\\" Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Faithful","review":"The opening credit purports that the story is \\"faithful to the Scriptures.\\" Well, almost. The writer, producer or director must have been influenced by the Dan Brown heresy that Jesus had a girl friend, because the same attractive woman is displayed several times and even sits at the last supper. Show me in any of the New Testament Scriptures where a woman was at the Last Supper with the 12 Apostles. Well, there wasn't any, because it would have been mentioned if true. As soon as I saw this, I stopped watching it. Jesus was without sin, for all you almost-Christians, and as the Son of God bringing salvation to Mankind, had no reason to marry or have a girl friend. Nowhere in the Scriptures, NT or OT, does it mention or allude to this. If you want the true story, read the Synoptic Gospels and the Scriptural Gospel of St. John. Two stars is a gift because of the production values otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on the movie part. Terrible on the \\"scholarly\\" remarks parts.","review":"This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portrayingthe Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand. The so-called \\"scholarly\\"comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate. Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this.It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tearit down at the same time. The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rdDVD. I gave the movie to a relative without that add on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most-Loved: The Gospel of John","review":"I love most the Gospel of John among the four gospels. It's about TRUTH and LOVE, which is JESUS CHRIST. I can say that this is my favourite movie about our Lord and Saviour. The actor did a fantastic job portraying Jesus. You can really connect to Him, both as human and divine. While watching it, it's like you are a student listening to the GREAT TEACHER with his divine teachings of truth and love. The teachings are music to ears, food for the soul. You can never get tired of listening to the teachings of Jesus Christ. The way the actor did it is very convincing. The movie is great, and we can really contemplate and reflect on how God loves us, how Jesus Christ loves us. God is just, as well as merciful and loving. He loves us too much that He sent His Only Son for us to be redeemed. Please go and watch this movie. You will never get tired watching it over and over again. I love it!!! Go and keep one for yourself. Be blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly woven, Wholly captivating.","review":"This is so impressively woven.

Suitable for all family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally moving and artistic view of the life of Christ Jesus","review":"My family and I enjoyed this film and its accompanying DVD featuring a revealing documentary about the making of the film and an in-depth commentary feature. For me, the word-by-word film based on the American Bible Society;s Good news Bible spoke to my soul because it transported me to the time and into Jesus' heart. Henry ian Cusick does not give a Hollywood-esque performance as Jesus. He speaks from the heart and often speaks more through simple looks. The cinematographer wisely focuses in on his eyes which are expressive. It is very dramatic yet personal in its feel. I would encourage anyone who loves film and wants to know Jesus in a personal way to see this film. Afterwards, read the Gospel of John. God bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bible movie","review":"This was one of the best biblical movies ever made because it was accurate. The acting was great and followed the Gospel according to John accurately. I highly recommend you see this movie and read the Gospel as well. Finding the Truth about who Jesus Christ is and what He spoke of and teached is priceless. Watch the three hour version, every word that Christ utters is priceless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WALKING ON WATER MADE THE MOVIE","review":"The Gospel of John was wonderful, you get a 2dics set to see it in a play format( I could do without this one) and the other disc shows the movie verison, it shows Jesus walking on water and that made the movie, I haven't seen that in any of the other Jesus movies that I have collected for my mother's video library. I would say that it was that part in the movie that made it along with other miracles that are often over looked by some of the other movies like the wine at the wedding among others. I would recommend it as any video addition or even as a start up collection. I enjoyed it and have watched it several times to get more understanding with each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This depiction of the life of Jesus Christ is the most accurate portrayal that I have ever seen.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospel of John","review":"Love this movie. Probably the best movie made about the life of Jesus. This version has 2 full copies of the movie; one is the entire book of John - every line and verse and the other is a more condensed \\"movie version.\\" This makes an excellent resource for teachers and pastors as well. Why just read a verse, when you can play it for your students?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh production!","review":"I enjoyed this fresh production of Jesus' ministry. The Gospel of John was succinct and very well acted.I bought a copy of this for a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine movie!","review":"I was struck by the firebrand nature that the movie portrayed Jesus to be. I have never understood why many folks think Jesus to be effiminate or sorrowful or downcast.I have to take a minor issue with those who knock the film due to an unusually 'happy' Jesus. While enjoying the company of his flock, Jesus was happy and thus naturally smiling. He is the Son of Man and of God. He knows the paradise he came from and where he is going - who wouldn't be full of joy with that kind of security? While in the midst of the false teachers, Jesus was annoyed, angry and blunt. Seems natural to me.I rented this from Blockbuster online and was not too excited about seeing it, but after having watched it am greatly impressed with the narration, scenery, acting and dialogue.Good movie and recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewish Jesus","review":"It's great to see Jesus portrayed - as a Jewish looking guy- with brown eyes.

I was hoping to find this movie differentin some ways, being that it was His life according to John only. I was very pleased with it. For the first time theydepicted Jesus as looking Jewish which He was- and very believable in character. The two hour version seemed to \\"skim\\"over details a bit- but obviously because of time constraints. So much to say in so little time.

The narrative went verse by verse and the dramatization was extremely well done; professional and engaging.

Gatton was one of those artists!! This CD is rather wide-ranging; it covers a lot of ground, with jazz, rock, etc. If you like big, echoey, American-style electric guitar, this is your CD. I could listen to \\"Quiet Village\\" and \\"In My Room\\" again and again. I could, on the other hand, cut out \\"The Simpsons\\", and on some selections there is too much saxophone(those reasons are why I gave the CD only 4 stars). I will undoubtedly purchase another Gatton CD. This is good stuff from someone that, as others have pointed out, ranked among the top guitar players in America. It shows in each and every selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful record.","review":"One of the great driving records of all time, and a great party record too, this CD is one of the cornerstones of my collection.

It is yet another example of how subjects thoroughly researched can be of interest to more than just the author. Thank you, Mr. Hillerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Hillerman again does what he does best -- a quick paced entertaining mystery - I read this right before Clancy's Rainbow Six - and Hillerman has it all over Clancy -- Hillerman has never become complacent in his writing and he continues to entertain. Chee, Leaphorn and Pete are among the best fictional characters going and Hillerman sees to it that they stay that way in his latest. Must Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillerman country","review":"I read every Hillerman novel during a trip to Arizona and Canyon de Chelly. It was a good way to discover Navaho history and culture, past and present. It was perfect reading for the trip and greatly enhanced my experience. I have kept all the books for when I want to relive that trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Hillerman - A continuation of excellence","review":"As with all the Hillerman books in the past, I loved \\"The First Eagle\\". Once again, Hillerman has been able to transport the reader into the storyline, giving one a sense of ownership with the characters. Joe Leaphorn moves into the next phase of his life, actually showing signs of excitement and youth again. Jim Chee also sees life in a different vain, moving forward in his own right. With precise research, creative visualization and a mixture of charm and wit, Tony Hillerman has indeed written another winner. Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"As a longtime Hillerman fan, there some things I expect in his books (vivid descriptions of a land the author clearly loves, gentle and often humorous evocations of Navajo culture, compelling characters) and some things I know better than to expect (an unpredictable plot, a graceful conclusion). With \\"First Eagle,\\" however, Hillerman managed to limbo under even my modest plot expectations, and he didn't have much to show me about Navajo culture in this yarn either. I won't hold it against him. I'll loyally read the next book, but I'm not so forgiving with the editor. All through \\"First Eagle\\" characters are surprised to discover something they were told two chapters back, and their short-term memories are clearly failing them when they recount events or conversations. It was a shoddy editing job if it can be called editing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the early ones!","review":"Read the early ones -- \\"Blessing Way\\" and so forth. They are wonderful -- funny, suspenseful, warm, and very visual -- with interesting depictions of Navajo life.The later ones attempt to deal with Big Issues and have somehow lost most of the warmth, humor, team interaction amongst the police -- and the local and cultural color....and this is definitely not one to read when eating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and stale.","review":"Let's get to the bottom line. Save your $ and several hours of your precious time. If you must read it, simply check it out of the library. Don't waste your money on the future paperback edition. Woefully disappointing.

Next time, Tony, don't bother trying to impress us with your research on the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillerman needs to visit Northern Arizona","review":"Having been a resident of Flagstaff, and happening to live there when this book came out, I was sorely disappointed to read Hillerman's erroneous descriptions of the area. There is no bistro east of Flagstaff. The only thing east of Flagstaff before Winslow is the Winona Texaco and Meteor Crater and a lot of juniper bushes and dirt. And the route that Leaphorn and his lady friend, the \\"professor,\\" take from Cameron to Tuba City in one chapter is impossible to take because it does not exist! Any road atlas would confirm this.I now wonder how many of his other books have as many glaring errors as this one. This was a real letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"I thought that the book was very boring and was really uninteresting. It started out o.k. I guess but after that it just started to drag on and wasn't interesting at all. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are looking for an exciting mystery, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coasting","review":"From most authors, this would be an impressive book. From Hillerman, it is not. He's coasting with this one -- worth reading, but don't buy it. I checked mine out of the library.Yes, it has Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, and it's set on the reservation. But the precipitating conflict is between two non-Native American researchers on the reservation. Leaphorn gets hired by one of the researcher's parents to solve her disappearance. Glimpses of Navajo culture and thinking, and Hopi culture, are here. But they are only glimpses, of what was fully laid out in exquisite and compassionate detail in Hillerman's previous books.As other reviewers note, this appears to be a \\"rush\\" book. I finished it in less than 24 hours after I picked it up. The hardback edition is 278 pages long, _but_ there are 31 lines per page, instead of the typical 40+ lines per page most hardbacks have. If you've heard great things about Hillerman, they're true -- but NOT in this book. Please start with one of his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provides some entertainment but falls short.","review":"I read this book in college for Cultural Anthropology to study the cultural aspects and customs of Native American reservations and its citizens. The novel provided some insight on social standings and customs but in terms of entertainment it falls quite short, as it is quite predictable and not overly fulfilling.The writing is simply enough to provide the casual reader to breeze through chapters and the length of the novel is not overwhemling by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"a question of eagles","review":"I am very familiar with this series, so I expected to like this book, and I was not disappointed. The mystery was deliciously complicated, bringing together disperate threads that, finally, wove themselves into a very nice, logical web. I especially enjoy the background against which these stories are set, and the Navajo and Hopi cultures are far more than touches which make this series unique. In fact, they are a necessary part of the fabric of the story, and the foundations on which the main characters stand. This book was written in 1998, but it is in no way dated. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillerman mystery series","review":"I've read all of Tony Hillerman's books, primarily for the mysteries, but also for the setting and the unique education he passes along about the Hopi and Navajo indians. This is a typical good mystery by Hillerman, but a little atypical as relates to his penchant for mysticism and indian culture; there is relatively little. His characters are continuing down their developmental paths, retirement, a starcrossed romantic relationship and an up and coming sleuth. Their development is center stage in this book, and provide a good read, but I was expecting the normal mix of indian lore, superstition, and hard desert living that you normally get from Hillerman.George E. Miller, author of The Lone War Cry"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I always didn't wanted to know about Prairie Dogs.","review":"What happened? Have been devoted Hillerman fan since the very beginning. I didn't really want to take a course in mammal biology, I prefer the old Chee and Leaphorn. Also getting tired of Chee persuing Janet. This book goes on and on don't know if I'll ever finish it. Which is a shame. I usually indulge myself with a full day of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"To little too fast.","review":"I am sorry to say it but Hillerman tried to put something together with bits and pieces and they just don't hold together. Relationships are started, or restarted, and then the reader is given to little additional information to flesh out what the author is trying to convey. Where he realy missed the boat is not in developing the relationships between the Hopi and Navajo. Also much more about the Hopi and their culture would have made the book much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with past Chee and Leaphorn stories.","review":"I felt a bit cheated. Details missing. A rather boring story. I'm hoping that the pressure put upon Mr. Hillerman by his fans to produce more and more Chee and Leaphorn will not result in more loss of quality.

My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one. I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book falls short of Hillerman's earlier works.","review":"Hillerman has written many great stories. This is not one of them. I love visualizing the landscape painted by Hillerman and the characters he develops with Longhorn and Chee. However he did not do either of these things with his usual adeptness. He appears to have written this one in a hurry. The details are lacking, the characters a re stagnant, and at one point dialog actually becomes confused. The First Eagle does not rate with HIllerman's earlier works. I will still anxioulsy await Hillerman's next release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Humble Pie .....Not so Humble","review":"For those Humble Pie fans, who started with Live at the Filmore or Rock On, As Safe as Yesterday Is, an Immediate release, is a great cd to revisit the evolution of the band. Great song writing, instrumentation, vocals, guitar, bass drums and occaissional organ. Great guitar hooks et all.Stick Shift, As Safe as Yesterday Is, Alabama 69, I'll Go Alone and A Nifty Little Number Like You are some of the highlights. Alabama 69 boasts an epilogue with sitar that is very cool but definitely not representational of the band, a rare track if you will.

There are enough poems in here ranging from 'superb' to 'good enough' to make this worth buying.The poem \\"Drink\\" is hilarious. Buk takes us into a New Orleans bar and excellently describes what he sees. The dark humor in it keeps me coming back to it.\\"Until it hurts\\" is a poem about writer. It's a statement to any true writer.Betting on the Muse has the usual fare: getting drunk, hanging at the horsetrack, woman troubles... and it never gets tiresome; but it also has Buk's words of wisdom about life and the process & meaning of writing.I'd recommend this book above any of Buk's other collections.I give 5 stars because as far as collections go it's about as consistent, from page to page, as you could ever hope for"},{"rating":"2","title":"intense human emotion perfectly put into words","review":"Charles Bukowski holds nothing back, which is the beauty of his punch-to-the-gut stories and poems. He knew what he wanted to say and he said it--with no frills, no window dressing. Bukowski loved life and hated life, but he always lived it to the fullest; whether seducing hotel maids with cheap whiskey or losing all his money at the racetrack, every day was an adventure for him.

Someone should have maybe suggested to the casting director that the vampire should be scary. This particular Count was actually starting to remind me of the guy who played Larry on Three's Company.

Also the recording quality wasn't good, the voices were unnecessarily harsh and unpleasant, and worst of all, the parts of the book that would have been the most useful to have recorded were only in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor.","review":"The audio quality of the tapes is very poor (it was recorded for foreign service training in the 50's). They do not help you with pronounciation, verb tenses, or word order, and the speaking is very quick and cut-off. The whole course is thousands of phrases written in both english and german in the book, and dictated in german on the tapes so you can follow along. Unless you can memorize sounds instantly, you will constantly be rewinding and relistening to the tapes. I found this to be a waste of money and regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conversational German with 12 audio tapes","review":"At the end of this set of lessons, you'll have about 1400 German words in your vocabulary, plus a useful knowledge of German grammar and some semblance of correct pronunciation, stress and intonation.It is a bit difficult, at first, to relate the audio tapes to the book text because the book has content that is not in the tapes.I recommend that you use How to Pronounce German Correctly, the book and audio tape, while you use Mastering German Level 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tim's heart!","review":"The first time I listened to the CD, I was blown away by how Tim led me into worship. His desire is to bring us into the presence of the Lord, and he has succeeded in this CD. His heart is pure and the fruit is revealed in the words in each and every song. I was also amazed at how easily the words came to me though I had never heard any of the songs other than \\"Here I Am To Worship\\". Tim, if you read these reviews, you have succeeded in your goals of writing songs that lead us into His presence with easy to learn lyrics. Well done good and faithful servant!

Why? How is it controlled? Well, the answer to that question is the easy part, getting back home in one piece is the fun one... prepare yourselves for giant dragonflies, lots of new monsters, pirates, spider swarms, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" expeditions complete with cannon fodder (um, I mean servants), and a nice arch-rival you might have heard of, goes by the name of Tiamat..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Module Ever","review":"I have recently been filling in some gaps in my classic module collection.This one really is not worth owning. Bad plot, stupid encounters and bizarre text. The PC characters provided (who you really have to use since the entire module is coded around them) have great names like Blondie, Slim and Blaze. There is boxed dialogue where NPCs say things like, 'Gee Whiz.' and 'Golly.'I have nearly all the classic modules and this one is one of the worst.

This installation overall went pretty well. Some of the joints were a little tight, but no big deal. I've see Jeeps roll several times with this cage installed, and it came through with no damage at all (besides scratches). The cage did not come with the mounting hardware. I had to call the manufacturer and get a hardware kit sent out. My biggest con with this product is the fact that it comes unfinished.

In a week and a half, they left me a voice message telling me that they were unable to send the bracket but I could order a new Clamp Buddy, remove the bracket, and then return the Clamp Buddy with the missing part. This has been a horrible first experience and I never want to do business with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - not great but not bad","review":"I wanted something mobile to hold my clamps, for the price this looked like it would fit the bill.This came packed in the cheapest cardboard I have ever seen, sad as it weighs about 20 pounds and has to go through the UPS/Fedex system. Mine came fast having Amazon Prime, but even so, the top bar on the longer side of the rack was majorly bent - see my picture. This does not affect the rack I guess, I can still hang clamps there and the other parts still bolt on OK, its just not perfect.Assembly was easy by myself, took about 10 minutes. All hardware was in the box. The casters swivel OK, but one makes a noticeable squeak like it is catching somewhere, this noticed after I loaded up the rack. I really don't care, its not like i will be pushing the rack all around every day, again its just not perfect.For what it is, it is not bad.

I call \\"Compositions\\" her best album this side of \\"Rapture.\\" Her powerful voice delivers on such songs as \\"Talk to Me,\\" \\"Fairy Tales,\\" \\"Whatever It Takes,\\" and \\"No One to Blame.\\" My favorite song is \\"Soul Inspiration,\\" because I play that song with my wife sitting on the couch and me lip-syncing to her. The musicians are also something to listen to, and Greg Phillinganes' piano solos on such songs as \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Fairy Tales\\" absolutely blow me away!

This is just one hour of footage from his funeral, intermixed with 5-10 second clips from his visits to places around the world - mostly just him waving his arm hello, or reciting prayers or giving speeches.It is not presented chronologically, there is no story line or narrative, and it would not help you understand who is was, what he stood for, and what he even did with his time on this earth, except for be the pope, wave to an audience and give a few speeches.Not a movie but a video scrapbook.

It had some great stories in it. This second installment, though, just was lacking. I just had the feeling that this book got all the stories that weren't quite good enough for the first one. Unfortunately, they wouldn't be good enough for a third, fourth, fifth, etc., book either. If you want some good zombie stories go to the Home Page of the Dead site and check out the fan fiction section. Oh, there's quite a few stinkers there as well but there's also, in my opionion, even more that show some real artistic quality. Definitely quite a few that are better than anything in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I bought it twice!","review":"I originally purchased this book over 15 years ago.

Highly recommended for the Zombie literature fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and dull--save your money","review":"The original, \\"The Book of the Dead\\", to which this is a sequel, is much better simply because at least 2 stories somewhat approach what most of us want in survival horror. I won't repeat what I wrote there (feel free to check out my review), but this book isn't worth the time or money. The stories are far too cutesy, as though, in trying to present new perspectives, every writer drew from the same cliched examples.Nothing here as cool as the terrific ending to Resident Evil (the movie), the tunnel scenes in The Stand, or the Manhattan scenes in Swan Song--and the last 2 aren't even zombie stories! A better book--though much harder to find--might be Bryan Keene's The Rising.Certainly a much scarier book is Noel Hynd's Ghosts.Avoid these 2 books--The Book of the Dead and Still Dead. Not only are they not scary--they're dull!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Little More","review":"This book did a great job of covering the pure factual information regarding the failure of the IMF. However, its main weak point comes in the fact that, despite recounting the events surrounding the Asian crisis, it does not contain enough information that is new and never-before told. When I read a book on world economic issues, I expect to learn a variety of new opinions and little-known facts, and Blustein did not do enough of this. The book was not an eye-opener to the workings of the IMF, and this was a huge dissapointment as far as I am concerned. I actually fell asleep midway through due to the monontonous meanderings of Blustein's antics, and I would suggest getting it out of the library before even considering adding it to your collection. I really expected more from it, and was struck by just how uninspiring it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Verified Purchase","review":"It is a fascinating account; flows well.

I would never use it again. Beardsley seems to not understand that one need not include EVERY detail regarding EVERY person who ever made a comment on some issue of aesthetics. The result is a confusing and cluttered read that drowns one in a myraid of loosely related facts. A bigger problem is: I'm not sure that anyone else tries to do what Beardsley does - present a survey, with analysis, of the history of western aesthetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I bought the TENS Clean-Cote Protective Wipes believing them to have some sort of protective coating on them for skin that is sensitive to the electrode pads. What did I get? A box of 50 alcohol wipes that I can get for nothing from my sister who is a nurse. This is blatant misrepresentation of goods. I am a frequent customer on Amazon and like to think that when I buy from an Amazon seller, I am getting what is advertised. I am outraged that BalegoOnline.org so openly rips off people with disabilities. Unfortunately, I opened a packet before reading the ingredients which, I guess, nullifies a return. $10.50 is a heck of a lot of money to pay for alcohol wipes. I can buy a huge bottle of rubbing alcohol for $2. at Walmart.

It says only 50 calories and 13 grams of sugar, but that is PER SERVING and there are 2.5 servings per bottle.

You might be better off taking a vitamin and drink diet soda or flavored water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"I love Vitamin Water. All of the flavors I have tried have been great. It is refreshing and GOOD FOR YOU! I drink this now instead of Soda. While they are flavored they aren't overpowering, and are not super sweet.

And before she put them on we both commented on how poorly they were constructed. Also the size was way off. We think they sent men's size rather than woman's.One of our criteria for buying anything is made in the USA. Before we ordered these shoes I asked if they were American made. I was informed that they were made in Canada. Of course, we trust the craftsmanship of our neighbors from the north.

My ankle bone has given me problems for years and I really do need to try shoes on before purchasing them. I was unwilling to keep trying various widths/sizes because it was too expensive to pay shipping and insurance fees everytime I purchased a pair that didn't fit. I saw someone wearing these shoes and I loved them and ordered them. I was disappointed when that ankle bone interfered with the fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these shoes!","review":"I have previously bought 2 pairs of this brand and now purchased another 2. I really like them - they are comfortable, easy to slip on/off and, here in the Pacific Northwest, can be worn casually as well as \\"a bit dressed up\\". They hold up very well. I have not found any defects on them whatsoever. I paid less than $40 for them not too long ago here in Amazon, and I'm surprised the price has been raised to over $60 now - perhaps it's because of the holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"World's best slipon!","review":"I'm on my fifth pair of these shoes and wear them almost everyday. They are super comfortable and can pretty much go everywhere. I wear them to work as my one foot swells during the day and top of the shoe stretches so it is still comfortable. Until I found Propet shoes, my other foot was sliding all around as I had to buy shoes way too big. They are easy to get on - even after knee surgery! The solid colors look good enough to wear with dress pants for those of us with extra wide feet that can't find dress shoes easily. All in all, a great buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not sized correctly","review":"I was so looking forward to wearing these shoes.But the heels were much too loose, and the shoe didn't fit properly around the ball of the foot.I walked in them for 5 minutes on my carpeted floors and decided that no additions or adjustments to the liners would make these shoes fit correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Fit","review":"I have purchase several different pairs of propet shoes. I am obviously a fan. I especially like the fact the there are no laces or the bulky pading around my ankle which I find very uncomfortable. I love the variety of widths.The only thing I could ask more of is more insole cushioning as I am on my feet for long periods of time. Overall propet shoes are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out-of-the-box comfy","review":"Have been looking for some sort of slip-on, well-made shoe for awhile. I lean toward soled moccasins while puttering around the house but they're not sturdy enough to take the dogs out, run to the store or walk to the mailbox particularly if the weather's crummy. These are perfect. Lightweight but sturdy and fit perfectly right out of the box. I'm normally a Sz 10-that wasn't an option with this material/color combination so I ordered the 10.5 thinking I could add an insole or thicker sox if they were a tad too big. I'm glad I did-I think the 10 would've been too snug. Haven't worn them a great deal yet but I'm expecting them to be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv these shoes!","review":"I bought these shoes because they were on clearance for 14.99(what a bargain!) and they appeared easy to slip on & off. These shoes are very well made. I am very hard on shoes but I believe these will last a very long time for me and I also like the fact that I can toss these in the washer. I would definitely buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most painful shoes I've ever worn","review":"I was pleased with these shoes when I first tried them on. They fit perfectly. Then I wore them for about an hour. I have never worn such uncomfortable shoes in my life. Even the cheapest shoes I ever owned did not hurt like these. There isn't enough padding in the front and the balls of my feet ached terribly, and this has never happened to me before. I got a blister on my instep, and blisters on both heels. I have bunions and hammer toes, and as long as I buy shoes wide enough at the toe area, they don't bother me. There was so much room, my toes kept overlapping and squishing my toes together, so that caused even more pain. I have been wearing easy spirit for about twenty years, and it looks like I will be wearing them another twenty. Now those shoes are comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for management and decision making","review":"Great management book from a Drucker standpoint. I respect Mr. Adizes work.

I picked these up at Costco for about 60 or so dollars last year and babied them. I properly burned them in, as advised from ilounge. They were great, and scratched the bass itch that grew from using shure's se210. Two months later however, the left side started failing, as if I blew the speaker. Mind you, my ipod's volume max is set at 1/3. Bad habit of mine for throwing away the packaging and I was stuck with broken headphones with no warranty. I went to bestbuy and picked up a pair of sony mdr-ex36v for $30 that peform better, costs less, has in-line volume control, and is reliable as my 20 year old 19 inch crt sony tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent sound, lousy durability","review":"I use these with an iPod, and pocket them rarely. I actually use them the most when using my home treadmill or walking the dog. Besides that I've used them on only two trips.They've developed a short and the sound intermittently goes in and out. Very annoying. They sure look flashy... oh and on that the blue finish has worn down considerably. Also the metal jacket that covers the male plug (the thing you stick into your iPod/whatever) came loose and slides up and down the earbud cable! Wow! Yes they are cheap!On the sound, not too shabby I guess. I use a cheap pair of Grados for most day to day listening. They seem really more balanced for drum and bass, and hip hop. Not really my main stay.I bought these on a whim, at Costco, right before a trip to South America. I recommend if you have the time shop around a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I got the newest version from amazon on April 6, 2009. Now, three months later after light use (walking) the left ear goes out. Now I have to return them and they make you pay for the shipping cost. WTF VMODA? The sound quality was good and they were comfortable but they really are not worth 50 dollars. Save your money and buy a proper set of earbuds. This is the worst item I have ever bought online and the company return policy stinks. They know that these break a lot yet they make you pay for the shipping. I emailed them before I bought these asking if the quality was better then the reviews made me believe. They told me that their engineers fixed the problem and that they would work for more then a year. Well here I am with a pair of useless earbuds that cost me 50 dollars and only worked for 3 months. Please, dont buy these unless you feel like returning them every three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I do not recommend these headphones. Sure the sound is great, bit after owning these little buggers for a short while the wire started to short out. i had to use take to hole the wire in place near the jack for the ear pieces to work.

Total waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - so far very durable","review":"Clearly if you want something great, you're going to need to spend a lot or pay close attention to deals online. I got these becuase I had a previous pair of V-Moda Bass and they worked great in the gym - but they cracked in my gym bag after 2 years. These are better from every perspective - sound better and are made better. I also like the small leather pouch that comes with them. After 3 months - zero complaints. I paid $26.99 for them and they were easily worth it. Very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality is horrible","review":"These headphones are horribily constructed. My first set stop working after 3 or 4 months under very minimal travel and normal use I use it when I'm on the computer,so not once did it get tugged off my ear. The sound just stop coming. Im on my second pair through vmoda warrianty and the left buds stopped working, in two days time- what the hell.Some says they sound good- but they never say compare to what, iPod headphones. Well sure it sounds good in that case. To me the bass was rich almost overpowering good for some not for all. I bought the shure se210 on amazon for 110 plus shipping. These feel so much more durable and sounds much more balanced. If your a bass person and you have an iPod use the equilzers. They work fine. These vmoda feels like an expensive overpriced toy-wait it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned 3 Pairs, ALL broke with under 5 Months of Use...But good sound","review":"PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BUY A PAIR OF V MODA VIBES READ THIS!!!!!I have owned 3 pairs of V moda vibes. The first 2 were from the 1st generation. I lost the channel in 1 ear IN BOTH OF THEM after only 3-4 months of usage. This is because the bend of the wire eventually caused it to tear ( you could hear in both ears only when you bent the wire back at a specific angle)However the sound quality was really good for the price so I decided to give the 2nd gen a try when it came out. They had made the audio plug at an angle instead of straight like the 1st gen, so i thought that the problem was fixed....What do you know...4 months later, I lost sound again in the left ear....same problemFolks, the sound quality is great, they are super comfy...but they dont last.....I spend almost 300 dollars on these and they didnt last over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Durability","review":"Really enjoyed these because they sounded great, but didn't last more than 3 months.

It is only a matter of time before one speaker stops working. This product looks and works great when it works but the quality is the worst I have ever seen. It starts shorting at the connection point to your device within 2-3 months of purchase. I do not recommned this product to anyone.The company must know about it but they have not made any attempts to fix their problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound and look, Badly designed audio jack","review":"If you are looking to buy these go with the Vibe II's. The original Vibe's have had the audio pickup jacket redesigned 3 times because of failure. I have had mine replaced twice under warranty, they broke again but I am out of warranty. Vmoda knows this is a design flow, just google it. Again, forgo these older models, THEY WILL BREAK."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbalanced","review":"I bought these to replace some v-moda ear buds that I had managed to crush in a move. The bass is really amazing. You can actually feel your eardrum shake like in a club. The only weird thing is it throws you off a bit with that sound quality when you don't feel the sound in your chest. It sounds great. The only problem is that the volume isn't balanced from left to right. Mine are actually louder in the left earpiece than in the right. I even switched ears to make sure that it wasn't just a bad ear, but it was the ear buds. Hopefully this is just a defect in this one set and not a reoccurring problem with other products of the same model. They are sturdy and I am very happy with them in every way, except for the lack of balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty","review":"I bought these because of the positive reviews. It took only 2-3 months for the left one to fry. I only used them in the Aviom our church orchestra uses for sound. I was very surprised when they bit the dust. I certainly won't buy any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THESE!!!","review":"As some others have written these sound great at first but they are NOT worth it. They will develop a short circuit in the plug after about a month of regular use. Then you'll only get sound from one side. It's happened to me with two different sets from different v-moda lines. To make matters worse, their customer service is terrible and will find any excuse not to honor the warranty. Save yourself the headache and find another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until they break, and they WILL break.","review":"I was one of those people who pours over reviews before buying anything. I saw that tons of people adored these earbuds. They're stylish, have great sound and deliver very nice bass. They were probably my favorite headphones I owned... until they broke. Like a NUMBER OF PEOPLE on this website have stated. After about four or five months of use (and only about 2 or 3 times a week) the sound in one headphone just \\"POP\\" died. That's not what I expect from $70 earphones (that's the price when I bought them). I, of course, didn't have my receipt so I couldn't get a refund. Please do not be like me and think that \\"Oh it probably won't happen to me.\\" Because it will. I used them gently and put them wrapped up in the case that was provided, in the fashion that v-moda suggested and they still broke. Don't take the chance. Keep searching! These aren't worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break!","review":"I thought i had defective pair of headphone until i started to read other reviews. I had the same problem that many other people have had...after a few months i noticed the left headphone sounded softer. It got softer and softer until i forced to stop using the headphones. While these are a great LOOKING pair of headphones do not invest in these if your looking for a product that will last. After having spent 80 dollars I have to go out and buy a different pair of headphone now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound in 1 earbud cutout after 4 months. Read other reviews.","review":"I would not recommend this product. Some reviews talked about the sound cutting out from one ear bud but I figured these were isolated incidences. I figured wrong. After only about 4 months of relatively light use with the volume never really going above 50%, sound in one of the ear buds has decreased significantly. The sound does not completely cut out so I do not believe it is an intermittent connection but rather some other defect. Subsequent searches through reviews have discovered several similar complaints of defective ear buds. One can only wonder how many others never took the time to write a similar review. Regardless of any possible warranty to pay this much money for these and have them consistently fail is frustrating, a waste of time and money, and indicative of a horrible product.My advice is to look to some other brand entirely. Avoid V-Moda. Trust me, and others, you will save yourself a lot of grief and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"These earbuds were great for my trip to Japan. Excellent for noise reduction and also hearing the movies provided while others in cabin were struggling to hear. Quality of sound to my ears great also from my iPod. Very comfortable to wear as well. Will get a pair of these for my sister as can't recommend anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Real Sound !","review":"I was a true Bose fan but I never thought these earphones would be a real contender. The sound is so lifelike and improved the more you hear them. The base is at a good level and you hear every tone clearly. The cable is a little annoying but thats a small issue. The plug works perfectly with the Itouch in a case which was not the case with my Bose because of the big square plug they use. All in all for the price you will get great sound with a very modern looking design that everyone will be asking you about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"These earbuds are not worth the price at all. As a matter of fact, they are pretty cheap.The cord is thin, and as much as I workout, they tangle easily creating a situation for easy breakage.The buds keep falling out of your ear no matter which size I use (s, m, l)and they slip out very few seconds...The noise cancelling job is pretty good though. The bass is nice, but as much as they slip out of your ear and tangle, it's not worth it. I regret wasting my time with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"The sound was great but the rubber around the plug ripped and exposed the wire. If you use your earbuds as much as I do, get one with a different kind of plug. The kind with the L shaped rubber with the \\"flex\\" ribs.

My particular pair is the gunmetal variety and they definitely are really sleek looking.Sound QualityThe bass was a touch overpowering in contrast to all the other notes but as I work in a loud call center environment I preferred that. However as time goes on the bass quality degrades and now my right earbud has gone from full sound to low sound to finally none over a week. This probably occurred due to pulling them out via the wire but still, depressing non the less.ComfortThey had quite a few earbud sizes but for me they still manage to fall out every so often on me.OverallI can't really recommend these as I bought these a year ago and they've already crapped out on me, disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down in less than a year","review":"The V-Moda Vibe look and sound great with plenty of bass.

Consider that they stay in my desk or in my ears at my desk while in use. Please just buy something else and save yourself the frustration. My last pair (Vmoda Duo) lasted less than two months. I am so tired of there slow and increasingly rude customer service. It seems the positive reviews on these ear buds are from people who havent been burnt yet.

Now I find that the bass is excellent.the Highs come through very crisp and clean. The mid range is slightly mellow, which I find suites the types of music I like. Others may like a sharper sound. You do hear things in the music you didn't hear before.I have had no issues with the earbuds not working, (I hope it stays that way). I am no expert but to me they sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Countdown","review":"We have bought 5 pair of these headphones. They should come with a countdown timer that shows you the product's life expectancy. If you are lucky, they will fail within warranty, otherwise you can be out for close to (or maybe more than) $100 after the one year coverage period. There is no exchange or repair alternatives offered, if they break, try using them for fishing. Problems noted include: volume failure or volume reduction in one or both sides or overall deterioration of the item itself.

Never again from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product but it falls appart and gets stuck in your ear canal.","review":"I purchased a set of these and after about 3 months a piece of steel mesh fell of and got stuck in my ear canal. All V Moda had to say was tuff and send them back for a replacement. you think that we should put this product in our ears?? That was 4 months ago. Since then i have heard nothing from them not even a phone call. Jesus they should be calling me. They have totally ignored the fact that the product failed big time and now i am out of pocket by a $100 and they have not sent me a replacement. DONT BOTHER WITH V MODA simply because they sell to you and then wave goodbye. I would not put any stars if there was a choice on the rate bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound, Poor Quality (at least first set)","review":"Ordered these based on reviews of others for the good sound, figuring the reported defects would have been ironed out. I used them less than 5 times while walking (and no other time, so less than 5 hours of service) and lost all sound in the left channel. I e-mailed company and they promptly sent return instructions...now waiting to see what happens (and had to spend money on earbuds to use while waiting). If I had it to do over, I would probably just buy the Koss buds I picked up at Wal-Mart for $20...not as much bass, but at least they work. When I spend $80 on a product, I expect there to be some type of quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price. As sound isolating as any in-ear headphone.","review":"Definitely a great buy. I used to have a Shure e2c but always got bothered by the size of the buds and the thickness of the cord. This guy offers the same sound quality, and their thing about fitting well is totally true.Selling these as sound isolating is a bit of a stretch, but in-ear headphones do have an isolation quality to them, and these are no exception. I also love the bass.So, audiophiles aside, if you're looking for something cool-looking (and not white), cool-sounding and affordable, do buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earphones - better than the Bose InEar","review":"I have been using the vibe's for about two weeks now. I first bought the Bose InEar, but returned them 2 days later. The Bose have good lows...but that's all they have. They have no mids or highs. It was very difficult understanding conversations in a video or movie. I even tried using the equalizer in Windows Media Player to get any decent sound out of them, but no luck.The vibe's on the other hand have great lows, mids, and highs. The sound is crisp and clear with a very good bass response. I recently bought a Zune and use these with it and love them.The sound isolation is not 100%, but 100% better then the Bose (which in my opinion did not isolate any external sound)Overall great product by v-moda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orgasmic","review":"i dont think i could have ordered a better pair of ear buds, it is definitely a great purchase and my best purchase as far as ear buds are concerned......as my title says, the sound quality from these ear buds is no less than ORGASMIC if you love to listen to your musik as i do with 35,000+ songs. highly recommended buy for anyone who appreciates all the qualities of musik.....this is a 150% upgrade from my skull candy earbuds which i cant count how many times ive requested warranty replacements on one hand, much less two"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"well when i got these, i wasn't impressed with the flashy packaging or the cute little pictures on the box.

Another thing, the sound quality wasn't even that great. they had SOME bass but thats about the only outstanding attribute. for comfort, they felt like every other pair of silicon buds. Also, the color \\"midnight blue\\" is a lie. Yes, they are blue, but its a light-teal-metallic-gayish blue. not the intimidating and sexy dark blue depicted on this website.

What's the use of amazing sound quality if only one side of the headphones work? Sure, it's okay, because they have a 2 year warranty, right? Nope- only from an \\"authorized reseller.\\" Apparently Sound Around Inc. was not one of them. My RMA request to V-Moda was rejected and had no way of RMA'ing with the vendor I bought it from.

My friend has a pair of these, so I thought I'd give them a chance, but it was not worth it.tl dr;Not worth the trouble, keep looking for headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound is ok, durability is poor","review":"I had no problems with the sound. I'm no audiophile, so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but I thought the sound was fine.My biggest problem is that they broke after 6 months of mild use. I used them perhaps twice a week (for an hour?) and never mistreated them, so there is no excuse for them breaking. The left headphone just stopped working, there were no disconnected cables or anything.My other complaint is about the cords. They have a flexible woven metal sheath. It has a horrible tendency to get bent & twisted up. Every time I used them I tried to straighten them out. Then I put them away in a pocket or backpack, pull them out and they're just as bent & tangled. I found it really annoying.Overall I would NOT buy again. After they broke I bought a replacement by a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but poor quality.","review":"The pair I got lasted about 4 months. While it lasted, the sound was good.And the isolation is ok, but not great.The problem is the wire connection to the earbuds is not strong enough.Gradually, one side started to become on and off, then both sides wereon and off.

And I DID handle it gently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but you need to get new inserts.","review":"I like the Vibe's sound. I'm a bass person and while these don't compete with over the ear headphones they are better than the cheepies that you get with your music player. However, none of the silicon ear inserts fit my ears. The small was too small where it wouldn't create a seal and thus you have no bass. The bigger one kept popping out of my ear as it was too big. I found some double flange replacement inserts that I bought as a replacement. With that change the Vibes are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THEM!

Okay, fine. I liked the sound and loved the looks.2nd pair: Wire broke at the base. Spent 2 weeks with some tape and wiggling the wire until I couldn't stand it anymore!3rd pair: Left side shorted out after 6 months. All I did was get up from my seat and the sound just disappears...it's ridiculous.Unfortunately, I didn't buy any of them under warranty, so no replacements (and I'm not sure I even want them now). I've been through quite a few pairs of sound isolating headphones and this definitely has the best looks (and sounds good), but this durability almost makes it a rip-off.Needless to say, I don't recommend these at all unless you can afford a new pair every half a year and can stand the frustration of having it break."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE'S THAT NAGGING QUESTION OF DURABILITY...","review":"I BOUGHT THESE EARBUDS FOR MY THEN TWENTY-YEAR-OLD DAUGHER TO USE WITH HER 32GB COWAN PERSONAL MEDIA PLAYER.

Better than the cheap designer phones, and not much more expensive. Plus, they look better.Comfort is amazing.

Then I swapped left and right and it was obviously the buds. In no time, everything had moved to one side. I pulled out some older buds and a set of full headphones to make sure. They worked fineIn no time everything was on one side.When I got these I also got a pair of V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds; less expensive, but I figured I could have an on the go pair, etc ... something to have when I didn't want to take the nicer ones.Same thing happened to those in a week.

But the box did say that it's bass heavy, so maybe not.Aside from my own preference these earbuds are great. I'm sure listening to other styles would be awesome.

All of a sudden one day the left earpiece just stopped working for no reason. The cord is fine, and the headphone case is fine, but it just stopped working.

I previously owned the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones and these also outperform them. As with other reviews, the \\"burn in\\" period is essential. When listening right out the box, it won't sound as good as expected until after the burn in.The overall quality of the earbuds so far is pretty good.

The quality was good, not great. The durability is the main problem here, after about 2 weeks there was static sounds whenever the cord was touched or moved, then one side stopped working intermittently, then stopped altogether. I am pissed off with this purchase. I've since bought some in-ear JVC ones for a fraction of the cost, and the sound quality is good.

The whole idea of spending a bit more, for me anyway, was to get a better, more realistic reproduction of the sounds I wanted to hear.. But while you get the bass, which is IMPORTANT, it is at the sacrifice of the higher end of the range.

They're shockingly comfortable and the sound isolation passes the New York City subway test with flying colors. Unfortunately, they're cheaply built and it appears the mini-jack isn't up to spec. After a few weeks, mine inexplicably decided it wouldn't work unless it was only inserted about halfway into the socket. (At first I blamed the socket but trying it on other devices made clear the phones were at fault: it looks like the jack is just ever-so-slightly too small!) This defect makes them pretty much useless. Some other reviews referred to there being three generations of this product, a quality first generation, a shoddy second generation, and a supposedly improved third generation identifiable by the 45 degree angled jack.

If this is ok with you, go ahead and get them, as they do sound good, just be warned you will be replacing them soon after. V Moda offered me 50% off new ones (list price- meaning I'd pay more than what Amazon sells them for everyday!).

I purchased this because I wanted a very good, low-profile set of ear buds and I didn't think spending over $90 made sense. I have tried many different ear-bud and headphone sets over the last several years and I feel this product is excellent. For over-the-ear headphones, I heavily compared the Bose noise-cancelling ones (both models) and the Sony Noise Cancelling ones and for about $150 less, I bought the Sony's and I'm very happy. I was recently on an airplane trip and the man next to me had the Bose noise cancelling headphones. He saw my Sony's and asked to switch for a while. We did - he thought my Sony's were just as good as his Bose and I did too. So, I am convinced that spending more money doesn't necessarily mean better quality. The V-Moda's Vibe Earbuds are an excellent example of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no microphone?","review":"In the products picture it look like there is an microphone on it, like the normal iPhone version has, but no...If you wish to here only music with it, it's very good, but if you wish to talk in the middle or here out side noises from the traffic (if you walk) it's risky."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I recently purchased these, about 1 month ago, and the left speaker blew out all ready!!

They look fantastic, the pictures don't do them justice. I'm no audiophile, but I found the sound quality to be quite good. They have good isolation, I was able to block out the noise in my office.So here's the gotcha: you get a year warranty and they probably won't last much more then that. On mine, the wire around the earbuds started to tear. Once that happens, the sound quality goes away.If you've got $90 to throw away on a fashion item to wear for a year and a half, get them. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound - while it lasts.","review":"Folks, take the advice of one of the elder statesman in this group; only buy these ear buds if you have a high threshold for aggravation.The sound VModa achieves is outstanding, albeit a bit heavy on the bass, but, overall, the listening experience is WONDERFUL - *while it lasts*.I had these ear buds for less than 30 days before the left channel went dead on a long overseas flight; nothing to do but break out the book at that point.I'm looking for something else, right now.

They look good and are stylishly designed and come with the remote answer/hangup button just like the original iphone headset. The sound was average. Quite acceptable, but not as good as my Shure e2c in-ear phones. Definitely recommned looking elsewhere if you're going to subject these to anything but the gentlest usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound, poor build quality","review":"Assuming they are functional, these headphones probably have the best sound quality at its price point.However, the right earphone shorted out a little over a year after moderate use. The wire near the headphone jack had become loose. V-MODA does NOT have a repair service at this time (I called)."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 months till left bud faded to nothing","review":"Had no problem with these for a few months and I liked the high quality/durability wrap around the wires. A little after 4 months, I noticed that the left bud was getting softer and it finally quit making any noise except for harsh distorted sounds during my spoken podcasts I listen to. Oh well, I bought them at a place I could still return them and got my money back but won't be buying another pair of these. It didn't appear that there was any wear on the wires, and if I wiggled it there was not the tell-tale \\"good, not good\\" sound when a wire is fraying or has a bad connection internally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole Lotta Bass","review":"I order these earbuds to replace a pair of OEM ipod earbuds. For the most part the reviewers talked them up pretty well and they seemed to be worth a try. The only way I can describe these earbuds are that they are very, very bass heavy. No amount of EQ could could correct this. If you love the sound of bass you will probably think these are the greatest but you can also buy bass heavy earbuds for $2 a pair all day long. Everyone has their own preference in the type of sound they like from a pair of earbuds. I know that these just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable... didn't last a month","review":"I recently purchased them for use on my iPod Nano. I use my iPod for everyday commute, I don't rough it up.2 weeks later the left earphone started to cut off the sound. You had to move and tweak the plug to get some sound out of it. Another 2 weeks and the same thing started happening with the right side.The sound was OK but for a price like this you're supposed to get the best quality.I ditched them and went back to my white earbuds. Hopefully someone at that company will have the courtesy of replying o replacing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far overpriced for what you get","review":"These headphones defiantly are not worth the cost. The sound quality is reasonably good but that is about the only good thing I have noticed about these headphones. The cable is wrapped with some type of braided cloth material that is horrible. Whenever it rubs against ANYTHING is creates a horrible disturbance in the ear buds.Bottom line: If you are going to be just sitting still all day then yes these headphones could be good for you. If you plan on walking and listening to music or if you like to put the headphone cable inside your shirt so that the ear buds pop out of the neck of your shirt get a different pair of headphones! Honestly I really like the sound quality and the noise isolation, but the cloth wrapped cord makes these headphones useless to me except for when I am not moving at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bass","review":"Worked really well but broke twice. Comes with a nice 1 year warrenty but make sure you don't send in your reciept without making a copy cause if you break it a second time, you still need the reciept. The bass is amazing but too much bending of the wire will cause one or both of the earphones to stop working so needs some taking care of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but they are DISPOSABLE","review":"These are 100 times better, sound wise, than the Apple earbuds that come with the iPhone. However, they are so poorly constructed that they develop problems within 6 to 9 months of use. Not what I expect of earphones that cost $100.00+. The company does have a warrantee program, but who wants to spend this much to jump through hoops returning the product (and you HAVE to follow their steps exactly, or they will not process the return) after only a few months of use?THere are better earphones on the market in the same price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! Only if they worked!!!","review":"If you look at most of the reviews at apple.com they speak the truth. They are nice looking but don't last. My pair lasted about 4 months before dying and I keep reading that the replacement pairs are just as bad so it gives me little hope.So keep you money. I paid over 100 for these so they are cheaper here but they still will die on you. I'm not sure how this company is still in business with these faulty headphones and multiple complaints. I'm just it's not like that for everyone but considering how many bad reviews there are for this item, I wouldn't take the chance.---UPDATE---I just sent them in for repair and they sent me the wrong pair back. My pair had the headset feature and the new pair doesn't!! Plus I heard the the jack is the issue and have already updated their pair with a new jack and this replacement pair has the old version. That's not right to me. I doubt this pair will last. Let's see what they say about their mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent sound/fit. Crapy audio jack.","review":"Agree with most previous reviewers.I like them a lot.But audio jack failed within 3 weeks of usage. It's still usable but very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, not durable enough","review":"For 8 months I used these fairly infrequently. Sound in the left ear broke away, like many others. They are extremely poorly designed because this happens to many throughout the internet. I don't think this product deserves stars because they need to do something instead of just ignoring the pink elephant in the room. $100 earphones in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear sound, sufficient bass and reasonable price","review":"Spending many days comparing different earbuds, I finally decided to give V-Moda a try. Since then (one month), I haven't been disappointed. Sound is clear (mp3s that have 192 kbps), bass is perfect for hip hop and rock and quality seems to be good too. The latter was a big concern of mine due to many customer reviews that complaint about quality. A redesign apparently solved this issue. The quality of these ones should be even better than the quality of the Bose ones because many friends of mine constantly loose the rubber and have to buy new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"V-Moda Vibe Earbuds","review":"I am really please with the sound quality and the comfort of these light weight, but durable earbuds. I recommend these to anyone who enjoys good sound and does not want to spend a bunch of money for the more expensive brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break","review":"These were great headphones for the first 6 months of owning them. I invested the ~$100 and so took very good care to put them in their case after every use and not tangle the wires. 4 months after I bought them, the wire just below the bud tore so that you could see the copper beneath. I did a quick fix using some super glue, being careful not to get it on the wires. 1 month later, the right bud died. It looks like the wire above the connection to the iPod is broken inside since when i move it, the sound comes in and out. Bottom line: good purchase for 4 months, but alas, something this good was not meant to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"High distortion","review":"I'm pretty picky about sound quality, and I purchased these based on the reviews here, and my assumption that higher-price = better quality. I found the build quality of these earbuds to be good, they fit well and were comfortable... but they just sounded bad. They are very bass heavy, which isn't entirely bad, but the bass was very harsh and distorted, even at low volume. The treble is very rolled-off, devoid of any high frequencies above about 8kHz. My recommendation is to look elsewhere for good sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon and poor sound","review":"I had the V-Moda bass and I left them on a plane. I purchased these as a replacement. I was a HUGE fan of the V-Moda Bass. They were much better than my friends expensive Shure buds.I used the Shure's at the gym for a week while I replaced mine. They are too heavy to work out in and have little bass. Anyway, I received my Vibe's and out of the box the left ear bud was DOA. The right bud had little sound quality as well. I sent them back and replaced with the Bass model and love them!! Might have gotten a lemon all around but I would not recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and comfortable but lack quality and durability","review":"Bought these in February 2008. At $80, they were the second most expensive headphones/earbuds I'd purchased. They broke last month. The left earbud just stopped working. I'd used them frequently with my iPod but not every day. I never thought they had the quality to justify the price, and even at $65, I don't think they are worth it. They were comfortable and I liked that they were small enough to wear while sleeping. But again, the quality of sound never was great, merely adequate. They are certainly better than the ones that you get with your media player, but not high end at all, in my experience. I have a pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise Cancelling headphones and you just can't beat the quality of sound these headphones provide. However, they are LARGE -- too large to wear outside or to bed at night. Thus the need for earbuds. I will not buy V-Moda again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but not for active use!","review":"Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed the sound quality in both pairs headphones that I have bought. I had to buy a second pair because the first pair (was destroyed by my cats when I was away on business). However I now feel they would have suffered the same fate. I workout several times a week and you would think that these headphones would hold up under moderate activity. However, from simply taking them in and out of my gym bag the rubber on the wires has begun to seperate and expose the inner wiring. I'm very careful and take great care of my things and this just seemed unavoidable. I have had to tape them in multiple places and this just looks so cheap. My Bose headphones have a much thicker coating around the wires and I am going to use them even though they are a little more bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"DO NOT BUY THESE EAR BUDS IN RED!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are advertising the wrong earbuds. this says they are the newer ones with the elbow jack, THEY ARE NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are the old strait jack ones. when i got mine it looked like the box had been opened and one of the little metal grill like things was missing.

I'll have to be more gentle with these...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound - BADDDD Durability/1 Year Warranty?","review":"I used these a couple of days a week. However, I would always ensure they were properly wrapped up. Either way, the black casing on the ends started to retreat, exposing the wires. Now, they will not work at all. And what is worst, I have only had these a little more than a year, so the warranty is not good any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor quality","review":"Like many others have written, mine sounded good while they lasted, but they broke after only a few months. Anything over a $10 pair of headphones should last longer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-pMODA Vibe Ear-Bugs","review":"I expected an $80 earbud to sound considerably better than the plastic one's that came with my iPod. Unfortunately, their description: \\"Hi-definition sculpted sound curve fashioned for discerning music enthusiasts\\" meant if you like listening to music coming from your phone. There was no fidelity to speak of. I was very disappointed. I had to send them back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage Hairball Wires","review":"These V-Moda headphones are garbage. I would only wish these on someone I disliked intensely.Why so negative?1. Sound quality is mediocre at best and volume is too low.2. The wires are made of some weird cloth coating that captures static electricity and in the dry winter months outdoors will cause the music to crackle and pop and you can even shock yourself.3. The wires seem to be designed to automatically know how to get into the biggest hairball mess of tangled cords in the least possible time. It's almost miraculous how quickly the cords get stuck in Gordian knots, no matter how carefully you stow them in the case.4. Uncomfortable in the ears- the metal parts rub on your ears after wearing them for more than a few minutes.5. Flimsy. The weird angled plug is because earlier versions fell apart after a few weeks. The new angled plug doesn't add much to durability and instead helps to make the cable tangle up more.Run away from these."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"BOUGHT THESE EARPHONES FROM AMAZING-BUY!

The connections eventually gives out and sound will start to fade form one of you earbuds. You jiggle it and it will come back but eventually the earbuds become useless. I thought I would not have this problem if take care of the earbuds and not use them in a rough manner, but that did not help. The product is badly made. I only used for 4 month. Now I am contacting vmoda just like the thousand other people. Even if I get the new earbudz what use are they if Vmoda has not addressed the real issue in craftmanship of their product. This sucks! DON'T BUY stick with shure; at least they lasted 1 year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I'm on my second set. The first one started after a few months, then a sort of pricking feeling in my left ear, like little electrical shocks. It got too bad to even use. I replaced them, and now only few months after that, the same problem again. $100 is too much to have to replace every six months or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, great fit, short life","review":"I had done a lot of research and had bought another pair of highly rated earbuds, only to find low bass response. Finally tried these Vibes. I loved the deep, rich bass (to me, not overpowering)--the only earbuds where I could really FEEL it. I also liked the good fit in the ear, blocking out other sounds. I also thought the wires looked sturdier than others. Well, here it is 2 years after I bought them, and like others have said, the wire leading into the jack frayed, leaving these basically useless. Too bad, since most else was very good. If you can go with less bass, try the Shure brand: they seem better built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor durability on my pair - customer service fails","review":"I bought the Red Roxx less than a year ago. Although the sound is great, the plastic around the wires has disintegrated in many areas along the wire - the sheathing is just not durable enough to support anything more than infrequent use. My product certainly failed the daily use test.Customer service leaves much to be desired. They claim I mishandled the earbuds, and that's the main reason the plastic has disintegrated. They'd be happy to repair them, and the repair cost would be less than a new pair - by about $20. I wouldn't let V moda repair them for $50 - they should've done it for free, and as a result of the poor customer service I encountered, I won't buy another pair.I think half the price you pay for an item at this level is for customer service. In this area, V moda falls far short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounds, terrible durability","review":"These earbuds took a little getting used to, as the fit doesn't always hold. I used the smallest of the gel earpieces and they still popped out a lot. The sound, however, is amazing! I use them primarily at work to listen to books and drown out my coworkers. They made me feel like I was sitting down with the reader. They don't last, however, less than 5 months and they are already broken beyond repair. No good!! The sounds is awesome, but they aren't worth it unless you have $100 to throw away every couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"These are extremely overpriced earbus. I have had 2 sets, on replaced under warranty and they both broke. I am really carefull abou them the sound is just so-so. Better bass that most but Female Vocals and piano sounds are just terrible- they can just a lot of boom boom and completely-un-HiFi tunes. They both broke at the jack, and there is a lot of cable rustling - there are others that are a lot better. I have had Bose Tri-ports, for Jazz Classical and Vocals -excellent. These are just Volume brain blasters. If you want your brain fried, these are it. But it won't hold up for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG RIP-OFF","review":"Please read other negative reviews. It's all true about poor quality, terrible customer service, etc. I can't even agree with some on the sound quality-- I thought the V-modas way too brassy. Also, the cord is way too long and too stiff. It's a hassle to deal with it all of the time. Try the Klipsch ear buds that are so highly rated on CNET. Same price as the v-modas, but a world apart in sound quality. It's no wonder that COSTCO had a huge display of the V-modas...... These really are just JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the reviewers. I didn't","review":"The day I got these I took them out of the package and immediately started the burn in process. I decided to give them anther listen about an hour later and couldn't believe what I heard. The right bud had stopped working already! I moved the cord around a bit and was able to get it to come back on, but for 1 hour old this was unacceptable. So listen to people when they say poor quality, they mean it. Returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"As reported by a number of other reviewers these headphones are not at all durable. Mine broke after just over a year of very gentle use. The coating around the wire disintegrated and they are no longer usable.

In the past year I've sent it back 3 times. Alas, my year-warranty has been used up and the right headphone is malfunctioning, yet again.No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"LIke others have stated, the construction and durability are terrible. I have had two pair, the first lasted a month, the second a week, with both tearing in the same location....where the wire meets the headpiece. The tear is not visible, but the absence of sound from that side is. Simply a waste of money for a ridiculously over-priced product. If the cost were $10 or so, it wouldn't bother me but for these price points it certainly does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones","review":"These headphones produce great sound and are quite comfortable. I use them with my ipod nano and have been completely satisfied. The only thing bad I would say about them is that they are expensive, otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch my ears! Why are my expensive headphones falling apart?","review":"I bought these a few months ago. They seemed to be a great improvement over the predecessors the Shure E2C's and a set of Sony Earbuds. The sound is great, these have great clarity and range. The problem is they start to irritate your ears if worn for more than about an hour. I tried every different size adapter and still, ouch! The second thing is that now they have fallen apart. The wires started to seperate at the jack and eventually broke leaving only the strain relief to hold the the jack on. The last thing is characteristic of all earbuds. This is the separation of the rubber ear interface from the earbud. I would take them out of the little gold bag and the little rubber earpiece would going flying off and leave me to hunt the floor of the airplane cabin to retrieve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them so far.","review":"I heard they have problems in the long run but with moderate use so far they are awesome.

I also paid 79.99 at the time for this piece of crap, and the apple store was selling them at 129.99! No wonder it's now 20 dollars on amazon!Only thing good I have to say about these earbuds is that it's comfortable and it looks nice. That's it. Sound quality is ok, nothing spectacular, and it's not noise canceling by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but it won't last you 3 months","review":"I've been through two of these in the past 6 months. I listen to my ipod very often and these offer good sound, but the headphones started deteriorating in sound until the music sounded like it was coming from a different room. Something about the way this was built causes the circuitry to come loose, so eventually you have to twist and turn the cord to hear the proper sound. This isn't something you should have to deal with. Get a more sturdy pair and you'll save money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable.","review":"The sound is decent. A bit bright on the treble, nice bass. I'm not very much of an audiophile, but they sounded fine for my purposes.The problem is the durability. They were treated gently, as what would be expected of casual use. I use them during my commute to the city, nothing that would put atypical strain of them. Only 3 months after buying the ear buds they started to cut and eventually stop working on the right ear, the cause being a wire loose at the plug. Customer service was decent, and when I sent back the faulty buds they sent me a new pair back.Now, only 8 days after the 1 year warranty expires, on these \\"repaired\\" earphones, the right ear is cutting on and off again, this time sensitive to movement at the ear piece. When counting the days it took to ship it, and the 10 days or so in between sending them back the first time and waiting for the replacement to arrive, I got considerably less than a year's use out of them, and now they're basically dead.Not cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"As They Say...Great Bass Response","review":"It is really hard to find a reasonalbly priced set of ear buds with good bass response...these are the answer. They are great! They are well made...metal, not plastic. Comfortable...three sets of sized pads...actually 6 - three black and three clear. I particually like the covering on the cords...it is a fabric of some kind. there is little or no feedback from the cords rubbing against or over something, and they do not seem to tangle like others I have. I dont often write these opinion things, but this set of ear buds is really worth the Bucks....IF YOUR THING IS GREAT BASE. If not...well there are cheaper sets for you to get. Oh...I use these with an IPod Touch...shudda got the set with the remote...mine does not have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound...if you can hear the sound","review":"First of all these headphones work great....for a month or two that is. My pair had an earbud's sound go out and it never came back. Mind you I take really good care of my things.(I'm pretty sure most of you do too) At first I would have to shake the junction point where the 2 wires to the earbuds went into one wire passing a metal coupling and it would work but then it finally went out. When they did work I really enjoyed the sound quality and the lack of tangling because the cable fiber and speaking into it was invaluable while on the move with the phone. The sad part was I purchased my headphones through an unauthorized seller and V Moda would not honor their 1yr warranty in full, they will only give me half off of the same pair of headphones. I DON'T recommend purchasing these headphones unless you want the same thing happening to you and from reading numerous other reviews, this is a common failure with their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Best Buy","review":"Truly amazing.

If you are looking to replace the really dull earphones that can with with your iPod,CD player,or any portable music player, these are the ones for you. Has a neat modern look to it, nothing big or bulky, comes with multiple silicone fittings to get that real comfortable feel and secure fit in your ear.

However, I picked up a copy of this disc at the public library on a whim and immediately purchased it at my local store along with several other of the band's recordings.This is an live album essentially, and captures much of the passion and fun that a studio cannot adequately convey. The shouts of joy and talking between songs makes the recording feel more real and organic and gives the true air of musicians jamming and enjoying themselves immensely.As a novice guitar player, the sounds these folks create with a few guitars and their voices is inspiring. The fact that it makes my daughter dance with joy every time I play it makes it a keeper for the heavy rotation shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"my introduction to the music of the Gipsy Kings.....","review":"Hailing originally from Arles and Montpellier, France, the Gipsy Kings bring the music of their parents, who fled Spain and settled in France, during the Spanish Civil War. They are referred to as Cale (Gitano) musicians and are best known for playing Rumba Catalana (a kind of Rumba Flamenca). This beautiful debut album (originally released in 1982) showcases them at their brightest. The guitar work is stunning. I would says the best songs include \\"Djobi, Djoba,\\" \\"Papa, No Pega Mama,\\" and \\"Princessia.\\" The Spanish lyrics are great, but I don't want to give it away! Though, I am not fluent, I got the gist of the romance and intensity they convey here. You definitely don't need to speak Spanish to enjoy the music! I guarantee you'll get lost in the beauty and brilliance of their instrumental intros and haunting vocals.

The little plastic mechanism that controls the lid must have been put together rather poorly with cheap materials, because it broke apart and is now completely useless. The lid no longer goes up or down. It just sits there. I'm ready to get rid of the whole thing and just go back to a plastic trash can, unless I can find a replacement lid that isn't too expensive. I'm so disappointed. I sure did love it while it worked. But it just didn't last long enough. So sad. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"This somewhat extravagant item is awesome! It looks marvelous and works perfectly. The action of the lid is virtually silent and works as advertised. It is definitely NOT too sensitive as it doesn't open by accident as we pass close by very often. By reading the reviews prior to buying I was able, from day one, to figure out which way the inner ring fit (wider end in the back). The outside is a bit tough to keep looking spotless, but because its brushed a slight mark doesn't show much.The only critism I have is that it dents easily so treat it very gently. Once again, because of the brushed finish the dent only shows from the perfect angle in the perfect light.I would definitely buy another one if I had the need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best trash can ever!","review":"I first purchased one of these cans for myself after two cans with the pedal step to lift the lid broke. I was motivated by the touchless concept. After having my can for a year, I am still as thrilled as the first day I got it. We just bought one as a Mother's Day gift for my mother-in-law. She loves it, too. It makes a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"automatic trashcan","review":"How long this will work, I do not know, but the product seems to be made fairly well. I would like the lid to be more sensitive--quicker, as there is sometimes a lag between the motion of my hand and the operation of the lid--but that could be from a \\"dirty\\" infrared eye.The product does however, work as advertised, and it is definately a step in the right direction, as far as being a convenience.I would like to see an improvement such as elimination of the plastic ring that holds the trash bag in place. I have had to retrieve this a couple of times since I tossed it. There has to be a better way to retain the trash bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat item","review":"I ordered this unit to replace one I got a year or so ago from Sam's which stopped working. It's a little smaller, but works well. I really like the concept and usage, but hope this one lasts longer than the NST brand I previously bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient cleanup","review":"This trash can looks very attractive in our kitchen, and is quite the conversation piece for our guests when it \\"magically\\" opens. What a convenience to have it open without using a foot pedal. The batteries are a bit expensive but only need replacement once or twice a year, so it is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trash Can (if there can be such a thing)","review":"I bought this trash can as a gift for a friend, and now I wish I had one, too!She's had it for a year, and it works really well. Enables you to keep your garbage covered without making you touch the can to lift a lid, or have to use one of those foot pedals that never seem to work quite right.The mechanism is simple to use, and it's going strong after a year. Looks great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great registry item","review":"We got this as a wedding gift and it's one of my favorite gifts! I'm so glad we put this on our registry. Perfect for a geeky couple :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty","review":"Great idea, and convenient when it works...however:I bought two and one has a sensor that only works 1/2 the time.The other goes up and down day and night all by itself like its possessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy !","review":"Im very happy with my trash can it open every time and it closes every time and for that I am happy it was xpensive but it should be the last trash can that I buy.I would recamend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"The sensor and lid work great; it's the rest of the can that is poorly made. The main lid does not fit well on the metal can, and the plastic ring to support trash bag does not fit securely within the metal can, so the heavy lid sometimes tips, and the trash bag often slides down into the can. The trash bag ring is held only by friction within the walls of the can, which is not strong enough to support a full trash bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to any home","review":"I never thought a trash can would be worthy of writing a review for, but this one definitely earned it. After months of use, it still works just like the day we got it. It keeps the bag hidden and we don't have to deal with an annoying foot pedal (which broke on the last two trash cans we had...including one trash can that cost about thirty dollars more than this one). It looks great and always elicits compliments from guests. Hah, the only drawback is now we occasionally find ourselves by habit waving our hands over other lidded trash cans in the house expecting them to open automatically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trash Can","review":"This trash can is awesome, I have looked at it several times not sure I wanted to spend that much on a trash can definitely worth it. It works as described and looks nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price great product","review":"Really love these cans got one for recycling and one for trash and they're great. I leave the lid open during parties cause people think they have to push the lid down which screws it up , but I just turn it off and on and its fine. The price.is fantastic had them 2 months and so.far so good :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but not good for a small kitchen/room!","review":"At first I really liked the hands-free aspect of the trash can, but we have a small kitchen and the sensor goes off all the time when you get close to it. We tried turning the trash can slightly many different ways but nothing helped. After several months of being annoyed by it we just turned off the sensor all together... Also, the inside ring that holds up the liner no longer holds the bag tight and after slipping many times we just took it out so the bag comes out over the edge and doesn't look as nice. I could see if you had a bigger space where you would only walk in front of it when you need to throw something away it could be handy, but it just didn't work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashcan arrived dented","review":"I cannot speak for how well the trash can works. I ordered this product once from another company and it arrived dented. I then ordered it from amazon and it again arrived very obviously dented and missing the power cord. I'm guessing the company changed the way they package the product or something. Amazon is sending me a new one right away, but I'm a little skeptical that it won't be dented again."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I love this can! When you have your hands full just stand in front and it opens.Every one that comes over thinks it's the coolest thing to have.We put batteries in it and so far they are still going strong, haven't had to change them yet. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery cost makes this not worth it!!!!","review":"The trash can works somewhat well. There are time the lid does not open but overall it work okay with some minor issues. This item takes 4 D batteries. The cost of the batteries in one year will almost be the same cost of the trash can. I do not recommend this trash can for that reason. It was fun at first but it is not fun spending $10 on batteries every 2-3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the trashcan, but it can act up at times","review":"We've been using this trashcan for the last year and a half. It has worked pretty well for most of the time and guest enjoy playing with it. There are times when, as has been reported, it can act up. One time, changing batteries fixed it, but I think that the last time, I just removed the batteries for about a minute and allowed it to \\"reboot\\". I'd try this before throwing it away. The other issue is that it can get moldy under the lid, but that is just because it is a moist humid environment. I'd probably still buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusty can","review":"Our trash can works fine the problem in the inside of the can is rusted.

Save you time and money and look at a different brand.BT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastecan a Waste of Money","review":"Like others on here the one I purchased worked for about two months. At that point it started acting up - opening for no reason, not opening when needed, buttons not functioning, etc. And it is not exactly easy to return a trashcan. I truly feel I have been ripped off, am truly unhappy, and am disappointed that Amazon has not been helpful with their return policy on this. No bueno!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!","review":"Like all electronics, I am scared that they will not last or be low quality when I see a great price.

But it's so darn COOL! Guests are amazed, and from a practical standpoint, it's the perfect size, holds the liner great, and looks awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, second one.","review":"Our first one broke. I think the kids were manually closing it. Its much better than the step to open trashcans that fly open when you step on them. It's nice when your hands are full.

They look at it and see the buttons thinking they have to press one."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic top broke after 1 day","review":"received yesterday and plastic top broke already. the sensor idea is great, but they really need to improve how the top fits. i am returning and hopefully next unit will work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Can","review":"Got this as a wedding present in January, 2009. We've had no problems with it so far. The lid opens and closes flawlessly with the wave of a hand. Putting a bag in has a learning curve of about 2 minutes.

The VERY best trash can I have ever had. A++++++++++!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garbage can! But caution....","review":"We love this thing! No more lifting the garbage can lid with dirty hands or have a \\"push then open\\" lid get stuck. But here's the hitch...you'll start expecting everyone to have a garbage can that will open on it's own (I waved my hands in front of my parents' garbage can on Thanksgiving trying to get it to open!). Plenty of volume for a family of 4, and the batteries last quite a long time (I can't remember the last time we replaced ours)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I can't say enough about this trash can. I kept waiting to write the review until the fist set of batteries ran out since there were complaints of battery life. I ordered this in December of 2010 and now in the middle of Nov 2012 I am finally replacing the batteries. Almost 2 years of opening and closing this trash can. Keep in mind that in that time we have a family of four and a now 2 year old which equals lots of trips for dirty diapers to the trash can. Even with all that the unit is working great and as a bonus it keeps the smell hidden from what is in those dirty diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"Bought this one year ago and it is already broken. I wanted a foot pedal garbage can but had a hard time finding one and decided to take a chance on this one. What a mistake, now that an inside plastic part is broken I have a $60 piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE NEW MODEL! HORRIBLE!","review":"They have used the same listing with the same feedbacks for their old(much better) model to sell the new one. The sensor is horrible on the new one. You have to literally hold the food on top of the trash can wait for it to open. I threw away the box so I cant return it but I'm willing to throw this thing out and find the old model or a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in principle - bad experience","review":"Maybe this is just my experience... I certainly hope so.I found this trash can because it was actually cheaper than comparable step-cans. About a week after using it, it stopped working. I assumed the batteries had just run out so I specially ordered rechargeable D batteries and a specialty D battery charger. It still didn't work.Then, my boyfriend had the horrific experience of finding the entire inside of the lid of the trash can COVERED IN MAGGOTS. Yes. Tiny white worms. Gross. We assumed they must be fruit fly larvae since we had seen a few (only a few!) in the past couple of days.I don't know if it's something about the charcoal system that allowed them to nest inside there or what, but it was terrible.Needless to say, it is basically now just a regular trash can that we have to lift the top to to put our trash in. No charcoal. No electricity.Kind of a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"Just after our return window closed, we've had it about one month and three days, it's operation is unreliable. I didn't love it to begin with, as you basically have to put your hand on the lid to get it to open anyway, but I thought since it worked, and we aren't big fans of returning online purchases, we'd keep it. Now it only works maybe 1/2 the time, Much of the time you have to push the open and close button manually, and frequently those don't work either, and you have to lift the lid manually. If I wanted to do that I wouldn't have spent the money, and waited for this item to ship, and would have picked up any old trash can at a local store. I'd say this is our last automatic trash can. They don't last for the money you pay. We're switching to a step to open can that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about 8 months","review":"After 8 months the lid would open and shut every 5 seconds. Per the customer service recs, I cleaned the sensor, changed the batteries, and left it without power for over 6 hours. Did work.They want me to send it back to them for repairs BUT I must pay shipping both ways. No good. Will not buy another from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"I bought the iTouchless garbage can, because it was everything I was looking for, I loved it...at first. It does takes standard 13 gallon bags which I was happy about, I even thought that the bag ring was a good idea...at first. Now that we have been using it for about 1 month, I am ready to buy a different type of garbage can. I HATE the bag ring, it doesn't fit right half the time, the bag gets all screwed up & falls in. I am tired of fighting with the bag & ring every time I need to take the garbage out. It is taking me at least 3 times as long to change the bag as it used to. My husband actually laughs at me struggling with it & says \\"was it worth it\\" & I just glare back at him because we both know it was such a bad investment. I strongly discourage anyone from buying this garbage can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 YEARS LATER & AND THIS CAN KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND ....","review":"I was going through my order history to find an item that did not stand the test of time. While I was in the process of locating the item, I noticed how long it had been since I bought this amazing device. I think the entire time we've owned it, we've only changed the batteries 2 or 3 times.The benefits of having a touchless trash can are endless. We get so many compliments on it. Not only is the appearance easy on the eyes but this Can keeps the trashy smell from getting out. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know today, I would easily pay double what AMAZON is charging right now. Do yourself and your family a favour and just order it. Be certain to thank me later under comments, I know you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid is highly likely to break","review":"I've had 2 of these, and just as several other reviewers have noted, the lid is prone to break. The first 1 came from Costco, and the lid stopped going up after a few months, so I took it back and exchanged it. The 2nd one worked fine for a while, but became very erratic. It would open, and then slowly drift back to closed instead of staying open. It would also make grinding sounds as the lid gear was slipping. Finally, the gear for the lid completely broke off from the rest of the lid, and now the unit doesn't work at all.One other issue is that the lid is a bit slow to open. Sometimes it works Ok, but at other times it seems we have to wave something a few times in front of it before it finally decides to open. The \\"artificial intelligence\\" they advertise seems to still have some bugs.It's a great idea in general, but the quality is lacking. I'd gladly pay twice the price for a product that would last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-Free Yipee","review":"This is just the greatest trash can. My daughter loved it as a Christmas gift, and her visitors can't stop trying it out. We're hoping the dogs don't figure out how to use it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"While this is a very good looking trash can and looks good in my kitchen, it has more drawbacks than positives. Its hard to fit the plastic liner in it - the ring that holds it in place slips all around. Also, when you remove the liner its hard to get ahold of the ring and I sometimes puncture the bag in the process. If you place it in an area where there is traffic, the lid opens and closes every time someone walks by. But, on the positive side, it is a delight to be able to just wave your hand at it when you want the lid to open. If could do it all over again I wouldn't have ordered this item. I, unfortunately, threw the box it came in away too soon and couldn't send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"Problems with the lid started almost immediately. And the bags would tear in removal...just great....and I just noticed a leak!! I'm trashing this trash can...great idea, lousy execution of the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"A delight while it worked. And then, after a month","review":"This product was a delight while it worked. Even my two teenage sons, who rarely compliment anything, independently said \\"I love this garbage can.\\" Alas, it broke after a month--the lid stopped opening. Fresh batteries did not help. It simply stopped opening, even when I pressed the manual open button. It's too bad--it helped keep the kitchen clean, the garbage lid itself stayed clean, and it was tall enough that the dog couldn't activate the sensor. But, in the end, it gave only a month of utility before it joined the ranks of yet another appliance that had to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update - no longer working","review":"This trash can works as advertised and looks great also! I love that my garbage bag is hidden from view.12/10/12 - I felt I needed to update my review. The lid is no longer working. Sometimes we unplug it from the wall and plug it back in and it will work. Other times it doesn't. Sometimes it opens but doesn't close. It's easiest to actually lift the lid at this point rather than get frustrated when it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensor on lid stopped working in 2 months. Replacement failed on delivery!","review":"The sensor on the lid was able to open the trash can from over a foot away until after two months it stopped working. I tried all the tricks posted on line to try to fix it with no success. So I asked customer service for a replacement. They wanted to charge me shipping & handling to send the lid back and replace it after only 2 months! After some haggling, they agreed to waive the return and just make me pay for the replacement lid's shipping and handling. After receiving the replacement lid...it never worked! It was defective on delivery!!! Same problem. The sensor would only open the trash can with your hand about 1 inch from the sensor. Something is seriously wrong with their quality assurance or engineering. Don't buy their products until they fix their problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"The trash can was a snap to assemble out of the box. The sensor is very accurate. It will not open if you simply walk by the unit. Works great. Plus, it is a 13 gallon bin. Therefore you can buy standard size trash can bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I've been using it for about 30days. No problems as reported by some of the other users. A worthy addition to my modern kitchen. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"I was looking around for a nice trashcan that fit into a tight corner in my kitchen. They were all costly and big. This one was a perfect fit. Plus unlike other trash cans, the hinges are not at the edges like all other trashcans out there so it even fits in pretty tight corner and it looks great.One thing though is that the ring sometimes fall inside when you change bags, no biggie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROBO-CAN","review":"We've had the iTouchless trash can for about a month and it has performed well with one exception. The sensing mechanism is a little too sensitive for where we have it sitting and it will open when we walk too close to it. Other than that we like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Saw this item on HGTV and was impressed with it. Costco sells a version of this, but made in cheaper material. This unit does not work behind a cabinet door. Seems when cabinet door is closed, the cover remains open.Works great free standing. Highly recommend...especially for those who are cooking in the kitchen and can toss rubbish without having to touch anything! Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit of the party!!!!!!","review":"I bought this wastecan as a birthday present for myself and everyone laughed. For Christmas I had a large party and the wastecan was the hit of the party. Know one had ever seen anything like and got a real kick out of how neat it was.

Highly recomend this product to people of all ages.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recieved with dents","review":"I order a lot of things from Amazon and I love the website.

I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted Christmas Morning","review":"Purchased as Christmas gift for my son.

But the iTouch Trash Can has given me the new generation touch of throwing rubbish without having to open the lid using hands or feet. I like it very much. Easy to install but battaries not included. Will recommend to anyone who want to amaze the family with high tech gargets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Overall, this trash can works very well, and is stylish enough (though I assume the ones that cost 2-3 times what this one costs look much nicer). My only problem with it is that the ring that sits between the base and the lid doesn't fit the can, and looks asif it's it was made for a smaller model. I think they just packed the wrong one in my package, and I was too lazy to do anything about it. In any case, it works fine without the ring, but the lid has to sit directly on the trash bag. No big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Trash Can","review":"This is a wonderful automated trash can. I have had absolutely no problems with it. I would highly recommend it for anyone in need of a trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Clean, classy and don't have to touch it when throwing items away. I also like the ring that goes around the trash bag to keep it from folding inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great at first...","review":"This is a nice trash can I like the fact that it is hands free.

It performs as advertised and is a great value for the money. It is sleek and clean in appearance, and the lid opens and closes as it should.

However, we probably try to pack more in before changing liners than we should anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's terrific !!!!!!!!","review":"I love the ease of using my new garbage can. It is so easy and clean. I love it. If for any reason it will not open I have the option of a manual open and close which also allows you to leave it open should you wish. The price was right also. I have told everyone who comes over that they need to get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Severely Damaged","review":"I bought this trash can as a Christmas gift. And although it arrived on schedule when it was opened it was dented so severely it had to be returned. The box it ships in is very flimsy; I'd imagine most of these cans would arrive damaged. As compared to others I've seen at stores like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, this trash can seemed a bit cheap. Although the product was sub-par...returning the damaged item was incredibly simple. Amazon paid for all shipping costs. We didn't even have to go to the post office. I was able to print off the return label from my printer. I chose to do a complete refund and opt for one of the nicer onces from a retailer where I didn't have to worry or mess with a dented can again."},{"rating":"2","title":"ss trash can","review":"This has worked out great for my family- no problem what so ever- fits great where I placed it.

I love this item. It opens automaticaly when you place you hand over the sensor and you never have to touch the can. It also has a feature where you can push the open button if you are going to take some time in scraping plates, etc. It looks good in the kitchen and it's easy to clean and maintain. The batteries last a long, long time. With a three year old in the house, he loves to help me throw away the garbage since it's so easy for him to use. I highly rate this product. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Touchless Can","review":"We purchased the trash can 4/9/10 and have been using it for about a month now. We have had zero problems with the lid opening/closing as it should. The trash bag stays secure and is hidden neatly away.The only complaint I have; the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it had two dents on the side of the can when we pulled it out of the box. I was able to push one out, but the other is still there. (not really a big deal since that side faces the wall). However, if it wasn't I would have returned the trash can for a new one.Great can for the price and stays clean f fingerprints because you're not having to touch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!!!","review":"I use these trash cans for storing my dry cat & dog food.

Keeps the dog out, garbage in. Great find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I love this trash can! It looks great and works great. Bags fit perfect, though it did take a couple of tries to figure out how to change bags quickly and easily. I just fold the top around the black plastic rim, insert on top of can, then pull down on the bag inside the can to pull down any extra that might peak out and then put the top on. Takes about 5 seconds. Best garbage can I ever had!Edit: 7 months later, I still like this trash can. I have not experienced any issues with the lid, but it gets very light use in my house. As soon as the first set of batteries died, I hooked it up with the power adaptor. No battery, no power issue, no weird lid behavior. BUT, I can't find the replacement deodorizers! Help! It worked great for several months and I didn't even realize how well till I threw it out. I thought I could come back to Amazon and get the replacement, but there is no sign of it. Where can I get the deodorizer packs???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Can","review":"Saw one of these at a friend's home and was intrigued.Seemed sanitary,roomy,clean and convenient with that lid action.

The touchless feature died too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out so well for us","review":"I have 3 dogs and couple of them are sneaky and get in the trash occasionally. My Rhodesian Ridgeback, however, will start \\"digging\\" in the trashcan if you just turn your head for a minute. I thought the touchless trashcans would be the answer for us. And it was, at first. My dogs did not like the lid opening automatically and for a few weeks it was great. I could let them roam with no concerns. Unfortunately, the metal the can is made of is not very sturdy. If you push your trash down in the bag it causes the sides of the trashcans to 'bow' out. I did not realize this was happening until the rim (which I hated because it ALWAYS seems to fall off the trashcan) and lid would no longer fit.Maybe I should have realized that the metal would bend but we really were not putting that much force when pushing the trash down. If the metal were thicker, I'd love this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"What a load of trash. Save your money on this item. I was looking for an trash can that had a smaller profile but could still hold my trash without changing bags every two days. Pulls the lid would open without the need to touch the lid. Placed batteries in the unit and they were topped out in a week. Found a power cord that worked for another week. Now it will nolonger raise it's lid no matter what I do. Great idea, too bad it did not function as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Design, But Doesn't Work","review":"The Touchless Trashcan looks great and is a cleaver idea, but the lid opens on its own and then does not close. The unit comes with directions on how to clean and reset the sensor, but they do not help. Now they want me to spend $20 on shipping to fix the unit under warranty. I would not waste my money on another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid malfunction","review":"The lid started opening and closing on it's own 14 months after buying it. Like many others I tried to contact the manufacturer and after cleaning and trying to reset the lid did not help they offered to sell the lid. I just can't believe that any would would be foolish enough to buy a product that lasts 14 months. Take my advice and just don't waste your money buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itouch trash can","review":"I bought one of these trash cans. It worked just as advertised for about a month then the sensor, I guess, wouldn't work any longer. I consider this can a waste of good money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Trashcan","review":"This is a pretty neat trashcan. Neat looking and neat usage. Four D batteries is all it takes to get it working. That's good because the instructions weren't edited by anyone who speaks English! I'm using the cheapo bags I had on hand--so far, so good. It is sensitive--sometimes it opens as I walk by or when I reach for a hand towel hanging nearby. When it opens, it isn't silent but I wouldn't call it noisy either. The 13-gallon capacity was a worry though that hasn't been a problem--I just empty it more often which is probably better anyway (for reasons I'm sure you already know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"So doesn't work. Stopped working shortly after buying. Hard to get to open other than pushing open button. Waving hand in front when your hands are full defeats the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked okay for four months, then didn't","review":"This is an okay trash can, but I've come to the conclusion that stepping on a pedal to open the trash can is much better. It's quicker and it doesn't break like this one. With the touchless ones you have to hover your hand in front of the trash can waiting for it to open. Then, when it breaks, and according to many reviews here it will break eventually, you hover your hand, nothing happens, then you pull up the lid yourself. Ours lasted about four months.I can't tell if the odor control part works or not, since I don't smell anything, maybe it's working, maybe the lid on the trash can is already containing any odors, anyway, I don't notice any odors.I would never buy another one of these things. I'm going to buy one with a pedal I can step on. Still touchless, much faster and won't break."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Great product- Just what I expected. Am thinking of buying another one for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Now I'm annoyed when I'm at someone else's house and their trash can won't automatically open! The bag is awkward to change, but it hold more now because of the elongated design. This is so handy when you are preparing messy things and your hands are wet and sticky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor and sensor stinks","review":"For the first couple months, the lid worked great. The sensor was a little too sensitive to movement, so we had to move it closer to the corner away from foot traffic.However, after a couple months, the sensor doesn't work at all. We now have to push the manual open button. Also, the lid doesn't stay open when you try the \\"stay open\\" button push. The motor seems to have given out and can't hold the lid open for more than a few seconds. Even with fresh batteries, the problem doesn't go away.We should have bought the step on lid opener... and so should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensor stops working making it useless","review":"I purchased this in October of 2011 and it worked fine until April of 2012.The sensor has stopped activating the lid.

I had a 7 gallon version for a little more than a year where a gear broke and the lid would not open. Bought a 13 gallon version and now a little more than a year later the sensor won't open the lid and the lid does not close. Replaced the batteries and then took the batteries out, left them out for over 24 hours, as one poster suggested, to reset the sensor and that didn't work. My trash can is never near water and is never forced open or closed unless the darned thing doesn't work.I just called customer service and they offered me the 10% off ($4.00) deal too to buy their replacement head at $39.95 from their web site. This is not enough of a discount for me to consider purchasing another head. I'm going to a stainless foot model. I'm done with itouchless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a few months...","review":"When the hands free trash can I picked up at Sam's stopped working after 3 years, I ordered this one from Amazon. I liked it more than my original one until the sensor stopped working 3 months in.

It opens and closes on its own. I did all of the trouble shooting, changing the batteries etc., and it still is possessed by some demon. I went to the website and they are selling the replacement lid system for about 2/3 the price that we paid for the whole can. Pretty much a useless trashcan after a while. Also the buttons on the front are so fragile that they were dented in after the first week of use. Sad really because I really liked this trashcan."},{"rating":"1","title":"lid stopped working","review":"Good quality garbage can but the lid stopped working after about 2 months.Its pretty much useless with out the automatic lid.I'll most likely not be buying this one again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not Work","review":"The product simply does not work. I have purchased this product in the past elsewhere and it worked fine. Why spend $84 on something that doesn't work is beyond me. Why Amazon allows shipping of completely defective product is beyond me.Lid does not power on in any way shape or form ... two sets of new batteries later ... what a bloody waste of time.Now somebody from Amazon is going to tell me to return it ...

I'm extremely disappointed that this one only lasted 7 months!! The lid sensor stopped working. At first it wouldn't open if you had opened it in the prior 60 seconds. Now it just plain old doesn't work. I wish the company would be better about replacing the faulty top. I have read several reviews that state what bad customer service the company has. I'm very unhappy with this product. It's very deceptive that this has 1,200 reviews with an average of 4 stars!! Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I am really enjoying this trash can. It is so easy.

Now i have to pay to send it back and pay for them to send me another lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months","review":"I like the overall look and design of the product but my opinion went down veryquickly when the unit began to malfunction.- Opens by itself- Opens and closes continuouslyI'm not amused either when I have to pay freight both ways to get a replacement. What's with a replacement top direct from the company costing almost as much as an entire new unit from Amazon?This company needs to improve itself in two ways: Customer service and quality. Without these two areas in place the company is doomed.Oh yes - I tried cleaning it. I tried taking out the batteries and putting fresh ones in twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen trashcan","review":"We always get comments about our trash can when people come over the house. People think it's so futuristic! We love the fact you don't have to touch anything to open the lid. Just wave you hand on top of it and it lifts right up. And it goes back down automaticlally also. The only semi negative comment is that it isn't super easy to put a new bag in. But it isn't hard either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A conversation piece","review":"I've been using this trash can for over a year now and nearly everyone that uses it comments on it. It does confuse people the first time, but they really think it's cool after they learn how it works. It's nice that I never have to touch the trash can. Sometimes you need to wait a second for it to open, but never longer than that.Pros:- looks good- impressive functionalityCons:- requires batteries"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trash can!","review":"I just purchased my second one.

At first the dog was imtimidated by it opening (who knows what it sounds like to a dog...) and he has never liked shiny objects, but he now ignores it as well as he does the Dyson he used to run from.

Recommend with one reservation....","review":"Great product, works flawlessly. Putting new bag in is a little time consuming but does allow the product to work well. IMPORTANT: Follow the new bag installation instructions AND TREAT THE PRODUCT with regular CARE. If you slam the thing around, drop it, dump it over with the lid up, etc it will (like any product) break or not work correctly. If you have small children teach them how to use it properly, etc. It's not made of rock, duh.The distance for the seeing-eye is wonderful. You can easily walk past the can and nothing happens. Ours needs to be activated at about 3-4 inches away from the lid, perfect.Very very pleased with the item !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Great product!

You actually have to get INTO THE TRASH and pull out the plastic ring holding the bag. THAT IS GROSS and IDIOTIC DESIGN. Why would i want a touchless trash can and then touch the actual thing that has been sitting there with all this rotting trash and bacteria build up, what person engineered this?this trash can looks nice, i cant think of any other pluses."},{"rating":"2","title":"So handy","review":"I'm so happy to not have to touch the can lid ever again to open it! The sensor works great and the lid stays open as long as you stand in front of it, allowing you to peel potatoes, etc while the lid stays open. Once it senses you, the lid opens quickly. Requires 4 \\"D\\" batteries, not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"I purchased this item last year as a gift. It has lasted well and the initial D cell batteries are still in play with active use. The stainless steel case does not spot like cheaper units. A second one was purchased this year as a gift for another person. It would be nice if the manual override to open the unit would self close after a 60-90 second delay. As it is, you must manually select the self close option again. Also, the sensor to open the lid is very responsive so keep this in mind when choosing placement of the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 months and still going strong!","review":"Before I bought this, people told me that this would break pretty quickly. Well it has been 18 months and it still works like new. I have changed the batteries 3 times so far...first set was duracell, the next two sets were cheap rayovacs. This thing is great for when I am cooking anything with egg or poultry where I can't touch anything. Whenever guests venture into my kitchen to throw something away, they usually play with it for a few minutes before saying \\"I have to have one!\\"I only paid $60 for it, and if it broke today, I would quickly order another because I would be lost without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I think its great. It opens quickly, as soon as you get your hand over it. It is easy to use. The only negative is that you have to make sure that were you place it is not a heavy traffic area, because if you walk nearby it can sometimes open. You have to be very close though for it to open."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this garbage can!","review":"We love this thing, my husband and I got this for our wedding and we love it! It makes the kitchen smell great, and is really convienent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best auto open trash can yet.","review":"All in all this is the best automatically opening trashcan my family has purchased yet. We've been through three now, and I feel like this one is actually going to last for a while.The main problems with them is either the bag gets caught inside on a seam of the bin, or the battery holder plate falls in the trash and disappears forever.The battery plate on this seems fairly solid, and I am not worried about it falling in so much as being hard to take off whenever it comes time to replace the batteries, which hasn't happened yet and we are going on to the second month of daily use.Also, the iTouchless seems to have a fairly good sized opening, and is slightly smaller at the bottom than at the top to help with the bags not expanding beyond the capacity of the can's opening. Given, of course, that you don't have someone who would push down the waste to the point that the can buckles."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOPPED WORKING AFTER 5 DAYS","review":"I really really hate this trash can. The LED sensor stopped working in less than a week. I had to wave my hand in front of it for at least 10 seconds before it would register and open.

Unfortunately, I had to return this to Amazon and will stick to a non-motorized one from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid malfunctions","review":"My lid began its consistent malfunctioning very soon after purchase.The warranty service requires customers to pay to ship the lid to them with a check for $9.95 for return shipping, which would have cost me about half of what I paid for the item.This is one of the worst products I have ever made the mistake of purchasing, and I regret disregarding the featured negative warnings from previous years in favor of the 4.5 star rating, positive recent reviews, and posted \\"solution\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this!!!!","review":"I love this product and everyone that comes in my home loves the novelty of it. I have actually also purchased one for my son because he liked it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I purchased this due to the majority of good reviews; however, when it arrived and immediately out of the box, the lid only opened maybe 30% of the way automatically, and about 50% of the time wouldn't close all the way. Was very disappointed in the overall quality of everything - it is made with what must be the cheapest of materials all around. It's luck of the draw whether you get one that actually works - and in my case even if I did get one that works, I wouldn't be confident at all in it lasting a very long time. I'd gladly pay $100+ for a quality touchless trash can - but it seems looking at both this model, as well as others, they seem to be all cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"It was hard to find a nice not to bulky stainless trash can.

It seems to be durable so far so no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The iTouchless!","review":"I've never thought about actually liking a trash can, but I absolutely LOVE this one! It is so stylish and matches my other stainless appliances perfectly. The automatic lid opener is just icing on the cake.

He said, \\"Why couldn't I have thought of this??\\" I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this can!","review":"This is the perfect geek toy! Friends come over and marvel at it and make it open and close over and over. It's battery operated so no cords to mess with, and there is a support ring inside to hold up the garbage bag so it doesn't have to drape over the edge.There is a motion sensor that opens the lid for a few seconds; long enough for most things, but if you need to keep it open for longer, you can press the OPEN button and it'll stay until you press the CLOSE button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trash Can, especially for the price","review":"This is the second iTouchless trash can I have purchased.

Well, this one died after only about 6 months and I asked about the warranty. They would replace it if I sent the old one in(at my expense) AND paid about $10 for the return (so basically about a third of the total cost of a new one!). I will go back to the old vendor and never deal with iTouchless again. The lid will shut but not open and there are only the two of us in the house and we know how they work and did not abuse it. Nine Stars was the old one so I'm now going back to see if I can get another one from them!

So I paid $20 to get it repaired by sending it to the company. The repaired top quit working after 6 months. Since it was a little over a year, it was out of warranty. I would have to pay $40 for a new top. I opened the motor housing and found several broken pieces of plastic. It seems that the plastic used for the internal parts is poor quality and not strong enough. I will not be replacing this item and will not purchase any iTouchless products, based on my experience with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"VERY disappointed with this and will be returning it. The 4.5 star reviews had me hopeful, but this thing is sooooo cheaply made. The stainless feels very thin and seems like it would dent easily. The rim that holds the bag in is flimsy cheap plastic, and the lid has no grooves for fingers to open it if the battery is dead or you don't want to use the automatic function. Even in a corner in the kitchen, with a 3 and 6 year I don't feel that this could stand up to normal day to day use, garbage cans should not need to be handled with care. The only positive thing is that it looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy this product. Stay away from this","review":"Trash can stopped working after few months. Sensor and the buttons not working any more. Lid is under 1 year warranty. When I talked to the customer service they asked me to send the lid at my cost and also asked me to send the money for the shipping which is required to send the repaired lid back to me.

I normally read reviews on items prior to purchase, but not the case with this one(impulse). This iTouchless 13 gallon Stainless Steel trash can is an amazingly refreshing addition to my kitchen, and works incredibly well for daily usage. I love not having to smell stinky trash when I come home or to open and close a lid when I have food covered hands. The ONLY downside is the lid opening is a bit smaller than i'd like it to be so I have to break larger items down a bit, and if I walk to close to it, my arm gets within sensor range and it will open, but that's only due to the placement in my kitchen, not the product itself. I also like the fact that if I have lots of usage at one go, I can keep the lid up until completion. All in all - I LOVE THIS TRASH CAN and would most definatley purchase another!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had had one of these automatic trash cans before but the design seems to have changed.

Stainless steel trash cans that don't do anything but hold trash cost considerably more than this can. Was so afraid I wouldn't find another on when the first one broke.

However, this time around the product has been a major disappointment. Despite repeatedly waiving your hand above the infrared sensor (in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions), the lid usually will not open. You then have to manually press the \\"open\\" button, defeating the purpose of buying a \\"hands-free\\" trash can.Also, when the lid does open, it does not open fully - I would estimate it opens at a 20-30 degree angle. The lid opens fully upright (90 degree angle) only when the \\"open\\" button is pressed manually.The other problem with this product is that the lid is supposed to remain open when the manual \\"open\\" button is pushed until the manual \\"close\\" button is pressed. This does not happen with our product. The lid closes on its own after a few seconds. This is very frustrating when you want the lid to remain open while cooking and cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Useful","review":"Absolutely great for the kitchen. Makes throwing trash away fun. Beautiful addition to my room. Easy to clean. Couple of things to keep in mind, the opening to the can is smaller than some since the opening mechanism is in the opening and therefore blocks a portion of it.

Buy any other trash can, one with a foot pedal. None of the hands-free models made by anyone work worth a darn, especially iTouchless. I have struggled in every way to get this thing to work. They won't fix it, they won't replace it, and now I've done what I can to persuade Bed Bath and Beyond to stop carrying iTouchless products.Absolute JUNK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great invention","review":"Love using this!

While the motion sensor is handy I don't know how long this is going to work as the dog is taller than the can now and has noticed he just has to pass his head over the top to open it.However, the device works great as advertised.

I had one purchase from costco and it's alot cheaper than this one and it lasted for four years. Still works but kind a want a new one. After doing my research I found this garbage can with a good rating and thouht give it a try. But very disappointed. The garbage can material is so cheap. The sensor does not work all the time. I have to turn on and off the switch all the time and it's really annoying.

Let's see how the third one works, because the design looks substantially identical -the manufacturer may have reinforced the weak point.I'm giving it two stars, despite its abysmal reliability, because the design is very neat -we like these trash cans so much that we keep replacing them. If the new one lasts longer it will deserve a better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really liked this at first...","review":"When I first got this trash can, I LOVED IT! But about 3 months in my husband, somehow bumped into it and the lid opening broke. I blamed my clutsy husband, but the lid opening is a little flimsy. Still in love, I bought a new lid from the company, which was about $70 or almost 80% of the cost of a new can. In less than one year, the lid is malfunctioning...it only opens 2 inches unless I press the OPEN button, but what is the point of that? I changed the batteries several times, but that didn't work either. Really disappointed on how much I have spend on this trash can. I wanted to keep on loving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"We received this trash can as a gift, and it worked at first. Then, we cleaned it. Even though we carefully followed the manufacturer's cleaning instructions, it would open and close by itself, and other times it just wouldn't work at all. It became the most HANDS ON trash can I've ever owned! We have fought with it for 3 years now, and are finally fed up and are ready to buy a new, NON-battery operated trash can. If you want touchless, save yourself the aggravation and buy a step can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this a couple weeks ago. I saw it on Amazon and I was just about to buy it when I noticed Costco had the SAME one for half the price! What a great price! I don't know how long the batteries will last. Everytime I walk by the trash can it opens automatically. There is also a lever in the back that lets you shut the automatic part of it off. The only part I didn't like about this was on the inside hinges. They are plastic so I am hoping they won't break easily from opening and closing often. Overall I am very happy with this trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"$10.00 cheaper than bed bath and beyond with no taxes and free shipping. Works better than I thought.

It worked great for 11 months and we really liked it. It is pretty sensitive so you didn't want to get close to it unless you wanted it to open but that was no big deal. A couple of weeks ago it suddenly started opening and closing all the time with no one around. I have tried changing the batteries, cleaning the sensor, repositioning it and nothing has helped. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a canned response telling me to try the things I already tried. It is still under warranty but based on other people's experiences, it is not worth paying the shipping for another one that most likely won't last either."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the positive reviews are TRUE!","review":"I received it on 7/31/06 and was impressed w/ how well the manufacturer had packed it for shipping. It was evident they take pride in their product. As another reviewer noted, the metal could be thicker, but really it is quite adequate. It looks sharp, works as promised, and now it's less expensive than when I purchased it here a week ago. BTW Amazon has the lowest price on this item and w/ free shipping it is quite a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"LID SENSOR MALFUNCTION!!","review":"It worked great for a few weeks. After that I experienced the same problem that many others here have. The lid stays open. When the close button is pressed, the lid closes and opens back again after a second for no reason. And it simply stays open even if there's nothing around it. Changing batteries didn't help. I closed it and shut it off for a day. Then it worked well for an hour or so before malfunctioning again.I'll be calling their customer service and will update this review. If their service sucks this wouldn' be a product worth buying no matter how fancy it is.Some reviews mention about their customer service giving a damn! If I experience that I'll make videos of the malfunctioning trash can and post it on YouTube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possessed by a ghost","review":"I am very disappointed with this trashcan. Within 1.5 months of purchasing the system, it's already malfunctioning. The trash can opens of its own accord and remains open until you push the close button. Then, it opens up again. However, when you try to open the can utilizing the motion sensor, the can doesn't open. I am so frustrated, I can't believe more people haven't posted regarding this problem. I would strongly advise against purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I recently purchased the iTouchless trash can and although it works fine, it will cost a fortune in \\"D\\" size batteries. I've had mine for one week and the batteries are already going. Also, the company wants to charge an extra $19.99 for the plug adapter which is a total rip off. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' Trashy is Great!","review":"Trashy as this garbage can is affectionately known as in our household is great. We've had him for over two years and I'm sorry to say he is on his last legs. The wiring box where you put batteries from time to time gets gross and you have to take it apart, clean it and sometimes take a wire brush to the conductors. I think Trashy has had to many clean outs and is ready to go.That being said this trash can has been the best. It's always worked very well. It's a good size and it's so much cooler than a twice as expensive simple human stainless steel model. Everyone who interacts with it gets a kick out of it.4 stars because the battery compartment could be better protected from moisture. But otherwise GREAT!! And dirt cheap for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cool and a for-sure puppy-proof product","review":"I absolutely love this can.

We used it for about four months before it started acting weird. Last night it started doing this (watch video). Contacted support and learned that it may be due to moisture. We'll try taking the steps they recommended. If it works properly after that, I'll change my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a piece of crap!","review":"Agree entirely on all bad reviews listed above!We bought the 13-Gallon itouchless trash can in August 2012 and it worked fine for about a month.For some reason the lid stopped working in September. We changed the batteries, used adapter, cleaned the sensor. Nothing worked.So disappointed. Do not buy this trash can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"This product worked great for a week or so, then the sensor completely failed. Tried some of the suggestions written by other reviewers with the same problem, but nothing I tried got the sensor to work again. The open and close buttons still worked, but this is a touchless trash can. I really did like it for the week it worked, and probably would give it 4 or 5 stars like many other reviewers if it was still working. However, this is not an inexpensive trash can, and for it to fail so quickly for the main feature I purchased it for, I give it the lowest rating. I sent it back and appreciate Amazon's great return policy. I debated whether or not to order another one as I already had purchased four new D batteries, but didn't feel confident enough that I wouldn't end up with another defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and sensor stopped working 2 months after warranty expired","review":"I really liked this trash can at first. It worked well and was kind of cool looking. But two very important things keep me from recommending it.The first is it leaks. If the bag leaks, the trash can certainly does not stop liquid from leaking all over the floor. I don't think it's too much to ask of a kitchen trash can for it not to leak.Second is after owning it for 14 months, two months after the warranty expires, the sensor stopped working. I've tried all the fixes in the top review, and no go. Even if it were still under warranty, paying shipping both ways and being without a trash can for weeks doesn't sound too appealing anyway.I guess I'll get a Simplehuman step can like I wanted in the first place, but dang they are pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good garbage can","review":"This product works well at keeping a kitchen cleaner by not having to touch the lid to open it when throwing away things like chicken scraps. I do not have the adapter to plug it in, so I just use batteries. The batteries actually last a long time, many many months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trash can!","review":"I love my new trash can and so does everyone who sees it at work! The only drawback was that the retainer ring that was sent did not fit. Also, be sure that nothing obstructs the way of the sensor or it will stay open. Shadows even keep it open. Great quality and it looks great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"This is a good can. It is our second one because the first one broke. Be careful with the lid.

Very unhappy, as I already spent over $80 on the original trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"itouchless garbage can is great","review":"I purchased this item as a gift. Great product. My only complaint is it is a little too sensitive. Opens when we just walk by. That will just take some getting used to. Overall great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"I purchased this trash can based on the high ratings I saw from the many reviews. I must cast my vote the other way. From the day I received the item, the trash can door will close properly only about 70% of the time. It does not matter if I was using the IR sensor or the button, 30% of the time, it leaves a gap of about 1 inch when closed. I played with it for a week and could not figure out a pattern. Sometimes it works consistently 10 times in a row and I thought everything is ok. Then the next morning, the problem came back. I ended up returning it. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy and easy process."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sensor went crazy in less than a year","review":"It was wonderful as long as it worked. After about 10 months of having it, the sensor stopped working: it would open/close the lid non- stop by itself.

Great product and a good price compared to other local and online retailers.The only problem we have is...our little dog does not like it...every time we head to the trash can, she runs out of the room, and returns after the lid closes. Maybe she will get used to it. Have already recommended this product to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept. Faulty execution. Hate it.","review":"We've owned this (two of them) for over a year now and are frustrate to no end. They never open instantly, so you're standing there for a count of 2-3 seconds waiting with whatever you want to throw out as if frozen in time. Then they close rather precipitously ... just as you're in the midst of the motion of tossing in food scraps, etc. Had we known, we'd never have bought them. We bought one for trash and one for recycling. They work the same and frustrate equally. Never up when you want, never stays up as long as you want, and often close in the middle of your action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ITEM","review":"This item arrived promply and packaged in solid form fitting insta-pak.

Going to contact the company..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother's little helper","review":"What can i say? There are soooo many reasons why this thing is wonderful. I wish i had thought of it.

Bravo to the creator of this elementary robot."},{"rating":"2","title":"great trash can","review":"I love this trash can. It is easy to clean, works exactly as advertised, doesn't eat batteries, and looks really cool. It manages to look slim but nicely fit larger garbage items. It is also *exactly* the right size for a standard white kitchen trash bag, filling the bag so there's no wasted space but leaving just the right amount of space at the top to tie it off. It's both a great trash can and a great conversation piece, especially if you like nifty gadgets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution to a nasty problem, and free entertainment!","review":"No one wants to see the trash. Now we not only don't see the trash, we don't touch the container until we are ready to remove the bag and put another in. My hands never get dirty. My little grandsons never \\"rescue\\" anything from the trash. And the entertainment value of watching an 18 month old figure out what causes that thing to open and close is priceless! There is much competition between the 18 month old and the 4 year old to put things into the trash to help me. The first day we had this thing, I think the little one put most of a box of tissues in there, registering surprise and puzzlement with each deposit.We love it because it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Have trash can","review":"We love our new iTouchless Stainless-Steel Hands Free 13 Gallon Infrared Automatic Trash Can!

I called asking to have them refund the ridiculous cost of this little plastic piece and was ready to order a new can, but they refused to take back the little plastic piece without me paying for it's return!!!

The times we have left something sticking out and hovering over the sensor keeping it open have been exceptions.It somehow even works in the dark.It scares the tar out of passing toddlers, and even some adults, which is hi-lar-i-ous. Despite that, it definitely isn't over sensitive. It's right in the middle of our lives, between the kitchen and dining area, and never opens accidently.If it ever dies I'll likely buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"I purchased the 13-gallon !Touchless trash can for my disabled wife who only has one working hand as the result of a stroke. The can has held up to her abuse while she was learning to use it along with her personal care aide. The !Touchless can uses standard tall kitchen trash bags which are held in place by an internal expansion ring. This hides the bag from view. As well as being stainless steel the design and size allow it to fit in tight spaces. The biggest benefit is the lid closes tight and there are no noticeable orders. The lid operates with 4 \\"D\\" cell batteries and according to the enclosed info, 10,000 cycles are expected from the batteries. If the batteries go dead the lid can still be opened by hand. I am considering the 3-gallon can for our restroom now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trash can!","review":"This trash can is the perfect size and slim so it fits in tight spaces. It opens when you wave your hand and closes by itself. Very convenient for a cook who is carrying gross food to the trash can and cannot open it themselves. Of course, being stainless steel, its gets fingerprints, but they wipe off easily. Too be expected with stainless steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Can does open when you walk by it sometimes. my one year old loves to trow things away (this is not a good thing because I do not want them in the garbage) My older child does fine with it.

However, I do not like the narrow opening (in which the lid's germ free existance quickly disappears)and the 10 minutes it takes me to change the trash bag.

I bought the round can and the lid stopped working right around the end of 1 year. I called itouchless and they send me a replacement lid which cost as much as the garbage can with shipping, The new lid has stopped working as soon as 1 year was up. If you want to spend $50 every year for a garbage can you can buy one of these. The customer service will not help you any way .. all they want is for you to buy another product from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"loose and lost battery cover","review":"The first time we emptied the can and replaced the lid, the plastic battery compartment cover and the batteries dropped into the can. Despite our care to always secure it - including holding it in place with duct tape - the cover was eventually accidently thrown out with the trash, taking the batteries along with it. After several unsuccessful attempts to replace the cover we just use the can with the lid either permanently up or down. Not very sanitary or convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but broke","review":"so this is a trash can and it is awesome at first. The infrared works great. Mine broke in two different ways. The first was one of the springs broke that are used when opening and closing so it still worked, except the lid didn't have the strength to stay up when \\"open\\" was selected to keep it open. Then the bad one the panel that holds the batteries broke. This was not a problem until at first because I used duct tape to keep it on and the batteries in place. However that failed one day and the panel and the batteries fell in the trash and I did not notice until after the trash was taken away by the city. So now I have to open it by touching it not very sanitary in my opinion. I am giving this one star for this reason, however if yours does not break like mine did it would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT HANDS FREE TRASH CAN","review":"I am very pleased with this trash can. It works just as expected. I have had no problems with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than advertised!","review":"Received this trash bin 3 days sooner than first estimate. It works better than we could have imagined. Just the right size for a 13 gal bag and very easy to use. The lid opening sensor is sensitive enough to detect incoming garbage, but not so sensitive that it opens when someone walks by. The retaining ring to hold the bag seemed awkward when placing a fresh bag at first, but after a bag or two it's hardly worth mentioning. I like the way that the bag is secured and removal is easy. And the price is right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant product","review":"Perfect for anyone who always has hands full in the kitchen. Never worry about washing hands excessively between food preparation and discarding food in the process. The lid stays open for 5 seconds only so if you're clearing food from your plate, you better do it fast. Otherwise, this is really a good product. A must have for someone like who cringes when discarding food to the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love our ITouchless Hands-Free Trash can!","review":"This is our second ITouchless Stainless-Steel Hand-Free 13-Gallon Infrared Automatic trash can. It is so convenient, and it keeps us free from germs that might be on the can. Besides this health advantage,it saves time because I do not have to wash my hands before or after opening the can. My first can got stuck once and someone in my family forced it closed. Unfortunately this broke the top. After a week or two of having to open the can by hand, I ordered a new one. My family has been given clear instructions to not force the top down. One drawback could be the extra sensitive sensor. The top opens when someone walks too near the can or if our dog wags his tail too close! I can't imagine my kitchen without this can."},{"rating":"1","title":"door was not designed well and is prone to crack","review":"I bought this at the local sams club.

I called the manufacturer for a replacement door and they came back saying that they never sold their product through Sams club.

Got this one for a much lower price than we paid for the original.Based on past experience, my only bit of advice is to not block or impeded the movement of the lid. The gear assembly inside appears to be somewhat fragile and you can strip them if you try to stop the lid from moving.Otherwise, great product. No hands touching the trash can = no germs."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome germ free can!","review":"This trash can is the best. I put batteries in it 3 weaks ago and it is still going strong. The bags remove easilly, unlike other stainless cans. We are very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT TRASH CAN!","review":"This is a great trash can. It is my second one - I purchased my first one about a year and half ago, last month the hinge on the lid broke. Just had to get another one. I love the hands free, no touching the lid and it is so quiet not to mention the stylish stainless steel that goes with everything in my kitchen. The batteries seem to last forever, still using the batteries from the first one. All my friends have commented on it and wanted to know where I got it. Great product - highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted.....the hinge broke","review":"I had this for 6 month and was pretty pleased with it. Then the hinge broke making this into an expensive regular open-top trash can. Replacing the top assembly is an expensive option to repair this. I will just pick up a 'normal' foot operated trash can next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAVE OF THE FUTURE....of trash.","review":"Constantly people were throwing away trash in my house and when the barrel would get full they would push it down with their hands, or you are touching the barrel top to throw things away. I was at a friend's house and he had this touchless trash can and I was amazed. It holds a ridiculous amount of waste and it will automatically open and shut when you stand in front of it. It's definitely more sanitary and will help you keep germs off your hands or for children in your house. It pleases the Misophobia in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I will keep it simple. It works great. It looks great. This is the second one we have owned. Both have failed prematurely as the gear mechanism that opens the lid is less than a quarter inch wide and made of plastic. Each time it has failed the gear (i.e., snaps). The last trash can lasted 7 months. We are going to buy a step operated can next. The step trash can is more money but a ten year warranty. It is also cheaper in the long run. Take it from two engineers (wife and I), this is not a durable design. The Achilles heel is the tiny gear. Then the whole thing is trash (pun intended)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Into 'Cool' Factor","review":"This product works as promised, but I really wish I hadn't fallen for the appeal of a touchless garbage can. A garbage can with a footstep is the way to go. It reacts immediately, stays open as long as your foot presses the pedal and closes as soon as you take your foot off. With this, you have to deal with the finicky sensor and a garbage can that oftentimes develop a mind of its own. I can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated when standing by the garbage can and having it open and close constantly.Guests are also confused anytime they have to throw something away. Often, they just lift the lid up themselves and disregard the sensor.You're buying a garbage can, not an iPod. Stick to the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but pricey","review":"A decent trash can with one draw back. The battery compartment is under the lid. So after about 3 days of use, i lost the battery cover. It must have fallen in the trash and been thrown away. Now I use tape to hold the batteries in place. So word of advice, careful with the battery cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, fragile, and expensive - not for regular use","review":"A fun novelty; don't buy this product for daily use. Extremely noisy gearbox to raise and lower the lid. Difficult asymetrical trash bag retaining ring inside the can often slips down past its retaining point and is always exposed to trash so you can just about guarantee you get garbage residue on your hands when changing the bag, and now I find the lid hinge points are very fragile and break, and the only solution offered by customer service is to buy another \\"lid assembly\\" for half the original cost of the unit when there should be a way to buy the broken plastic piece for $2 (Okay, $10-$15 by the time everyone gets their cut) or some kind of repair kit to patch the hinge area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I should have read ALL of the customer reviews before purchasing this can. It is a bit flimsy for the price AND I've only had it for 2 days and the lid is already acting up. As in the other negative reviews the lid opens without anything in front of the sensor and stays open, you have to use the \\"close\\" button and hope that it stays closed and the \\"open\\" button if it does stay closed to get it to re-open. The sensor appears to be malfunctioning. Great idea but poor quality. I'm not sure if I'm going to bother shipping it back, I have to see how much the shipping charges will be. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gear teeth broke making unit unusable....","review":"Worked great for a few months and then the plastic gear teeth molded into the lid wore down, causing the unit to try to open but fail. I now have a $90 trash can that does nothing. Contacted iTouchless and 2 of their reps refused to acknowledge, instead referring me to a hidden web page on their site where I can order a replacement top for $45! All I need is the top flip lid. It's too bad they skimped on a 75 cent part of the construction process because the whole unit is now failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"We are extremely pleased with the hands-free trash can. We have had it around a month and have had no problems with the way it functions. I would recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"This trash can is GREAT!","review":"I gave one of these as a gift 3 years ago - and its still going strong. So when I needed a new trash can I knew just what I wanted. The automatic lid keeps the top from getting grungy - and keeps your kitchen trash out of view and hides any odors. I had a step lid can - but got sick of jerking the lid open. I also like the compact design - some other automatic cans have big mechanisms protruding out the back. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this trash can with a passion","review":"I normally don't write Amazon reviews but I hate this thing so much so I just can't hold myself back. We got it about six months ago. It seemed fine at first but then I started realizing how terrible it is.* it can get moldy easily since food going in may touch the sides of the top part of the trash can as its going in - this can be pretty common if you're cleaning scraps off a wide cutting board.* you need to hold your hand over the sensor to get it to open - which means that the trash can may get gross when your hands are wet and you try to throw something away. it also means you have to wait for it to open.* occasionally the motor gets into a state where it only opens partway* after a few months of use, the motor no longer works at all. the trash can opens about a quarter of an inchI don't even want to attempt to fix this thing. We're getting a new trash can this weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice trash can.","review":"my guests get a kick out of it. and I love using the joke that it's an \\"apple product\\" everyone always laugh when I say it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but doesn't work.","review":"This product does not come with the adapter so have batteries ready when it arrives. Or you will need to hold on to its two massive boxes until you get to the store to purchase the 4 D batteries it requires.

WHAT A SCAM!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, but quality of parts is a problem","review":"I had to replace my first lid because the gear broke. I ordered it from itouchless.com. $45 for a whole new lid is just stupid. Then 3 years later, the springs on the replacement lid broke. I can't order new springs, but I could order a new lid again. I just went to the hardware store, bought some new springs and rigged it so they would work. $4 for springs. I contacted the company, no help there. Why don't they sell replacement parts? I understand that moving parts wear, but they should offer replacements. My next garbage can will not be touchless, because of the cost to replace worn units. Too bad, I like it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed.","review":"This garbage can has been great. When my hands are full I love the fact that all I have to do is walk up to it and it opens and then when I walk away it closes slowly on its on. My 3 year old daughter loves it as well. We had to watch her at first because she was throwing everything away just to see it work, I mean everything. I don't feel that it is overly sensitive. It has a switch in the back so you can shut the automatic lid off but then there is no step pedal or anything else that helps you open it without using your fingertips to wedge in and open the lid manually. There are buttons on the front as well to push to open and close if the infrared automatic doesn't sense you but this has never happened. The one downfall about it is that the garbage sack ring is a bit tricky to insert but when it is put on right it holds the sack great. I'm happy with my buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Hands Free Feature","review":"Love the hands free feature. Great when you are cooking (i.e. egg shells in hands, etc.) and need to throw out in the trash. My mom is handicapped (walks with a walker and is very limited to what she can carry) so this trash can has been very helpful in her household (bought her one for a present). She puts the items to throw out on her walker and then goes over to the trash can and when the lid automatically opens she is able to throw out items without losing her balance.I am on my 2nd one. Wasn't too happy that the little plastic part broke that works the automatic feature (not very durable for the price you pay). The only warning would be if you have a dog in the household that may automatically activate and then get into the trash. I do not have that problem; however, when a friend of mine's dog was over, she figured out this feature quickly and thought that was a great advantage for her getting into my trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trashcan.","review":"I have had a couple electronic trash cans and this one is pretty easy to keep clean. I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"I've owned this trashcan for a little over two months and still love it! It took time to get used to the touchless feature, but once you get a hang of it, you gotta love it, especially when bringing hands full of scraps to throw away. Try doing it with the trashcan in the closed cabinet under the sink. It seems to be too sensitive sometimes, and opens when I am just walking too close by, but this doesn't bother me at all. The mechanism is quiet, opens and closes properly, you can open it with the \\"Open\\" button for it to stay open when you are cooking, and need to use it constantly. I finally don't have to worry about the cat getting into it when we are away from home. The only downside of a closed garbage can is that in the heat of summer garbage starts smelling faster, but you can't feel the smell when the can is closed - that carbon filter and tightly closed lid do their job pretty good. Overall - I am very satisfied with this product, and feel it's totally worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not like","review":"just received today and do not really like it. it works fine, but like one review pointed out, it looks so cheap.to really make angry, in the front middle, it has a connect line, which apparently the pictures do not show, this really turns me down.will stayaway from itouchless products."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working in less than a month!","review":"I was so disappointed that this expensive trash can is no longer working in less than a month.It should be more durable for the price we have to pay.Harder still is the process of returning it and the offer of company to have it repaired with all the shipping costs it is asking for the customer to shoulder.Better buy in the store and not online so if problem arises, easier to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"The cover only completely closes periodically; this is the second one that I have had as I returned another one for the very same reason. At first I thought it was due to running it on batteries but then I purchased the overpriced electric adapter but the problem remains; sounds like Amazon has determined that this is an ongoing product wide problem.If you have a similar problem, return it to Amazon immediately.

They will not allow a total refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Trash Bin I have ever had","review":"This is my first review on amazon since I hate this product so much, I want to spend the time to let others know. First of all, the Lid is really easy to break as you can see with other review. The worse is actually the customer service. When the lid break (it will break eventually), you have to pay for shipping and return shipping and ship them the broken lid, then they will try to fix it and ship it back to you. Sounds ok, but the process will take about a month. I think it took me around 3 weeks. Finally I just got the lid today and realized the replacement is broken out of the box. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool, conversation starter but really is annoying","review":"The other reviewer's right - it's too sensitive at times (opens when anyone walks within 1 ft), but when you need it to open, it won't.

We initially received it as a Christmas gift a few years ago. This trash can has been a conversation piece everytime company comes over and they go to throw something away. I love it when I have a handfull of garbage and it automatically opens for you. It's very quiet. You don't have to fumble trying to open the lid and touching it. It seems so much more sanitary. It now has become a necessity in our lives, instead of a luxury. We would miss it terribly. You find yourself when we go to other peoples homes, you are waving your hand in front of their trash can to get it to open, and it doesn't... LOL The batteries last a really long time. I don't think we have had to replace them but once a year. The stainless steel can won't rust and I think it looks very modern to fit in with today's style. It blends in with the appliances nicely.
