He discusses the failures of his presidency, notably the embargo of all trade, in a fair manner. Finally, he provides an interesting analysis of the motivations and sources of Republican policy and places Jeffersonianism in its historical context in a much clearer way than I have ever read before.The book is well-written, although perhaps on the short side. It also contains almost nothing about Jefferson's life before or after the presidency--it really is a history of his presidency."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"i like this book because it was a romantic and a suspension book,,,specially because i love story about kings and queens and that they are not mean people like some people thinks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows Dance Sad Waltzes with a Sigh of Rapture","review":"The above title is from a quote in the booklet, \\"in the north there are a lot of shadows. there are far more shadows than people. in the south the shadows are sharper and clearer. it is easier to talk to them. in the north, they dance sad waltzes with a sigh of rapture.\\" - per kirkeby.

This album contains some incredible gems, shiniest (if darkness can shine) of which is \\"Tell Myself\\", which simply one of the best songs Eitzel has ever written. Some of the songs are a bit grating, especially in the context of what immediately precedes them, which is something a little creative CD programming can fix. The Eitzel funny bone is present in the form of \\"Mr. Lucky\\" and the more subtle \\"How Low\\", one of the extra tracks on this re-release. This latter song is to my ears a listenable satire of the tide of early 80s electronic pop that was ebbing when _Restless Stranger_ was released.

Has the feel of a 'made for Sci-Fi Channel' budget and acting, but that's not always a bad thing. The plot held together all the way through and the effects were not terrible. They were overly obviously CG but worked within the structure and feel of the movie.This is NOT boring if you ARE looking for more than just 90 solid minutes of Mobile Suits fighting. The characters are simplistic but interesting and they move the human drama along just fine. Common threads found in many Gundam plots are to be found in G-Saviour as well, such as the moral dilema of conflicting loyalties and understanding for one's self what the right thing is to do in overwhelming and difficult situations.The spectacle of the final MS battle does not dissapoint when it comes time, so it seems there is something here for both people looking for the pathos of human drama and MS fans wanting to see mechs battling it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the kewlist live-action Gundam Film ever.","review":"This is the live kick butt movie for you Gundam fans out there.

It takes way to long to get to the big Mecha battle at the end and then its over much too quickly.The Ugly:1) This should have been a Japanese production.

I managed to make it through about 40 minutes of so-called acting before I had to stop.

If you never gotten into a lotus pose, I'm sure the regimen here will get you over the top to do that pose. I unfortunately couldn't on the first two tries, but I felt it. And did feel the DVD was worthwhile.I will say this - as a dude, I'm not a fan of hip openers. I will do it here and there as I realize/feel the benefits. But for traditional like yoga Anusara yoga class...i'll practice with \\"Lakshmi Rocks Me\\" and \\"The Dance of Yes and No\\". Still...i can't knock this DVD - it will stretch you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for learning technique but too much language","review":"This video is OK to watch once or twice to get the technique down. John's descriptions and directions are very good. However, I found this video to have way too much language. I found John's non stop talking to be distracting and not conducive to relaxing and going within, as it should be in yoga. This video is a training video only. It's not one I could practice yoga with on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"I just got through to Part 4 and was disgusted that \\"Dating Mr. Darcy\\" was a religious screed masquerading as a P&P; sequel.

It was that, in part, but I found myself increasingly annoyed at her giggle-with-me style of writing, and downright furious by her assumption that anyone who admires or resembles Lizzie or Darcy is, of course, a good Christian. Some of us consider ourselves to be kind and decent people and aren't Christian at all. In the end,I found it beyond disappointing; I found it insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This haunting album should mesmerize Jeff Buckley, Elvis Costello and David Bowie fans as much as it does classical aficionados. John Dowland (1563-1626) was one of the greatest Elizabethan songwriters, full of lament and angst--über-emo in overdrive. These dark songs are not for polite, post-19th-century, operatically trained-cum-Elizabethan voices. Play \\"Flow My Teares,\\" perhaps Dowland's most famous song: Sung without accompaniment, its starkness touches the subconscious, an ancient echo of Ralph Stanley's \\"O Death.\\" The Forge Players, a Scandinavian string quintet, were joined by two non-classical art-rock singers, Mikael Samuelson and Freddie Wadling. Here, you'll discover why Costello sang \\"Flow My Teares\\" at Buckley's funeral. If Dowland is new to you, let this be your introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"I bought this HDCD based on the fact that it is an HDCD, I like Dowland, and original instrument recordings. The first cut is fantastic. However, each to their own, the next two vocal cuts are not to my tastes. The engineering seems to be heavily \\"tweaked\\" to cover for quality of the vocalist and this severely hurts the sound of the excellent instrumentalists who would have been better off without the vocalist, IMHO. I couldn't bear the thought of listening to any more of the album.Too bad, because it had excellent promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Bitter Gourd and Other Stories\\" by Talat Abbasi","review":"This collection of short stories by Talat Abbasi is a contemporary classic. Set in Pakistan and New York, the stories deal with the lives of ordinary people - rich and poor, master and servant, husband and wife, parents and children. But there is nothing mundane about these stories. In the hands of a master story teller, the ordinary turns into the extraordinary to surprise the reader at every step and reveal the psychological and sociological complexities of people's lives. This collection is a first rate addition to the worldclass literature emanating from South Asian writers.Rating: 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy at beginning to be useful","review":"After a useful chapter 1 \\"Quickstart\\", the text plunges quickly into mind-boggling complexity, including lengthy initial \\"Security basics\\", philosophic \\"Overview of JEE application development\\", \\"Web application principles\\", \\"Web application design\\", and a do-it-my-way \\"Setting up a development environment\\" chapters.

However, in spite of the difficulties and obstacles, I still expect good editing, grammer, solid plots and character building. Although the base story line is a good one, Not All Dogs is lacking in many areas. In fact, Robinson filled the pges with several meaningless scenes, which weighed the plot down unnecessarily.

I was incredibly wrong, this is a magnificent showcase of talented bands on one CD, a rare treat. I would highly recomend this to anyone who has a passion for beautifully crafted music that touches your soul to the very core."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"One word to describe this soundtrack...disappointing! Despite a few gems, the rest of the music is hardly noteworthy. I guess it was still worth buying since the songs by Heather Nova and Amy Jo Johnson are great...but I can't say the same for the rest of the CD. The only way I would enjoy the entire CD is if I was in an extremely calm and somber mood...so if you like that kind of music, you'll really enjoy it...I guess it's all depends on your taste! Enjoy it or don't...love always!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I consider myself an avid fan of this show, as I have watched the reruns over and over again, as well as purchased most of the series on DVD. One of my favorite pieces of Felicity was the selection of music that was played during the episodes. When I saw that there was a compilation of songs from the shows, I was looking forward to hearing them. However, many of the songs from the shows were not included on the CD, and I was disappointed with so many of the songs that were on the CD. I will always love that show, regardless of the disppointing CD - there's nothing like it around anymore - I am grateful that I experienced such a wonderful program."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TV Show rules, so this CD has to..","review":"I'm not a fan of soundtracks..

Yes, it's real leather, and yes it's just as warm, but patch leather has a \\"CHEAP\\" look about it. That's why it costs so much less.

And the exersizes have no point to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link so far in the Decker/Lazarus series","review":"The book starts off well, as a mystery should, with the events of the murder of Dr. Sparks. But then it spends the next 300 or so pages batting back and forth, and not really going anywhere. Plus the relationship between Rita Lazarus' deceased husband and the priest are totally incongruious, as I'm sure Kellerman realized when she threw in this rather burdensome plot twist.However, the end of the book really does pull some surprises. You just have to plod through the middle to get there. Not her best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best book Faye Kellerman has written so far","review":"This is the most thought-provoking book in the entire Rina Lazarus and Peter Decker series. Some of the books in the series are light reading, but this one is really deep on so many levels. A lot of loose ends are tied up about Rina's earlier life, important details that will matter to long-time fans of the book series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book kept me thinking","review":"I have never read Faye Kellerman before, and I expected something different from this book, because I had read her husband's work, which was not religious in any way.\\"Prayers for the Dead\\" did much to disguise the real killer. However, after wading through a lot of Jewish vs. Christian material, it was hardly a surprise to see that the UN-Christian, UN-holy bikers had perpetrated the evil plot.On Mrs. Kellerman's behalf, I can say that the book was very accurate on all accounts. However, the actual plot lacked \\"twist\\" due to the abrupt ending wherein those who hated gays were those who hated authority.Perhaps if I had more experience related to the Jewish lifestyle, I would more fully appreciate this work. Nevertheless, I read it until the end and was happy to see that the Catholic priest was innocent, despite his tragic death.Not much of a review, considering that I've told the whole plot...but, there you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The religious lessons, theology, rites and ritual one is forced to endure while reading Faye Kellerman's books completely destroys any enjoyment of the mystery--threw it in the garbage after 100 pages. There's too many other interesting writers out there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent unless you're a Christian","review":"Like \\"Grievous Sin\\" this book is another exercise in spreading contempt for religious Christians. Faye Kellerman's writing, and stories are excellent. If you're a Christian grab some other Peter Decker, Rina Lazarus book and enjoy it -- they are all well written and fun to read. But avoid this one and \\"Grievous Sin\\" unless you have a thick skin. In her other books religious Christians have the luxury of being igored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family secrets","review":"Dr. Azor Sparks, a prominent heart specialist, is found brutally murdered. Lieutenant Peter Decker is called in on the case and he discovers that the doctor fathered some very dysfunctional children who stood to benefit from their father's life insurance policy. To complicate matters, Dr. Sparks was developing a controversial new drug, and several people had a motive to disrail his research. A third complication is Dr. Sparks' unlikely association with a motorcycle gang with whom he rode on weekends. As always, Faye Kellerman weaves disparate threads into an interesting pattern and intertwines Peter Decker's professional and personal lives. In this book Peter's wife Rina has an unusual connection with one of the murder suspects and this creates some tension between the two of them. This is another winner from Faye Kellerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best book since the first ones","review":"Faye Kellerman's recent books have read like books that her publisher pushed her into writing. \\"Faye, baby, let's have another book quick while you're still hot. Just bang it out, and you'll sell a million.\\"Prayers for the Dead, however, lets Kellerman develop her characters and her plot as threads as intertwined as the strands of the tzitsis. If you liked the early Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus books, you'll like this one. Read the description for the plot line, read the book for Kellerman's deft touch with a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faye Kellerman always delivers for me","review":"Another great Peter and Rina novel.

The lyrics and vocals may leave a lot to be desired, but the blending of simple, deep bass with crunching guitars results in an awesome sound.

From the thundering riffs to the delicate organ and piano, this album proves to be a tour de force for Earth.

[I am a celebrant in Australia and I get to read a lot of poetry.] It is ideal for weddings and ceremonies for to-day's couples (some of the poetry may not be suitable to read in Churches - so read them outside!!). It's delicious and delightful. It will touch your soul and your deep longings and memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"There wasn't a single likable character in this book. The heroine was a pathetic, spineless girl who spent the entire time chasing a man who was verbally abusive to her and the hero was a self-centered jerk who made himself feel better by constantly belittling and humiliating his wife. I could not figure out why either one of them even wanted to be together; halfway through the book, I no longer cared. I'm all for flawed characters, but they should at least be likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!! :)","review":"The Harem Bride is a Regency read that isn't stuck in London, with the story ranging from Shropshire to Constantinople and the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland. Although the book never quite comes out and says it, the villain in The Harem Bride seems to be a little old lady from Kent, who is so quick to think the worst that she ruins her niece's life. We all like to think we would never allow the events in this story to happen, that we'd be smarter, more perceptive, more adaptable, but sometimes those closest to the problem can't see the obvious solution. A lot of us have been there, experienced that. Penelope and Jason have to learn flexibility and forgiveness before they can move on with their lives. They have to suffer loneliness, hurt each other all over again, before they finally find peace. The inclusion of Lord Elgin and his marbles adds an extra dimension to this tale of lovers who might have led perfectly normal lives if they hadn't met in Constantinople."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"A preposterous plot, which verges close to pedophilia.

Smaller bags, now you get less!","review":"The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...EDITED TO ADD:I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before.

Watch out for this problem with other Japanese/English picture dictionaries as some of the other dictionaries have the same defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for starters","review":"I have used this with many of my adult Japanese students who are in the U.S. for a time and want to have instruction in conversation and practical English. It is good for Beginner to Intermediate levels and provokes many avenues for conversation. Pronunciation and discussion of various subjects follow. It is helpful to have the Beginning and/or Intermediate Workbook to go along for practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view you don't usually see","review":"If you're like me, the everything about the early days of space flight is captivating. I've read other accounts of this time period, including the incredibly in-depth michener novel \\"Space\\". What you don't often see is the view from the controller's booth. You don't see that often there was absolutely no data or voice communications between early spacecraft and the ground. You don't see the months of drills that Mission Control would stage, only to encounter problems that they could never have dreamed. Consequently, this account is a good read, and I enjoyed it. You may occasionally get bogged down by Franz's desire to name almost every person he can think of, as well as the endless acronyms. The jacket makes a big connection with Apollo 13. It is misleading because the book is far more comprehensive than that. Despite these shortcomings, I found it hard to put down and eye-opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Read!","review":"I lived through most of the events the author recounts, and, at the time, they seemed to be pretty neat adventures. The advantage of age and Gene Kranz's detailed descriptions made me realize how daring, brave, and trusting, the first astronauts were!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Being a bit of a NASA-junkie, I really enjoyed getting this historical perspective from a long respected launch director (Gene Kranz). I found it rather inspiring and instilled a pride of our space accomplishments.I only wish we were able to maintain this feeling with our current NASA objectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic person","review":"Fantastic story, of life on NASA. Who loves grat's time of mission space. Gene is fantastic personality in the world. Tks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read after reading all the astronauts' books.","review":"Gene Kranz's book tells a similar story, as told in books by Eugene Cerman, Scott Carpenter, and Chris Kraft, without being dominated by the author's ego. The others wrote good books. But Kranz avoids using personal attacks to tell his tale. The antidotes differ from those in other stories, as Kranz does not have a Boy Scout image to preserve. However, Kranz covers mission control only through Apollo 17.This book is an excellent story of the space race from the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION","review":"Gene Kranz was there from the start, a true pioneer. Starting with a blank page, the Mercury program, and progressing through Gemini and Apollo; developing the plans, procedures and mission goals to accomplish mankinds' greatest acheivement -- landing a man on the moon and safely returning him to earth.Tough and competent, discipline and morale. Mr. Kranz defined the human spirit with these statements in a way you can in no way comprehend without reading this book.The title says it all, FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insider account of the beginnings of Nasa","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was especially fun to read this book and then watch the movie \\"The Dish\\" as they complement each other quite well! In addition to the events at Nasa, this also doubles as a semi-biography of Gene Krantz, also interesting, but not what I was expecting! All in all this is a great read representing a unique period in American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I consider myself an afficianado of the U.S. space program of the 1960s and early '70s, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Kranz's book.Kranz has always seemed to be a man of the utmost integrity, dedication and competence. But a page-turning writer he is not. If he used a ghost writer on this book he was ripped off, seeing as how the prose is dry as dust.The book is likely a valuable contribution to history, but it will probably be more referenced in future books than it will be read in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring reading for technical leaders of all kinds","review":"While I confess to being a lifelong space buff, this book is the first of many memoirs I have had the pleasure of reading from the actual men and women who participated in one of the greatest adventures in human history. I read it nonstop from the moment I brought it home, and have reread many sections of it numerous times. I believe it is a useful historical record of the golden era of the space program, but also holds many lessons for those who find themselves in formal or de facto positions of technical leadership in all types of organizations - churches, consulting firms, technical contractors, manufacturers, and probably many others with which I am not personally familiar. Thank you Mr. Kranz for all you have shared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have the heros gone? They're right here among us.","review":"I am very proud to have this among my collection. I have read it twice and am quite sure that it will be read again in a few short years.May God bless you Mr. Kranz & your Family. You are a true American hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I picked up this book out of interest in the Apollo program (thanks to Ron Howard and Tom Hanks). I just wanted more details, but found out I have an interest in the entire space program. This auto-biography of Gene Kranz's years at NASA reads like a well-written novel. It's a great first hand account of the early years of the space program. From Mercury to the final days of Apollo, this book is a fast paced thrill ride from start to finish. It shows the unwavering intelligence, engenuity and shear willpower of the American people."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.","review":"Great bookI have always been a supporter of our Space Program.

I then read the book only when I was 11 years old. Gene Kranz is a great writer as well as a great Flight Director.The book explains about everything from Mercury, through Gemini, to Apollo in great detail. The book taught me a lot of stuff that I did not know such as that Gemini 7 was before Gemini 6A. The book explains why did it happen and how. It will also explains what they were going to do about it.The book has 21 pictures and 397 pages of knowledge.

A nostalgic narration, absolutely MUST HAVE.ALESSANDRO MARIANI"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Likeable, But Ghostwriter Would Have Helped","review":"The voice that immediately enters your mind in reading Gene Kranz's FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION is that of Ed Harris playing Kranz from APOLLO 13. Harris's protrayal matches the man in the book, and from that perspective, the book is very enjoyable. Actually, that's probably the greatest strength of the book, it takes you behind the scenes and validates both Wolff's THE RIGHT STUFF and Lowell's APOLLO 13. The weakness of the book is the writing. Kranz is a straight forward subject-verb writer, which is fine enough, but after a few hundred pages, some variety in sentence structure would be nice.Still, this is a book that is both educational and a reminder of the devotion of the men who built the USA space prorgam.

It sheds some light on the current state of NASA today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Refund is Not an Option!","review":"I fully understand that Gene Kranz is not a writer, but at the same time, Mr. Kranz should also come to grips with that same fact. This book had the potential to be so much more than the equivalent of a seventh grade account of a summer holiday. If Mr. Kranz would have availed himself of the services of a professional writer or editor this book could of really been a completely different experience. There was only the slightest attempt to translate the technology of the time into terms that can be understood today.After reading this book, the NASA space program of the 1960's and 1970's has all the cachet of a Thursday afternoon at the local Post Office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"Gene Kranz not only helped to bring home the Apollo 13 crew, he was part of Mission Control from day one. He explains in detail how he and many others \\"wrote the manual\\" for space flight operations. You realize how critical it is to be perfect when you're a flight controller, and a bad day at work could mean death to a crew thousands of miles away. Kranz tells his story in such a way, that you don't have to be a mathematical engineer to understand how we really pushed our luck in achieving our ultimate goal... The Lunar Landing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Failure is not an Option-Gene Kranz by Apollo Engineer-Sara","review":"Hey, Gene, I really like your book. I worked on the SI-C Stage at Michoud.

The book covers the most exciting events in recent history and should be a page turner. It's not. I found it mind-numbingly boring.

It was too late for Christmas delivery when I ordered. But to my amazement, I received it on Christmas eve less than 48 hours after I ordered them online. My daughter had picked them out herself online and I paid. You can imagine how thrilled and shocked she was on Christmas morning when she opened the gift and found her favorite boots inside. She already had the same pair in black and wanted the Chestnut this year. She loves them. Great Christmas Surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say - people love these boots!","review":"These were purchased for my 20 yr old daughter who has a couple other colors of Ugg boots. She absolutely loves them! They are worth the money for the older kids. My 14 yr old daughter wants a pair but she is too careless, leaves things at others houses, etc. She will have to earn these boots...:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas present","review":"Duh she is 17, How can she not Love her Ugg boots we just wish they didn't cost so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally LOVE UGG’s but not this pair","review":"I love UGG’s and have always been impressed by there comfort and quality but this pair let me down. Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was thrilled to have her own pair and I was happy not having to share my own boots. The reason I’m giving these 2 stars out of 5 is that my daughter has worn these 6 times and the stitching across the arch and on the side of the right boot has come undone. Would have loved to have made an exchange, however since this was an order fulfilled by Amazon I am not able to do so. I’ll wait for the refund and purchase another pair. Hoping to give the new pair a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from shoe parlor...","review":"I bought a pair of uggs a size larger than i needed, when i got them they tore as soon as i put them on, so i sent them back.

I tried to exchange and get a refund. I finally had to get the USPS involved and get a claim thru amazon to get a refund. It was 2 weeks and still did not hear. They said THEY ONLY DO RETURNS ON SATURDAYS. Well 2 weeks has 2 saturdays in it. I think they were not real Ugg boots. I am very disappointed. I makes Amazon look bad. Dont waste your money. I hope they refuse to let them sell on Amazon any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair but","review":"I could not get my foot through the narrow opening without forcing it.

For the first time my daughter actually said her feet were still warm when she came home at night because of these boots! Great transaction! Brand new item arrived when promised, boxed like new from the store. I searched all over the internet for bargains and there are none! If you want UGGs, make sure they say UGG on the back of the boot and they're all the same price for the originals! The fakes are cheaper but do not compare!

I must say that ordering shoes on-line is not my favorite way. Shoes must be tried on, but with UGGs I thought I would be safe. One was tighter than the other and there is a different color pine needle on the back heel of one. So they are a little too different for me.I wanted to exchange them for another pair. BEWARE! You can not exchange if you got the Amazon credit card and received the $50.00 off. If I returned them, I basically would have to eat the $50.00. So I'm keeping the UGGs.

The ones I currently have are real uggs. These aren't. Very cheap feel and not enoughfluff inside. Also, there is a silk tag in mine with the logo in a metallic silver. These do not and the sole is not correct. Look at the actual ugg site for the correct looking sole. These just say ugg ugg and a sun on the middle. Nothing else. It's pathetic. These people sent me an email stating they are authorized by ugg. Definitely not!!!!THE VENDOR DENIED MY REQUEST FOR A RETURN LABEL AND I HAD TO FILE A DISPUTE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent experience buying Ugg's short classics","review":"We purchased these adorable UGG short classics without problem.

I was really excited to receive them, as I've wanted a pair of uggs for the longest. When I took them out of the box I immediately noticed that the outside of one of shoes looked paper- like. That same boot was thin and far less plush than the other. I'm pretty sure they sent me a real boot and a fake one in the same box. Needless to say I will be returning them ;("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure they were authentic.","review":"These boots did not compare to my other UGGs which made me doubt their authenticity. They did not fit like my other UGGs did and the suede looked cheap. Since the price was the same as my store-bought UGGs I returned them. I'll buy these in a store not online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality!","review":"My daughter had a pair of Bearclaws (much cheaper) of the exact \\"look\\" for less than a year before they wore out with a hole in the heel. These Uggs have held up beautifully for years for my other daughter so when we replaced the Bearclaws, I tipped over for the more epensive Uggs. Well worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Boot, but Pricey","review":"I treated myself to a pair of \\"real\\" UGGs this time around. There's no question the boots are well made, and it's nice to have that recognized brand on the back of the boot, but I'm having trouble justifying the additional $$ for the brand. I ordered a size up to accommodate for the fluffy fit in the boot, and that was a good choice. I'm finding the upper part of the boot fits a little more snug that previous boots I've purchased. It's not too small, just tighter, so be aware of that, especially if you don't have pencil-thin legs. These are very nice boots, definitely far above the bargain options you'll find at your local big box stores, but they are quite pricey compared to some good quality alternatives that are mid-priced. Love the boot, don't love the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"These boots are fake.

The inside is suppose to \\"feature a soft foam insole covered with genuine sheepskin\\" but in my case the pair I received for my wife, the sheepskin color (a orange yellow) comes off on her socks. I doubt this happens with real sheepskin, it hadn't with other sheepskin lined footwear we've owned.

As others observed, the size tends to run big -- buy one size smaller than your actual size for a perfect fit! I usually stick my bare feet in these bad boys, and I am one happy camper. Only flaw so far is some of the fur gets worn down, or clings to my stockings, so it looks bald when you look inside. I've been careful not to get them wet, so they're still going strong!

I've also recommended them to many people (mostly other instructors) who now also swear by them. They coat your throat, helping soothe that scratchy feeling caused by talking all day, illness, or medical procedures where something has been stuck down your throat. The 'slippery' part of the name is appropriate because they make a sort of slippery coating over an irritated throat. I always keep some on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Active ingredient: Elm bark","review":"I bought these little beauties whilst performing in a radio-play and I wanted to keep my mouth moist. So I took them at regular intervals during the proceedings. I would say they did the trick. I had never heard of Slippery Elm before, but some of my fellow actors had and swore by them. I was intrigued by the fact that they contained vitamin C and rose hips. I shared them with the actors in my dressing room. One actor thought so much of them that he bought an entire bottle full for himself.

Haha..It may be due to my picky taste buds, I will admit. ^_^;Not for me, but worth a try if you can tolerate the described taste and feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thayers lozenges","review":"Nice purse size (or pocket size) box of dry mouth lozenges.

Probably best used to point the way to primary sources or more thorough scholarship. Designed as an introduction, it should not be faulted for often skimming difficult issues.If you have some philosophical background you will likely be able to identify the times when Sharples makes an assertion without much argumentation (again, since this is an introduction, I'm willing to overlook some of this). If this is your first exposure to the Hellenistic period, you may want to take some of his claims with a grain of salt.It's unlikely that there is another, more concise introduction to this period around, so this fills a need. If you're looking for deeper, more thorough scholarship on the period, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great stuff!","review":"I started taking this after hearing about it from Dr.Mercola. It's done wonders for my skin. I suffer from adult acne, not severe, but annoying nonetheless. This supplement has helped so much with my skin.

The story centers on one of today's real medical crises - the imminent failure of antibiotics, with all the horrors that implies. Frighteningly authentic and peopled with well-drawn characters, it's scary without becoming - as so many 'scientific' thrillers do - improbable. A great read if you prefer entertainment with substance, topicality, and good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless and Slow","review":"The story behind this book is what first caught my attention; overuse of antibiotics. It's a serious problem in today's society. The book is about a string of drug-resistant antibodies that are running loose in LA. The doctor, who is trying his hardest to fight this problem, faces a multitude of problems trying to find an answer. There is supposedly a cure, but only Dr. Ford can determine how much he's willing to sacrifice just to find the cure. It's a long and drawn out book that could have been about 200 pages shorter. The plot has been done to death by so many other authors. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"I bought this book with Richard Preston's Cobra Event because I like medical thrillers. I have read every Robin Cook book there is literally. After all of these GOOD authors, Omega was a complete disappointment. Understand this: I am thirteen years old and I read good books in three days max. Omega had me dragging on for about a month. And don't think I'm too immature to understand the 'big words'. After reading Robin Cook, I have decided to become a pathologist. I know many of the medical terms that he uses in his books. After reading Patrick Lynch, I have decided not to read his books ever again. If you want a good medical thriller, try Robin Cook (and dont read Coma or Brain- I think they are highly over-rated and extremely boring; read the later ones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carries the medical thriller into a whole new league","review":"Set in a racially-divided and cash-strapped city of Los Angeles 'Omega' follows trauma surgeon Marcus Ford as he races to uncover the truth behind a revolutionary new drug that is only rumoured to exist. At stake are the lives of a fast-growing number of trauma patients and - ultimately - that of his own daughter. The twists and turns of Ford's story make for brilliant (if at times traumatic!) entertainment, but what is most impressive about this book is the way it seizes on what seems to be a genuine crisis: namely, that we may be heading for a medical dark age because our old armory of drugs has been rendered obsolete by anew generations of bacteria. The arrival in the USA just this month of a seemingly invinincible superbug shows just how on-the-money Lynch is. Riveting, original and deeply alarming"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, predictable - a long way from Robin Cook","review":"Omega has a beautifully designed cover. The writing inside, however, leaves the reader disappointed. The details, if you're interested in technical thrillers, are lacking; if you don't like techno-thrillers and enjoy a well constructed plot with fully human characters (if there must be a trade-off) you'll STILL be disappointed.Sore throats and hospital politics with no suspense, little tension, less than engaging prose and generally a waste of money...I bought my copy at an airport (and foolishly paid full price rather than going to Amazon.com) and listening to the drone of the 777 engines was as interesting as turning the pages of this novel.But turn them I did, convinced that the book just HAD to get better ... just a few more pages and it would all come together... well, forget it. Listen to the jet engine and save your six dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull, Dull!!","review":"After reading Mr. Lynch's other book, Carriers, and liking it (except for the totally implausable ending!) I was looking forward to Omega. Well got halfway thru it and gave up. Sorry, Mr. Lynch, but a couple of people dying from strep infections and hospital politics, makes for dull reading. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christian Enlightenment, the Church's Paradox","review":"Noll explains how the search for a relationship between faith and science, as well as contemporary politics, ultimately was the relationship that spawned over a hundred and fifty years of antagonism between Christianity and the academy, or learning. In a sense, Christianity was forced to look at itself and ask if its core tenets were not subject to challenge. A great book! It is worth the read. It'll award you tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than you feared....","review":"At first glance, this disc has the look of something rather cheesy, cobbled together for a diva no longer quite in her prime and aimed at an undiscriminating market.It's nothing of the sort. It's a judicious compilation of Handelian plums, cleverly themed and artfully linked, and thus striking a pleasing balance between unrelated highlights and a complete, coherent programme. It is gorgeously sung by Kiri Te Kanawa, sounding more animated and impassioned than I have ever heard her. Her technique is absolutely secure and the voice still has all the sheen and flexibility which brought her to fame. The \\"Giulio Cesare\\" numbers, in particular, are superb. A lovely disc for Baroque fanciers and Kiri fans alike; what a pity that it is currently unavailable. Buy a copy on Amazon Marketplace and enjoy some beautiful singing and very stylish orchestral playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handel","review":"It's a shame that this is not currently available. It's a wonderful collection of Handel arias for Soprano. While I usually find Handel a bit on the boring side, this is really an entertaining collection. There is quite a bit of instrumental music, aside from the arias, which is wonderfully done. Kiri brings her usual gorgeous voice to the recording. She also does a nice job of interpretation, something she often lacks unfortunately. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiri's finest","review":"I should start this review by saying that I am not a big fan of Kiri Te Kanawa. It's not her singing that I object to, but what she usually sings - I'm not very keen on Verdi, Puccini and Rossini. Having said that, Handel is one of my favourite composers and Christopher Hogwood is a genius; and I have to admit that Kiri's performance in this CD is absolutely brilliant.The instrumental tracks have all the strength and vitality that you'd expect from Handel/Hogwood, and the vocal tracks have the added bonus of Kiri's heartfelt and moving interpretation. My personal favourites are: Laschia qu'io pianga from Rinaldo, and V'adoro pupile and Piangeró las sorte mia both from Giulio Cesare. And the Academy of Ancient Music are as wonderful as ever.This is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Came as described, durable and good price.

Its greatest strenth is the fact that George Q.Cannon met Joseph Smith and knew people who had known him most of his life. You can sense that Cannon had a deep respect and love for Joseph Smith. Of course this love and respect that Cannon had also leads to bias. Cannon does not speak much about controversial subjects in the life of Joseph Smith. There have been better biographies written about Joseph Smith since this one. Such as No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith by Fawn Brodie, this biography of course has a skeptical bias and is not always historically accurate. The most fair biography of Joseph Smith is \\"Joseph Smith the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill. However the best biographies of Joseph Smith are still to come. But any serious person who wants to study the life of Joseph Smith must look at this one by George Q. Cannon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectation with the quality","review":"I was very pleased to open the package, it is heavy duty steel and very good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby!!!","review":"I bought this CD for one track only; his version of \\"After You've Gone\\" is priceless!

The temporal nature of music provides a subliminal cue about how much time they have to ignore my urging to get up: by the time the french horns come in, it is probably time to get up like mom says...; and it generally helps us keep moving. All of the selections on this CD are brisk, unlike those on the Mozart for Morning Coffee CD, which I also have, which has many surprisingly drowsy pieces on it. I acknowledge that the format of the compilation is murderous to the intention of the compositions in terms of structure of the movements, and so forth. However, it is still a very pleasant, useful compilation album, and much more energizing that simply tucking into a full-blown symphony at 7am, with maybe not enough time to finish it before time to get gone to school."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - not compatible with all games!","review":"This controller acts like a Dual Shock controller--NOT like a Dual Shock 2 controller.

I appreciate the mix of the traditional gospel sound coupled with a fresh contemporary sound that does not compromise the Anointing. The spontaneous praise at the end of this song lets us all know where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty.These songs do just as Dr. Hutchins stated in the JDI Interview-they minister to the Body of Christ. Every song gives a message of hope and praise to God.While I like all of the songs on this project, my personal favorites are \\"Jesus I Love You\\", \\"Awesome God!\\" and \\"Lord You Are The Potter\\" because they speak of the One I love with all my heart and soul.I am also aware if I have my \\"Mind Made Up\\" and I surrender all I have to the Lord, as another song says, \\"God's Got A Blessing-With My Name On It!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Nation Hears The Call!","review":"Simply one of the most electric, exciting, and powerful albums of the last few years.

Jorn has really poured his heart into these songs, and it shows.Though all of the songs are amazing, my 3 favorites would be:Out To Every NationVision EyesWhen Angels Wings Were WhiteVagabond, The Snakes, Ark, Millennium, Beyond Twilight, Masterplan, the Allen/Lande albums.

This is JORNs best solo album to date. Even better than the fantastic THE DUKE(2006). Not one bad song on this, the songs are all so diverse from one another that it takes you on a musical journey that will make you wanna take the trip again and again. I hope JORN goes back to this style of songwriting on his next(5th) solo studio album. THE DUKE is great but got a little \\"dark\\" in places. JORNs greatest solo song of all time is on this \\"Something Real\\".

While Dr's Steil & Bommelje present a strong case for leaders to listen, their content and delivery are tedious.For each of the 10 Golden Rules there are ten action steps, i.e 100 steps. Some of the 100 steps have additional steps and some them include additional habits. In researching this book for application for leadership development, I was hoping to find a model that could be easily communicated and grasped by others. One hundred plus items just doesn't work for me.While I understood the the main points, I was worn down by the delivery of example after example, after example.

However, buyer beware! Whilst Vickers voice is the amazing force of nature we can expect Rita Gorr sounds like a battle axe. Gorr's voice just isn't sexy at all. In addition the sound recording is far from top notch and shows its age.I bought this recording because many reviews recommended it. I already owned the superb Colin Davis (Jose Cura and Borodina on Erato Label) set but thought this must be a special recording. I was very disappointed. To my mind the two sets worth their money are Davis (Cura, Borodina) and Chung's (Domingo, Meier). Both are superb, with a Samson and Dalila who sound attractive and attracted. Both sets are well recorded in digital sound quality. Both have a Dalila who sounds like a beautiful diva rather than an old dame.This old Pretre (Vickers, Gorr) set was bettered years ago.

And in that way, the story resembles The Lovely Bones, as the reader gets to see the impact of the loss on the family, though it is told more fluidly here than in Alice Sebold's novel.However, at a few points in the story, I felt the writing dried just a little and appeared merely competent, but overall it is a novel well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheap quality, pooly made, made in China","review":"The playing board is really flimsy, the checkers don't all stack properly.

We purchased this at a small gift shop while on vacation. Everything was packaged and wrapped well (it didn't appear to be a returned product). However, we were dismayed to find that there was a shortage of red pieces, with 2 of them broken in half. The other strange thing is that there were 4 extra black pieces. Even if there were the right number of pieces and non broken, I still wouldn't recommend this set as it is extremely poor quality. As others have stated, the checkers don't stack well and the board is warped and doesn't lay flat.Thankfully, my 5 year old didn't care about all of this and still had fun learning to play (we had to be a bit creative due to the missing pieces), but we will be buying a better set and chalking this up to a learning experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsey !","review":"Couldnt find a single medium quality checkers game on Amazon. this one : The Board is not stiff like other folding game boards; it is flimsy like laminated 'constuction paper' . the piece are fine,and the rules paper is too - they will out last the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have read the reviews","review":"The packaging is incredibly flimsy.

I strongly recommend this--with one caveat. I believe Langston was probably gay or bisexual, and I wonder if the author, through the screen of today's social awareness (this book was published in mid-80s) might agree. If so, LH was certainly deeply closeted, but the clues abound.

This release has only one original member. Doug Clark on guitar being the only original member has completly lost his edge. This release sounds thrown together and lacks the polish of earlier releases. This band should fold and rest on the laurels of its long since past glory days. This release would be better served as an aid in putting babies to sleep. It sounds like it was recorded on a boom box and mixed by small children.

I thought this was strange, so on day I touched the screen and my finger went right through. The cheap screen had completely rusted through I couldn't believe it! I payed $100 for a screen that lasted for only 3 months outside. I guess the lesson is DO NOT BUY this screen if you plan on leaving it outside with your fire pit. After you have a fire you should pull it the pit, massage it with tropical oils and let it rest in cool (but not damp) area. This is a garbage purchase, anyone who reviewed this as 4-5 stars obviously wrote their review after a couple weeks of use.

It really is small enough to fit in your pocket; much more convenient than a small 35. The picture quality is very good. I find the flip-up flash almost never produces any red-eye, and is much more reasonable than preflashes and other schemes. I've been using it extensively for almost a year, mostly with 200 film. The only negatives are that a slight delay in the auto-focus sometimes makes it hard to keep up with kids, and with the flash up you have to wear your Sox hat backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advantix is Fantastic","review":"I'm so Happy that I use Advatix camera.

O'Gara skillfully and lovingly describes the Wind River Valley like a sculptor shapes his beloved work. He is an excellent storyteller. What I loved most was O'Gara's deep attention to human relations, personal histories, and character. He always tells the tale with the human in the center. He never proselytizes or places blame. He doesn't demonize or romanticize. Also, the Native Americans are depicted as people, not political images or symbols. It's easy and fun to read, yet never strays from reality. I loved reading it. I wish more stories about Native Americans were told so warmly and truthfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Studio Performance","review":"This 1956 studio recording is one of two classics featuring Schwartzkopf, Karajan, and Edelman, the other being the film of the 1962 Salzburg stage performance.The notes to the CDs say that the 1956 recording became a study tool, and ironically that turns out to be apt: by comparison with the stage performance the studio recording is more of a seminar. The difference compared to the staged version's drama seems partly due to the lack of the stimulus of a studio, but partly to pure musical factors as well: clinical tempos and Philharmonia's concert style. Everything is done to perfection, of course.Schwartzkopf's dramatic vocal gestures change substantially between the two performances, and for me the 1962 portrayal works better.I also find that the CDs have a bit of that edge in the treble that initially was so striking as compared to LPs but that now is not appreciated. The sound in the staged performance's Blu-Ray disk is better balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice bowls -- bright, perfect size","review":"I bought these thinking I was buying one (I shopped too fast), so I was pleasantly surprised when 4 bowls showed up.

However, this CD is a disappointment. The main problem is the horrible recording quality; if you like a muffled, tin can, heavy reverb sound, this may not be a problem for you. And if you like a flamenco-influenced style more than the classical guitar style, then you might be satisfied with these recordings as well. I prefer, for example, Parkening's version of \\"Rumores de la Caleta\\" and Williams' performance of \\"Leyenda.\\" These criticisms notwithstanding, Romero is still one of the best guitarists around. His performance of \\"Fantasia para un Gentilhombre\\" with Academy of St. Martin is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Soothing Music!","review":"I was first introduced to this little-known CD by my aunt, and I immediately found it relaxing and otherworldly. We used track #3 (\\"Raindance\\") in a silly video we made -- it worked great! Then I got the CD for my birthday. The whole album is very soothing and not too distracting. The music is filled with percussion and unusual instruments. The album mainly paints pictures of water, but sometimes it even sounds like ancient tribal rituals of some kind. Don't be fooled by the group's name -- they are from England I think, not Japan. The group has other albums as well, including 'Peyote' and 'Primitive,' both of which I'm sure are just as good as 'Undercurrents.'

The pocket clip gets hooked on stuff every now and then, but it can be bent back pretty easily. I bought mine when they first came out and paid about $50.

On arrival at Chalice Hall, she meets Gabriel Ansell, Lord Campion, the fiance that she deserted 4 years ago. Will Madelaine resist the charms of Gabriel and will they trust each other enough to stop the scam that is the Game of the Century?This is my second book by Christina Dodd and will probably be my last. I had trouble finishing the book and alsmost gave up half way through. The danger lurking in the background didn't really get off to a start and you could predict the ending. There was no chemistry between Gabriel and Madelaine except for one sex scene which was quite hot. Apart from this scene give the book a miss and read a book by other historical romantic authors who do a much better job.Lealing"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment for sure","review":"Parts of this book were what you would expect of Christina Dodd, but other parts seem like a graduate school writing assignment that went awry, especially the last dozen pages or so which seemed just slapped together, to the point where twice the hero is described as coming to the rescue riding bareback, and then \\"slipping from the saddle\\". This kind of editorial sloppiness just underscores the feeling that the book was pushed through production. Too bad, it could have been a good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"I am usually a huge fan of Christina Dodd's novels, but this one left me feeling bored. The magic that Dodd has created in her other novels was sorely missing in this one. The characters were boring and the plot was dumb. I felt like I never really got to know who the characters were. Although I want to know Eleanor and Mr. Knight's story, I think I will wait for it to hit the stands at the used book store. I hope this isn't a sign of Dodd's future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment...","review":"I always await Christina Dodd's books with great anticipation. For the first time I can say I was sorry that I even read one. The behavious of both of the main characters left a lot to be desired - but the repeated humiliation and put downs of Madeline by Gabriel and his manservant left a bad taste in the mouth. Not only did she accept everything at the hands of Gabriel - she accepted it as her due which came across as warped. Well - she wasn't perfect, but neither was his behaviour - yet somehow all of his atrocious behavious was ok because she LOOVED him. YUCK. Unlike other books by Christina Dodd there was no balance in this book at all. The ending seemed to be put together in haste, ending the story in a very unsatisfactory way. I would recommend giving this one a pass. I will think twice before rushing out to get the next in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Dodd's Par","review":"As a fervent fan of Christina Dodd, I was heartily disappointed with the pacing and storyline here.The plot points are a bit thin, and for the first time in my recollection, so are the characters. Maddie is stumbling around being pompous and self-righteous, refusing to use common sense logic in the listening to the reason's behind his gambling, much less bothering to take note that he's stopped... *Yawn*. The usual humor and candor of the characters was missing, and frankly, the love scenes were dry.But MOST of all, the abrupt ending was irritating, and though I can only assume that this is a launch to a sequel, I felt jilted at the end with relatively little closure of the situation/adventure.Read as if Ms. Dodd churned this out in an afternoon, leaving open threadlines, mistaken clues, and diluted dialogue. Boo.Still a fan to the end, but truly was disappointed in this unmemorable adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As a HUGE fan of Christina's books, I was very disappointed with this one. It was the first Christina Dodd book which took an effort to finish (usually I gobble them up in one sitting). All of the wit and charm of the \\"Governess\\" series was missing here. I found the main characters unlikeable (except perhaps to each other), and the plot line was ludicrous and unbelievable even by the standards of romance fiction. Like the reader above, I thought the quality of the editing was lacking as well. I actually checked the publishing date to see if it was perhaps a reissue of an early book, as the writing seemed very amateurish in comparison to her other books. On the plus side, the love scenes were fun to read, though it's not enough to allow me to recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Dodd does it again!!!...","review":"Once again Ms. Dodd has written a great book. I loved reading about Madeline and Gabriel. Madeline is a strong heroine just like the rest of Ms. Dodd's heroines. Madeline keeps Gabriel on his toes through out the story and keeps the reader interested in what will happen next. The sparing between the two main characters kept things interesting and it was easy to see that these were not your usual main characters of a book. Something i greatly enjoyed seeing. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel to this story to see what happens to Eleanor who was first introduced in this book. I highly recommend this book along with any of Ms. Dodd's books. Ms. Dodd has yet again made it to my keeper list and I plan on buying Eleanor's story the moment it hits the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Dodd forgetting how to write?","review":"For some reason, I continue to buy Dodd's new books, even though lately her heros are so dark and brooding that they rival the villian in terms of who I dislike more. There was no romance between Gabriel and Maddie, only arguments and one very harsh sexual encounter. I never developed any sentiment for either of them, and the supporting characters were more annoying than supportive. Also, there didn't seem to be an editor for the book; the dialogue was choppy and there were many typos and grammatical errors that were very distracting. I sincerely doubt I'll buy Eleanor's story when it's released despite the fact that I own almost all Dodd's other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"After reading this, I assumed that it was a reissue from those bad old days in the 80s when romance novelists apparently believed that abuse = love. There wasn't much romance here, and I found the relationship between the two main characters disturbing. Also, the plot was ludicrous. Fail.So, what on earth happened to Christina Dodd? I never thought she was one of the greats--her plots tend to be rather ludicrous. But I usually find her books entertaining, and I'm willing to suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride. In this one, there was no charm to distract me from the gaping plot holes. This one was just bad on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really engaging story","review":"This book really took me back to my own childhood. I loved the fact that this little girl was not very adept at dancing. It reminded me of how much I admired the dances performed at Obon in Hawaii but wasn't very good at it myself. Even the red kimono looked like the one I had as a child. I thought the story had a very good message and I would have like to have had such a book when I was growing up but I guess I will just have to buy it for my nieces and nephews. I want them to learn how important it is to try even if you aren't very good at something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was THIS obon?","review":"I was hoping to find a nice children's book based on an annual event that I've attended for 30 years, and all I found was a book of inaccuracies. I have never attended an obon like this in the United States, let alone in Japan. For one thing, dancers wear \\"yukata\\" not \\"kimono\\" to obon. Also, the entire layout of how obon is portrayed in the book is one I have never seen before. The feel of obon just wasn't there. I think more research or attending at least one obon might have contributed in a more accurate portrayl of obon. I would like children to know what obon is really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"As a new mom, I appreciate having all my child's medical and vaccine records all in one place. It is also small (and durable) enough to throw in my purse or diaper bag when I go to the doctor. Is a great shower or new born baby gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It was a very disappointing read, there's only one chapter on how to fight witchcraft and its only a few pages long, the rest of the chapters are on how to detect if someone is under the influence of witchcraft but from my perspective or at least what i got out of my read, it seems everyone around us is under the influence of witchcraft, my mother, my father, the clerk at the grocery store...ridiculous...for example do you have a friend that won't go home and takes up your time, there under the influence of witchcraft, that's ridiculous...or anyone who gets super spiritual with you when you try to have a normal conversation, there under the influence of witchcraft....total waste of my money... This book really concerned me...only because you might misinterpret general well being concern for \\"witchcraft probing\\"..I definately do not recommend this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Misinformation from This Author...","review":"Yes, Witches are real. They are peaceful, family-oriented, caring, healing individuals. People do not need to be delivered from wisdom, peace, and nature. Demon is just another name for hateful humans lost to themselves and their own inner evil. Spirits of our ancestors and the divine speak through Witches/shamans just as the divine is said to speak through religious people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Performances of Ravel's and Honeger's Music","review":"These are the last recordings ever made by the noted French conductor Charles Munch. Appropriately enough, these are with the Orchestre de Paris, which he had founded shortly before these recordings. EMI's latest digital remastering has wrought sonic marvels from the analogue recordings; the performances sound as fresh and vivid as any I have heard from many digital recordings. Munch leads the orchestra in stirring, mesmerizing performances of \\"Bolero\\" and \\"Rapsodie espagnole\\" which show much admiration and affection for Ravel's scores. Their reading of Honeger's second symphony is also distinguished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Taste of Something Different","review":"This CD is great if you are looking for some new music that is actually good.

Unfortunately I only bought two jars. That was approximately 5 years ago and those jars are long gone. I found in once in Safeway in San Francisco (my home) and bought several more. I was so confident that I could find more at the same supermarket, that foolishly I gave one of the jars to a fellow mustard lover. Then it disappeared from their shelves, and I have been unable to find it for several years now. I have scraped my last jar down to the glass :-( I can't find it online either. I am a mustard lover and this is my all time favorite. I mix it into my vinaigrette dressing, amongst other things, and the added zing is unbelievable.

This composer is one of my most favourite and depending on the artist who interprets the music, it is a treasure to listen when trying to relieve stress!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible beauty","review":"The Concierto de Aranjuez is undoubtedly the loveliest guitar concerto ever written, and Pepe Romero (perfectly paired here with the ASMIF) plays it with impeccable skill and delicacy. The first and third movements are playful and spirited, but the real essence of the concerto lies in its achingly beautiful second movement. I guarantee that you will be hard pressed to find a more rapturous piece of music. Also, the rest of the disc is filled with other, equally delightful works by Rodrigo, most notably the Fantasia. If you are a fan of classical guitar, or simply appreciate beauty in its purest form, buy this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After Paco, Pepe sounds like a ...well, joke.","review":"Dear friends and lovers of Spanish guitar music. I just cannot comprehend how Maestro Pepe had the nerve to record another version of the \\"Concierto\\" after Paco's performance (Paco de Lucia, naturalmente), with Maestro Rodrigo still alive, present, whatching and listening.How ungrateful, knowing the closeness between Rodrigo and Pepe!Rodrigo has said it all: Paco's is the best interpretation of my concierto.

Buy another Concierto de Aranjuez, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used battery sent - beware!","review":"Beware, \\"brilliant store\\" sent me a visibily dinged up and pre-used battery instead of the new one promised. Waste of time and waste of money, not to mention bait and switch! RUN AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs waaay down ~","review":"Sorry to say that I actually hated ~ yes, hated ~ this DVD. We already had two other Hermie DVDs which I and my grandchildren like very much ~ \\"Common Caterpillar\\" and \\"Stanley the Stinkbug\\". Those two are beautifully made and have a good story. I found everything about \\"Grumble Bees\\" extremely unpleasant. As far as the artwork goes, it is predominated by the icky maize-y yellow and black of the bees... This DVD lacks the beautiful colors and artwork of our previous Hermie DVDs. For my personal taste, Buzby/Elvis is just YUCKY to look at and to listen to, (I'm not a fan of Elvis, or of his impersonators). The two \\"Grumble Bees\\" and their horrible behavior and totally non appealing to the (my) eyes looks had no redeeming qualities. Their horrible voices/attitude took up waaay to much of my time. I watched this DVD once, and promptly stuck it in a bag to go to Goodwill. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Dad loved his gift!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my father, who loved the Rockford Files movies. This is the first 4 movies they made. He said they were great to see again, wish the remaining ones were on DVD but haven't seen them.Movies played just fine, & shipping was superfast for this item. Always have been pleased with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shaft Vol 1","review":"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer that this is just another shameful venture in order to milk the public out of as much money as the distributors can in order to get this product out. As fond as I am of the series (and the movies), I will not be buying these to supplement my series collection. I have an exhaustive collection and these additons just are not that necessary. Maybe someday I'll find them in a cheap used bin somewhere and buy them. Or wait until a \\"Complete Movies\\" volume shows up at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rockford Files","review":"Picture quality is great. The Rockford Files is my favourite show and these movies are just as good as the TV series, maybe better if that's possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved These!","review":"I used to watch Rockford files when they were on tv, the movies are a nice way to remember the fun times watching the shows with my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"An aural cleansing...","review":"I will start by admitting that this cd is my first exposure to the music of OYC, although I have delved often into this genre in the past. The works on this disc are a masterful blend of 'normal' instruments, electronics and found sounds, combined very tastefully into a soothing but stimulating result that I would best describe as an audio brain-wash (in the cleansing sense, no implications toward mind-control). This is music that can be forefront or background -- I've already found it relaxing enough to use to drift off to sleep at night, but it's also interesting enough to play in the car. I look forward to exploring more of their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird","review":"This story starts out promising, but in the end it's not really worth the reading. I hated the way everything was turned into a metaphor. Can't we just enjoy a story for itself without it having a lot of different symbolic meanings (which don't really work anyway)? Overall the impression I came away from _Enchanter's Glass_ with was that it was just *very* weird, and I was disappointed the author didn't try harder, because there was potential for a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak plot + weak character= weak book","review":"I am a big fan of Harcourt Brace's \\"Jane Yolen Books\\" which is why I chose this book. I loved Crown Duel and Court Duel by Sherwood Smith, and also Little Sister By Kara Dalkey but I found this to be a very dull and boring fantasy; no originality at all. The author could have at least written this story in a way to keep you interested but didn't bother to. A very weak plot and characters, this book is hardly worth touching or looking at. The cover is beautiful, and that's the best thing about this book. The female character was a sensitive weakling, trying to be portrayed strong and fierce, yet the author didn't succeed. The goat boy and all the other magical creatures in this story were completely dull to read, they all thought the same; which is why I give this book just 1 star, hardly worth it though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Helodermatid Lizard book out","review":"This book is very informative and is a great book on Gila Monsters and Beaded Lizads. This book was so good I could hardly put it down. This book gave me a greater understanding of Gila monsters and Beaded Lizards.

I Recommend this to anybody who is Interested in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A FANTASTIC BOOK!","review":"My sister bought this for me from a talk the author was giving at some writing conference. My birthday is on Halloween and I got this today! I've been sitting here reading this instead of doing work because this thing just won't let me put it down. I thought I knew everything about vampires, but this book has a zillion more things about them than I ever knew. It's so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incomplete and meandering compendium with some good tracks","review":"This is a fairly solid effort from Mr. Pookie, with a number of great rappers adding their talents to some of the tracks such as C Fat, Lexxus, Big Cuc, Mr. Montis and Joy. There are also some outstanding female MCs in here, and I am impressed that he attempted the double album.Unlike Dallas Crooks, the remixes of some of his great tracks such as \\"Stoney Crook\\" are great, and actually add another dimension. The title track \\"My Life\\" is great also, but the album loses me a few times when he gets more tender talking about relationships.Still, a pretty solid album, and something that will add to the collection of any Mr. Pookie fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened","review":"Terrible, just plain terrible. Gangsta is the only good song and that song is kinda weak. By changing producers and leaving Stoney Crook Pookie and Lucci may be done. The producing sucks and the lyrics are still Dallas.

I only wish there was more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Rameau like it!","review":"I originally bought the album because one of Rameau's movements that I had heard once in a while that I really enjoyed. Considering the low price, I decided that I couldn't go wrong by puchasing the disc. When I listened to the CD, I was very pleased by the music and the performance as well. I can't imagine how this was scored for ballet. The tempo is fast as Vivaldi, yet lighter with a cadence more suited to a waltz or polka then ballet. Definitely a worthy addition to any lover of baroque music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was petty good.","review":"I thought that this book was not so bad. It's my first book by Jackie Merritt. There were some interesting parts and some boring ones. I would reccomend this book for Desire lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase with caution","review":"I generally like Jackie Merritt's books, but this one had me baffled. I thought both characters could have used some counseling. This was like a typical 1970 contemporary romance novel where both characters couldn't say 2 kind words to each other, yet were secretly in love. And in the middle of an argument, they would begin to make out. I just didn't think this book was up to Ms. Merritt's usual standard. It will make me think twice before I get another one of her books. I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Great product- helps with weak brittle nails :) Will definately buy this product again. Wish it were larger bottle size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixing Genres Key to Success for BR","review":"Bad Ronald's self entitled CD is a mix of genres that contains something for everyone.Some of the tracks on the CD are big time rap songs; all the rhymes are very funny, making the CD truly a joy to listen to. Other tracks on the CD, such as \\"Lost on Tour\\" and \\"1st time\\" combine the Rap with almost a ska feel. It doesn't have the ska feel as do Reel Big Fish or Goldfinger, but it is more ska-like than any rap group out there today.If you're a person like me who's comfortable listening to anything from P Diddy to Snoop Dogg to Reel Big Fish to Barenaked Ladies, pick up Bad Ronald. Their nonsensical lyrics make them a pleasure to listen to all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I first heard of Bad Ronald watching MTV and saw their music video for \\"Let's Begin\\" a few years ago. Ever since then i've been hooked. Their music is a mix of hip-hop/rock with a happy and humorous sound. The lyrics are somewhat abrasive but cleverly laid out, adding to the humor of most songs. This is one CD I can listen all the way through without skipping a song. I Highly Recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phat party tunes!!","review":"Came across this band while driving away from the city for a drinking weekend with a car full of dudes.

The Whole SHeBOMB","review":"I usually don't listen to Country but when I heard these ladies from Utah, I was totally hooked. Their music contains a little bit of everything.

Much love, peace, and happiness... Jay's Jook Joint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with talent !","review":"I think that this CD is great for so many reasons.

GO GIRLS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is too 'pop' sounding!","review":"The 2 singles released from this CD already are the best songs on it. That is always disappointing to me. I personally think SheDaisy sounds way too much like Wilson Phillips. If you want good female Country Music, try Jodee Messina and the Dixie Chicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why compete? Both are great!","review":"Why on earth is everyone turning this into a competition with Dixie Chicks? Ok, so they're both trios of talented women. And they both ROCK! There's more than enough room in the world for both of 'em. I saw SHeDAISY twice in one day, and they were absolutely incredible live. If you have the chance - GO! They were also very sweet when I met them - they patiently and kindly autographed CDs for a ton of on-the-ball fans. I love this CD so much, I'm wearing out adjectives for it! Suffice it to say that it's awesome. The harmonies are breathtaking, and any woman will instantly relate to the songs (ok, you guys will enjoy it too!). I wish SHeDAISY continued success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this CD based on the song \\"Little Goodbyes,\\" which I love, and all of the good reviews I had read. It definitely doesn't live up to the hype. Most of the songs are forgettable. I rarely listen to this CD. I should have saved my money and just bought the \\"Little Goodbyes\\" single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good debut CD!","review":"I bought this CD now really knowing what it was going to be like. It may have a pop touch to it, but these days, what country album doesnt'? \\"Little Good-Byes\\", their current hit \\"I Will...But\\", \\"Punishment\\", \\"Before Me & You\\" are a little more upbeat and fun songs. Their \\"This Woman Needs\\" and \\"Dancing With Angels\\" are slower songs with a great sound. Overall, I think Kristyn did a good job co-writing each song, and they have good harmonies. The title of my review says it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Contempo Country-Pop","review":"Not for those interested in classic country, but a must-have for the modern country music fanatic. Powerful songs pack this album, with my own personal favorite being \\"A Night to Remember\\", followed closely by \\"Still Holding Out For You\\". I also can't ignore the first release \\"Little Goodbyes\\", which is an infectious little tune that has gotten a lot of attention. Bottom line--buy this CD, it's AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She RockS!","review":"I bought this album coz i thought it sounded promising. My opnion?--> It's great. The Osborne sisters have great talent. Their harmony is brilliant and the lyrics, witty. The songs are great, every bit makes a better difference, from the unusual but great-sounding all the same harmony to the supporting band. The content of this album is brilliant. It potrays the modern woman of today from sensitive and needing love (\\"This Woman needs\\" \\"Without your love\\") to downright independant and strong (\\"LIttle Good-byes\\", \\"Lucky 4 You\\").In short I just wanted to say: NO REGRETS. My money's worth.It's a must buy for girl power enthusiasts to any country music fan, though traditionalists might find it a little to pop-py flavoured. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good stuff","review":"This is a good, fun album, in spite of the men whining and the country fans whining and the whoever whining. Not a great album, but a good album.No, they don't particularly sound like the Dixie Chicks - I like both, but the sound and the talent are different. No, they're not all sweetness and light. No, they don't sound like Loretta or Tammy. They sound like Shedaisy, and you'll either love them or you won't, just like all artists.My suggestion is, listen to the radio. If you like what you hear, you'll like the rest of the album. But don't buy it expecting to hear the Chicks, because you won't. And don't buy it expecting Patsy or traditional country, because it isn't. Just buy it because you like the music and enjoy the artists doing the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad song on it!","review":"This album is one of the best i ever heard, there isn't a bad song on it, as i am from the uk, nobody over here has heard of them, but by hearing clips over the internet, i bought it from amazon.co.uk. And i have never regreted it... i can't wait to see what they have in store next."},{"rating":"1","title":"SheBust - This Is Teenage Girl Stuff","review":"This is not country music. Maybe they didn't think they could make it in the pop scene. The ladies have pleasant voices and the arrangements are ok. Well, actually all the songs sound alike, are a little whiney, and some sound like chants instead of singing. Yep, in A Night to Remember a man bites the dust just like the guys in Goodbye Earl and Independence Day. I know men don't like these kinds of songs, do women? What about these ladies serving some time for killing these guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Stinks! :-(","review":"I did not like this CD because the songs were not fast enough and I did not like the songs. I don't like the CD and I would not recommend it. I'm waiting for their new CD Knock on The Sky coming out June 25, to see how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"If SHeDAISY had any previous albums out, I would say they had outdone them all with this CD. However, being this is their debut effort, they obviously have a very long career ahead of them. The CD starts off with the hit \\"Little Goodbyes,\\" and only gets better. My favorites are \\"Punishment,\\" and \\"I Will..But\\" which will rock your stereo. \\"Before Me and You\\" and \\"Dancing With Angels\\" are also highlights. It's a bit misleading to name favorites, because this album has been on repeated play since I got it, and the whole thing is great...an uncommon feat these days. The harmonies that Kelsi, Kassidy, and Kristyn put together are superior to most out there today, and I highly recommend The Whole Shebang to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is honestly the best CD I've ever purchased. It's perfect for a hot day, windows down a,d music turned up load. Their wonderful attitude in each song, beautiful harmony and great background music you won't ever find a more fun and exciting CD to listen to. There's no need to compare them to any other group (Dixie Chicks) they surely stand on their own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome","review":"SheDaisy is great. It's not very often you can buy a CD where every single song is great. This is on of those rare ones. Any one thinking of getting this CD should do so. You definitely will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH BABY!!!!","review":"This album rules. I drive around with Little Goodbyes or Lucky 4 You cranked and just laugh as I get a visual of my ex in my head. The fact that the songs aren't \\"poor me you left me\\" but \\"sad for you you lost me\\" makes my day!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs, Annoying Video","review":"I love their debut CD. I don't understand the comparisons made between SheDaisy and Dixie Chicks -- they don't look OR sound like them. The only similarity I can find is that they both have three women in their group. My only complaint is their video -- it's one long \\"aren't we gorgeous\\" commercial. Yes, you girls ARE gorgeous, but don't try so hard to prove that to us. Your \\"Little Goodbyes\\" video could've been a lot of fun to watch if it had instead illustrated the ideas in the song instead of putting you on display."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not country music","review":"This group is pop; they are not country. It seems that there are about a dozen or so REAL country artists. I am so tired of the crap that is called country.

I get bored very easily listening to the same music over and over, but between the interesting lyrics and the lush harmonies, I haven't gotten bored yet.

No comparisons are needed because they stand on their own talents, which are considerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"SheDaisy is really Shebanging around!","review":"Now, hold your horses! SheDaisy is not your classic country, but what beat! My cousin and I can't put it down. They say you may be able to learn things in your subconciuos, well put this on all night and snooze into new country!

Within a week i had it memorized. From the openin vocals, that just makes me smile, of \\"Lucky 4 You (Tonight I'm Just Me)\\" to the song that still makes me cry even though I've heard it a hundred times \\"Still Holding Out For You\\", to the tragedy of \\"A Night to Remember\\". This cd just keeps on gettin better and I recommend it to anyone, even if your not a country music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"She-yikes!","review":"Unfortuneatley for me, I was stuck on a long road trip listening to this whiney bunch of \\"so-called country\\" men haters crying in their Zinfandel. Oh brother, if they could only get over their angst and ridiculous sniveling. This is just another example of fluff the music industry trots out and makes a big deal over, then in a couple of years they will be featured on a VH-1 \\"Where are they Now\\" segment and everybody (including my wife) who bought this junk will be perplexed and hard pressed to find a solid answer why they did. Yeah, it sounds nice and cute and fun. The song lyrics, bad as they are, are in fact a pretty sad statement. If songs have a basis in reality these would give Dr. Laura a coronary. If you are looking for some good, true, heartfelt country music dig out Patsy Cline, the Judds, Tammy Wynette, and Allison Krause, etc. She-Daisy ain't Nashville, I know I live there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Country-Pop","review":"Little goodbyes was ok. But man, I would have rather downloaded that song from Napster than having to buy the whole album. I'm glad that other reviewers agree, and whether or not others like to hear it or not.. it IS true: Being in Nashville you see a lot of acts, and these gals DO have talent, but it sounds like a country-pop-Wilson Phillips meets Dixie Chicks. Can't they be original?? And what's with SheDaisy #1 stating they've been around longer? How does she know the Chicks weren't playing together before they hit the stores? Why should she even need to comment??? Anyway, it doesn't really matter what I say becuase their fans will love them despite the coat-tails they are riding on. My advice: Download some of their stuff on Napster or borrow it from a friend. This is one of those albums that I've really only found 1 or 2 good ones from, and I hear a LOT of counrty down here. Sorry Gals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Country, Mostly Weak Lyrics, But Good Voices","review":"I have read a lot of good reviews of this group but the songs pretty much sound alike and are not country. The harmonizing is good but gets old the more you listen. \\"Little Good-Byes\\" and \\"A Night to Remember\\" are good songs; however, others are too pop with silly and immature lyrics. I predict that many will not listen to this CD for very long unless they are a teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Country?","review":"This sounds more like a male-bashing album, like Alanis Morrisette meets Shania Twain sound.

Boy, was I in for a surprise!I fell in love with every single song on this CD. Their songs run the gamut from sultry to silly to hard-hitting (almost) rock. The lyrics of these songs touch the heart, while the group's seamless harmony stirs the soul. I have been raving about Shedaisy to all my friends.Special note: pay particular attention to the song \\"'cause I like it that way\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are better than the Dixie Chics","review":"I am not a big country fan but, when I heard this group I couldn't get enough. I have listen to my CD so much I have to get a new one. When I am feeling a little low I just pop in there CD and it helps out my mood so much. I would recommend this group to all who like to listen to really great music. They harmonise beautifully and, the words to there songs are great. My favorite ones are track #5 Lucky for You, #10 A Night to Remember, that one is really great. So if you want to have something good to listen to with a good beat to it I recommend that you add this one to your Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"They rock","review":"one sentence will describe this whole album: Kristyn, Kelsi and Kassidy are an amazing set of singers who can harmonize like no one else, and have a smashing debut to prove it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What this woman needs","review":"The group is SheDaisy...the CD title is \\"The Whole Shebang\\", and all I can say is WOW!What this woman needs is more music like this! What a refreshing change from some of the stuff currently out there. I bought it after watching them perform on \\"The Donny and Marie Show\\" where they sang \\"What this woman needs\\" and I am so impressed with the quality of their music. What is even better is that they write their own stuff. There really is something for every mood! I really like listening to \\"Lucky for you..tonite I'm just me\\".This CD is my music of choice during my daily walks on my treadmill. It has the right rhythm that helps me stay on pace, plus I will listen to the whole CD before I stop walking--so I am getting a good workout!!My 11 year old daughter gets mad because I won't let her listen to it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glow stars without the glow!","review":"Bought this for my son's nursery and after reading some of the reviews compared to other products, decided to give this a try. First of all, these stars have never glowed, even after leaving them in direct sunlight all day. I even left them in full glare of a lamp and still, no glow! The adhesive pads are very convenient, but after a few days, some of the stars started dropping off from the celing.Right now I'm in the process of removing the rest of these glow? stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIM","review":"These stars are pretty weak. They are very large so they are very noticeable during the day and when you turn out the lights they aren't very bright (and that's with a chandelier charge from the middle of the room!).

The only downside to them is that they don't glow for a really long time, but that doesn't matter as much. They're quite durable and will stick very well to any surface.

In short, I really like the \\"3 Keys\\" cover art that Nabu placed on ITS rendition of this most-excellent work -- and yes, I OWN this Nabu version IN ADDITION TO owning the UML copy, as well -- but for the very most part everything ELSE in the Nabu edition strongly inclines the reader to buy the UML publication, instead.

This album was originally released in 1991, and rereleased under Public Works years later. You have to think Negativland, although overall this is better than most Negativland work. They mock pop culture (and American society) through their appropriation of (mostly 1950s) commercials, TV shows, and the like. Consider a track like Creditwise, probably a commercial where our protagonist is considering not paying his credit card bill, or Desire, an early version of a self-help infomercial (think Anthony Robbins years later). It is hilarious and outrageous. And, of course, the release is in the public domain, so you can appropriate it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stitching came apart","review":"Purchased this product based on the good reviews and the praise the Valeo brand gets from most sites. First of all, having padding everywhere does not mean having good padding. It actually makes it harder to grip when doing pull ups. After the third workout, the stitching in the palm as well as wrist wrap was coming off. Avoid these gloves, not worth the hype or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There just ok","review":"I purchased these gloves after reading countless reviews stating that they were awesome. I figured for $20 it would be a bargain to get these gloves. After receiving them I have come to loathe their existence. There is very minimal padding on the spots that actually matter. The wrist straps are either too tight or too loose(not secure) and they dont flex well enough with the back of your hand. I have started having wrist issues after using them, my wrists feel like they are going to pop out of their sockets. Long story short I would definatly not recommend these to anyone and I myself will be buying a new pair of gloves in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great...","review":"Have been using this item for the past couple of months now, overall the product is not that bad and gives good support for your wrist during heavy lifting.

So in short...strong wrist support and works with heavy lifting just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much padding at the finger base","review":"I bought these glves becasue i was getting callouses at the base of my fingers and to prevent the burning sensation on my fingers while doing dead lifts. Things I did not like about these gloves are:1. This glove advertises as 3/4 finger length but only covers up to the first knuckle.2. All the padding is in the center of the palm and none on the base of the finger.Things I liked about the gloves:1. The velcro wrist straps2. The mesh back that allows ventilationEven with the ventilation my hands were too sweaty so I bought some Gripads and they work much better.

I received these and while I don't know if they last longer, the quality isn't there compared with Harbinger's gloves. In short, the padding is inadequate, the palm leather is too slick and doesn't aid in grip, and the glove just appears a bit cheap. It is definitely inferior for serious gym goers.

The strip of cotton material along the thumb which serves as a sweat absorber, after barely TWO months of use , started to separate at the seam where this material connects to the leather. This happened on each thumb within a few days of each other, although the rest of the glove appears that it may hold up pretty well, but one can't really lift comfortably with exposed thumbs. Now I do work out often, about four days a week and lift some pretty heavy weight, so maybe it's just that these gloves are better suited for lighter workouts without so much heavy pushing and pulling. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk gloves that fell apart within a few months","review":"I lift pretty heavily 5 days per week and these gloves just couldn't take it.

However, after watching the movie, I was rather pleased. Although his acting is not in the same league as The Rock, it's better than it was before. Also, the combat in these movies, although no Blood Fist equal, is solid and hard-hitting. Austin doesn't just mow over the guys (and does face some pretty decent fighters), but does finish his fights strong. His finisher is a powerful punch to the heart, but he doesn't overdo it (meaning they don't build the last-half of each fight around it), and he takes just as much damage as the other guy, driving home the fact that he can kick ass but is human.Lastly, the story is pretty decent and the backgrounds of the two supporting characters makes for an intersting addition to the movie. In all, it is a great rental and, if you like brawlers, would make a good addition to your movie library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damage","review":"Great Movie, Austin is one of the best WWE stars to make movies, better than Cena and the Rock.

They are much appealing to a wider audience now as I have followed them from their first album. \\"Block Buster\\" is a song of seduction between man and woman with no reference to gang-banging, yet puts you in the mood to dance, party and romance. This should be one of their single's from the album. It's sad that KMEL does not support 11-5 with all of the sales they have done nationally. I would recommend this to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This crunchy mama says: What a great book!","review":"New-sibling books make me cringe most of the time -- they love to center on sibling jealousy, all the \\"negatives\\" of having a new baby. And then there's what I call the \\"bottle and crib factor\\" -- parents like me who breastfeed and sleep in a family bed search constantly for a collection of \\"books about babies\\" that look a little more like our family.This book is perfect. The toddler could be either a girl or a boy. The family's race is not specific and this could well be a mixed-race family -- what I'm getting at here, is that this could be anyone's family. The baby is breastfed with the toddler cuddled in the mama's arms, having a cookie. It's all about the joy of loving and being loved by a new baby, and the toddler is included on every page, helping and being loved, beckoned, welcomed. Utterly beautiful and simple. The last page, after the text ends, shows toddler and baby cuddled together under a blanket, asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my 18-month old","review":"Based on the positive reviews I read at Amazon.com, I bought this book and several others to help prepare my toddler for the arrival of our new baby. She got the book when she was 12 months old and it is still a favorite 6 months later. While I agree with other reviewers that this might not be the right book for an older child, I think the appealing illustrations and the simple, repetitive text are perfect for younger toddlers. In fact, it is unquestionably the best book I've seen on the subject for this age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite new baby book!","review":"We just gave my two year old daughter this book and she loves it - as do I! The drawings are nice, the text simple and concise. The copy focuses on loving the baby and explains the basics of what the child will see once a new baby is home. My favorite aspects of the book are: 1) The featured family is multi-racial, which is lacking in a lot of children's literature and I think great exposure for ALL kids; 2) The older sibling and new baby are gender neutral so the book can appeal to all children; 3) Very natural images are presented of the mother breastfeeding and also cuddling BOTH the toddler and baby at the same time. These are some of the reasons I purchased the book in the first place and we were not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ah ok book","review":"hubby doesnt like it and my son doesnt as for it.

He is almost 2 years old and loved to read before, so we were able to sit and describe the pictures. I went all over the place to find a book that wasn't too complicated for him, this had very simple phrases, like \\"A baby to love\\" and \\"A baby to watch.\\" The book also showed a nursing mother while the older child also cuddles with mom and has a snack. It seems to be helping, my son wouldn't let me touch another baby without becoming jealous or having a meltdown, but he let me hold another newborn baby and would even say \\"baby\\" and do nice touch on the babies feet. He also told me when he was ready for me to be done holding the baby which I think is one of the best case scenarios."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Books That Heal Kids","review":"Caring for a baby is a constant. They have routines and schedules that change the dynamics of a family. We Have a Baby uses simple text to explore all the things baby needs. \\"A baby to feed....A baby to dress....A baby to carry.\\" An older sibling (probably under 4 or 5) would benefit from reading this and brainstorming all of the things baby needs - and how they can participate in baby's routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this book","review":"Just wanted to leave a review since I regularly read others.

My daughter is three years old and will only let me read her a caillou book before bed. I purchased this one along with several others.The story is about the fact that Caillou is afraid to go into the attic because he thinks there is a wolf there. My daughter would never think to be afraid of something like that, but this book put that idea into her head.This book is definately only for those folks who are trying to help a child deal with a phobia.

I enjoyed the series immensely and would have recommended the books to any teenager; however, after reading Sold Out, my opinion has changed. Chloe's initial character was appealing because of her harder edge and atypical image. Unfornunately, as I read the book, I felt as though I was not reading the words of a teenager. The slang was dated, including words such as \\"groovy\\" and \\"pretty tough chick\\" as if these are typical of today's teenagers. Casual conversation throughout the story was far too structured to be that of teenage lunchtime banter, making the story seem spurious. Also, the issues in this book were either exaggerated or trivial. Few issues that Chloe faced were relatable to teenagers today. The book was trite, dated, melodramatic, and mawkishly sentimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sold Out","review":"Great teenage stories that draw students to want to read the book.

This book has some love making scenes that will take your breath away. Literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Now this is a vampire story! If you even moderately enjoyed From Dusk Til Dawn, you will love this book. Davey was always a loser, but when he went into a seedy club with a neon sign that read Live Girls, his life would change. Inside were gorgeous, yet slightly pale strippers. What the girls did to him would make him come back to see them again at all costs - and that would include Davey's soul.The only thing that can save Davey is a broken down police officer who happens to get curious as to what goes on behind the neon sign, and his girlfriend who is willing to put her neck on the line - literally!Buy this book - it is what all the vampire fans out there have been waiting for.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I bought Ray Garton's \\"Live Girls\\" because I loved his two werewolf novels, so I wanted to read his take on vampires.

Nick is the cool one, SA is crazy, Chad is the comic, Tim is the sweetheart, and P-Nut is...well, just P-Nut. If you don't like 311, you are bound to like one of the band members...they have great personalities and get wild when they're not onstage.

Rather, the words \\"too symphonic\\" are percisely what makes this recording great, because Tchaikovsky broke ground in combining symphonic and ballet musical styles into his three ballets.

Katharine Raines, a college professor and political consultant to Delaney Lynch, candidate for the U.S. Senate in New York, hires Rada to investigate the disappearance of grad student, Susan Blake. Upon discovering that she has been murdered in her apartment, Rada is determined to find out who committed the brutal murder. There are a number of twists and turns in this plot. And the ending will surprise the reader. Mazel writes action scenes that keep readers sitting on the edge of their chairs in suspense. The scene of Rada chasing a suspect through the streets of New York was riveting. The prologue introduces the reader to Alex and sets the stage effectively for the story. I particularly like titles for every chapter. I am looking forward to Alex Rada's next investigation and to finding out more about Alex."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little corny but effective","review":"I agree with all of what the other reviewer - James P - said. We had another video that was kind of absurd that we used for training in our agency. This one is better - but it has a low budget 70's type of feel to it. Probably cause they had a low budget and it was made a while ago.The opening dramatic presentation is very corny but to the point. The woman who stars in this video has lines that make her seem like a doofus - and so might offend some people, but no one seems too offended about it when I explain that it is hard to find good fire safety videos.The ending may seem a little over the top - 15 minutes of a real life worst case scenario - but them's the facts.

Some of my best memories came from this camera.I have many rave reviews on my pictures and the quality that came from this little gem. Everyone comments on how great my pictures are~ so it must be doing something right.

I researched cameras quite a bit before purchasing, and with the $100 rebate, this camera is an awesome deal that simply can't be beat. This is my second digital camera, after having traded up from a 2.1 megapixel model. I find that the quality of a 3 megapixel camera like this is ideal--big enough for high quality photos, yet not insanely detailed to the point that the photos eat up incredible amounts of hard drive memory. The camera also takes pictures quickly without much lag time in between photos. Also, one of my favorite aspects of this camera is that with a 512k memory card, the camera doubles as a little camcorder for capturing high quality, quick videos (with sound) of precious moments. The only thing I don't like about the camera is that the rechargeable battery has to be removed in order to be recharged. There's no way to recharge it simply by plugging in the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, good movies and audio","review":"This camera takes great photos and gives you lots of options, from simple point and shoot to preprogrammed settings (landscapes, fireworks, dusk, closeups) to total manipulation of features and images using camera features and software. We wanted a small, light camera, and this one is compact while easy to get your fingers on the \\"mouse\\" and dial.

The recorded sound is full bodied, yet brilliant, and the chorus in the Fantasy is obviously at home in both the language and the music.This is middle-period Beethoven in (unusual) departures from the standard symphony and concerto opuses so well known. The Choral Fantasy is a wonderful, bravural piece that deserves to be played more often. Perhaps the piano part is too small to warrant the fee of big name performer.

The guy travels from the USA to Argentina after his lover, but he doesn't convince me. He doesn't seem to be neither in love nor suffering. He's always smirking. If one's after Sabato's toy, the scene is flash, forget it. It seems to me that, apart from very few movies, most of them suffers from a weakness in their plots, their direction, their acting. And they lack real love feeling, such as in \\"Just a question of love\\" (Fr), \\"Later Days\\" (although the main actor's acting is weak (the religious guy) )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise Lost to Bad Execution","review":"The only good thing about this film is the acting.

At some moments it seems to be a dark and gloomy (with kind of light and entertaining music in background...wth???).Then, some events are showed as if the whole enterprise was nothing more than a poor parody of a thriller...I don't even mention the final, because it is ages since I have seen such a dumb ending.Second star for Sonia Braga, who potrays bitchy mother of \\"lost in action\\" argentinean lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"What a thundering disappointment. Fans of the book will be outraged by this dire adaption. And Antonio Sabato Jr. fans must not get their hopes up: despite the hoopla over his full frontal nude scene, it lasts a flickering second (have that pause button handy). Additionally, he gives a stilted, one-note performance. Shockingly, the film was co-adapted for the screen by Dennis Hensley, a frequent celebrity interviewer and author of the witty books \\"Misadventures in the (213)\\" and \\"Screening Party\\"; none of his humor is present here. Also missing is the book's edge and sense of urgency; the film plays more like a plodding drama.

She does stormy-'n'-indignant deliciously well.My one HUGE regret is that the music isn't available on CD as a soundtrack! It is so glorious, especially when the main character gets to Buenos Aires. I hope they get the soundtrack out. It is extraordinary. (It was the first thing I looked for here on Amazon.com after I saw it.) I would love to have it. (The music gets all five stars!!)That said, the movie played out like a dream would, with Dean (David Sutcliffe) searching obsessively - as someone who is caught in a dream would - for the lover who evaporated from his life: Pablo (Antonio Sabato, Jr.).It reminded me very much of dream, when you'll do anything to find the one you are looking for...and get distracted...at times...on the way.(Smoldering eyes are not on short supply in the film.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for the money shot!","review":"First of all this movie is about revenge and hate. What would compel a person to go to extreme measures just to exact revenge (for me it's unjustified). The extreme measures in this case involve flying to Argentina, having sex with your ex boyfriend's one-night-stand(if that!)and ruining the wedding of your ex because of HATE and because he dumped you! The author must be experiencing a lot of repressed anger(I didn't read the book). This, I find stretched the limit of believability, but one can argue that it's a movie. Having said that, the only redeeming feature of the film for me is the FULL FRONTAL nude scene of ASJ. You know what I mean! I'm not a fan but I'm willing to buy this DVD just for that!

I discovered hypnotherapy while I was going through grief and found it to be extremely powerful in healing the emotional pain. I have been guided into hypnosis many times and have learnt a lot from the process.During hypnosis nobody controls your mind. It's not voo doo or magic!! and you don't become unconscious. Hypnosis is a beautiful state your mind reaches where it can be relaxing and highly focussed. In hypnotherapy, hypnosis is induced by the therapist to help you heal (emotionally and or physically).After coming across several hypnosis/NLP/mind books, I highly recommend this book. It diffuses some of the common misconceptions about hypnosis and it gives a helpful guide into using hypnosis more effectively in therapy. The other book I also recommend by everyone who wants to know about hypnosis is \\"Hypnotherapy\\" by Dave Elman"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book every hypnotist should read","review":"This book is written in an entertaining, easy-to-read format. It is not a \\"how-to\\" book for beginners, however even those new to hypnosis may find enlightening the fact that we are all constantly moving in and out of trances, that hypnosis is so much a part of our daily reality, the way we think, communicate and process information that like a fish swimming in the water we may come to conclusion that water doesn't even exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHATTY PRESENTATION","review":"This book has a very chatty style; you could almost imagine the author reading it to you or chatting to you as you go through it. It has some good case studies which highlight clearly the information but is not for the beginner. Perhaps it is for the new practitioner. It would also be very useful for any prospective or new parent to read as it gives an incredibly interesting view on how hypnosis happens naturally in the world and so how we are influenced from being children!GREAT BOOK - very interesting and easy style to read,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone intrested in hypnosis, trance or psychology.

So I buy this book and now I am more confused then ever! The authors use terms they do not define such as muted or topaz, terms which are critical to me being able to sort out my season confusion. Then they suggest I use \\"color draping\\" by grabbing clothes or even towels from around the house that match obscure and subtle color differences. Ah, I do not have a \\"mango\\" and \\"salmon\\" towels or at least I do not think I do. It is hard to tell since the color swatches in the book are as bad as everyone else complains they are.

This IS a book on color so if you are real torn see the original book ok its dated in fashon but really does a much better job in the color department. As for the makeup section it stinks. I don't agree with their suggestions for eye makeup and eyeliner for alot of people...

(I have ashen blonde hair color like a Summer, olive green/golden brown eyes like an Autumn, and pale translucent ivory skin , like a Spring). The color palletes look like coloring book swatches that were done by a five year old (what are we supposed to gain from that !) Overall a huge disappointment, and only helpful purhaps to those who have well defined seasonal characteristics.

As soon as I turned to the Clear Spring type in this book, I knew it was my type.

It centers around a mentally unstable woman groping for happiness and the happiness of her four lovers, each lovers in diffferent senses of the word.

However, I don’t question the point that cats somehow seem to fit into the way of Tao, so the book, coupled with the beautifully-done paintings and sayings, makes for a really thought-invoking read.Indeed, the book is both elegant and refreshing with a strong tinge of Eastern influence, and the calligraphic painting of the cats in a variety of poses and actions are really exquisite and beautiful in their own ways. Each art is accompanied by short Taoist or Confucian maxims, and if one pauses to think about it, the cats paintings and sayings certainly tell us something about the aspects of life.No doubt, the book is simple with more focus on art than words, but then, a picture is sometimes, worth a thousand words."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Drawn Cat","review":"If you like line drawings of cats, this book is for you.

It is also interesting that fused his interest in the 60's era into a career that included managing some of the biggest stars of the 60's! Like Nancy Sinatra, Nancy is one of my favorite singer of all times!(There are LOTS of great photos of her in the book) and she says nice things about Hal in her intro.The picture of Hal in his Batman costume next to Adam West's Forward was a nice touch.

I look foward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time!","review":"If you think that Nancy Sinatra was the biggest, hottest and sexiest babe ever to hit showbiz, then this exercise in self-aggrandizing narcissism is for you. \\"Written\\" (so to speak) by Sinatra's publicist (there are pictures of her EVERYWHERE), the book is little more than a series of scant captions and magazine covers. Amid the author's juvenile memories of what he claims was the best year ever (After all, who doesn't think \\"The Swinger\\" and \\"Munster, Go Home\\" were two of the seminal films of all time?) are the author's persistent claims that his six year-old libido was getting sexually aroused by the likes of Stephanie Powers and the chick from \\"The Green Hornet\\"! No mention is made of the space program, sports, politics, or Vietnam. Why? I guess Lifson didn't have any hot pics of Nancy Sinatra (or himself) at Cape Kennedy, or \\"fun\\" memories of sipping Kool-Aid while running from the Cong through a rice paddy near the DMZ."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the kid in all of us!","review":"Hal Lifson's 1966! caught my attention because I was born in 1966. Flipping through this wildly eye-catching book made me remember things I loved about my own childhood during (mostly) the '70s. The Brady Bunch, Kaboom! cereal, Lik-m-Aid candy, my Flatsy dolls, and discovering Dr. Pepper were all great as a kid. But as an adult, Lifson convinces that the freshness and surreal creativity of '66 pop culture was indeed \\"the coolest!\\" How FUN was practicing the Bewitched nose-twitch, wondering if I could turn my bedroom into Jeannie's bottle boudoir, Nancy Sinatra's boots 'n miniskirt image, the Country Squire wagon with the wood panels (my parents' first car), etc., etc? If you're ready for a break from today's world of 9/11, Eminem, and Fat Bastard-type bathroom humor, Lifson is ready to take you on a very charming trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning preformance, great digital sound!","review":"Fantastic performance, top quality sound. Pavarotti in his top form. Daniela Dessi sings in an exceptionally colorful, emotionally rich manner, while maintaining a very precise, perfect pitch at all times. Juan Pons sounds better than when heard live at the Met - here he seems to have a more powerful baritone than when sounding live. And yes, he's presenting a very expression-rich, dynamic performace, as usual, and as one would expect from a top notch vocalist singing this verismo masterpiece. I own about a dozen recordings of I Pagliacci and this one is my most favorite of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this laptop","review":"So I bought this laptop for travel/work, planning to use my \\"big\\" laptop at home. The \\"big\\" laptop hasnt had much use at all. THis laptop is great. No problem with the keys, they are comfortable and have not had the problem of hitting nearby keys due to the smaller size. I was also concerned about the screen for day to day use, but the quality of the screen makes up for the smaller size. My back/neck dont hurt anymore lugging the big laptop around in my bag. For someone focused on buying a lightweight laptop this is an excellent choice.

The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok off the chain.","review":"Ok this cd is tight, but my favorite song is (4) As long as there's you.

Unfortunately, the author is not only not a philosopher, but apparently spent so much effort on trying to be humerous, that there wasn't much left for accuracy. In this supposed introduction to the great thinkers we find such gems as Ayn Rand advocating \\"egotism\\" rather than \\"egoism\\" (a distinction Rand was at pains to make in The Virtue of Selfishness), the term \\"dogma\\" defined as a belief enforced in an \\"authoritarian manner,\\" (perhaps a popular connotation of the word is everyday speech, but not its proper definition as a theological term), and, stunningly, feminist writer Mary Godwin Wolstencraft being credited with authoring the novel Frankenstein (no mean feat since she died a decade before it was written in 1813. The actual author is , of course, Mary Wolstencraft Shelly who was a live teenager in 1813).The list goes on.

Well...it's not a bad book, but superlative? memorable? moving? (which is what I rate 5-stars in my reviews): I don't think so! It definitely WANTED to be, but it's got a somewhat confusing story line with way too many different conflicts going on. There was the heroine's trying to keep her brother safe; the hero's conflict over whether he should love her or deliver her to the King; the hero's family problems; the heroine's skeevy uncle & his plots; the heroine's Scottish family...yada yada, and none of this gelled into something really attention-grabbing.The heroine, Gabby (terrible name) was just \\"nice\\", no spice...tho' everyone kept saying how brave & resourceful she is, I just didn't feel it. The heroine's having \\"the Sight\\" was over-used. The love story was vaguely boring, I thought. I just had to push myself to finish it.

The low light focusing ability of this camera is unmatched, even compared with camera that has focus illumination.However, while shooting video, the focus is slow to catch up with the zoom, especially when zoomed in completely. Sometimes, the focus may never lock, if it is zoomed in completely, very quickly. To get it to focus, zoom back slightly, and the camera will focus. Once it is focused, max zoom in slowly, and the camera will stay focused.The camera takes very good still and video, and has a very smooth zoom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera at affordable price","review":"I thoroughly enjoy using my p712 camera.

His superb technique is always at the service of the music as his profound knowledge. I give this CD my highest praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"no comment","review":"What can you say about tempos that are neither too fast or too slow, dynamics neither too wide or too narrow, phrasing that supports but never distorts? I'm posting only because in reading reviews of various sets of Beethoven sonatas I so often find Brendel referred to as dry, pedantic, or intellectual. His writings and interviews leave no doubt that he is an intellectual, but on these recordings the intellect is entirely at the service of musical expression. Every note is carefully weighed and measured but the result is anything but dry. These late sonatas are the pinnacle of Beethoven's art and any exaggeration only robs them of power. This set is taken from the second of Brendel's three Beethoven cycles. The recording quality is excellent and there are almost 2 1/2 hours of music on the two cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected!","review":"It came in just a few days, was not missing any cards, excellent quality for \\"used\\" it was basically brand new.

I prefer Arrau/ Haitink's Brahms 2nd to Richter/ Leinsdorf and Fleisher/ Szell, though I find a special beauty in the account by Gilels/ Jochum that commends it equally.

The only suggestion I would make is that the Boneheads limit the writing to Steve Jones. The Boneheads' \\"democratic\\" approach to songwriting results in every member of the band contributing at least one song. Because each band member's variety of styles and influences don't necessarily \\"meet in the middle\\", the result is an album that sound like 5 guy's going in on a solo project. Music fans who liked Keith Richards' solo albums and Exile on Main Street, will like the songs written by Steve Jones. For those that like the laid-back blues of Dr. John, the other band members put out some Cajun Funk that will make you reach for a cold beer every time. All in all, this is a talented bunch of guys. They just need to realize where the majority of talent is allocated, and make it a group effort to showcase Steve Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"step bumper receiver","review":"this item dose not come with no hardware compare to the other step bumper receiver it should have said NO HARDWARE INCLUDED also the hole that bolts to the bumper was too small for the 3/4 hole on the step bumper no I don't need to addbut since I had cut the hole bigger and repaint it was much cheaper than returning for a refund I got it to work butwhen you sell a product you need to make sure things are going fit than making alteration and buying hardware kurt hashardware come with there bumper hitch and it almost looks the same"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item","review":"I had someone weld me a cargo rack for a receiver hitch, the only problem was I didnt have a receiver hitch so I bought this and bolted it to my 2006 chevrolet colorado bumper by drilling a couple holes and Im done.

I'm here to tell you, the idea is sound and it at first appears to work wonderfully.The device has two ways to set off the alarm, first is the motion detection, second is a attachment to allow you to set it up to trigger if a door or window is open (limited by distance of the cable). I only used the motion detection part because I really didn't want cables running from it. Well within a few weeks, it starts setting off false signals, within a month or two it beings to constantly set of false signals to the point where I can't use it. So I got some crappy wall art.I have a feeling and it's purely feeling, that this product has a high potential to stop working or to come delivered faulty.

I set them both up, and only one worked. I traced the problem with the other one to the remote control, which was completely non-functional (nothing happened when pressed buttons). I could turn on both units with the one functioning remote, but only one of alarms seemed to have the exit delay stated on the package. I should mention that the chime option is quite loud, and without the exit delay it was loud enough to wake up the kids upstairs who were already in bed. They both worked the first night, but the next night one of them was giving false alarms every couple hours during the night for no apparent reason. I had to turn it off as it is useless for security purposes if it just randomly goes off.This is the lowest rating I have given a product I have ordered on Amazon, but as you can see from the above it was deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick oveview","review":"I got this book for my fire science class.

Kirby's storytelling inside the book is entertaining and well-paced. Although obviously dated, they seldom had that \\"campiness\\" feel.

It is easy to get lost in the narrative because there is little to refer to in regards to good the clear maps and the names of the towns in the battle area are not exactly names familiar to most military historians other than Kustrin, Frankfort on the Oder and a few others. The main problem is that good maps are needed to follow the action. The publisher reduced the maps to the size that is difficult to clearly read them and find the places mentioned. The hardback copy most likely has larger maps and possibly a better section for the reader.

I Musici plays with an informed baroque style, but not so much so that they get bogged down in the reactionary, scholarly prerogatives of much of the period instrument movement. The horns ring effortlessly, brightly, and clearly, the sound of the flute is enchanting without using excessive vibrato, and the strings are completely unified creating the full effect of Bach's masterpiece. The violin concertos are taken at a slow tempo, and I Musici, it can be argued, is guilty of overdoing the sentimentality. But the performances of the violin concertos, none-the-less, are solid.

However near the end of my workout I'm doing tricep extensions, and the gloves seem to cut painfully into my palms at that point. Again, its a weird thing that never happened with any previous gloves.Given these two factors I just can't recommend these gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after four uses","review":"I purchased these gloves to replace an older pair of another brand that had taken abuse in the weight room for almost a year before needing replacement. I liked the look of them, and the fact that they're made to go through the washer and drier suggested that these were made to last.I quickly found out that this is not the case. After four uses, the stitching around the finger holes AND on the velcro flap is already falling out. If I were to keep using them, it looks like they'd be totally worthless and falling off my hands in another week.I'm usually not one to deal with the hassle of returning inexpensive items, but the fact that I can get other brands that will hold up at around this same price has convinced me to ship these pathetic little things back for another brand. I'd highly recommend you save yourself the time and money. Look into another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Pakistan! JUNK!","review":"Made in Pakistan!

Anyway, this baby has 200 blocks of memory and comes in a sort-of-clear blue casing that is drool-inducing--if you really, really like blue.

And let me add that there is really, really good fanfiction out there, but this is not it.

There is so much thick, sludgey, pedantic psychobabble in this story that it seems like the authors were trying to write a Dune or a Fellowship of the Ring, and failing miserably.

GREAT book, one of the best Star Trek novels I have ever read, the characters were well on point and never erred (No OOC).

That is my main #1 beef against the original TV series. Authors who repeat and magnify that blunder make the matter worse!Once again, Kirk and Spock (mostly Spock) are the main focus of attention, with the rest of the Enterprise crew functioning as no more than glorified pages and squires. Even worse is the way Spock is charcaterized by the authors. In this book, Spock might just as well be wearing a cape with a red \\"S\\" on it!I read this book before ST:TNG, ST:DS9, and Voyager were made, and I despised this book then. After enjoying the way ALL of the characters were included and developed in the three latest Star Trek series, both my love of Star Trek and my hatred of this book grew. Enough, already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The pits","review":"I've decided that this book is worth two stars... why? Well, I must say that it is the absolute worst of the Star Trek novels I've read. It was difficult to understand and the plot was a bit obscure. Also, it seemed to me that Spock and Kirk were portrayed as homosexuals. I began to wonder whether or not this was a story based on sexual fanasties(as a previous reviewer stated). I did, however like the fact that the character of the Romulan Commander was reintroduced.

(As someone else has noted) the button which changes framing is place just where the left forefinger wants to hold the camera, so you can easily trigger it unwantedly. 2.

The date/time stamp on the back is so small and faint it's hardly worth it. Every roll of film I have developed comes out differently, whether it's every photo with red-eye, or skin discoloration... There is also a problem with the film memory itself, making the format's come out different than what it was set at (besides the default) Kodak told me it's because the film is so new they are still \\"working on it\\".

They too died before the day was out. We followed the directions to a t. The trip here was just too much for them. I refused to do it a third time depite this company's willingness to send out more frogs. It just broke our hearts to see the lethargic frogs arrive in the mail. What a life.

We had raised tadpoles two years ago without any problems. She is going to be so upset when she finds out that the third tadpole didn't live.The tank itself is made of cheap plastic and it gets so hot inside the tank, the plastic fogs up.

We ordered the tadpole in January, but didn't receive it until April (delivery was supposed to take 4-6 weeks), and it died the second day we had it. To the company's credit, they sent us a new one free of charge, but then had to wait another month. That one lasted about 7-10 days. Very disappointing for both my kids!!! We followed every instruction very carefully, and even thought of ways to keep their environments more stable, but it didn't do any good. We will try another source for another tadpole, but defintitely will NEVER use this company again!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"toy buyer","review":"I received my tadpoles in early April, 2009.

The light is like all Timex indiglo's, bright and unique.The strap is also unique - hard to desscribe but it's sort of a backwards closure.

I have learned to love many lesser-known rhapsodies from this set, and to me the understated literalness has allowed it to wear well, especially when hearing a number of the pieces at one sitting. Continuous dazzle can also be boring; Campanella prioritizes his climaxes to heighten impact. It is odd that someone selected number 15 to trash; I learned this piece from Percy Grainger's 1922 recording but Campanella beats the pants off him. If you have a full set you enjoy, stick with it.

If you haven't used an APS camera before, you will be amazed at the ease. The auto-loading of film is great, and the photo-format selection is very cool. I particularly like the panoramic option. Index prints, instead of negatives, are great.The Kodak APS is a pretty good APS. It's not a top of the line model, but it is far better than most entry level models. Besides, most people don't need a top of the line camera for family photos. The incremental gain in picture quality is greatly outweighed by the increased cost (I own a higher end APS as well).The features on this camera are all the features the average person needs.This is the perfect price point and picture quality for the vast majority of people.

I have sent the camera in for repair twice and it took 1-2 pictures before ceasing to function again. I lost the cost of the camera, two batteries, the cost of several one-time-use cameras, and the cost of shipping it twice. (I may try sending it one more time in sheer determination to get something for the money I've invested in it.)

I take a lot of pictures of my family at the beach, and the zoom helps me get a closer shot if they are in the water or too far away.

At first I thought it would be cool since it has multiple sports, but unfortunately we've found it to be pretty worthless. The only thing my son had fun with for a while was putting balls - and other things - in the basketball hoop. If we ever can't find something, we can usually look in there and it's wedged in halfway down. The design of the spinning balls isn't done very well since by the time a child is old enough to have the dexterity to do it, s/he is probably too tall for the baseball and the golf ball one isn't close enough to the ground.

He loves watching the ball come out the chute at the bottom, and the fact that it always lands in the little recess and it doesn't get away from him is a big plus. My other kids think it's fun, too, even though they are way past toddler toys. They like using the golf putter and t ball features. I love the way you can use the anchored golf and tee balls when the baby is little, to practice connecting, or use the regular balls when he's ready. All in all, this is a really fun toy. Easy to put together, and it seems very sturdy. Two baby thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-in-1 Sport Set","review":"I think the manufacturer of this toy tried to cram too much into one toy. The 3-in-1 sports design doesnt really work. My son really liked the basketball hoop part when we first received the toy as a gift so we decided to keep it, well, after putting the darn thing together which was a pain, we werent going to return it. But, the novelty of the basketball part wore off quickly. With only 3 balls included my son resorted to throwing other things in the hoop and down the chute when he couldnt find the balls. It has become quite the annoyance now. The positioning of the golf ball and baseball make it very awkward to play either sport. Plus, who gives a young child a bat (allbeit a plastic one) in the house?! If it werent winter when we received this toy it would have been an outdoor only toy. Save your money and buy a nicer basketball hoop or a set of nice toddler golf clubs for your child rather than this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"We all need a good story.

The only reason I can think that this product would be marketed this way is to mislead the consumer into believing this was superior to the competing products that state up front that their product contains only 100mg.Do yourself a favor, and find another brand, either one that contains 100mg but advertises the fact up front, or one that actually contains 300mg or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to work","review":"It seems to work had to reapply a few times.

There are a myriad of references, resources, recipes and suggested diet plans for those who desire, but this book is mostly about finding the right approach to work for you to lose weight. It's encouraging as Ms. Fletcher reminds us that many people take several attempts at dieting before finding one that works--much like people who attempt to quit smoking many times before it sticks. This means the next time you try to lose weight just might be the final one that works for you for the rest of your life!

(Many of her masters have lost and kept off much more.)The two things I like most about this book are:1) Rather than taking a theoretical and single-minded approach to dieting, the author relies on a wide variety of actual true long-term success stories and quotes the masters themselves extensively.2) The author takes a practical, common-sense, long-term approach rather than the usual quick-fix mentality of most diet books.Bottom line: this book worked (and is still working) for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"basic good advice","review":"the best thing about this book is learning once and for all that everyone needs to find their own way to lose weight and keep it off. it's refreshing to read real accounts of real masters of weight loss and it boils down to basic common sense...eat less and move more! what you eat and how you move is up to you and that's the fun part of the book...learning that all the masters found their own way to lose weight and keep it off. empowering and easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is reality, not a gimmick","review":"Now that I am in my mid-thirties, I am in the process of losing the extra weight that I've been carrying since high school.

We went to the Amazon A-Z guarantee and found the only thing we could do would be to ship the table back at our expense and receive a full payment. That means disassembling something that took hours to get together, packaging (and by this time we had thrown away the boxes), and paying to ship.

It started off with SOME good information, although nothing new, and had a nice personal success story. Soon after that you get slapped in the face with its sales gimmick, which is difficult to get past. Why? Because it's difficult to trust informtion coming from a person who is going to benefit financially from his recommendations - 100% of the recommended supplements are from his company.

The author's books have always been populated with blank characters for whom the reader never feels a thing (they exist only to advance his criticism of society), but this one is so empty it's like a black hole. After reading Diary and Survivor, I realize Palahniuk's books are less novels than they are almanacs, collections of random facts, albeit interesting facts. It's like he's read every urban legend story in the world and just vomits up tidbits onto blank paper and then connects them with cardboard characters. I think most people read his books for the reason I've lasted this long: the packaging is awesome. All of his books have awesome covers, and you'll feel better when you realize that's why you and others are buying them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I found this an easy to read yet dull book. I read half of the books pages in about an hour but had no real motivation to go on, nothing seems to happen, the characters by Palahniuk's standards are dull and rather cliche, you have all manor of freaks as to be expected, but theres the trouble with Palahniuk his side show parade of freaks and geeks is what you expect.If you liked Survivor, and Fight Club there should be no reason why you woulnd't like this, more of the same really but I've found all his books interesting on one level but uninvolving on another, Fight Club worked marvelously as a film, maybe Chuck should look at writing film scripts?Anyway I found this book dissapointing, after plowing through Fight Club, and Survivor and not finishing Choke I think I'm all Palahniukied out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I even bothered","review":"I don't normally read novels. I picked this one up in order to enthuse me back into reading novels. What a total put-off this was? Could not keep myself interested beyond the first ninety pages. The characters are hazy and there's no plot. The rule of adding a touch of sex to anything to make it work does not cut it with this novel. This book is going straight to the bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"It started out interesting so I kept on reading it. I noticed the book had no point or anything interesting, but I thought since every talks about how great Chuck Palahniuk's book are. Towards the end the was so bad and weird I just stopped reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound bites only might be worth reading.","review":"I was given this as a Christmas present with the recommendation that it was \\"hilariously funny.\\" And, if all you read is the sound bite quips every 20 pages or so, it might be. But, as commentary on contemporary society, sex addiction, unemployment, theme parks, dementia - each topic works out to about 3 pages from a sad (and redundant) professional journal article spread out through an entire book interspersed with all the dirty words that are really no surpise anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I do really like the book, actually I mean the content of it, but the quality of the book is bad, very very bad, it's the book from museums. moreover, the appearance of it is bad and unacceptable. the picture on the website is not the real photos, since there is also a tag from the museum on the cover. how can i store this book. It's a really bad experience of buying things on amazon. Hope it's the only one. Jesus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for everyone..","review":"This book is definitely not for everyone to read. It is very perverted and just wrong in so many ways. I couldn't even finish reading this book. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm really not into the dark and perverted stuff that was in this book. If you are into stuff like this, I highly recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Sucks Palahniuk was trying too hard","review":"Awful I threw it in the trash after reading it halfway. Palahniuk was trying too hard to be edgy and sarcastic it just comes out very lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck's fiction is mucho better","review":"Other than the memoirs, this book is pretty lame. It's written well, and covers some strange topics, but it just doesn't hit Chuck's true ability as a fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"obscenity a ruse to disguise emptiness","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who related a story about a reading by Palahniuk, complete with fainting old ladies and styrofoam body parts that Palahniuk threw into the audience. \\"If you read anything,\\" he said, \\"read Choke.\\" Now I fear the taste of my friend is in serious question. Chuck uses lots of colorful metaphors for various sexual acts and the more relevant parts of his body, but his imagination appears to have abandoned him after that. The print was big, the sentences bland and uncomplicated, and he's cheekily prone to repeating choice phrases that are as bland or moreso than rest.It was somewhat reminiscent for me of highschool, if you can imagine being accosted by a group of horny, unintelligent and loud mouthed lacrosse players. Anyhow, I'm glad those days are over, and the metaphors really weren't all that clever. I don't have anything against sex or books about sex, but I like it with a little content. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"This book was obviously only half as inspired as his others. I finished this book, but barely. I yawned through the last half. if it shows this has a high rating, ignore it."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this book get pubished again?","review":"...I didnt like the book \\"Choke\\" at all. I thought the few characters were degraded and I dont know why any normal person would want to go into the mind of a sex-adict. I thought the characters were undeveloped and vague in my immagination due to the lack of description, as well as primitive in their attitude towards each other as well as sex. If you really read into it, Victor (main character) has a one track mind- sex, and ocasinoally his poor dying mother.....this book was just unenjoyable, unless of course, you would want to spend 200 pages of your time reading about a gutter minded 20 some odd year old kid who is going through all of the sexual desires that any normal human goes through, only he gives into them...I really cant belive this book even got published, what a gross reflection of American culture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This was the first book of Chuck Palahniuk's I've read, and I can't say I'm a fan. I pretty much figured it out, so the ending just sucked. It was disappointing and a major waste of time. I do like his description of things, but was disappointed by the story. I have heard that Rant is a good book, but I am not sure I will give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Paper","review":"I've said it once and I'll say it again: I do not enjoy reading fly paper. Since Fight Club, Chuck's artistic integrity has taken a pretty hard blow--it's on the ground for the count and nearing its last breath. \\"Cohesive\\" and \\"coherent\\" are no longer in the guy's vocabulary. With this knock out, I'd say Palahniuk is strong evidence that Zoloft causes mental retardation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never comes together, not one character is at all likable (or terribly interesting)","review":"I'll sum up my thoughts like this:in the annals of med school, I'd hazard a guess that noone who ever got in ever used the phrase \\"for serious\\" when they meant \\"seriously\\" or \\"for real.\\" This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks every time Victor used it, and it seemed stupid.Plus, every guy gets sexually rejected once in their lives by a woman ... except Victor.This is a slightly below-average throwaway novel. Meh."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ears are bleeding from this great Mind-F#ck","review":"\\"A Bukowski and Braughtigan love child\\" isn't the right description for who I think Palahniuk is, but it's the first description that comes to mind.Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great one","review":"Choke is different from other books by Chuck Palahniuk in certain ways. It did not start at the end. Less emphasis is paid to consumerism. But it is definite Palahniuk, no one can argue about it. Victor mancini is modern day saviour and he lives up to it in certain ways. The most impressive character is his mother, Ida mancini. Mr Palahniuk is definitely one of best writers alive. Atleast he made me buy the hardcover. I can't even remember when was the last time I bought hardcover fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"Not sure why everyone liked this book. I could barely read it be/c it was so weird and yet boring. There was no life to the book the character was so gray and dry. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book to get stranded on a desert island with","review":"I've been saving up CHOKE for months for a needy moment, which came this morning when I expected to be spending a couple of hours in a doctor's waiting room. After plowing through fifty pages, however, I decided it would be more fun to just stare at the walls, which is what I did. It's an ugly book about the sort of people you'd cross the street to avoid if you saw them coming in time. Maybe it gets better. I don't intend to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb book.","review":"The book is about a guy who likes eating jaw breakers, but would often choke on them. Despite his affliction, he continues to eat jawbreakers. The story ends when he ate his last jawbreaker and it went through his ears which caused him to be deaf. After becoming deaf, upon leaving the hospital he got ran over by a New York taxi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choke by Chuck Palahnuik","review":"Chief Justice Brennan in 1957 described this book when he wrote the Roth decision and defined obscenity. When a work is utterly without redeeming social importance and when for the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest, it is obscene. This book about a sex addict is marked by an immoderate and/or unwholesome interest in unusual sexual desire: the very definition of prurient. Choke could be subtitled: ' A Dictionary of Genitalia and Sexual Intercourse to Debase the Human Body and the Sex Act.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that, is the first word that comes to mind; see O.K.","review":"This story was alright I thought it would be better because of Fight club. I liked where it seems like he was trying to go with the story but it didnt catch me Like I wanted it too. Others may love it, but I thought it was O.K. Only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta tell you, this ain't his best.","review":"I enjoyed \\"Fight Club\\" very much. and I did enjoy most of \\"Choke.\\"But style can only take you so far without narrative strength. Choke ain't worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird but lost steam.","review":"At first the author's voice reading the book was bothersome - whiny, halting, and \\"don't quit your day job\\" type of reading, however it fit the story perfectly. I enjoyed listening to this quirky/weird story through maybe chapter 45, but then I had to give it up. It really went nowhere and was beginning to bore me. I guess I could have given it two red rubber beads, I mean stars, but I guess the worst review of a book is not being able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"The book is sloppy and uninteresting. I know he was trying to make it unstructured which would have been fine if it didn't take away from his ability to tell a good story. The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting which made me really not care what happened to any of them. One part of the end that is supposed to be shocking is predictable the other part of the end was surprising. I feel that if he is trying to make a story that really builds up to a surprise ending it better be really good but he just doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cover is the best part","review":"I read the first half. skimmed actually. then I superspeed skimmed the rest. I'm sure I missed the good page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fading Talent","review":"While \\"Fight Club\\" showed virtuoso prose and original ideas, and \\"Survivor\\" expanded his mileau of the dispossesed, \\"Choke\\" fails on every level. The main character is a rehash of Palahniuk's bizarro character sketches. Also, the story does not have the narrative drive contained in his other novels. Finally, and most disturbing, is the fact that the writing style is just plain bad, being juvenile and unoriginal. Chuck, what's up??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I won't spoil any of the plot for you (I'm going to guess that you've already read all about it by now), so I'll just say a few things. First, this is Chuck Palahniuk's most \\"hopeful\\" book. While I love his past three books, it is kind've refreshing to get some hope thrown into his mix. Second, Victor is a lot like Tender. If you like Survivor (the book, not that ... show), you should like this as well. Third, this is CP's funniest book, as long as you don't get offended by strong sexual content. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sexy, very entertaining, but not his best.","review":"I will try not to give any spoilers here. Its characters are classic chuck, the main character is a sex addict that works at a historical theme park, and they just get more interesting from there. They are strange characters, yes, but easy to relate to and motivated by very primal instincts. Not a book to read to your mother. It&#65533;s riddled with more of his very unique dark humor that is in Lullaby and Survivor. Also, Chuck inserts his little \\"tips\\" in life that they don&#65533;t teach you in school, they might be from the anarchist cookbook. Things like what all the secret code phrases that are announced over PA systems, and how to make easy money at fine dining places. It&#65533;s a quick read, flows nicely, a few of the scenes are unnecessary, but a good book over all. In chuck we trust indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best literature ever","review":"This book is so in depth. Chuck Palahniuk is great at writing literature that goes deep into the pysche. You can be from a family the resembles the Waltons and when you finish this book you feel like you were the little boy standing in the snow while your convict mom made an outline. I really enjoyed this book and invisible monsters and i look forward to reading all his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck does it once again","review":"Having read all other books by the author,I was greatly pleased to see and read that he onve again has brought another tale of warped human pysche and woe. From the under-devolped, mishapened chickens to the building to nowhere for nothing,Palahniuk seems to take modern nihilism and satire as well as a bit of deconstructonsim to dizzying heights before leaving as all with his trademark what in the Hell was that ending. Truly he has become one of America's best authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ho hum, another fan hopelessly devoted to the latest Morsel","review":"Probably all the reviews you'll read for this book are going to be exuberant and massively enthusiastic. I'm going to try to keep this as level as possible, but the fact is that Choke is a fantastic read, wickedly funny and, though not heartbreaking, it often manages to touch a raw nerve. If you're looking for the same kind of jet-black humour present in his other books, you will not be at a loss here, as the humour springs from the page right from the very start as the author insists that you, the reader, should go and do something else. After all, you're not getting any younger. Time will tell if this author's work will be held in a high literary regard, but even if it isn't, this novel deserves to be read and appreciated for the sheer pleasure alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty isn't the right word","review":"but it's the first word that comes to mind. I'd like to \\"choke\\" the woman from my book club who suggested this book. Club met last night and not one woman liked this book. Some couldn't even finish reading it because they were so disturbed they lost sleep. I truly regret that there's a record on the world wide web that I even purchased this smut."},{"rating":"1","title":"its still the book I wanted","review":"its a used paperback, I just thought good condition wouldnt come with a bunch of stickers on it and looking like itd be run over by something. lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palahniuk can do no wrong in my eyes","review":"If you love twisted themes, great storytelling, EXTREMELY interesting characters, this is a fun read. Premises like that usually hook me pretty quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"chuck is the man","review":"This book is nearly perfect in its ironic catastrophe. It is somehow a perfect circle of events and facts, all linking together to create an astonishing story that just might, for use of a boring and tired out cliche, take your breath away. The twists are thoroughly unexpected; perhaps this is due to the fact that the situation is completely unlike anything I've ever been involved in. Despite this, I can relate to the characters and sympathize with them. I read Fight Club and Survivor and have to say that I liked Choke the best, if only for its warped irony. Simply put, Choke rocks and so does Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and disgusting and wonderful","review":"This book isn't for someone sensitive or with a weak stomach, but it is really a fantastic book. This is one of those novels that throws you into a world that you wouldn't otherwise know if you hadn't read it. I loved it very much, and it was my first of Chuck Palahnuik's books, and is still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Fight Club","review":"My overwhelming wish was that the title character would have actually choked on the first page and no one saved him. That would have perhaps made for an interesting read. There were two redeeming qualities to the audio book: 1) it was just over 5 hours long, and 2)the narrarator wasn't terrible. Outside of that, there is little to be excited about here. The characters are almost as unbelievable as the preposterous, meandering plotline of this jumbled mess. All the tricks of the trade are here: allegory, alliteration, emphatic repetition. None of it works. It rings as hollow as an undergrad emulating his favorite author, and falling woefully short. This is my first go round with a Palahniuk book (Fight Club was the second one I read, but these could be gene-spliced together without any rejection by the host....they feel that similar, thus the copy & paste review similarities). There are too many good reads out there to waste one of the finite ones you have left on this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Zeh's opinion of Choke","review":"Choke is a phenomenal book that is easy to read and very entertaining. I have recommended this book to several of my friends to read, and so far they have all liked it as well. If you have read Chuck books before, then this is a must read. This was the first book I read by him, and it is his best in my opinion. Check it out sometime if you get a chance. By the way, this is my favorite book and soon it will be made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, but not in a good way","review":"I feel like Chuck's been holding back a bit. It's like he's not sure which direction he wants to go. Like he's straddling the notions of serving the mainstream or pushing the envelope and going more toward the other extreme. Fight Club is hard to follow-up, but seems like there's a bit of a rut here. Very odd. Anyone reading his books out of order might suggest that this was one of his first efforts, and Fight Club his latest. The repetition gimmick gets a bit old, really.That said, I'd still say it's a safe bet that I'll buy and read any other books Chuck has to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Intriguing isn't the Right Word, But It's The First...\\"","review":"Killer story, the typical Chuck characters and imagery, but I felt a little empty with the lack of climax, but then it all makes sense afterwards...That's the whole point. We're all just striving for one climax after another, when life is really just meant to be lived. Easily a necessity for any Palahniuk or postmodern literature fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"Unless you're a huge fan of Palahniuk, stay away from this book. If you're just getting into him I highly recommend \\"Haunted\\" or \\"Fight Club\\" over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality Problems","review":"While the novel has a fine story, and is classic Palahniuk, I can only give the product 2 stars. The binding is of low quality and falls apart easily. My copy came completely unbound after being left in my car for less than 3 hours of a warm-ish Pacific Northwest afternoon. A friend's copy came partially unbound after being left on the floor in his living room five feet from the fireplace.Enjoyable read, but you may want to buy a used hardcover, or borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Choke\\" is right","review":"After seeing the movie Fight Club, I became interested in author Chuck Palahniuk. He seemed to have such a fiendish sense of humor and made some very provacative commentary with Fight Club, so I decided to read Choke. That was in December. This is July, and I still have not been able to finish. Don't get me wrong--this book has the same cynical view that endeared me to Fight Club, but it just seems a bit pretentious with its dictionary-style addenda spattered throughout and the character's odd choices of phrases such as \\"For serious, dude.\\"Ughhh... it makes me shudder just remembering how tedious and annoying this had become.My flight was delayed for 8 hours in Mexico City yesterday, and even THEN, faced with utter boredom, I still did not reopen Choke for another go. I guess I will finish it eventually, but I sincerely hope the next Palahniuk book I read is ALOT easier to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Jesus NOT do?","review":"He would not read this book... I've enjoyed every Palahniuk's creations, but this is not good at all. It's in the same Palahniuk-Fight Club style, but it lacks an entertaining story. It is very raunchy, dicey, and weird like Palahniuk's great novels, but it lacks entertainment value. You read chapters after chapter before anything happens. I will say that the end is rather intresting. But to get to that point, it takes so much energy to pick up the book and plow through. What would Jesus NOT do? I know Chuck-- he would not read this novel. At least Palahniuk has Fight Club behind his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"He really did choke.","review":"Let me start by saying I like Chuck's work. I thought fight club and survivor were very good but this one was substandard. Like alot of his work the characters are one dimensional and that is ok if the action of the plot moves fast enough but sadly this is not the case. None of these characters (except Denny)are sympathetic and I did not connect with any of them. I was struck by how masoginistic our antihero Victor is. As with other of his books chuck uses the protagonist to spout slogans but there were few that we could hold on to. i recomend this book only to those devotees of Chucky P's work who worship him or those who are between the ages of 17-19 They'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"Palahniuk's \\"Choke\\" is, in a word, drivel. Like all other shallow, immature offerings from Chuck Palahniuk, this one shines with the author's fascination for his own amateurish writing. It's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I found the writing style irritating, and the characters dull and boring. The story seemed to drag on and on without actually going anywhere. It might have been decent, but the big plot twist turns out not to make any sense. Not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"same song, different charactes","review":"I'm a fan of Chuch Palahniuk. I've used Fight Club in my freshman level lit class. Unfortunately, Choke confirmed my fears: Chuck P. is a singer of one song (so far, anyway). Other than substituting sex for violence, the themes (and characters) are no different from FC (except FC is far superior). For example, in Choke, Victor refers to his boss as \\"His Highness\\" and \\"His Lord High.\\" Tyler uses a similar \\"tone\\" when referring to the president of the union: \\"Mister His Honor.\\" These comparisons may sound minor, but, reading Choke, I couldn't help but to think of FC and Survivor, to a lesser extent.No new ground is covered here. If you have never read Palahniuk, buy Fight Club or Survivor. This book is little more than a \\"re-tread\\" of his previous works but done with less brilliance.I do think that FC is a modern classic. I just hope that the author will move on to new territory and explore some other issues of modern life."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUB PAR","review":"I forget how i came across this book, maybe it had to do with fight club, a great film. i never read the book. anyway, about the book. it jumps around way too much. the beginning was a chore to read and get used to. i dont see what all the hoopla is about with this, it really isnt anything great. there are some original ideas in it, that are weird. Chuck writes some interesting sentences, some good descriptions, but i didnt find the plot very satisfying. its just okay, nothing great. oh well, hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lather, rinse, repeat.","review":"Have you read any of Palahniuk's other books?Great. You don't need to read this one.If you've read more than two or three, you know already that the fundamental plot elements remain the same, and the situations the characters get into become more drastic as he struggles to wrap new plot lines around the same broad plot as Fight Club (you have to hit bottom, subvert society, say a bunch of \\"shocking\\" stuff, etc. etc.).This is a really bad book. If you've read one Palahniuk book, you've read them all- at least stay away from the later ones, which are just sort of pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A roll in the gutter.","review":"I slogged through this tedious, ugly story hoping that there would be, as I found at the end of Fight Club, some redemption in it; --some payoff at the end that would justify the time spent listening to Palahniuk's interminable compendium of abject filth, sordid sick-mindedness, and general depravity.Alas, there was no payoff. It was a journey to nowhere, offering only a vivid view of ugly, trashy scenery along the way.What a waste of time and effort it was to sit through this insipid book. You could accomplish the same effect without spending the money by going out tonight and rolling in a gutter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choke....Gag....it's not the right word, but the first word to come to mind...","review":"I picked up the book choke because my significant other is absolutely obsessed with Palahniuk and i've read a couple of his works before. Unfortunately this book was just a major upset. At first I found the book rather interesting, but there were parts where it just dragged on and on and on. The flashbacks lessend the pain, because they were slightly more interesting. But aside from that, the ending of this book was the big upset to me in my opinion. This isn't a very Palahniuk-esque, and i wouldn't recommend reading it , it's the first couple pages that draw you in. And Palahniuk was right, don't keep on reading it, becasue it isn't worth your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are too many other books out there...","review":"...so don't waste your time reading this. I see Palahniuk's point in this book, but his execution is forced and at times boring. His writing style tries to come off as cute or witty, but his attempt at sidebar Vonnegut tangents fails miserably. This was my first book I read by him, and it really turned me off to his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a mean view of the world","review":"I have the good fortune to say that I have never encountered anyone remotely like the people in this novel. I finally concluded that I was just not the target audience for this novel. Some people thought this was funny?! Compulsive sex adicts throbbing lovelessly away on the bathroom floor? Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Favorable of Chuck P.","review":"I really enjoyed Palahniuk's first two books, Fight Club and Survivor. His style and cut throat in-your-face narration keeps you propelled to read on. However, Choke does not do that. I could not even finish the book after getting to page 90. For some reason, the narration got very repetitive and annoying. The content is over-the-top gross, and overshadows the characters and story. Chuck's first two books kept a good balance of satire and the explicit to the development of the main characters. Choke read as though the author was trying to out do his other books by being too ridiculous with repulsive language. By the time you read Choke, Chuck is not so much fun or a shock to read. It's just flat out silly. His latest novels tend to go beyond the repulsive language and try to create a different atmosphere with characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sad","review":"This book is a pretty in-your-face Palahniuk book. Harsh, Funny, Sad. It's a good read if you have a strong stomach that can handle black humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book.","review":"I read a lot of books from all genres. Fiction, non-fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. etc. etc. This book is the best so far. As you're reading it, you feel your mind being turned inside out: you become aware of the things that were there all your life, yet you never counsciously thought of. Amazing explanations of human nature coupled with humor just gets you to say \\"damn\\" outloud on almost every page. I would recommend anyone to get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I have no problem with the fact that this book is pretty much soft-core porn. I do have a problem with the fact that it is trying really hard to be meaninful but it's actually pointless, boring, and dumb. If it wasn't for the dirty parts the freakin thing would be unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read, great writer","review":"First off, this is one of my favorite reads ever. Chuck Palahniuk is one of the most unique writers I've ever encountered. His style is one that is ugly, rich, and full of wit. If you've seen the movies, or read his other books, you know whats in store. I would suggest this to someone who enjoys books by similar writers like Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is one of my favorite books, it is dark, strange and extreamly well written. Definitly not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for feeling good","review":"This book is the first of Chuck Pahalniuk's novels I have read. The book was interesting enough that I purchased his new release \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Survivor\\". Choke was nothing like \\"Fight Club\\" the movie(Haven't read the book yet). It took a little bit of patience to get started but I finished with ease and surprise in the end. Choking to get by in life and trying to find out who you really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"Took off with FIGHT CLUB. Peaked with SURVIVOR. Fell hard and long with INVISIBLE MONSTERS Barely even gets back on his feet with CHOKE. A disappointment from someone who's proven himself capable of so much more. Empty. Pointless. Unfinished. And, unfortunately, completely redundant. It seems that if you've read one Palahniuk, you've read them all. See also: Gimmicky transitions. See also: Over-stylized sentence fragments. See also: Addiction and disillusionment...there are other things to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted a different book with the same title.","review":"This was not the type of book that I read. I wanted to read a book called \\"Choke\\" that was about professional athletes not performing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets you laughing","review":"This is another where I saw the movie first (same with fight club) but in this case I felt the book was as good as the movie. It is a fast read and one that will keep you very entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a...ahem... vivid book.","review":"This book surprised me at first with it's vivid commentary on sexual situations occuring between the sex-addicted main character and random women. Being someone that appreciates a good writer, I quickly learned that the author isn't so much a pervert, as someone with a great amount of talent. The book was always a page-turner, but every once in a while, I'd hit about two chapters that went on a little more than they should.

It's a laborious read and he goes on and on and on about a lot of bs. Just when you think it's going to get good it slides into a pit of mud from which there is no escape. Fortunately for this book, I have to read whatever I pick up... Finish reading even if I'm all ready finished.I must say that he's seriously one of my favorite writers.

It's easy reading, funny, but also deeply satirical.However, if you don't like modernist literature, and you didn't enjoy Palahniuk's other books, you might get turned off by the style.I personally felt the ending was a bit weak, but the overall story was so strong it makes up for it. The scenarios are so unique and the relationships he creates are at once so real and so superficial, I just like this kind of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME isn't the right word...oh, yes it is","review":"color me confused. i am over 100 pages in and i cannot take it anymore. my g/f gave it to me for christmas insisting i would like it. total yawn fest. another reviewer said its not for people with a queezy stomach, i dont see how that holds true. another said it is very sexually explicit. maybe, if you've never watched cable television before. the writing style is annoyingly simplistic. see spot run, run spot run. that is what it feels like i'm reading, only slightly more humorous. i'm not interested in giving it anymore opportunity. shrug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer - - Terrible Book","review":"From page one of Choke, you immediately know that Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer. Unfortunately, while the prose pops and the story moves quickly, this book ultimately goes nowhere. The story is thin to say the least. Basically, the plot involves a sex addict's ill-planned quest to be a good son. However, most of the book really just amounts to Palahniuk describing bizarre sex practices. Although there are many different ways to tell a story, this ultimately goes nowhere and has little relevance to the plot. The ending, and the events leading up to it are not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Chuck \\"Choke\\"d","review":"The jacket lured me in but I can't say the author delivered the goods. Incredibly depressing, gross and bizarre characters and behavior doesn't make for an interesting read. His style can be entertaining but repetition of certain motifs really wears thin even in 256 pages. His attention to detail led to some interesting characterizations but just too weird to really be enjoyable.

My wife had just watched Fight Club and kept talking about it. Books are always better than movies so I bought Choke - expecting it to be as good or better. I could list a number of pejoratives to describe this book but I'll leave it simple. This book is just SILLY! The characters are silly. The plot is silly. The attempts to shock are silly.I devour books, especially good ones - but this one - I couldn't get it down - it made me \\"Choke\\". Maybe Chuck Palahniuk will see me choking and come save me!

But having the talent to entertain and enlighten doesn't necessarily produce a good novel.Choke left me feeling empty and confused. The sex addiction issues and the dysfuncional mother-son relationship were the well developed themes, but I felt as if nothing gelled together to form a complete statement of intent. Despite a very thorough synopsis of humanity's ailments, the plot just became more and more contrived and ridiculous as the book moved on, and the various 'surprise' endings were disappointing, to say the least because they were not developed; it seemed like they were just thrown together at the last minute to bring things to a close.I enjoyed Fight Club but Palahniuk has failed with this one. Hopefully his next effort will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I saw Fight Club the movie, so I thought this guy might have some good books.

I could not tell if it was just a weird tale about a guy with all kinds of problems and hang ups, or whether there was some point to it all. It was entertaining--especially the parts about his escapades--I will give it that, but it left me wondering what the hell was that I just read.

Palahniuk turns up things that make me both jealous and glad that I'm not the subject of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"This poor mans version of Fight Club is surprising ineffective. It seems that Palahniuk is a one trick pony, or maybe this is just the sophomore curse, it's unlikely that I'll trouble to find out, that's how disappointed I was. The characters, instead of representing everyman, seem to be faker than those on a TV sitcom. The story, instead of giving voice to the existential angst of a generation, is simply flaccid nonsense. There is nothing here but a feeble attempt to shock. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know I finished it.","review":"ChokeI am not usually made to feel sick by graphic imagery in a book, or any other form of communication.

This is Palahniuk's funniest book yet and more odd than any other, even \\"Invisible Monsters\\". I was taken aback by \\"Choke\\" because it is not the same as the others. It has a special additive of fantasy entwined in it, which captivates the reader. As usual the main character, Vincent Mancini with his numerous sexual encounters and hilarious moments, leads the story into a web of uncertainty, confusion, and explicit sexuality whether in another woman's bedroom, the mile high club, or in the hospital where his mother is dying.

I received it in the mail today and decided to send it back within 2 minutes. The tones (and that is being generous) are just terrible. I couldn't play any recognizable tune with them at all. If you're child is into banging, try a drum or another xylophone. The Tap a Tune Xylophone by Little Tykes gets fairly good reviews and is less expensive.

But the sound quality of the keys is horrible. First of all, the keys are wooden not metal like most xylophones--which is okay, but the product doesn't mention this and the picture is a little misleading. The red key and the orange key sound the same,and the other three make hollow, plunky sounds. Instead, I recommend the Grover 8 Note Children's Xylophone (www.giardinelli.com) if you like metal keys and the 8 Note Wooden Children's Xylophone (www.grothmusic.com) if you prefer wooden keys.

Not only that, but there was about an inch of bare string exposed which looks ridiculous. I have tried to exchange it or get a refund but it has been difficult to do so far. I would also prefer 6 keys.I would buy this toy, even as it is, over a plastic toy any day though. I do not feel the need to deplete the worlds petroleum resources any further, or expose my child to petroleum products such as plastic.I think that wood is a million times better for building toys out of than is plastic. It lasts longer and is so much healthier. I saw the Wonderworld Eco-Friendly Neo Xylophone which looks like it might be better, although I have not seen it. I might try to exchange this toy for that one. Too bad it is only 5 keys too though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorgeous looking. Terrible Xylophone.","review":"We got given this as a gift for our son's 1st birthday. I was so excited as the colors were so vibrant and design very modern. However as soon as I tried to show him how to play it I was bitterly disappointed. It couldn't play any music - not even Three Blind Mice! There's no proper scale. Makes a great drum/bashing toy, but terrible for actual musical purposes. So I guess it really depends on what you're looking for - bashing toy (buy) or musical instrument (don't buy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan Toy FAILURE. Go for the metal variety.","review":"I love Plan Toys but this one is a failure. It's irresponsibly designed in that the keys are random pitches, rather then ascending and descending tones. Other than how to bang on things, I'm not sure what Plan Toys is trying to teach children with this toy. Sure it's cute, but go for the metal, pitch perfect variety if you want any educational value. That'll hold an older toddler's attention as he or she grows and keep that developing brain engaged and enticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at, but not to play","review":"We were given this xylophone as a gift, and though it's very nicely made, the wooden keys just aren't very musical.

This toy is useless as an instrument-the wood keys look and feel nice but the difference in pitch is almost undetectable- all keys seem to make a flat hollow wood sound (sort of like you're knocking on a hollow door), no matter which key you strike. The keys are suspended on an elasticized twine-like line, and are not rigid as the image might suggest-this contributes to the poor sound quality and also makes the piece feel a little flimsy, though I will give it credit for being quite strong (my daughter likes to sit on it). It basically feels like a fake out instrument.

This one is not tuned to any scale and has minimal musical quality. It's visually soft and pretty, the keys bounce in an interesting way, as they're suspended on elastic strings, and the sound will not hurt your ears, but the tones are random. Also the head of the mallet fits into the one-year-old's mouth, so he popped it in and started tottering around; that is not safe. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never too early to interest a baby in musicality","review":"Excellent well-made toy for toddlers. Giving a baby an \\"ear for music\\" is a great gift.

My son does love the drum stick that came with it and uses it on all the other wood pieces we have for him, and actually on everything he can bang around on.Pros - it looks pretty and the \\"drum stick\\" is of good quality. The wood pieces appear to be durable, but that's it.Cons - it's not musical (which was the main reason for wanting something like this), with the way a child plays it doesn't look like the wood pieces will stay in place for very long (my son loves to bang on his toys and treat them pretty roughly)Would I recommend this to others - no, not at all, even fisher price (although plastic) has a more musical sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't play well","review":"This \\"xylophone\\" is super cute and stylish.

The environment that the author proceeds from in this book is too limited to make it useful as a real-world guilde to process reengineering.Comments like, \\"A business is a collection of processes\\" can be seen as a valid point, however, discounting the employees and relegating them to the status of mindless automatons limits the usefulness of this book to a Business 101 class.On a positive note, the author makes a good point that businesses need to review the processes they use and ensure that they are accomplishing these processes in the most efficient manner possible.While the book could be used for building the case for process engineering/re-engineering, there are better books available for the nuts and bolt of actually doing the process changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT and how it's SUPPOSED to work.","review":"The book brings to light what IT is SUPPOSED to be doing... helping the business be profitable... not a money pit.

While it only provides a cursory view of TQM, I think it's better point is the philosophy of what IT should be doing for a business.

Though I'd go back to Guilds in a heart beat if I could find them.The packaging, a whole set in a plastic bag as opposed to the paper envelopes, makes it easier to get the strings in and out.

But I've stuck with them for the following reasons:�?They're extremely reliable �?I can't remember the last time I had a dud string.�?Their sound is excellent and they last a long time.�?They settle in extremely quickly (this is a biggie for a professional musician).�?They have eco-friendly packaging.I use J16s on my folk guitar, which is a Taylor 510. In standard tuning they're fine; but when I drop the bass string to D (which I do a lot), it tends to go sharp when fretted. So I replace this set's .053 with a .056. Were I playing in DADGAD all the time (which I feel more and more inclined to do), I would use Pierre Bensusan's stringing, which is (according to hisfirst video) .056, .042, .032, .023, .017 & .013."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strings for a Gibson Songwriter","review":"I have been searching for a set of strings that have great low end and are lighted enough to play solo's high on the neck.

The first I stretched and let sit over the course of 20 minutes, tuning up and down. After it broke I then strung the other two guitars strings and I let them sit over night. Tried to tune them up to E this morning and both broke. The other strings seem fine but the tension on the Low E was recognizably higher. Very disappointed.

These are warm and round, but not quite what I'm aiming for. Is it the guitar? I had a set on it once that sounded fantastic, but can't remember what they were, so I'm searching. Yes, I know, \\"get a Martin\\" or \\"get a Taylor\\", but I like the Seagull - loads of bang for the buck!

It was funny but also taught me a lesson that how I act when no one is around is as important as the way I act in a crowded board room. Dr. Dobson has lived a life of faith and obedience and this book shares practical leadership tips that will help anyone, from CEO's to fathers who want their children to have a life of integrity.

Paul Batura is able to give a insiders view to the founder, Dr. James Dobson, in a way that puts flesh on the voice heard on radio. When you're done reading the book, you come away with definite themes that are important to Dr. Dobson with the most important one being \\"be there\\" which communicates the importance of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in light of the story to his son, Ryan after the death of Pete Maravich.

He presents an opportunity to spend time in Dr. Dobson's office and share in the personal details of managing an organization revered by millions upon millions of listeners. In the process he reveals the management styles he observed and has distilled into 19 practical principles that are enough to make the book worthwhile. Fascinating reading plus one to keep for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks For the Peek Inside!","review":"*Gadzooks* is an excellent look at what really happens inside the Executive Wing of Focus on the Family, up close to Dr. Dobson. It is not another biography -- to be honest, we don't need another of those right now, the story is still being written! But having seen Focus both from the outside and the inside, I can vouch that Mr. Batura's impressions ring true. This is not a brown-nosed attempt of a policy assistant to please his boss. This is an account of some principles that all of us could stand to live by. The book reads easily and contains some keen humor -- a must! I think it will be most popular among those who have some experience with Focus and want to see inside -- but there's something in here for nearly anyone!Reg Finger"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fly on The Wall","review":"People talk about being \\"a fly on the wall\\" as observing a curious situation or person. I felt like that while reading this book, getting an insider's perspective of an interesting person that I'll probably never get to sit down with or get to know. Great practical takeaway value too. Paul has an upfront, innocent writing style that is fresh and draws me into his stories. He sounds like a sports fan relishing stories about his favorite ballplayer.

When I receieved a copy of Gadzooks! to review I was pleasantly surprised by this author's articulation of timeless wisdom.Instead of writing about concepts and theories developed in the halls of academia, he has shared with readers real life, practical application of leadership principles from an insiders perspective.Too often authors interview CEOs to ask their opinion on what makes a great leader and as a result we end up with packaged opinions.On the other hand, the stories this author shares are from eyewitness accounts of true leadership in action. This book will inspire and encourage any executive who is leading others in business and remind them that leadership is in the walk, not the talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gadzooks! A Christian leader worth emulating","review":"This is not your typical leadership book.

I saw this book and thought \\"what a great idea!\\" After reading the introduction and first few selections, I knew there was an agenda floating about. There are run-on sentences all throughout the book, and his overwhelming personal bias is just too hard to look past. Had this book been called \\"The 100 books I think are important, by M. Smith,\\" then I could have dealt with this better.Alas..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I waste my money?","review":"I recently purchased a large set of the classics and I wanted a companion book that would give me short educational insight to many of the works. I quickly realized this book was a poor choice. The author made every attempt to tear down the Christian faith, many times by promoting the heretical beliefs of the Gnostics. He also pointlessly tried to denegrate the divinely insprired relationship between the Old and New Testaments. These are just some of many ideas propagated which disturbed me. I realize my disgust with the book may be a result of my personal beliefs being called into question, however, the author seems to have very strong beliefs also. Unfortunately, his beliefs appear to be based in utter disdain for the Christian faith; usually the result of a life of spiritual denial. My beliefs, however, are the results of a changed life and eternal hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-Semitic garbage","review":"Seymour-Smith deserves one stars for at least trying to tactical the issue of a top 100 book-list review. However, his failure to list a man's book whom put my aunt in the Warsaw Ghetto and started WWII, Adolf Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf,\\" makes Seymour-Smith's book reek of anti-Semiticism.How somebody can forget a book that lead to the desecration(the \\"Holocaust\\"), of the 6 million covenanted ones, is unexplainable and unjustifiable. How can we \\"never forget\\" if the book is not there to review, Mr. Seymour-Smith?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"If you're gnostic or New Ager, you'll love this book. It will reinforce your concepts and ideas with no material evidence. However, if you're atheist, jew, muslim, christian, whatever, you'll regret of having bought this book.Instead of reviewing the ideas and posting a brief story of the life of the 100 most influential books of mankind authors, Mr. Seymour-Smith exposes his own thoughts and beliefs about these 100 books. He does not quote any bibliographic citations. He does not follow any scientific criteria to list a book and not to list another one.In other words, this is an excelent book to learn what Mr. Seymour-Smith thinks -- and I was not interested on it at all. But it's not a digest of the most influential books of mankind, as the title suggests.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is not so much about the CONTENT, but rather the INFLUENCE of \\"The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written\\". It was not what I expected/hoped for. That said, the author's rather subjective opinions (and diatribes against academics, historians, ...) made it hard for me to separate the author's views from more widely accepted interpretations of these 100 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: pompous author.","review":"Ditto the \\"pompous\\" label from other reviewers. Also, you would hope that the author would be a little more impartial, but his admiration of Gnosticism (including strong favor of Kaballah and Judaeo-Christian-based Gnosticism with scorn of Old Testament and New Testament) and esoterica is blatant, adding bias.Despite pomposity and bias, this book does have value as a nice list of reknown works, including Eastern works (I Ching, etc.), and notable non-fiction including science (Popper, etc) and economics (Smith, Keynes), as well as Western staples (Homer, Aristotle, Dante, etc). The brief review of each work often (but not always) portrays the work's value, so it is a nice guide to browse. However, it is not encyclopedic, so for those purposes, Wikipedia will serve better.There must be better guides to the best works of the humanities. Unless the price is right, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's personal agenda too evident","review":"I usually greatly enjoy this type of book but the author's blatant bias against Christianity and his obsession with gnosticsm made this book unreadable to me. I felt he chose books well, with interesting reasons behind his choices and he provided a good history about the author and the book. However, almost every section had some rant about how evil the Church is and how put up on the poor gnostics were. Puh-lease. I don't want to know about this. Truly, it robbed me of my ability to focus on what the book was about and confused me as I was trying to focus on the issue at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historian with a muddled agenda","review":"The author spends far too much time defending his choices against invisible enemies (bureaucrats being a favored target) and far little time on the content and its influence. One imagines his editor overlooking the worst of what made it into the book out of sheer exhaustion, unwilling to bring another battle to bear. Consider this ridiculous summation of his entry on Homer: \\"...and already the robot-clerks who, with plastic identification buttons on their lapels[gasp!], plan curricula, have no place for them [his works]. Only when it is pointed out to them that sales of Homer have made money for hundreds of years do their dead eyes seem to glint.\\" What a dope."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most irritating book i have ever read!","review":"Well, the title of this review tells everything.

After reading it, you will NOT understand:a) What was written in the \\"famous\\" book?b) Why the book was so important?But you will understand:a) What author of this book \\"thinks\\" about the famous author.3. There is no bibliography4. Author, evidently is not a philosopher, nor theolog, nor physician, but anyway he has his \\"own\\" on everything.What I wait from a book like this is:1.

But what hurts the most is Seymour-Smith's arrogance that grows into plain stupidity on his reviews and method of selection(not to mention coward attacks on defenseless popular authors).I never bought a book written by such a malignant mind.

However, nothing could be further from the truth, however the adventures of the boys are thus chronicled.The stories were pretty good and it was entertaining.

It's nice to hear a band that actually takes the time to let a jam build and grow before just going for the money notes. It may be just me, but I feel like this new stuff is worlds better than the old stuff. The music seems to have more spirituality and complexity than it did on other discs I've listened to. To back it up, there are some great performances by Blackalicious and Joe Satriani!!

By the way you can remove the tensioner pully with out removing anything but you have to jack it up and reach the back side with a 15mm socket swival and extension.

OEM idler and tensioner pulleys are smooth and nothing keeps the belt from moving sideways. This conversion has grooved pulleys that hold belt in place. Note: You will need to jack up vehicle and get underneath it to install the tensioner pulley. Nut that holds it on is easily accessible from the bottom. I also used a crowsfoot wrench with long breaker bar to move tensioner pulley far enough to install new belt. It seems to be a tighter fit than the OEM belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"I have had problems with the Serpentine belt for years and saw this solution and ordered it.

Chrysler's kit may have metal pulleys but it will cost about $100.00 more. The pulleys in this kit may be plastic but they have high flanges. High Flanges make it a bit of a challenge to get the belt on but it gives you confidence that the belt will not fall off. My wife drove 4000 miles in less than 2 weeks immediately after I installed the kit in our 98 Grand Caravan and then some since. She met up with some water conditions that put the kit to the test.

Unplugged it and let it set for a month or so, when we plugged it back in it reset and worked for about a week and then went out again. Expected better from Sony. While it was working loved the convenience of being able to watched recorded programs on DVD, but was a little frustrated with the time it took for the thing to load, prepare to record, and write, etc. Couldn't just pop it in and start recording like with a VHS. Will need to find another one to replace it with.

After 1 year the \\"welcome\\" message came on and never went back off. Even after unplugging it for days it still wouldn't go off after I plugged it back in. No buttons worked even the power button didn't work. I called Sony and they told me it would need to be repaired by shipping it to a service center thousands of miles away. On my dime of course. Funny thing is this unit died just months after the warranty expired.It's junk. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good-Quality, Versatile Unit","review":"I bought this DVD recorder mainly because it supported the double-layer discs, which enable you to record for over two hours at highest quality. It's a good companion product to my Tivo S3 hi-def unit. I can archive shows and movies I want to save directly to the Sony. Granted, everything is through the analog ports, but the quality is good 'nuf.Like most of these machines, you do have to read the owner's manual to figure out all the ins and outs, but that's a small price to pay.The only nitpick I have about this machine is the interface to title discs is rather cumbersome, but no biggie. The other concern is just how durable this machine will be. I've read other reviews that said it stopped functioning after several months. So we'll see.Update: This unit fully failed after about a year of use. I feel that Sony quality has really gone downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DVD recorder","review":"This a nice product and easy to hook up. I have had the unit for two weeks.

Chalk up another Victorian heavy breather to a simplistic storyline that finds the Anglo-English virgin the center of yet another cloistered harem fantasy in which the white women rule the roost. And what a roost, Ava Gardner as the first wife, aging but still beautiful, she is second banana to Cherie Lughi and Nancy Travers -- in their dreams! The evil rooster in the competitive hen house is Omar Shariff, a waste of talent as is Gardner. Art Malik manages to bring some humor and dignity to the role of stereotypic eastern male, but again, the mindset that brought this film to the screen is dated. Not one for the video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Triumph","review":"After reading the other reviews of this movie, I realized that either it was beloved or hated; nothing in between. And that's OK! If you love movies with wide, sweeping scenes, storylines that draw you in and keep you there, stories with lead characters who display loyalty, courage, love, and integrity, then this is for you. If you don't, then go watch a mindless action flick. Sure this movie is a bit implausible, but that's how we want it, don't we? That's why movies are escapist fantasies. That's why we go to the movies, isn't it? Otherwise, go watch a documentary. If you want to dream and escape for a while--then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic film","review":"I saw this film when I was a young girl. But it always stayed in my head.

Hmm More Like A Back Spin","review":"This is hard pill to digest. While this is somewhat of an intriguing story, the acting falls flat. Scarlett Johansson, who is a beautiful woman, was so not convincing in this movie. In fact, her character was the of the worst in the film. The lead actor, Jonathan Rhys Myers was a close second. The opera-tennis combo theme (which was odd to say the least) did nothing for the story. After the first 30 minutes, all tennis playing was over. The operas and opera music was far too stylish for such a bland group of actors. None of them captured the sleek, seductive, and risky behavior their characters displayed. There was also a substantial amount of predictability in the slow moving plot (Infidelity, lust, murder, wealth, etc. - seems like it's been done before, only better). The only thing that saves this movie is the anticipation to know the ending, but that too seemed to be lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Woody","review":"I loved Matchpoint.

He is typically mediocre at best....Annie Hall references abound...Annie Hall IMO is just ok...nothing special and I think that Sleeper is ok too...but just ok. However, I loved Matchpoint.

I kept trying to convince my companion that the good part was coming - but it never arrived.While it was not necessarily predictable, it wasn't that complex either - there was either option A or option B and there was nothing about the character that made you care one way or another.

Bumbling police, contrived coincidences and a whiny Scarlet Johannsen add up to one tedious film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Tragedy meets Crime and Punishment","review":"Execellent photography and scenes. Mediocre content.This story line transparently mimics Dreiser's American Tragedy as rewritten and released by Hollywood in 1951 as A Place in the Sun. Allen mocks the perpetual struggle between good and evil in the bewildering conscience-absolving comparison to good luck and bad. Do the gods punish the act? The intent? Or leave all to chance?PS: Re the casting. I do prefer Scarlett for believable sizzle rather than Shelley Winters in the 1951 edition, though Shelley the actress by herself to this day outshines any of these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less.

Now after watching the 2 hour and four minute film, my thoughts on the movie are slightly tainted. I very much enjoyed the devilish plot, teeming with scandal and suspense, but the conclusion just didn't sit well with me. The ending seemed completely cold to me. I didn't get any resolution whatsoever. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' character was the most complex and complicated to understand, even though his actions were quite predictable (I saw the whole 'murder & robbery' play out in my mind twenty minutes before it happened). Aside from the ending, I very much enjoyed the movie. The acting was just stupendous, preferably in regards to Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I do recomend this movie to those who love a good scandalous drama, but be aware the ending is still very scandalous, however unsatisfying it may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a surprising thriller","review":"You know when Woody Allen puts out a film, you can't wait to see what it's about.

Watching this movie was one of the most morally soiling cinematic experiences of my life.The main character is about as evil as they come. He marries for money, then starts a needless affair with a beautiful blonde, gets her pregnant, and when she acts as almost any woman would act under the circumstances, he murders her. In the process, he also murders her totally innocent neighbor to make it look like a drug rampage. And he gets away with it. And the movie manipulates us to root for him as he does all of this. I was so angry after I watched this that I was almost beside myself.As I say, Allen should be in prison, not making movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read this before...","review":"While watched the movie could not escape the thought that once before the sequence of the same events was captured by Theodore Dreiser in \\"An American Tragedy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible copy of Crimes & Misdemeanors","review":"The only people who seem to like this film are people that are not Woody Allen fans. Because if you were, you would realize this is an incredibly poor copy of his previous work, Crimes & Misdemeanors, which was in turns funny, thoughtful, suspenseful, etc. Allen's works obviously do repeat many of the same themes, but Match Point is literally more of a derivative work. Even if this were a new film, it's terribly flawed. The viewer isn't trusted at all to understand the issues of the story, and so themes and images are featured in a highly repetitious manner. (One scene I especially hated was a closeup of a tennis ball straddling the net and eventually tipping to illustrate the theme of chance, which had already come up numerous times...) Disappointing. BTW, the people are better looking than in Crimes, but everyone keeps their clothes ON, so don't get too excited.

Rhys-Myers, I have decided is only capable of simluating sex. Whether here or in the Tudors it's pretty much the same.

No single character deserves empathy. they are all scumbags in every sense of the word and as soon as the movie is over (If we can call it an ending) we don't really care what happens to any of them.

It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great. She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing. 2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Still, in a vacuum, one of the better films of 2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"No happy end-","review":"Woody Allen seems to have struck gold \\"across the pond.\\" And his leading actress, Scarlet Johanson,is very convincing as a gold digger, down-on her-luck actress, desperate pregnant cast-off of yet another gold digger, only this one male, in a twisted plot that takes us through twists and turns and ends up with our principle male shrouded in guilt and the stunner of the movie lying dead.

This is almost the exact same plot as \\"crimes and misdemeanors\\" - sex, infidelity, and expedient murder to save an empty homelife - but it is flat, humorless, and has no intriguing or sympathetic characters; one of the great delights in earlier Allen films were the character-based asides, vivid glmipses into (largely new yorkish) lives, but they are absent from this film. Allen also is out of place in England, which is a very different society than the US, and his portrayal of its elite has no depth beyond well-trod formulas of priviledge based on hard work. Finally, the acting is wooden and unsubtle, very disappointing. I think this is the worst film by Allen I have ever seen.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an Improvement Over Allen's Comedies.","review":"While my title is true, it's still as overrated by the critics as all his irritatingly bad comic flicks. It wasn't boring, and I found the plot engaging enough. The trouble? You could see the ending coming a mile away, and the more the story went on, the more despicable Johnathan Rhys Meyers' character Chris became. Maybe this was a comedy, because Allen actually expects people too root for someone this shallow and evil? Another case in point is that the police working on the murder of his mistress Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and the poor, innocent lady downstairs conducted the sloppiest detective work since Jon Bonet Ramsey. The girl at the boutique who knew about Nola seeing Chris, and the man he banged into on the street after committing the crime were never questioned? Worst of all is the ending.

A couple of nice touches here and there and some good actors totally wasted. Non-actor Johansson really brought down the grading curve. She's terrible! She was terrible in Ghost World and she was even worse in Lost in Translation. Sure, she may be maturing as a woman, but she sure needs acting lessons.Critics!

The \\"high class\\" backdrop, tennis parallels and allure of Johansson at the center or a romantic tangle all pointed to an intriguing ride.But the plot pace is glacial even for me, the story predictable and the themes and characters inconsistent. The tennis touches are largely forgotten a third of the way in, Jonhansson's character develops unevenly and in jumps, and there are several glaring plot holes as things progress. There was some question as to how things would end, but by then most of my interest had fled and the resolution was flat regardless.I am not very familiar with the works of Woody Allen and thus could not compare this with his other films. If that's part of the appeal I could be missing something, but overall for me Match Point unfortunately turned out rather disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Match Point","review":"I had seen this movie in the theater when it first came out and really liked it.

Meaning that he has once more copied himself. All the moral issues depicted in this movie were already in Crimes and Misdemeanors (CM), which truly is one of his best movies and was also much deeper and much better acted. This movie is just CM in London, without its moral depth, its great script and its great actors. Allen is just re-doing himself with better-looking actors. The use of soundtrack in Match Point is the only really redeeming feature of this point. The observation that small random events can affect our lives in important ways is certainly true but is hardly new and not so well exploited here. The best thing of this movie probably remain Scarlet Johansson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This one is supposed to be a psychological sexy thriller.... I think. It drags from the start and the director (I suppose he's the culprit) vainly attempts to mislead and eventually surprise the viewer at the outset with a tennis ball which hits the top of the net (ergo, the match point theme), and later, linking this little caveat to a wedding ring of a murdered girl which hits a railing (ZZzzzzzzzzz.......). Anyway, it's all about an immoral tennis instructor who gets himself into a menage-a-trois of sorts, and whom chooses murder (shocking!) as a resolution to his love problems (and his financial ones too). If you use cinema as a means of battling insomnia, and you need some background noise in order to nap, this one might work for you.

Scarlett Johanssen is just awful, as is Jonathan Ryce-Myers. Both seems to be sleep walking through this film. I love opera, but Woody has done his best in this film to turn people off of it. This story has been done before about a cad trying to reach the top by marrying a wealthy heiress while chasing after a would-be actress, with no scruples whatsoever.No surprises in this film, only surprise at how boring Woody Allen's movies are and how non-talented actresses like Johanssen can rise to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vicious Love Story","review":"I'll admit that I'm not a fan of Woody Allen at all, so when I found out this was one of his movies I was shocked.

They did it perfectly. The plot of the story moved at a good pace, though some things I would have left out, and the ending was something I did not expect at all.

I have to admit the lack of references was disappointing as at times writer opinion versus fact were questionable. A majority of the chapters did offer interesting insight and tried to look at either popular misconceptions or myths surrounding the subjects.

Opp.1-7 were published by Estienne Roger in Amsterdam. The later opus numbers, of which this is one, were published by Le Cene in Amsterdam. The first four concertos of Op.8 are frequently played together or individually as they comprise The Four Seasons. This was not by any means the first \`programme music' but it is certainly an early example, long before the Romantic era. This recording on Philips is by I Musici with Felix Ayo and Maria Teresa Garatti as soloists. I like this recording for both the warm string tone of the playing and the judicious tempi. There is none of the exaggerated tempi of some of the more recent recordings by the younger violinists or the rather dry tone of recordings on \`original instruments'."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting to watch","review":"A little confusing with snipits that don't really make that much sense.

Before the first Gulf War, he was assigned to a one of a kind military organization, quite unlike anything which most career soldiers will ever experience. The opportunities that assignment gave him for travel and interaction with the locals, lead to a unique perspective on that period of history. Coupling his rare view of events with his sense of humor, he has used his gift for writing to produce an accurate account of events which is fun and easy to read. Most soldiers never have the opportunity to find themselves in the sort of situations that Stanton writes about.

Granted as an Army officer also present during the invasion there is no doubt that his two days of observation were interesting but hardly of any strategic value. Two days in the Sheraton and then a human sheild is all very good, and makes a good story for an officer who knowingly entered a country purely for self gain. The books reflects how a individual who has used a circumstance to self promote himself.

The interpretation of the arias is excellent and quite invigorating. All the soloists bring the arias to life.The conductor, Sir Colin Davis, provides us with a very energetic performance of this work. Crisp, bright and vivacious is the interpretation of the Messiah by Sir Colin!It is by far the best recording of this work I have ever heard.

While it may be nuanced and even, it lacks passion, grandeur and any sense of the sacred, and has little narrative drive. The Choruses, except for the Hallelujah Chorus, have little majesty. There is also something wrong with the sound mix. I can't quite put my finger on it but somehow the bass-treble balance is just off. I tried the special anniversary 24 bit rerelease and found that the sound of it was, oddly enough, even worse. I would instead very highly recommend Sir Colin Davis' other recording of The Messiah, with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra.

This is by far the best blend of sound quality, smooth bass and a complete sound range.I can very easily hear a difference in compressed audio and CD/DVD audio; the sound quality is that good. I use these mostly for music and occasionaly for DVDs. They are suitable for any music, hip-hop trance, rocks, jazz...you name it. The bass is never overwhelming and the mid range sounds are perfectly produced.My recommendation is this: try not to fall into marketing and pricing.

They remind me of my old VW rabbit. When it worked it was an awesome car, but it had one problem after another. The same can be said for these speakers. The subs on both sets failed, and got severely distorted sound. The quality of these speakers has spoken for themselves. ****CHEAP**** They obviously have a serious reliability problem, as suggested by many other customer's reviews, but what is worse, after spending $350 on the two sets, Klipsch will not recall them, and wants me to spend another $40 each to fix the subwoofers. That's great customer service. Don't buy this junk. I have since bought a set of Logitech z-2200 speakers (THX rated) for about $100 and could not be happier. They are built much better, and sound fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"I've owned my Klipsh Promedia 2.1 speakers for just under two years. The performance has been very good, up until today. The system just stopped working and the green power light did not come on. I found the main fuse blown and replaced it with a new fuse, which also immediately blew. I then disassemble the sub unit and performed trouble shooting. I discovered that the main transformer has an internal short. This is not something I can repair, other than to try and find a replacement transformer, which will be nearly impossible. I've used Klipsh speakers for years in my home theater system and they've been great. However, to have these Promedia's fail so quickly, and after they are out of warranty, is extremely disappointing. I've been willing to pay the extra premium for Klipsch products due to their great reputation and sound quality. However, after reading about all the failures of this model, and now experiencing one myself, my confidence in this company is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Sounds great, when it works. I've replaced the sub-woofer or various parts the customer service has sent me for the sub-woofer four times in less than a year. Once it blew out several circuits in my house. As many of the reviews indicate, the lack of a power shutoff switch and other internal problems make these very unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two bad on plugs","review":"Just others have commented.

I did expect to get more quality and use out of these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after less than 24 hours.","review":"I picked these up while they were on sale at a retail store. I was really impressed with the sound quality and was looking forward to using it to play some games. Unfortunately, when I got home from work the next day, the speakers were stuck on full volume and were playing white noise. They still played audio from a source, but the static was always audible and I could not change the volume. I had to return them. This was my first experience with Klipsch, and I had high expectations given their reputation, but I was very disappointed. I'll probably give them another chance in the future, but not without considering competing products first."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Klipsch :o)","review":"I first fell in love with Klipsch in the 80s when I purchased a set of Klipsch Cornwall II speakers. I was expecting good things from them for a computer speaker system but was blown away by the ProMedia 2.1s. Highs and mids are crystal clear and BIG. Bass booms, a little more than I am use to, so I backed the sub off a little until it was what I wanted. These speakers are more than I expected am am more than satisfied with their performance thus far. These are high quality speakers both in sound output and construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Speakers Rock !!","review":"How can anyone not rate these speakers 5.+ They are only [...] tops and these speakers rock. Best speakers i ever heard for a oomputer, BUY NOW>."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks mids","review":"The Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers deliver excellent highs and impressive bass, but lack the mid tones essential to so much music. While the speakers sound great for movies, TV shows, rap, and pop music, they certainly require EQ adjustment when listening to rock, jazz, and country. They aren't bad speakers, but my room mate's Logitech speakers are more veritile and don't require the adjustments. If I could do it over again, I would have gone with the Logitech Z-2300.Update: After roughly 4 years of use (very heavy the first two years, and very light the next two years due to a move with a different setup), these speakers no longer work. Something has happened with the main connection from the sub to the satellite. I downgraded the rating to 2 stars, because for the money I feel like they should have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounding but didn't last long...","review":"I bought the Klipsch 2.1 speakers about 2 years ago to replace my old Yamaha (YST-MSW10); they sounding great until about a week ago! It looks as though I'll have to pull the Yamahas back out of storage. The sub-woofer in the Klipschs comes in and out every 5 minutes or so (must be a short some where?). I've checked all external connections and they are fine. When the sub-woofer goes in and out of producing a sound it gives off a 'scratchy' sound that sounds awful. I too use surge protectors and never turn the volume up past half-way, so the problem shouldn't be from misuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... when they work","review":"I am on my second set of these speakers now. They sound great when they work but after two failed sets I give up. On my first set the amp failed and just continually blew fuses as soon as it was turned on. On the second set my left channel has gone out for some reason. Replacing the fuse for that channel does nothing, something must be fried on the board itself.Avoid if you want a set of speakers that will last for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of faulty right channel","review":"Got the speakers brand new and could not get the + - wires from the speaker to fit flush into right channel clamps. Returned the product, got it working for about two albums, sounded great, but then the same problem occurred. I guess the wires became dislodged somehow. I tried to plug them back into the clamp and could not pick up any sound. I tried getting in contact with sales reps at Klipsch and they could not help me. I find myself back in the market looking for new speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound,But","review":"The klipsch 2.1 Have magnificent sound quality after tampering with it a bit,Its obviously made more with music in mind tho,To hear voices over based clealy had to do alot of tampering unless i was playing music,Movies will sound great with propper positioning and volume to sub tampering,And lastly regardless of the work you have to put in for certain media to get voices to pop thru the bass this system is one of the best for pc hands down,But have a cheap backup in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Speakers!!!!!!!","review":"I bought these for my friend that has aerobics gym.

However I never expected the enormous sound that effortlessly flows from the ProMedia 2.1 system. I feel these little speakers just blow away any similar systems that I have heard. The bottom end has to be heard to be believed. This is an unqualified recommendation to drop the buck and one-half and procure these little gems. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Setup","review":"A very inexpensive way for great sound from any source. the klipsch 2.1 thx is very stable with no buzzing or humming while in idle use. i've had mine for 6 months now and not one problem. enough bass to raddle the silverware in my kitchen drawer. a remote option would have been great but the price is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, won't stick around","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, my DIN plug is fine. But after 2 years everything else is cooked. First, the wire clips running off the subwoofer broke. Then the subwoofer blew out completely. I replaced the sub, but now one of the satellites has loud static. Don't know if I should even bother replacing it.UPDATE:I spoke too soon-- later in the same day as I wrote the original review, the DIN broke. Don't tempt the fates! ...and don't buy Klipsch Krap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klipsch ProMedia 2.1","review":"As for the sound, this is the best 3-piece computer speaker system you can get. Its simple to setup and works flawlessly.As for the bad...They've improved the main cable (preamp input) a bit, but it still could be so much better. The fact that you can't turn the sub-woofer off, that's another head scratcher.Klipsch builds great speakers, can't say that they know much about computers and those that use them.I'd recommend these if you need a 3-piece system and want excellent sound reproduction, no coloring, no fake highs or lows, just what the artist was trying to create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounding spaker!","review":"The system sounds pretty darn good, and I'm very happy with it! Good base response! Classical music sounds good with good highs and good lows with little distortion. Rock music too sounds excellant too! The Base is solidly built and has some weight to it. The only thing that that I would say that I don't like is, that speakers pop with you turn the unit on. This happens even with the sound turn all the way down. The quality of the sound makes up for the initial pop you get. This could just be this unit and not any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic high-end PC speakers","review":"Fantastic PC speakers to upgrade from basic speakers, especially if you need a sub for games and music. THX certified and they sound great. Volume control and sub level are built into the right speaker. My problems with these speakers are few. (1) Speaker cables appear to be tin and not copper. One end is a 3mm plug and would be hard to replace. (2) Interconnect to sound card is fixed inside the speaker which means you can't replace it either. (3) One cable to left speaker but 3 cables to right one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good company bad product","review":"Speakers are ok but the sub refuses to work.

They aren't as awesome as my Optimus 15\\" 3-way towers plugged into a 20-year old SONY receiver... but they're good. Great highs and lows. I've got the bass knob pointed to \\"9:30\\" - any higher and it's just too much bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Speakers Out There","review":"Honestly I have never heard music be so perfect out of only a 3 piece set. Absolutely the best speakers on the market and they are a bit expensive, but well worth it. Not only is the sound flawless, but the durability is outstanding. Ive had mine through countless parties and such over the past 3 years, and they still sound just as good as the first day.

This system sounds AMAZING!Purchase this, no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PC Audio for the Price","review":"I spent months looking for the best speakers, and I was not disappointed when I finally made this purchase. I am no audiophile, so the sound this system produces sounds fantastic. The speakers can get very loud too, and I often joke that my suitemates will kick me out of the dorm if I ever play them too loudly.Voice and instruments are exceptionally clear, and the bass fills the entire room. If you are no audiophile, end your search here and buy these speakers.My only complaint is that there is no power button at all. I either have to leave the speakers plugged in, or unplug them if I want to stop them from using vamp power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy for the Money","review":"Excellent speakers.

Bad customer service","review":"I bought this because I am a musician and an audiophile. I wanted the best and was willing to pay 150 dollars at BB.because of the high end price I figured it would be bullet proof and blow my mind like Bose. Unfortunately, It was very mediocre and the Mid's sucked. it was not made for Rock music.Conveniently after 2 years, the speaker shorted out. I payed 30 dollars from the main website to replace the speaker wire. Then after it came, I found out that the amp was Blown and the repair man said it would be 200-250 dollars to fix. What a waste man. I ended up having BB just recycle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! sound","review":"Highly recommended. The BEST computer speakers I have heard (and I love music.)

I would say that I am completely very satisfied with this product. Whenever I play my music and movies (THX movies sound great...it's like you're in a movie theater!!!), the sound is awesome. Setting up the speakers was so easy. The only thing that I wish it would have is putting the power switch somewhere else rather than having it behind the subwoofer; I'd have to reach down to turn on/off the speaker system. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this speakers to anyone...since the sound is AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Picked up this little system based on the reviews and the price. I was kind of skeptical, I looked at the comparable bose system, but didn't want to shell out the extra 100 bones. This little 2.1 is an excellent value for what it is. The 3\\" woofs have more throat (mid range) than I figured they would, which is a good thing. It did take some fussing with the an EQ to make the system shine. If you want more, go to a receiver and floor speakers (my initial intentions, but I'm saving it for later). Overall good sound so far (first few hours), we'll see how it holds up. I'd recommend it for anybody looking for a good 2.1, just make sure you have a decent sound card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, some issues","review":"This should actually be 3.5 stars. After having the speakers for over a year, I've noticed two things: 1-the front cover on one of the speakers seems to have somehow warped. It's plastic, so I don't know how that happened, but it doesn't fit properly, with a gap of a half inch at the top. The other issue is the lack of a power button. This I do not understand. What electronic device doesn't have a power button? It's obviously a ghost drag on my electric bill since it can't be turned off.Now for the good: the sound is excellent. I have neighbors, so I don't often crank these, but when I do they sound great. The bass is awesome. Whether it's an Audioslave CD or CastAway Bluray, the sound is impressive.I just wish those other issues were not present, as it makes them seem lower quality (though granted, they don't affect the sound quality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful crisp sound...worth every penny!","review":"Listened to friend's Harmon Kardon computer speaker system before this purchase. Loved the HK sound, but opted to try the Klipsch based on other reviews. This sub/speaker system has crisp sounds and tremendous bass on demand. My Onkyo in the living room is feeling competition from these tiny desktop speakers coming from my office! I'd recommend these over the comparable Harmon Kardon computer speakers any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great speakers, bad jacks.","review":"So I really love these speakers. I've bought 3 sets of them.The speakers are excellent with good sound throughout. The problem is that both the headphone jack and the subwoofer jack are of very poor quality. They will fail *far* before the otherwise great speakers. I don't move my speakers around, they sit in one spot. Yet somehow the jacks still manage to fail.I probably won't ever buy another set as I'm tired of getting rid of otherwise good speakers because the $5 jack failed.5 stars for sound Quality. 1 star for Equipment Quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound- great / quality - bad","review":"I have 2 of these systems. I have had to replace the entire control pod assembly (approx. $30 EACH)twice for each system due to the horrible DIN plugs.Despite treating them with extreme care, the DIN plugs will fail. In addition, the pods are usually out of stock at Klipsch. This is a real shame, since these speakers sound great when they work. Check out the Klipsch forum before you buy these - you will see all the problems people have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"These were by far the best computer speakers I have ever owned.However last night the left channel started to crackle, buzz, and pop. Then it died. A strong burning smell coming from the left speaker filled the room.I did a quick Google search, and I am not the only person to have this problem. Repair costs start at $75 plus shipping both ways, and local repair shops say it's not worth the fix. Unfortunately they are going in the trash tonight.While these speakers produced amazing sound quality, I cannot recommend purchasing them unless you plan on purchasing another set on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I purchased this to replace my flat panel Monsoons which died, they were very clean with excellent imaging so I was surprised that the Klipsch sound even better. Still don't know if being certified by THX means anything, even writing to THX produced little in technical specifications, but nice marketing. Long cables from the satellite speakers, and compact size plus a subwoofer that is solid down to its lower limit. Now, if all manufacturers would move the power switch function from the subwoofer to the satellite speaker with the volume control so it would be easier to turn off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Dead out of the box. I had fairly cruddy sound from these speakers in the R and L channels -- just nothing out of the sub, so the sound was terribly weak as you'd expect.For the price, I expected something that sounded better than my Insignias. I'm still looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor design.","review":"I can attest to the great sound quality of these speakers, if you are anything less than a finicky audiophile, you will be satisfied with the sound.Unfortunately, I can also attest to the horrible quality of construction, particularly the design of the din connector. If you try to place the sub-woofer under your desk (where it should be), the flimsy din connector, 'will' break. It juts out two inches from the back of the sub, if you brush it with your foot, or push it against the wall, your speakers are done. I am convinced that this is the cause of many of the failure complaints.This happened to me of course, and I spent 20$ on a replacement \\"control pod\\" directly from the klipsch website. What I got was a model with the same defective design, even though newer models had addressed this design flaw, and were fully compatible with my speakers. After the din connector broke on the second control pod (about a months usage) I gave up.Good sound.Bad design.Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound - while it lasts","review":"I've owned two pairs of these speakers over the last 6 years. Both pairs eventually lost enough fidelty to become practically worthless. This happens when the main connection from the subwoofer becomes so loose that sound has a lot of static or is entirely absent on one side. Klipsch knows of this issue - just search their online forums - but will only fix it if the product is still under their warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but the subwoofers apparently highly prone to failure","review":"I had been using this speaker set for a bit over a year and had been very satisfied with the sound quality. One of the best, IMO (although my new HK Soundsticks have since won me over). However, a couple months ago the subwoofer failed on me, for reasons I don't yet know. I was considering having it repaired or just buying a new Klipsch set, but a little Googling turned up some forum discussions that indicate the subwoofer with this system is highly prone to failure. Needless to say, this was very disappointing. For that reason alone, I'm posting this review with a huge ding to the rating over this issue. It's a shame, because otherwise they are a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Aficionado's Only!","review":"This set is so \`over the top' and amazing that only a computer/sound geek can appreciate it. Klipsch is right up there with Bose and Denon for quality. Toss those package speakers and go for the gold! This is as good as a home theater sound system. 35 watts per channel and 130 watts for the subwoofer is only for the aficionado. The sound is classic master and the bass is killer.

My ProMedia 2.1 worked for 2 years, then choked 'out of the blue.' Personally, I'm going back to the old analog CD+Amplifier+REAL SPEAKERS. By comparison, the ProMedia sound is sub-standard. Besides, I never had to stand in line at the Post Office to return defective speakers or amplifiers built by Sony. The Klipsch ProMedia is just poor quality engineering on many fronts.

Warning though you have to tweak your DSP settings. They sounded muffle when I started playing around with my Realtek sound card so I turned those settings off. Next I went into my ITUNES DSP bka a Equalizer setting and created a few unique EQ preferences, it's not very difficult. Then you can select all your music in one wop and generate a customized sound. I am very pleased, I just got them in the mail a few days ago bought off ebay for $72 + $20 Shipping for $92 I am very very satisfied. Very rich and powerful, yet they don't look intimidating.

That is when I start to google and found out that there might be a club of Sorry-a*se-owners of Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 speakers.

It costs a little more money than I wanted to spend. I was looking for something in the 50-100 range. But obviously you get what you pay for and the previous systems I bought from Creative and Altec Lansing were crap. The bass on this thing is almost too much. You barely need to turn up the sub. But thats better than not enough bass for sure. This is a strong system with full sound and it seems to be built well. I just bought it today so I guess I'll give it time before it gets 5 stars. Besides...if you get the 2 year replacement plan thingy available at Best Buy etc. then you are worry free for the next 2 years. Word"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy for recording","review":"I purchased these speakers to replace some altec lansing speakers which would no longer work with a new computer. I read reviews and decided on these. I should have listened more to CNET, they are muddy and have way too much bottem. They are not good at all for recording. I would not recomend these, I paid 130 for them, and I don't think they sound as good as a 30 dollar speaker set. They are loud and have a muddy bass response so if that is what you are looking for buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound while it lasted","review":"I've owned these for about 2 years and for the past 6 months I have been having a feedback problem from the sub-woofer. Even with no music playing there is a humming sound that comes from the sub-woofer constantly. The only way to make it stop id to turn the unit off, which means no sound from any of the speakers. Buyer beware! I'm going back to a name brand that I can trust...Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE Balance of Sound ! ! !","review":"I had a Klipsch Active Sub-woofer that lasted 12 years and finally died. Based on my absolute satisfaction with that Klipsch product I bought the ProMedia 2.1 THX for my computer thinking that they would be good enough. Once I connected the system to my computer all I could do is LISTEN to everything! This ProMedia 2.1 system rivals if not exceeds my Home theater setup in my media room. DROP THE $150 BUCKS and it will be the best value for the dollar you'll have ever spent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy for the money!","review":"Purchased at best buy, was about $75 cheaper. Got two year warranty because i read a couple reviews noting an issue with the connection of one of the speakers. These speakers sound AWESOME. Better than the $120 more expensive BOSE also on display. Bass is full and independently controlled along with volume so you can adjust to compensate for lower volumes. Speakers are more than youll ever need for a 15x15 room and if you so choose, the bass can be window rattling. High end is crisp and clear... no noted distortion although have not turned to full volume. This product was def more than twice as good as the next series of speakers which were half the price. These speakers are worth the money... worth more than the money compared to the competition. You wanna hold an impromptu dance party? Well you've got the option. You will not be disappointed. Only con is no independent power switch. Have to link through power strip. :/ Kinda dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"These sound great when they work, but unfortunately the stereo plug has always been an annoying pain an rarely gives me stereo sound.

I have never heard a higher quality computer speaker. The only way to get better sound on a computer would be to use a full blown home theater system. They are almost perfect in every way. The only things I don't like are; lack of included stands for rear speakers; mini stereo plugs for the speakers and no power button. Otherwise they are perfect. The only problem is the lack of quality from the sound blaster extigy I am using them with. Buy the speakers only get extigy if you have to (broken laptop sound chip.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Klipsch - ya gotta love these things!","review":"The Klipsch promedia are great.

These have more punch, presence, crisp, and clean sound than my $4000 Monitor Audio system. You get that distinct crisp Klipsch sound in such a small package and price tag. I've tried over a dozen PC desktop speakers from $100 to $500 (several Bose, Creative Labs, Altec, etc) and these blow them away. Remember these have _very_ crisp Klipsch sound, so I wouldn't recommend for those that have a hard time with strong highs (like my wife), but I love 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality product","review":"Good quality speakers and woofer , excellent bass quality for a computer speaker.I gave a 4 star because the absence of a on/off button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine until proprietary cable came apart","review":"Speakers sounded great and I had no problems with them until a proprietary cable that plugs into the subwoofer from the speakers came apart at the terminal. Very poor workmanship. System does not work at all without the cable and is now completely worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I had never heard of this brand before. Believe me they are extremely loud and powerful. Some reviews have stated how the high end is more predominant. That is very true. I personally do not like large bass sounds. But the speakers could use a treble and a bass contol (other reviews also mention this) for each to give others the ability to alter the sound for what they want to hear from the speakers. If you do want the ability to increase the low end maybe searching for some other speakers would be a good idea but man these are loud and clean. I have a pair of Bose 901s that have been unused for years and these (Klipsch) have a supberb sound quality (for high end) they reminded me of the power the Bose have but the Bose are a complete sound. Now of course the Bose 901s are great but for $130 these Klipsh will shock you. Easy to plug in to the computer also. If anyone has a comment of some other speakers that they would suggest instead please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well satisfied...great sound quality","review":"After research and listening to a variety of speakers in this price range, it came down to BOSE or KLIPSCH. Both are quite reputable in the field. The THX certification was the deciding factor in the decision to go with the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speaker system. While I use them with my computer system and VISTA ultimate version, the sound quality that they produce with my multimedia software rivals my larger home entertainment setup. I read reviews that complained about mid-range response, but a little tweak of the computer equalizer to add a little more punch took care of any weakness in this regard. I'm totally satisfied and more than happy with my decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE EYED PIRATE AT LOW VOLUME","review":"This product sounds simply amazing loud, sounds like LIVE, everything comes alive when turned up ....BUT...one channel is dead when the volume is at low level listening and who wants to rock out at 6 in the morning or 11 at night. I can buy a passive per amp to fine tune the volume but I would have to spend $300+ extra then I will be better off migrating to the Logitech Z623. This speaker system is good for the birds the way it performs right now. Now I know why testfreaks.com gave it a 6.8 rating and the Logitech z623 a 10.Klipsch should display more corporate responsibility by fixing this issue or just take this product off the market if it chooses the other route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, NOT BUILT TO LAST","review":"I loved these speakers for nearly 3 years. Then the DIN cable that goes from the control pod (right speaker with controls) to the subwoofer stopped working. Search the internet; it's a common problem after you've had them for a while. Don't buy these if you want them to work for more than a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klipsch Speakers OverPriced + Low Life Span","review":"When you first get these babies out of the box and set up, all you can say is wow!! I don't think there a better sounding set of computer speakers on the market. That's if your set even works the first time. There appears to be a lot of failures at first power up. Or, if you survive the 4 - 6 months of normal usage, the amp in the subwoofer prematurely fails (very common occurance-many people are on their 3rd set in a year). These speakers should be failing after 8 years, not 8 months. Until Klipsch get's their quality issues under control, (and when they do, I'll be glad to give them a '5' in the ratings), STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!! Buy a set of Altecs or Monsoons for half the price and none of the aggravation. If you do decide to buy them, I have 2 words for you: EXTENDED WARRANTY. The warranty on this product is 1 year, and guaranteed they will fail once within that time period...Buyer Beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst speakers I've ever owned","review":"I hate to be \\"that guy\\" that has a uniquely bad experience with a product everyone else loves and then has to rain on their parade, but so be it. The first time I bought these speakers they came with a faulty cord and had to be exchanged. The ones I have now developed a crackle in the left speaker about 2 months after purchase that has steadily gotten worse. Today (~9 months after purchase) the left speaker completely gave out and now sounds like someone shaking a can full of pennies. The speakers have only been used at reasonable volume levels and have no reason to fail so soon, aside from simply being poorly made.As for the sound quality: Terribly underwhelming when compared to the great reviews. This will be the first and last Klipsch item I ever buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor reliability.","review":"Unfortunately, all of the review that quote this system as having great sound, but lacking reliability have proven quite true.

There is no power on/off switch. The only way to turn them off is by unplugging. The wire harness where you plug in the individual speaker wires into the subwoofer is absolute garbage. Their are springs which easily pop off and they are cumbersome to reattach. I had one shoot back into the speaker. There was no retrieving it. I had to break apart a pen and use the spring out of it to fix it.I am a huge Klipsch fan. I own them for my home theater and have had them for previous home stereo systems.The sound out of these desktops are great. However, with the poor speaker wire harness design and no on/off switch, I highly recommend finding a different set of speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but did not last","review":"I was indeed positively surprised by the quality and the power of the sound produced.However, after 1.5 year of use, the sounds is completely distorted. So durability has been a problem with those speakers. I now need to replace them and I am not sure I will buy the same brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant sound, weak connectors, poor reliability","review":"I have had two sets of these marvelous sounding speakers and both have failed. They feature outstanding lows, mids, and highs for about the best 2.1-channel PC sound I've heard.Unfortunately, they do not hold up. My first set developed a buzz after several weeks. I exchanged them for another set because I loved the sound so much. After about 3 years, my second set has failed. The left or right speaker would continually cut in and out, forcing me to fiddle with the wires and the connector to the subwoofer. Finally, today, I was happily listening to iTunes when all of a sudden the speakers began to buzz and pop until the sound cut out and the little green power light faded out, never to relight again. Very, very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Desktop Sound System for $130","review":"I have already reviewed this for my subscribers:[...]Here is a rule I have honored since 1957: \\"Never pay for more sound than your ears can hear.\\" For a desktop system, this is as much as I need.

The treble clarity is particularly crisp with the MicroTractrix Horn, and the bass is deep and powerful. The speakers have a relatively small footprint for their sound, but will take up some room on your desk if that is a factor (each speaker is about the width of an oversized coffee mug). One precaution is that the subwoofer has very thin feet on it, making the bass travel through into the surrounding rooms, so if you live in an apartment or dorm and this is a concern, I suggest resting the subwoofer on a towel to absorb some of the noise. Overall, a fabulous product, and worth the list price. If you can find it on sale, grab it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"I was very satisfied by this product.

These speakers work well if you want something loud and don't really care about sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"Not much to add.

They hit the lows and the highs and every note in between. They sounded great with my onboard audio but when installed a Creative Labs X-fi ExtremeMusic soundcard it took them over the top.

I never write product reviews but i am 100% behind this product and will deffinatley be looking at other Klipsch products.

The service I got from Amazon was great also...I will order again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"I find the laudatory reviews here completely incomprehensible. Even with the volume on the bass unit at a minimum, this system sounds tubby and muddy, not only in the lower registers, but well up into the midrange. It can sound very nice on material like solo voice, nylon string guitar, or solo clarinet, but as soon as the material contains more voices/instruments, more bass, sharper attacks, and/or more complex dynamics, the sound gets horribly smeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability - AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRES","review":"These speakers sounded great until shortly after the warranty expired. The the left channel stopped working. I emailed Klipsch customer service and they told me that after the warranty expired they really can't help me.

The right satellite speaker has the subwoofer and volume dials on it. But it's really cheap construction, and after a while the rubber dials start to vibrate and make a \\"chirping\\" sound during play. This occurs even when played at a reasonable volume. I babied these speakers and still had this problem. If you're thinking about buying these, ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly built","review":"Garbage!....they sound great but the input cable in back of the subwoofer is fragile.

Uses 18 watts standby","review":"I've had these speakers since 2005, and I've been rocking them ever since. Sounded amazing when I was playing BF2 and now playing BF3. I've always noticed they get warm so I figured they were using quite a bit of power. I recently purchased a Belkin power meter that tells me how many watts Im using (kinda like a Kill-o-watt) meter. This thing eats up 18 watts on standby so switch it off when you don't need it or connect it to a surge suppressor. 18 watts at 10 cents per kwh = $16/year. Not much at all, but a waste none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUV IT","review":"The amount of sound coming out of this thing is impressive and worth every penny. It blows out any other 2.1 sound system within its price range (well the exception being the harmon kardon sound sticks II, which has slightly clearer sound but less bass). My music sounds clear and crisp, with all the booming depth and beautiful mids and highs present. Im no audiophile, but i was satisfied with this piece of audio equipment.The only thing that i don't like are the wires that come with it. They are too thin and can break easily, so just buy some of those monster of cables and your set. Plus there have been many cases of these speakers breaking down, and my speakers have crapped out on me once and while, but i just adjust the wires a bit. Best thing to do is to just find a place for it, and don't touch it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 - Multi Media Speakers","review":"Overall, I am satisfied with the sound of the system for the size and price.

You can turn it all the way up and the satellite speakers are crystal clear. The bass on the subwoofer is deep and powerful. Everything looks and feels of professional quality.I wanted to purchase it new because it was a gift so I didn't buy from Ebay where prices are cheaper but most of the systems offered are open-box or refurbished so I got it from Amazon.com and received it in the original box and unopened.Don't waste money on a cheaper system because you'll regret it.

These speakers sounded so great when I bought them, and considering the price, well they should have too. I connected them to my computer and was very happy with them. Then, as you can read from *many* others (try the forum on the Klipsch site), they fell apart, in just over a year. The contact between subwoofer and rest of system failed, both sides of it, and I suspect other things too, and troubleshooting and repair means pulling the whole thing to bits with a soldering iron.

Don't take my word for it though, go check out their forums and search for the the phrase \\"\\"Reverse Volume\\"\\".Now that the 3rd control pod wont work, they want me to send in the subwoofer for repair which takes 4 - 6 weeks.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD","review":"these speakers are the highest quality you can get for this price range.

I started out with the cheap logitech systems and they did do a good job but nothing compares to this set of speakers. If you are looking for a simple yet powerful and crisp sounding system then there is no alternative. Audiophiles will no doubt hook up massive surround systems to their desktops but this Promedia set is not for that purpose.The audio is crystal clear and the response is dead on. The Sub-woofer provides the perfect amount of bass needed to compliment the very powerful desktop speakers. Plus you can adjust the Sub-woofer volume to meet your needs right on the satellite speaker. The headphone and external audio input jacks give this an added bonus.

The sound quality and power is beyond impressive and completely understated everywhere. I use them under 10-15% power most of the time because anything higher would be too loud. You literally \\"feel\\" the sound. If turned up higher my furniture starts to literally vibrate while maintaining crisp clear sound. Listening to music with these makes a world of difference because you hear details that other systems simply can't produce. I bought my speakers from NewGenOutlet open box for $100.

However, two weeks after I purchased my first set, an electrical problem developed internally and the fuse wouldn't stop blowing so I had to exchange for another set. Other than that issue, these have been truly excellent speakers, especially considering the comparably moderate price."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the ones","review":"Having ripped more than 10,000 songs to my hard drive, I was frustrated listening to them with mediocre computer speakers. I decided to believe the amazing reviews you'll read here at Amazon and buy these speakers. The greatest raves you'll read are accurate -- these speakers have astonishing power and clarity. The listening experience compares favorably with my JBL tower speakers, Energy surround sound speakers and Infinity bookshelf speakers, all powered with quality amps.I always worried about the supposed sound degradation of ripping CDs to WMA files.

Well, now the left channel has gone out on both sets. The speakers themselves all work so I bought a replacement preamp control cord unit but that didn't solve the problem. Still no sound out of the left speakers.Klipsch Support said I probably need to replace the amps - 80+ dollars each - but that it was an unusual problem . I said there were loads of complaints online about the left speaker going dead and he responded that there were no such problems. He said these online complainers are loopy (his words exactly). I guess the Klipsch strategy is repeat how great you are and deny any problems.Call me loopy but they certainly will never get my money again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in CHINA not Germany","review":"Great sound with warm big bass tones unfortunately you wont get to hear it often because the speakers are poor build quality.

Its a shame because they do sound nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but not long lasting","review":"First let me start by saying, I LOVE these speakers. They sound better than more expensive speakers from several manufactures in the $200 range, including bose.However, they have a ~2-3 year lifespan.

It's been a joy listening to my music collection on this set and I hope you will share the same experience I did.

To make matters worse, there is no low battery indication so many times it has died on me and meanwhile the baby has been awake and crying for sometime. Now I feel like I have go upstairs and check on him every 5 minutes while he naps. For this much money, it should at least warn you when the batteries are low.

It was very frustrating because I would get it just so, leave the room and then half an hour later my receiver would suddenly play static because the transmitter had just disconnected, and now my baby was asleep and I couldn't go in to fix it. Eventually it got worse and worse until it would only work if I was holding the cable... so it was useless. I didn't rough it up or anything, I just had it on her shelf so it wasn't a very sturdy product. Another thing I never really liked even when it did work is that the sounds were always very loud, there is a volume control but at the lowest sound it was still very loud and magnified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitors with No Issues!","review":"We tried two different monitors from Walmart which we returned and then tried these.

The battery doors are not designed to be removed easily (feels like I'm about to break the latch when it finally releases) and since the unit does not charge rechargable batteries. The baby monitor does not accept batteries, so if you want to move it you need to bring the DC adapter along with.It's going back.If these things are not important to you then fine, I have not tested the range further than upstairs/downstairs and then only for a very short time so I will not comment on this.Best,Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a nightmare","review":"My mom got this 1 the whole house didnt get any sleep so she got upset and so we were all upset, finally my mom got a fisher price 1, what a release we got some sleep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant noise","review":"This product works ok, not great.

The volume control could be a little better but it's a minor complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reception/light weight","review":"Just got this a few days ago in preparation for our 2nd child. I plugged in the monitor in the bedroom and one receiver in the living room to see how well it worked, and it works great! The TV was on in the living room which I could clearly hear in the monitor, then had my daughter pretend to cry and make noise and that's when the lights came on signifying \\"baby activity,\\" which is what you should expect. The background noise was not overbearing, and there was no static. We live in a small house, so not sure how well it would do from a distance further from the base, but at small range its been great. It is very lightweight without batteries in it, so it easily topples over when plugged in. I'm giving it a 4 because although my test run went well, I'm yet to see how it does for a longer period and with an actual baby. Overall, I'd say great price for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new here","review":"It's all been said I think - these work amazingly well and I haven't second guessed this purchase once for use in our baby's room.

Boy was that a waste of time. I could barely hear my baby crying on them, granted the \\"white noise\\" wasn't there so much, but neither was his voice and I needed to hear his voice. I would absolutely not recommend these. It's possible my set was defective, but I will never know for sure, I ended up just buying another Fisher Price set. The white noise doesn't really bother me, it seems most people complain about that...but I've never known monitors to not have it and the one that I tried (this set) that didn't have much white noise ended up defeating it's main purpose anyway.

Anyway, I tried for 2 hours and could not get the static to go away so I shipped it back and went to Radio Shack and bought their cheapest 2 room intercom and that solved my problem.I am not saying this baby monitor is not for you, it just did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Static than Safety 1st, First Years, and Fisher Price","review":"I bought three monitors before finding this one. All of the three following monitors have an unacceptable amount of static: Safety 1st Crystal Clear Monitor, First Years Two-Receiver 49MHz Monitor, and Fisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitor. The static on these three monitors was louder than my baby's crying making it useless. While the Graco is clearly better than the three listed above, there still is a very small amount of static on it. I am guessing that a digital monitor would have worked even better, but I am not willing to spend that much money on a monitor.

For now, I am just keeping the house very quiet when baby is in his crib. I'll be replacing this monitor soon. Also, the battery case is quite difficult to get into, and the set feels really cheap because of it. Upon further consideration, I would much rather have a monitor with rechargable batteries anyway, but this review is based on the static. I'm giving it two stars because about 20% of the time the static isn't so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"These monitors are poorly made. They stopped working after two weeks.

When we turned the parent units to \\"on,\\" we would hear sound from the nursery unit/transmitter for a fraction of a second----then nothing but white noise. This white noise/static sounded much like the fan in our nursery...so we didn't even know that the receivers had broken until we heard crying from the nursery (and then realized, \\"Wait...we're not hearing that in the monitor at all\\").We're very careful with our electronics...and judging by the fact that these both stopped working independently of each other, I know it had nothing to to with the AC adapters, a mix-up on the channel selection, etc.Fortunately had a few days left before Amazon's 30-day return policy ended, so shipped back for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for babies","review":"I purchased this for my mom. This was a great product to purchase when my father became ill and my mother became full time main caregiver. She needed to be able to hear him call for her and meet his needs and still mow the lawn, take out the garbage or shower. It saved her in so many ways.

Volume of static is much louder than the sound of my son in his nursery, totally defeating the purpose. I intend to return this and get a different model Graco (the one I had before was the graco imonitor - which lost its ability to hold a charge and thus has to be plugged in at all times, but always left me confident that I knew what was going on in the nursery). The imonitor cost a lot more - I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Problems","review":"From the divergent reviews (static vs. no static) it would appear that Graco has quality control problems. The question is whether you want to roll the dice and hope for a good one. I would love to see statistics on what percent have issues. For what it's worth, the static on even the lowest setting is louder than our alarm clock and it gets louder if I turn up the volume. We've found that the best way to hear the baby is to turn off the monitor so we can hear the baby crying through the walls and down the hall. I'm trying to return it, but foolishly recycled the packaging it came in. We do have the usual other devises in the house (cordless phone, wireless router, fisher-price baby monitor) that have no static problems whatsoever. Turning them off has no impact on the static, which leads me to believe it's a quality control issue with the Graco monitor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"these are nice. picks up a bit more static than my other set, but these still work pretty good! i bought these for traveling and I'm definitely pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Sony NTM-910 Dual","review":"I own the Sony NTM-910 and this model. I much prefer the Sony, since it comes with rechargeable batteries in the receivers which automatically recharge, whereas the Graco won't even recharge batteries if you buy them yourself. Also, the Sony is voice-activated, which means it is completely silent until the baby makes noise, even when turned all the way up. The Graco on the otherhand, you have to turn almost all the way down to avoid a constant hum, which will make you an insomniac in no time quick if you turned it up. I just assumed all monitors had this feature, and am sorely missing it on this one. The Sony NTM-910 comes in a dual receiver model, which I would recommend over this. I almost bought it but due the (...) price difference I opted for this model. However, the (...) will quickly be eaten up in battery costs, so no real advantage there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Baby Monitor...great value too!","review":"The Graco Ultra Clear II 49mhz Baby Monitor is wonderful. We had originally purchased another monitor by a different brand (that was three times as much.) Unfortunately the feedback on that one was terrible.

We have never heard static or feedback and love that even with the volume turned down that we can see if our daughter is crying (noted by the red dots on the parent unit.)The monitor is easy to set up and worked the first time we plugged them in.We would definitely recommend this unit to parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor- no problems- great price","review":"I love this monitor.

So here's my recommendation... get an Australian Shepherd.Fast forward 3+ years to my next kid and they work great.

In fact, there is even a better one in the very same Philips Duo series -- the one by Witold Rowicki and the London Symphony Orchestra (see my review). Other better buys are the Giulini on EMI Double Forte (not the horridly slow Sony title that was mentioned below), Von Dohnanyi on Double Decca, and Kubelik on DG (see my review of the box set of the Nine Symphonies). With that being said, this set is really not so terrible. I think we all feel a little let down by Davis because so many of his other Philips Duo offerings are among the best of any given work available -- the Complete Sibelius Symphonies, Haydn \\"London\\" Symphonies and Beethoven Piano Concertos to name a few.

These awsome melodies will stick in your brain (being more of a 70's rock fan I'm puzzled to find myself writing this, but it's to the point). If you like Alexandra, and I'm sure you will, check outUdo Juergens (cf my review) as well. He actually wrote \\"Illusionen\\" for Alexandra, one of the diamonds among a CD of pearls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"Hvorostovsky was the star draw that attracted me to this recording, but every time I've listened to this opera, it has drawn me deeper and deeper into its coils. I find it incredibly touching and moving, and having recently heard numerous tenors giving Lensky's Kuda kuda aria a go in the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, Shicoff's rendition is startling in its memorability and clarity.I'm not Russian, so I can't make any comment on the ability of the singers to handle the language, but, this recording has made me a complete fan of Tchaikovsky and drawn me to his other operas and his symphonies. Every time I hear it I find it more poignant, enthralling and romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor recording","review":"Its a poor recording, meaning that I can't hear what are they singing (words, intonations, etc.).Also terrible accent of singers (not all, but still) which destroys general impression. IMHO Russian opera should be either performed by a Russian singer or there should be no accent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It MIGHT have worked if...","review":"The ENTIRE cast had been replaced.We've all seen similar stories before. Some things about the cinematography were strong, while other scenes were so contrived that I wound up adding my own lines after a bit; a habit picked up from years of Mystery Science Theater and Monty Python: the only way of making it through a brutally ridiculous movie. I'm a Lovecraft fan, too, but I've never read this story.If this idea had been handed to a competent group of actors, it'd probably be decent, but Dr. Munoz and his performance were the most transparent I've seen in a long time. If this one's in your local rental kiosk, and you like to toss a few lines into a bad movie during supposed ultra-dramatic moments, grab it!As far as I can tell, the cover is the most frightening thing with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"H.P. Lovecraft would roll over in his grave and laugh to death...and then maybe cry a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and Completely Wretched.....","review":"I am going to keep this short, to avoid wasting any more of my time with this completely lousy movie. If you want to see what happens when an incompetent director is combined with an amateurish cast, a putrid script, and apparently no budget at all, then by all means rent this stinker. It reminded me of the old 1960's drive-in movie features with unconvincing blood and gore and a ridiculous \\"plot\\" that keeps you laughing (out of pity) instead of scared.If one purpose of movie reviews is to keep innocent viewers from wasting their time and money, then please accept my honest advice and avoid this wretched mess at all costs. Even if it were offered for free, it would still be a waste of your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovecraft Adaptation","review":"The screen writers have taken the liberty of placing this in modern times. The story is grime and keeps the basics of the Lovecraft horror. This could have been a greet horror classic if not for the stilted; or dare I say it, poor acting. The budget was obviously limited as will be noticed by the very limited sets and props. I mean the white van looks like it was rented for the day and had mud on it too make it look like a long neglected vehicle. When the acting does not capture your attention like in this film you start too notice things like that. I will not give away the plot for those who have never heard of the storyline. I am glad I saw it but happy I only paid $2. This is a movie that will only get the one viewing from me. My suggestion; borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 95% of H.P. Lovecraft's stories end as a bad movie?","review":"Based upon H.P. Lovecraft's story Cool Air, Chill is yet another in a long line of lackluster attempts to capture the other-worldly creepiness of an author who was way ahead of his time. The movie have a lots of problems for the begining of the production. First the director Serge Rodnunsky does not possess the skills to get decent performances out of his cast. The only two actors in this otherwise train wreck of a film who come off as convincing are Ashley Laurence and and Calabro. The make up is horrible and I know this is a low budget movie, but definitely they kill this production. And if you make it to the film's finale, you'll be rewarded by seeing what has to be the single most laughable CGI-rendered explosion that I've ever witnessed. In other words this could be a good movie if the production crew and the director were more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting facts, lousy writing","review":"Goodrich claims that Merlin was a Celtic Christian scientist, political advisor and religious leader. She may well be right. Indeed, I would like to think that she is right. But if I disagreed with her conclusions, her arguments would not convince me. As other reviews of her writing have said, it is full of non sequiters. I have a Ph.D. in religious studies, and teach religion and philosophy. But I could not explain to a third party her arguments for her conclusions. If you want some exposure to ancient/medieval texts that bear on the identity of Merlin, this book might be useful. But don't expect to come to any clear conclusion (for or against her views) with the help of her writing. She mixes textual exposition and argument without stating where one leaves off and another begins. The reader is constantly wondering: is this what her sourse says? Is it what Goodrich THINKS it says? Is it evidence for her point of view? If so, how? A tangle of confused writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great research, abominable writing","review":"Ms. Goodrich undoubtedly knows what she is talking about, and has done her research. However, her writing style and grammar are so horrific that I was completely unable to finish even the first quarter of the book.Her sentences are disjointed, she makes frequent reference to events and myths without sufficient background information for the reader, and cannot seem to hold a cohesive thought in her head for more than the length of a sentence. Her writing skips off on tangents and rabbit trails, and generally fails to lead to any logical conclusions or coherent presentation.The research is there, but she's unable to express it to her audience in either a narrative format or a reference format. A huge, huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Painful Weeks to Read","review":"I usually tear through a good book in a day--it took me three weeks to get through Utopia. It was a great story idea and I wanted to like it--didn't want to give up on it because I have always thoroughly enjoyed the books of Child and Preston. I begin to suspect that it may have been Preston's writing I was enjoying. Every once in a while, I would see a glimmer of something exciting starting up in the story and I would think, \\"Ah, ha, now it gets good.\\" A page or two later, I would find my mind once more wandering through dry narrative. The novel lacked flow and I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting. I just skimmed the last few pages--just didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utopia","review":"This was a hard book to put down, after reading this I want to read more books by LIncoln Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a disappointment.","review":"A less-than-glowing title, perhaps, but it's very true: Utopia is not a disappointment, even if it also isn't a stunning and revelatory novel. If you like Lincoln Child, and/or techno-thrillers and mystery as genres, then you'll enjoy Utopia. What's particularly enjoyable? Novel ideas and research that was new to me (and I'm fairly nerdy) re: computer science, entertainment parks, and artificial intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Adventure!","review":"Utopia is a real departure from his collaboration novels with Douglas Preston, less mystery, more action, but great nonetheless. The characters are ALL very well realized. Utopia paints a vivid and fascinating fantasy world (think Epcot, Universal, Disney World) on the surface while underneath it all there is a fast paced, life and death chess match, between cold-hearted villains and the men and women that rise to the occasion to confront them. Lincoln Child proves that he is excellent in his own right. I look forward to his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining thriller","review":"Utopia is the story of a robotics expert called in to work at a state-of-the-art theme park in the Arizona desert. Once there, he is startled to find the robots are malfunctioning. Could the glitches be the result of park mismanagement, or could it be something more sinister?I really enjoyed listening to Utopia. The book was well read, and entertaining even at high speed on my iPod. I did find myself rather annoyed with the protagonist's daughter Georgia and the bratty way she was possessive of her dad. This may be realistic but I found it a tad creepy. I liked Sara Boatwright, but the protagonists new love interest seemed a carbon copy of the love interest in Deep Storm.Overall, a good book. I probably would've cut the Georgia character or made her younger. She seemed a little too old to be such a brat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utopia","review":"Action packed, good read. Kept you guessing . Lots of twists and turns. Would make a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I always feel compelled to finish a book once I start, but I have about 15% to go and am considering bagging it. I usually love Lincoln Childs, and usually his books are real page turners, but this book is BORING..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still haven't finished this one","review":"It seemed to start out OK - but got too \\"Westworld\\" for me - definitely not one of my favorite Child's story. Maybe one day I'll finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill Ride!","review":"Utopia is literally and figuratively a thrill ride. It does not disappoint. The story is plotted around a fantastic amusement park -- like DisneyLand on steroids -- infiltrated by coercive bad guys. If this sounds like a run-of-the-mill plot, be advised that Lincoln Child's skill as an author lifts it far above the ordinary. Just enough mayhem, just enough plot twists, and ample suspense to keep you turning the pages. Child creates characters that you care about -- and bad guys that you love to hate; and the ending is a real bang up job. I loved it. I only backed off assigning 5 stars because many chapters leave you hanging then skip to a different venue -- a technique that Child uses effectively to build suspense but can at times be frustrating. On the other hand, it does promote faster reading; but then, when finished, I'm sorry it's over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"I'm a great fan of the Preston/Child books, but I just couldn't get into this one. I started reading it twice, but gave up both times, yawn.I don't know how 2 people can be better than one when writing but I guess Preston and Child will have to keep splitting their paychecks 50/50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utopia plenty","review":"First off, a prior reviewer had Mr. Preston confused with his brother. Richard Preston writes the germ warfare novels. Douglas Preston writes delightful novels like Jennie and Dinosaurs in the Attic. All that aside, this is a great novel- much in the vein of the Preston/Child novels that many, many people swear are the best in the business. Child has outdone himself in the details-- they make the park come alive in the reader's imagination. Definitely a hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical to be fun","review":"I just couldn't get into this book. I have a 50 page rule, if the book hasn't captured my attention within the first 50 pages, well, it's just not worth my time. There are too many wonderful books out there waiting to be read. I gave this book twice my usual attention because I really like Lincoln Child, but it was just too technical to be fun and after 100 pages, I was still bored to tears. Maybe it got better on page 102, who knows. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking to be captivated from the very beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginatively entertaining...","review":"More action-packed and imaginative than the Lincoln Childs novels, Child has masterfully constructed Utopia, a robotic futuristic theme park in the desert. Combine a fading academician, his troubled teenage daughter, a budding romantic interest and a terrorist psychopath and you have a plot with more twists and turns than the deadly rollercoaster. A bit of unlikey luck helps the heroes also. As for the incredible finale...you should have seen it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 pages too long!","review":"Bottom line: This is a below average novel that quickly becomes tedious because the narrative is mostly fluff. This book could have been much more enjoyable if 200 pages of useless descriptions were removed. Note to the author, it is ok to let the readers use their imagination.Pros: interesting and ruthless villains; cool concept for a future theme park in Nevada near Las Vegas (I'd go).Cons: overly wordy by 200 pages; weak and uninteresting protagonists; cheap imitation of R2-D2 type robot.Alternative Lincoln Child book: Try \\"Deepstorm\\"; it is much more interesting and fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lincoln Child, what were you thinkning?","review":"I read all of Lincoln Child's books including the ones he wrote with Doug Preston and by far this one is the absolute worst. Just because he can write, publisher shouldn't allow him to write a crap. I understand that he had a good storyline with a few interesting characters but taking a page out of Die Hard isn't what I expect from a top notch writer like Lincoln. Don't write a Hollywood movie script, write a book. Don't sell out like John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"What can I say? I was somewhat disappointed by this book; it is not up to the usual standards of the author [but it IS an earlier volume in his output, etc/]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clone of Die Hard","review":"This novel is purely visual. Absolutely nothing is going on in background or in the character's heads. In fact, there are no characters - with their simplistic reasoning, feelings and motivations, all of these people could've been robots. It would make a great script for a so-so action flick, a clone of all 3 Die Hard movies sans Bruce Willis' presence and occasional comic relief.Science fiction? What science fiction? Only if you thought Hackers or The Net were sci-fi. All technological aspects here amount to some Unix terminology, with several intentional blunders to simplify the concepts. Robotics plays only a secondary role in the plot, an embellishment that does not change the genre of the novel.The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it reads very fast. I did not waste too much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utopia by Lincoln Child","review":"Lincoln Child is one of my very favorite authors ever and this book was superbly written with action continuously all the way through. I strongly suggest all books he co-wrote with Douglas Preston and his other two solo books, Death Match and Deep Storm. This man is one of the most super-talented and gifted authors today. This book takes place in an amusement park which is a little different than his other books but with his wit its probably more fun than actually going to an amusement park."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring waste of time.","review":"I picked this up because I really like the collaborative works between lincoln child and preston douglas. I was very disappointed in this story. There was lots of description of the theme park, but little depth in the characters and an extremely thin plot with almost laughable situations. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one. Whoever the reviewers are who enjoyed this book must have read a different book with the same title. I will continue to read the works written in collaboration with Mr. Douglas, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roller coaster ride with a lot of fun","review":"I have read several of his books and they all are page turners and keep you guessing.

I purchased my camera at a Target Store in October 2002. I went to purchase film a month later and it was out of stock. So I tried other Target Stores and had the same problem. The problem still exists. If Target is going to sell a product they should stock the accessory for that product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Colin, Caballe, and Carreras at Covent : Commanding!","review":"When I first found this cd, I fretted a bit. It was not reviewed in my Penguin (1996) guide--and with these principals, alarm bells went off in my head. I decided to trust my educated instinct, however, and bought it anyway. I have been elated ever since. This recording is marvelous, spacious, beautiful--everything, in short, that a Puccini opera should be. Caballe, playing the heroine, sings with glorious passion and tone; Carreras' portrayal of Cavardossi is definitive in its power and style; and Ingvar Wixell puts forth a deliciously villainous Scarpia. Additionally, Sir Colin Davis evokes a fine performance from both the Chorus and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Instrumental playing is excellent, yet never overshadows the singing when it should not. This may be the best opera recording that I own; I even find it preferable to Decca's _La Boheme_ with Freni and Pavarotti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly among the best","review":"Carreras is awesome in this recording, certainly better to my ears than DiStefano. Caballe is not as strong as Callas, but then again nobody ever will be. Carreras rendition of \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" takes my breath away every time I hear it. His young voice was something to hear and this is a prime example. He was ideal for this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"An altogether nice Tosca","review":"All singers do their task sufficiently good. Montserrat Caballe is the best choice for Floria among the recordings made during the \`70s &\`80s (R. Scotto, K. Te Kanawa, K. Ricciarelli, M. Freni). Her rich, creamy voice (one of the most beautiful soprano voices indisputably) , her perfect breath control combined with those supreme legatos produce a very nice Tosca. However, even my beloved Montserrat cannot be compared with Renata Tebaldi's Tosca..Tebaldi is so grand and powerful, the ideal Tosca for me!Jose Carreras is a deeply moving Mario (among the best) and he surely is in better shape here as some years later with K.Ricciarelli. I also like the rest of the cast who together with our main singers produce this very satisfying edition of Puccini's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN CALLAS/DI STEFANO?","review":"I dare say yes! Jose Carreras' voice is at its best. He is really Cavaradossi. Caballe too is very good. She doesn't just sing the notes, she sings the emotions: from one who trully loves Mario to jealous woman to a desparate woman who will do anything (including kill) for her man. And her diction is good here- unlike on some of her other recordings. And I believe Igvar Wixell's Scarpia is better than Gobbi's on the worshipped EMI set. The Scarpia death scene is very realistic. You can feel him die. On EMI you just have to beleive he dies. One caveat though: There is NO libretto/translation with this recording. But finding a Tosca libretto is no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right thing at all","review":"Tosca has had tons of great recordings, more than any other Puccini opera. You can hear Callas, Price in her prime or just past, Nilsson, Scotto, Freni, and Tebaldi, all imbedded in good-to-great performances that ooze Italian style.Not this one, though. Caballe and Carreras made a natural pairing, but she is too phlegmatic for the fiery diva Puccini had in mind, and the mircrophones can't really boost Carreras enough to make him a heroic tenor on the scale of Cavaradossi. Wixell is a terrible Scarpia, rough and without a clue to Italian style. Davis favored him in quite a few recordings, a mystifying choice given how Wixell marred all of them. The Royal Operaorchestra can't remotely match any of the great orchestras on disc.But the real problem is Davis, whose talent doesn't extend to Italina opera. After this flirtation and an equally awkward La Boheme he backed out of this repertoire, for good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable & Older Book","review":"I bought this book when it first came out, right after I had a baby. After I started applying Linda Clark's simple home remedies, ate the correct kinds of foods, and took her advice on vitamin supplments, within 6 six weeks friends were telling me thatI looked more vibrant, lost weight, and my eyes glistened. Since that time, the influence of this book has left a life time memory and way of life on me. Some of the simple anti anging recipes come right from the kitchen, great for the hair and skin! such as mayonaise, blackstrapp molasses and yogurt, the b vitamins, collogen and much more. This lady really goes into detail in laymans terms. Wonder foods, kitchen remedies and vitamins, it is that simple! She packs a lot of research to support her writing. I highly recommend this book in lui of the very expensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wont stay together","review":"My cousin got this toy for my now 18month old. She's had it since she was about 14 months. Since then the only play value she has from it is to pull off the roller coaster loop and wear it as a necklace, and she will bring the ferris wheel into the living room and put the people on it and turn it around but that was only just recently. It's a big toy that takes up a lot of space for one that is hardly used. I wont give it away as she does enjoy the ferris wheel and the little people and the red \\"necklace\\" but now the cars wont do the loop anymore because the loop has been pulled off so many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably want to let this one pass","review":"I bought this despite some of the negative reviews the risk did not pay off. The loop coaster which was the big draw for me is neat, but the loop tends to fall apart. Also it requires a bit more coordination than my 2 year-old can sometimes muster to set the cars correctly on the hook and track. The Ferris Wheel doesn't stay in place very well at all and the plane ride is hard for her to grasp and manipulate. A much better bet is the Surprise Sounds Fun Park which has essentially the same elements (it's not a loop coaster, but at least it stays together) except with sound. The knob at the top of the rocket ride is easy for her to grab and move by herself, also she can work this coaster toy completely on her own which she and I both love. A Ferris Wheel toy can be bought separately which is cooler looking with lights and sound and since it stands alone there's no problem with it constantly falling out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again.","review":"I was very upset with this toy. I run a daycare in my home and thought the kids would love this but everything pops off easy. The loop comes off all the time and the cars do not go all the way around on the loop either. You can not keep the farris wheel or the merry go round on this product. If they pick it up by the top of the roller coaster hill it will come off. It is not a toy that is played with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Park Big Disappointment","review":"Fisher Price usually designs fun workable toys for kids. This Fun Park was a big flop. The roller coaster track is a complete waste. The car comes down the hill and crashes every time. My husband who is a design engineer says the track was never designed for the car to actually travel on it completely. The ferris weel and swing are ok, however they do come off quite easily during normal play. Overall this is a very bulky toy that was a big dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Price Flop!","review":"I was really excited about this new Fisher Price toy. We have several and they have proven to be sturdy fun toys. This toy was fun but more aggravating than it's worth. We have had constant problems with the loop tracking coming off and the people come flying out of the airplane ride! We are very disappointed in this one! I would recommend you to buy any of the others but this one is surely not worth the money! It could have been a lot fun. It does have storage for the people and cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 21 Month old son loves this toy","review":"This is a great toy for my 21 month old son. He loves to send Sonya Lee down the track and spends endless amounts of time playing peek-a-boo with the exit ramp (clown face). He also loves to spin the ferris wheel, but isn't too hot on the planes. He figured out that most of his hot wheels cars will make the loop and come out the bottom, too, so that added a new dimension to the toy. The only problem we have had is that he can separate the track from the base pretty easily and until he learned not to, I had to fix it pretty often. Overall, I would highly recommend this toy, moms will enjoy it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"We got this one free with paper's points. If I knew then what I know now, we would not have selected it. It falls apart easily - the hill pops off, the door falls in and the loop can be easily snapped off. It's only redeeming value is the people and the little cars that come with it. The playset itself is a wreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My daughter loves this toy. It's really easy for her to make the cars go on the rollercoaster. The only problem is the ferris wheel and swing is too easy to remove. They are never on the toy always somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loop rarely works, Everything pops off","review":"Well, I must say I was disappointed in this. While it LOOKS very cool, the loop RARELY works right, the plastic cars are junk with wheels and axels that don't even spin well enough so that if you DO make the loop, they stop short. The ferris wheel and plane ride don't stay attached, so they are CONSTANTLY popping off.I like a LOT of their other products, but especially for $33 with delivery here, I'd avoid this item. I enjoy the GARAGE, HOUSE, and ZOO so much more, especially the ZOO. DO NOT BUY this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to see but makes a toddler frustrated!","review":"This is such a sweet set to look at. Can be difficult for a toddlers to use. The slide is difficult to latch the cars on. The pieces do not stay connected. A slight push & the set is all to pieces. We bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday & now at 3 still has trouble with it. Fisher Price did come out with a new Fun Park with a small slide & different pieces. So maybe they improved it. The farm is wonderful & suggest that as a toy which will be used everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes up a lot of space for a toy that is not played with","review":"We bought this toy for my daughter when she was 2 and since then we had another baby who is now 2. Neither of the them show much interest in the toy. I agree with the reviewer who said the loop needs to be re-deigned as the track keeps popping off. Also, for some reason the cars that came with it no longer make it all the way around the loop, let a lone all the way around the track. This toy is unwieldy and if you are short on space for toys, not a good investment. My daughters play with the Fisher Price Circus Train, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS SURPRISED","review":"When I ordered the toy on the internet, I forgot to look at other people's comments to see what other kids thought about the Fun-Park. By the time I looked at the comments, it was to late to cancel! I was worried that I might have wasted my money. But when my 18 month son saw the box, he was so excited. I thought to myself great a $30 box. To my surprise, when i put all the pieces together and showed him how to play w/ the toy, Well he just loves it. It's quality time for us, since he still has not mastered putting the car on the track, I get to do the honor and he gets to count down to 3 and push the button.

The circular part of the track never stays in place and is always somewhere else in the house besides where the toy is. Also, the part that drops the cars onto the track also falls off easily. Small children don't know how to reattach the parts to you are constantly putting it back together. The ferris wheel detaches constantly also and the merry-go-round flings the people out. Totally frustrating toy for small children and it is usually ignored, in pieces, and I personally hate the thing. We all love the other toys, (ie. farm, house, fire dept) but this one falls below expectations in a major way. We suggest you buy another toy. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read reviews first","review":"I agree that the loop only occasionally works for my children so now they don't play with it at all. It does come with a piece of paper that tells you how to keep the loop in working order, but the suggestions don't really work.Also, the people don't stay on the airplane ride when my children turn it. The only part they like is the ferris wheel. Once I get over spending the money on a toy they played with about 10-15 times I am sending it to a thrift store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Lame Lame","review":"Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of little people & had them as a child & have bought them for my child. BUT I really dislike this toy!! It looks like lots of fun but the cars won't loop the loop & stay on the track which is pretty much the whole idea of the toy. The ferris wheel & swing are mildly entertaining but my daughter ignored the entire set until she realized that some (& only some) of her hot wheels cars will run the loop completely. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay a dime for this toy as I got it free from a Pampers giveaway but unfortunately my belief in Little people has been tainted & I will be more careful when purchasing them. I really thought their standards were higher but I guess this one slipped through their qc department!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Fisher Price's normal standard","review":"This toy is a piece of junk. I bought two. One for my niece and one for my 17 month old. They both loved it for about the first 10 minutes. After that the cars couldn't make the loop & just fell down. The problem is that people don't fit properly into the cars. Because the people fall out-the cars don't weigh enough to manuver the loop.Both had the exact same problem.I usually love the Little People products. This toy is not up to Fisher Price's normal quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks fun in the picture on the box, but not as fun to play with","review":"This toy was purchased for a 2 y.o. per the age recommendations on the box, but the design is poor. The loop for the roller coaster snaps into place, which means it unsnaps easily if the child leans on (or falls over it). Each time the loop is replaced, the snap gets looser and looser. Eventually the cars won't make it through the loop. The merry-go-round and ferris wheel are definitely more age appropriate, but for some reason, Fisher Price didn't make them a permanent fixture of the set. As the child tries to load Little People in, the items falls over (if sitting alone on the floor) or falls off of the fun park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all!","review":"this product looks fun but really isn't. my daughter got bored with it after 2 days. the pieces aren't sturdy and there really isn't much for the kids to do. certainly not worth the price either. buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not stable","review":"This toy is a lot of fun.My son just got this toy and we haven't stopped playing with it.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"This toy would be great, if only it stayed together. I got it for my 2 1/2 yr. old.

If only I would have read the reviews...","review":"This toy looks great and is described wonderfully. When it is taken out of the packaging, a whole new life it takes on. It falls apart too easily. The pieces aren't as \\"friendly\\" to a small child as one might expect coming from Fisher Price. Yes, the figures are as usual awesome, but the moving parts (the ferris wheel and roller coaster) fall apart and are confusing for small minds to grasp. P.S. There is an identical one that I picked up several years ago for my middle child. I wondered why I never saw it much...now I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it Tomorrow","review":"My husband I bought this toy for our 19 month old son for Christmas.

It looks like great fun, but it's full of weird design flaws. My daughter is not tough on her toys, but the track parts pop off at the slightest touch. Also, the cars need to be hung on a hook in order to complete the track. There is a loop on both ends of the cars, but only one is big enough to fit on the hook, so half the time she's trying to force the car onto the hook. In addition, the \\"Fun House\\" door--where the cars come out--is directly below the where the cars start on the track, so the child's foot is almost always blocking the trap door. (We've had playgroup at our house enough times to see almost every child does this.) It seems like a great idea for a toy, but I wonder how much Fisher Price tested it before they put it on the shelves. I expected more from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A FUN TOY","review":"My daughter is 3 1/2 yrs. old and really love the fun park.

The quality of the plastic is very cheap. It assembled very quickly, but not as quickly as my son tore it apart. The set falls apart very easily.

The top of Roller Coaster kept coming off and the loop track came off very easily. (which my son had around his neck in a matter of seconds.)

Most folks use a blender full of adjectives to describe the sound as country, punk, blues, rock, swampy, earthy, Americana, funky, and whatever else comes to mind.Maybe it is and maybe it isn't but The Moaners have set the bar high for guitar-drum ensembles.

Unfortunately the construction of the rope is poor, the plastic handles break easily - mine cracked at the bearing end just from casual indoor use. I never dropeed the rope or treated it badly and from normal use the handles broke, bearings came out and now the rope is useless.I will be purchasing the Aero Speed - as I loved the design of Buddy Lee's ropes, and this one has aluminium handles so hopefully they wont crack and break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rope","review":"Great rope. I gave it 4 stars as I have not tried every rope out there, but this one is fast and a joy to use. The longer handles with the foam padding are comfortable. As the instructions go slow when you are cutting the rope down to size. I took a half inch off at a time the first few uses to make sure I did not go to short. I still have a few more inches to get rid of for a perfect fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action, easily broken","review":"When I first started using this rope I was blown away by how much cleaner and faster the rope turned than the others I had tried. But unfortunately, the plastic broke right at the insert between the rope screw and handle after only a month of casual use. I returned the rope for a new one, which broke in the same way after only two trips to the gym. The problem is that the rope starts to unscrew itself from the handle, which puts tremendous shearing force on the weakest part of the plastic handle as you rotate it up and down. I read something about applying a thread lock, which may be a solution. I can't believe such an expensive rope from the great Buddy Lee has such a fatal flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great rope but...handles are a weak spot","review":"This rope is great for jumping however, as others have mentioned, the rope has a weak spot right at the bearing insert point.I will buy the aluminum version as the performance in general is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Spike and Mike","review":"Has few of the humorous bits Spike and Mike's work is famous for.

They arrived today and there are flaws on each one! The glasses have seams spaced 1/3 of the way around each glass (total of 3 seams on each glass) that is rough. I have champagne flutes, wine glasses, cordial stemware, and shot glasses (bought by mistake but so cute I kept them), water tumblers and two pitchers in this pattern and none of the other pieces have seams like that. It is as if a step of the manufacturing was left off where the seams would be buffed smooth. Also, one box had paper dividers in the middle of the box only so the two glasses on either side bounced against each other during shipping. Of course the lips of those glasses are cracked and pieces have fallen out.

Mex takes a slower take on the track, one that emphasizes the sadness of the vocals, while Ashley Beedle goes for a more disco-oriented vibe, one that emphasizes the finger-snapping quality.

The instructional dvd is very well made by Dr. Ed Thomas which makes it easy to learn the Indian club exercises. There are plenty of exercises to learn and you also can create your own when your good enough. I purchased these 2 lbs. Indian clubs for our son (plays varsity football & wrestling) who is already pretty strong. I would say to someone with not a lot of strength to purchase the 1 pounder's for starting out. The Indian clubs are great and well made. This exercise system can really benefit your shoulder range, motion, flexibility, & strength. They also can help to avoid injury due to these benifits from being dedicated to using this system. Your grip, wrists, forearms, etc. will also benefit from these indian club exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motion RX Indian Clubs","review":"I purchased a set of 1# and 2-1/2 Motion RX Indian Clubs about a year ago. The major problem I have with the Motion RX Indian Clubs is they both weight much less than the stated weight which bothers me. The Motion RX Clubs also dent rather easily as mentioned in a previous review.On the plus side the Clubs are fairly well balanced, and they are easy to control. The DVD that came with the Clubs is adequate. It is limited to a few basic movements. If you are new to exercising with Indian Clubs it will safely get you started.Overall these Clubs are satisfactory for beginners and rehab. I rated the Clubs a two mainly because of the misstatement of the weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to a new method of exercise","review":"These clubs are well made and provide a great new way to work out. The main reason I purchased the 2 pound pair was because I wanted to focus on getting the technique down before going heavier. The instructional DVD is informative and easy to follow. It may not be HD or filmed on a big budget, but who cares? Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get started on Indian clubs/ clubbells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"DVD was excellent, club came with cracked handle and huge dent and DVD case was cracked. I will get my other clubs from another company. I have little spare time so I find it a hassle to return something.

I just taped the handle up, but I am not happy about it and feel they should have packed it more protected than they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fairly well","review":"Overall, I'm pretty happy with the table. But, I had two problems after a couple of months of use. First, if I'm using a heavy bit, like a raised pannel bit, the vibration causes the leveling set screws in the plate to rotate. So, I keep an allen wrench in my pocket to level the plate every few minutes. Annoying but not a show-stopper. Second, as I slide a work piece across the gap in the fence, it gets caught on the back half of the fence often. Not sure if it's me or a mis-alignment of the fence.

I love modern dance, and was not disappointed. The sensuality and steaminess within the dance only hightened my reaction towards this show. The story is simple to say the least... but then, it's based on a simple opera. This is a dynamite show and definitely worth the attention.(Please note: The review above is for that of the play. I have not seen the actual video noted here. Others' negative critiques may very well be agreeable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is a terribly disappointing video. I was expecting to see some incredible dancing. Instead, what we have throughout this recording, are close-ups of head and shoulders and a few seconds of group/long shots.

The costumes and sets are terrific. If only the cameras could stay still. I'm sure this performance was thrilling in the theater. Major dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant take on Carmen","review":"Matthew Bourne's Car Man is a simply brilliant redo of the classic opera of the (more or less) same name. The wonderful music is all there, the plot shifted to a western US auto repair shop (from cigars to auto parts, hmmm), and as with all ballet, no spoken dialogue. But I found it simply wonderful to watch, the dancers erotic without a doubt but in a highly entertaining way. If you like the music, or if you like dance, and especially if you like both, give this a try....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money-See the live show","review":"If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy.

This book was both cookie cutter and fundamentally boring. There was no romance, sparkle or passion. It was tedious with cipher characters and nothing interesting or remotely unpredictable happening. You compare this to Loretta Chase's Not Quite a Lady, or Lisa Valdez' Passion (which had a hero who was already engaged, and that was so emotionally wrenching!) and it falls with a thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exemplary","review":"I love this book because one of its chapter titles seems to sum up the spirit of contemporary feminism in just one simple phrase: \\"My life is hard because your life is easy.\\"To which sentiment I , an unreconstructed straight white male, would have to reply in the following manner: \\"Your life, Joanna, may well be as horrible as you say it is --god knows it looks unappealing -- but that has nothing to do with me. My happiness does not create your misery. My successes do not determine your failures. You and me, we have nothing more in common than the air we breath.

Unfortunately, Shapiro managed to take an exciting idea and turn it into a boring, meandering, too lengthy book. The main character was by turns too overanalytical and incredibly naive and unseeing. The book was so slow and scattered that I actually stopped halfway through and scanned the end (and yes, the obvious suspect was the guilty key to the whole thing).

I've tried it on a few of my old acne scars and it lightened them dramatically. I've purchased a 2nd tube of this and hope to have great results from this product again with some new scars I want faded. =D"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't trust it","review":"My star rating might be unfair to the product. The product is watery whereas the the scar gel samples I received from a plastic surgeon's office were thick and went on like a protective coating. The Spenco Scar Gel didn't inspire my confidence. The location of my scar (on my face) and the watery consistency of the 'gel' resulted in my regretting purchasing the product even though it was less expensive and had good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Product...","review":"I ordered this because I have a recent piercing scar and was hoping to heal it. I can say that I applied it several times a day and it made no difference at all in the appearance. I bought it because of the positive reviews and have since learned that so many reviews for products here on Amazon are shills paid by the company and this has to be on of them. I mean I used it for several weeks DAILY and it is a small scar from a monroe piercing and there is NO DIFFERENCE at all, NONE. Try something else because this doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"I broke my ankle 5 months ago and have a 7 inch incision scar.

The item contains no ingredients list, and may be just plain rubbing alcohol. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to Be Working","review":"I've been applying this twice a day for nearly a month. Two areas on my leg had a small, red, bumpy scar the size of a pea. My doctor called them something specific. Something that forms from a cut that didn't heal properly. Whatever they are from, this seems to be fading and flattenning them out. Less noticeable and hopefully will fade even more with time. I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Installed on warm night and everything went fine. Woke up to the front two cracked. Upon contacting there customer service was told go fly a kite and passed off to one after another and sent the forwarded email stating tag your it, as in there too lazy to take off it. Great customer service TAG (your f^&%$G Lazy seelers of junk). There must be better quality shade than these. Do not waste your hard earned money on something that no one will stand behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, lush, but old school","review":"I agree with pretty much everything the other esteemed reviewers have said about these recordings. I grew up with them. They are indeed old friends! They are lush, well played and extremely well executed.They are, however, reflective of where baroque music was back in I Musici's heyday 20 years ago. This makes them wonderfully played, but probably a bit tame. So much so, I was actually quite shocked that this was the recording of these I grew up with. The pace is almost languid.There is no denying it, though, at the Philips DUO price, they remain a bargain. Other, more daring renditions have a more daring price too. So, pick your poison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgrade now to his more recent work - Pool Light","review":"How can I diss the man who is - IMHO - one of today's greatest photographers. Well, I can't. But I will say that unless you are absolutely devoted to owning every book by Howard Schatz then you can skip this one and go straight to \\"Pool Light\\". That's his most recent attempt at underwater photography, and his experience shows. The photos in this book are a bit rawer than those in \\"Pool Light\\" - and by that I don't mean tawdry. This is still an excellent work. Those who have never seen his underwater photography will be stunned by the use of brilliant color, occasional distortion, and free-floating forms.\\"Pool Light\\" is a larger affair, and cost twice as much - but it's VERY well worth the price. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to be able to read Khmer - Good for khmer people learning english","review":"The book seems a good instrument in case a khmer person wants to learn English.

From initially starting out cubbing to learn how the newly merged Seaboard Coast Line and Seaboard Air Lines operate, through working as a brakeman to how he entered engine service to become an engineer. Doug takes us into the cab of the engine, The cupola of the caboose and into the crew rooms and layovers that are a railroader's life. Doug also allows many insights into his own life through these experiences. The night he was almost killed in a crankcase explosion, how it feels to collide with an auto and what he hopes for his son in the future. For anyone who wants to really know what it's like to work on the railroad, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely advertized as 3\\"","review":"Very disappointed because I thought I found what I was looking for!IT IS NOT 3 inches, as advertized, it is exactly 2.25inch in diameter. I entered asearch for a 3 inch Cast Iron Plett Pan, and the first that popped up was this one.But actually you would have to find the smallest eggs if you can find them and feed them to your family to fit in it. And even with that it would still overflow and make a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality","review":"I took the pan out of its box and immediately noticed that the 7 pancake holes were not straight sided like usual.

You can hear the same songs on other albums, but it isn't the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hot Acoustic Album","review":"Seether has always been known to write good songs, and on this live acoustic album, that being One Cold Night they perform these masterpieces live, and in the end we not only get the radio version of The Gift, which is a fantastically done song, but we also get Tied My Hands, from their first record in South Africa, Fragile. The only problem is that on the song Diseased, they scream when it is not the heavy version of the song. But nevertheless, I love this album, just like ANYTHING ELSE Seether has done.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"wounderful sonatas, questionable performance","review":"When I found this recording in my library I was sourprised: The most beloved sonatas of Beethoven, played by a pianist I appreciate so much. How could I forget I own it?I listened again, and understood. The sonatas are wounderful, but the playing is at most OK, and these works deserve much more. Almost every piece here has at least one much better performance: I prefer, for instance Gilels for the Appasionata, Rubinstein for the Pathetique, and Barenboim for the Les Adieux. This recording simply doesn't get to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Very disappointing recordings from the 70's. Some odd choice of tempo from Brendel; the Adagio Cantabile from the Pathetique seems to drag with heavy accompaniment while some passages of the Rondo are so fast that in combination with mediocre sound quality they lose clarity. The Andante of the Appassionata is spoiled by an urgency rendering the final Allegro movement relatively less dramatic. Also the subjects in the Allegro do not sing out as they could - just listen to Barenboim's recording. Not recommended even if you are on a tight budget. Try Barenboim or Ashkenazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to Put You to Sleep","review":"I find Brendel's playing style washy, imprecise, sluggish, and completely without fire. In a word, boring! He is the anti-Glenn Gould."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my \\"favourite\\" CDs","review":"While Alfred Brendel is very popular, and said to be very good, and this CD set has many of the more famous Beethoven sonatas, this CD is terrible. The only reason I gave this two stars was because of the number of famous sonatas. Brendel's playing itself, however, is so unbelievably mechanical and \\"dry,\\" I don't know how anyone can like him. He uses no pedal, which I had never heard before on a Beethoven CD, and have concluded that it sounds horrible. The only reason someone would buy this would be to at least have one, fairly cheap, copy of the famous Beethoven sonatas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate and not one second","review":"I bought this thermometer yesterday at Tuesday morning for 19.99, I've tried it about 20 times and received 20 different readings on the same person, when it gives a reading at all. The batteries that come with it are useless. I'm probably going to return it. When my grandson has a temperature, it's going to be too frustrating to not know if the thermometer is accurate, from 99.8 to 97.6 to 98.4 to 96.7 within less than a minute. That's too much of a variance to be reliable. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely unreliable","review":"I have to agree with the previous two reviewers. I recently purchased this thermometer and was shocked to find how unreliable it was. I wouldn't be surprised if the multiple measurements were a little off, but the range of different readings were off by as much as 3 degrees (and we did follow the instructions, including pulling on the earlobe in the appropriate direction to straighten the ear canal).We called customer service and they said that they would send us a new one. After reading the other two reviews here, I suspect that it'll find itself in the trash. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I can't believe that anyone would sell a thermometer that is so unreliable. The temperature given varies more than 2 degrees. At best you can say if they probably do or don't have a fever. I can tell just as much by touching their forehead. Don't waste your money on junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"work very well","review":"This set of transparency markers works well and offers a slight variety of colors to choose from.The markers write easily, and also wash away easily with water from anything except skin. From experience I know that cleaning off transparency sheets written with these markers is very easy, but leaves one's hands stained.The colors offered are very basic, but all useful, and tend to show up well.

There are wonderful moments where it seems as though It really is Gwendolyn who could be speaking the lines on the page. But on the whole, you get more of an inside glimpse of MacEwan by reading her own work, rather than through Griffiths' play. It is a good attempt, but anyone who has read much of Gwendolyn MacEwan's work will likely be disappointed, as more of the writer's self-indulgence is visible than MacEwan herself. but it does pay a tribute to this often neglected brillant Canadian poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regular cut up","review":"Good pastry blender.

Record the entire session in a subway tunnel on a two track recorder.4. Release the album via Mexico ensuring my new aggression of NAFTA.5.

Despite having good luck with Russell Athletic apparel in the past, these shirts are a SERIOUS disappointment and a waste of money. The neck band rolled within the first five minutes of wear and the shirts began to pill after the first washing. The ironic thing is that there were no less than three separate inspector tags taped to the inside of the shirt!

For starters the box was not wrapped in cellophane the way a new box of this perfume would be wrapped at a reputable store. The spray nozzle with balloon attached was dirty and tarnished. Moreover it was missing the little plastic tube that goes down into the perfume allowing you to spray it. Finally the perfume had kind of an alcohol smell, the way perfume gets when you've had it for too long. I don't think it's worth the $50 (or I now see the price has gone up to $60) for what appears to be old/used perfume. Go somewhere else and pay the extra $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"got tricked","review":"This Prada by Prada is not the one I thought I was ordering. I wanted the Prada \\"tendre\\", which has a much more feminine and mild fragance. When I received the order, I immediately noticed the difference in the color. The \\"tendre\\" one is like in the picture posted here, light pink, so I thought I was ordering the right one. The one I received is light brownish. The fragrance is much more woody and masculine. I called the company to let them know, but they didn't care about the misunderstanding and did not offer an exchange. They should have specified that this is not the tendre Prada. Be aware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was very disappointed with this product after opening it. I could not smell even a hint of garlic, unlike Gaia brand, and since garlic has a very strong smell even in small quantities.

The authers name is dav pilkey. George, Harold, and Captain Underpants are the main characters. George and Harold are funny. They play hilarious pranks on clueless Mr. Krupp and get caught in some very puzzle-ing situations. I would recommend this book to people who like funny books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Underpants","review":"As my two grandsons like the Captain Underpants books, I bought some as a birthday present. A quick look at the contents left me very disappointed and the main reason for that is that the character's words are so grammatically incorrect, they made me shiver. How can these books be educational for young children, when all they learn is incorrect grammar!!!! It seems to me that they would have had more educational value if the correct words had been used. I wish that I had reviewed these books before buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt tell you","review":"Since I NEVER received the book I cannot comment on it!

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept - Poor Execution","review":"My son loves the books, so when we bought this one, we thought it would be a real winner. We were, unfortunately, wrong. The problem is that it is an activity book whose pages unbind and drop out too easily, and it is not a good size for laying down and writing in or drawing in. Because it is the same size and binding type as the \\"reading\\" books, it just doesn't lend itself to being an \\"activity book\\".Content is fine and right in line with the other books. I just think the execution is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraged my son to read","review":"Although this isn't a great work of literature by any means.....it encouraged my 1st grader to read!

I don't have the problem of loose Velcro that other reviewers have noted, but it takes using both bands of the pair stuck together to be long enough to wrap around one leg. One band might be long enough to reach around the leg or upper arm of a small child. No way is it long enough for the leg or upper arm of an athletic adult in good shape. The good thing about this product is its very bright reflectivity. If the bands were longer, I would rate them 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Velcros bad with time","review":"Lost one right away since the velcro did not hold. Great idea, just not a great execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"Trying to remove these from the package the velcro fell completely off, as it was not sewn on properly/securely. Very flimsy. Seem to be fairly reflective, but due to the poor quality, we would not buy these again. Still looking for a better alternative for night-time dog walking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"who are these made for, pixies?","review":"These are reflective all right, but I'm not sure who they are designed to fit. I have average-sized arms for a woman, not that big, but the bands BARELY fit around my arm. I have to squeeze my arms somewhat, and forget it if I'm wearing a thicker, warmer top for running in cold weather. I can't see how these would fit most men at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and good for biking","review":"I use these over my pants for biking to work - they definitely do the job very well. I am a bit worried that the velco will wear sooner than later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work just fine!","review":"I tried another brand before this one. I like these much better because they are reasonably well made and are just the right size and provide a nice sized reflective surface. I would rate them a 5 if they helped me climb faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small bands","review":"These reflective bands are nice for keeping your pants from getting tangled in your chain while riding a bike, but they would not fit around my ankle when I am wearing boots. Seems stupid, but I wear boots when I am on call for my volunteer Fire/EMT position, and I still like to ride my bike, so it was a bummer they didn't fit while in my uniform. I guess they also wouldn't work if someone had rather large calves or ankles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"I've seen other leg bands, and the quality of these were much better especially given the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"To small for around arms","review":"These are well made and very reflective but there is no normal sized human being whose arm/bicep these are going to fit around. Not even close. And forget it if you want to wear them over a jacket. These need to be at least 3-4\\" longer. The velcro placement does allow two straps to be put together and used as one bigger band but there is not enough velcro to allow for adequate size adjustment. Better to call these wrist or ankle straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"listing is miss-labels ~ these are leg bands (sizing and package say so)","review":"The listing is mislabels ~ there are leg bands(small sizing and package say \\"leg bands\\"). The reflective portion is also narrower than advertised. They have included the black non-reflective edging as part of the measurement. Just as a heads up ~ the backing is felt. I do not think the backing will hold up and since the sizing is for ankles will be returning. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I bought this book to give it as a Christmas gift. The kid (4 years old) recived many toys last Christmas, but my gift was his favorite.

However I was displeased with this shoe. The picture can be quite deceiving, it looks a longer when worn. This gives the shoe a boat like appearance that I found to be unattractive. I suggest watching a review on youtube just so you can get a more accurate presentation of these shoes. Secondly whenever it rains outside (with thunder) my team takes up a nice game of Futsal indoors in the gym. Let me just say that these shoes had 0 traction. I was literally slipping and gliding, and for all who've played Futsal you know it's a game where ball control is crucial.I'll give these four stars because they're meant to be casual sneakers, some people may like the look, and because they are a charming classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is this awesome shoes the reviewers are raving about?","review":"I intend to change my review later after I break them in.As of right now, they're only pretty on the outside.On the inside they feel tight even though I ordered a full size larger to avoid that. Theres also an astonishing lack of cushioning on the inside. The tounge is the thinnest I've ever got on a sneaker before. It makes me wonder where in the hell did the $65 go into making this shoe.The tounge also likes to venture on its own and slip to the side of my foot. I guess I underestimated the usefullness of the tongue holds on my old pair of shoes because I went well over 2 years without having to tie them once, while these shoes seem to demand that I constantly need to reshift them. I'm scared that the lack of cloth padding on the inside is going chafe and blister the back of my feet.I hope these end up being as comfortable as the reviews say. I'll re-edit my opinions in a month or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic adidas kicks.","review":"They look and feel old school. I wore these through New York all day as I walked around and scoped the attractions. My only complaint is that the tongue of the sneakers makes them squeak if you tie them tight. Other than that, this is a very stylish and comfortable shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unparalleled touch on the ball","review":"I know that technically these are for leisure, but when it comes to playing indoor in them, the shoe molds to your foot like no other and permits amazing weight for passes.

If you don't have wide feet, I think they would have made fine shoes. At least, they look awesome.

I did the research and brought the book anyway, because I want to see what Whitney has to say. It turns out a lot better than I had expected.

Big disappointment! I expected the same duplex printing that I get with the laser printer at work: fire and forget, duplex done automatically. No such luck. First discovery: you still have to take the paper output and feed it back in again by hand through the input tray to get duplex. Second: if you try to print a document with an odd number of pages, it gets all screwed up.This device is a very tiny improvement over the manual duplex printing that you can do without this ill-conceived $80 add-on.

This is a MARINE unit, right? Designed to be around water?? Hmmm... anyway I dried it out as best as I could, it still would not play. It was still under warranty so I sent it in for a look. The repair center said it had gotten wet but since it was under warranty they sent me back a new detachable faceplate. After that I was very protective of it, never let it stay out in the boat overnight, and again it only lasted about two months before the radio portion of it completely quit one sunny morning. It still works as a CD player, but that's it. So, I'm currently in the market for a new unit but sorry to say it won't be this one again.

I contacted pyle whose response was we will getback to you on how to get a replacement. They never got back to me. Even after many emails and calls where I am told that a manager is not avaiable but will return my call.

This is not the book for someone planning to build a performance sailboat out of expensive specialized plywood and epoxy resin. Still, this book is worth reading for the evocative discription of boatbuilding as recreation in a bygone era. It can take the stress out of your project and remind you why you are building a boat in the first place, which is to please yourself. For those in search of instruction in building modern craft, \\"Gourgeon Brothers on Boat Construction\\" is as good as any. For classic construction methods, \\"Boatbuilding\\" by Howard Chapelle and \\"Boatbuilding Manual\\" by Robert M Steward are mandatory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plain language for the novice boat builder","review":"This book is not as detailed as some of the other boat building books available, but it is a good place to start.

There are no other words to describe this interpretation other than utterly and completely beautiful.

Traditional songs with clear melodies-- such as \\"Christ Child\\" and \\"Green Groweth the Holly\\" are exquisite indeed, but McKeown indulges too often in singing songs of her own composition. McKeown is, at best, a mediocre lyricist. I don't know if she left the melodies out of her own songs (the title track, for example) unintentionally, or if she imagines that she is being modern and hip by so wasting her voice. Songs without music may wash with lovers of alternative rock, but people who listen to this sort of thing are looking to please thier ears. I believe that Mckeown's specatacular, powerful voice could make her as popular as Loreena McKennit, if only she'd realize where her talents lie. Her \\"Bushes and Briars\\", an album of traditional songs, most of which have melodies, is a better bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matti Salminen then and now","review":"Matti Salminen is still, even in his mid-sixties, the greatest Hagen my generation has ever had. His appearance shows his age but his voice is still extremely powerful, cavernous and booming. And he's still a fantastic actor with a special gift for playing menacing characters. In the 1990 PBS broadcast performance from the Metropolitan opera, his Hagen was evil but also appealing in a way--I felt for him when he sang that his blood would taint the blood-brotherhood drink; also in his conference with Alberich. In this Valencia performance he's never appealing. He's pure-evil nasty from beginning to end, evoking fear but not sympathy. I don't think he smiles once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-modern Flim-flam","review":"I checked this out from my local library. Needless to say, I am elated I did not buy it.

One more thing that is very noticeable is the lyricism of the cello tone that almost resembles that of a human voice; it is so light and transparent, as perfectly exhibited in the second movement of the Trio No.1, that at times it could be mistaken for violin.This is one Schubert recording you should not miss, and I actually think I like this more than the overplayed (although very much deservedly) Trout Quintet. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this for the Grumiaux trio's performance of D 581","review":"Schubert lovers may be drawn to this CD because of the Beaux Art trio's fame, but the best performance on the CD is the Grumiaux trio's String trio in B flat.

The Philips sound is clean and full and these performances, especially of the Etudes, leave nothing to be desired. No dreamy indulgence here, just penetrating exploration of Debussy's unique tonal world. At this price, the complete duo-piano music (in which Haas is joined by Noel Lee) is a bonus!

I read about it and became very excited about the gameplay and the new ideas. But then I actually played it. With all the time, effort and money put into this game, why is there absolutly no single player story mode. This is based on a world with some of the richest history in pen-and-paper rpgs out there. Why could they not even muster up the time to put in even an average single player mode. (the lame bot matches and training missions don't count) I mean for crying out loud, even halo and gears of war had memorable storys and characters. And those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. Its not that the gameplay is bad. The multi-player is actually very well thought out. But for a game that costs us 60 dollars, there is absolutly no excuse for no story mode. I'm not even going to start on the lack of maps.

While mildly entertaining, this game feels like a glorified Counter-Strike mod. The game offers a whole 3 game modes, 4 classes, a lackluster 8 avatar skins, 9 maps, and a handful of gear/spells. The graphics are muddy at best and to top it all off the game is an online-only multiplayer game with no splitscreen option.Second, as for the original fans, this game is Shadowrun in name only. Almost every ability included in this game stands in direct contradiction to the canon of the establish IP, meaning every one of the restricted/prohibitted or otherwise impossible aspects in the original universe are reversed in this game.So in conclusion if your a FPS fan pass this one up and wait for something better such as; The Darkness, Quake Wars, Crysis, Halo 3, Team Fortress 2 or any of the plethora of FPS on the horizon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME IS MORE ADDICTIVE THAN CRACK!","review":"OK Alot of people say this game sucks because of the multiplayer...Well you should research something before you buy it!

I recommend thoes albums to any one who want's to know about Pat. To me what made this album even worse is Pat was locked up for about 4 years so u would think after being locked up that long and the fans are waitin on u to drop an album that u would come out with somethin great.

The author fails to understand the distinction between donors and parents and frequently refers to the donors as parents. This is not only confusing but misrepresentative.

Don't be confused, this is an opera of the life of the composer Palestrina, not a work actually produced by him. Peter Schreier is a fabulous Palestrina. This piece's tempo keeps moving, but does not push. The music in the sene with the ghosts of the past composers is superbly sung and played. The sene where the patriarchs, archbishops, and cardinals debate Palestrina's new Mass is full of power and passion. The singers even in the minor roles execute their performances beautifully. The sene where the Pope gives his benediction to Palestrina (Schreier) is moving and paternal. I would recommend this version to anyone interested in great music and the life of the composer Palestrina. Hans Hotter out did himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"Great performance? Absolutely! What an ensemble of musicians and singers!

Haas offers what is on the page and does it beautifully. The playing is also, from a technical aspect, absolutely perfect. I cant find any \\"Teutonic\\" qualities as the other reviewer said. Instead I found much tenderness and subtlety as there should be. There only bad quality I could find is with the recording. Since it is old, from the late sixties, there is a noticeable hiss, especially in the quieter passages. It is, as with the case of all Philips CDs, slightly expensive for the amount of music, but nonetheless still a great purchase. This is a must buy. I only lament that this, along with his equally great recording of Ravel's works, is all there really is from Mr. Haas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"As far as I am concerned, John Williams has blown away the competition in classical symphony with his new, young, and up beat style music. Truly, he is a revolutionary, and represents the modern era of utterly pleasing to the mind and soul music. In response to the overwhelming concern of redundant themes in his score, I believe that it simply portrays the continuity of his personality throughout all his works, and serves as a great and unsurpassed trademark. This addition seamlessly falls in with its brothers and sisters of previous sounds tracks. No other soundtrack composer's music can flow from movie to movie like William's. Needless to say, add it to your favorite playlists, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's missing","review":"Something is missing from this soundtrack, and I'm not just talking about the Fox Fanfare fanfare. Don't get me wrong, this track has its moments, but nothing that meets the higher tones of the first three movie soundtracks, and the somewhat funnish feel of \\"Phantom Menace\\" but it still has a few high moments, dispite the darker feel to the entire soundtrack.But I guess that's the whole point: the movie has a darker feel, so it would be obvious that the soundtrack has a darker feel as well. For the classic Star Wars fans, you do see shadows of the old soundtracks bleeding through, my favorite is the \\"Imperial March\\" overture in \\"Confrontation with Count Dooku\\"Am I telling you not to get this track? Au contraire, just don't expect the flightier music of the previous soundtracks, is all. So what is missing? I just said it, the lighter feel of the old soundtracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music But Lucas Butchered it","review":"I saw the film last night = great film. the music i have not gotten the cd yet. i wanted to though very much. From the day this cd came out I have read many reviews about the score and how its layed out its the same as TPM but this time this film music is butchered by the directer - not John Willams. In past Williams scores sure you got a few selected cues from the film but those were not butchered up like this. From what I have listend to so far that its a mix of \\"ACROSS THE STARS\\" and an action cue or it just sounds the same. But if I were you I would wait for the 2 cd set and if you have not gotten the 2cd set of TPM I would get that other then this and have that to hold you over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a disappointment","review":"In many ways, Williams became famous for Star Wars.But \\"Attack of the Clones\\" (AOTC) is perhaps the weakest of all Star Wars scores.In simple terms, this score reminded me of Jurrasic Park to the point where I believed I WAS listening to Jurrasic.The only definitive theme in the score was the love theme. But I must painfully state that it sounded too inspired and un-original, not to mention that it was repeated to bloody death throughout the CD.The constant violence and randomness of the music during action sequences is very disappointing. I felt I was listening to either the orchestra warming up or an amateur composer. The bashing and poor attempts at innovation do nothing except bore the listener with endless noise.I do not hate Williams. I love 90% of his other work. But this is clearly not his best. Nowhere near it."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams has done it again.","review":"Add another classic to John William's list of amazing movie scores. \\"Across the Stars\\" is hauntingly beautiful, and the use of winds and strings is wonderful. The piece gives a much more passionate and intimate feeling than did \\"Luke and Leia\\" from Return of the Jedi. Also wonderful is \\"Zam the Assassin\\". With pounding percussion and occasional electric guitar, it paints a musical picture of the skyways of Coruscant.I only had one problem, that being that most of the pieces deferred back to \\"Across the Stars\\". The Phantom Menace's soundtrack had definite differences to the sounds with the droid army's theme and \\"Duel of the Fates\\". That is the only thing that drops this CD to 4 stars.But all in all, John Williams proves with this soundtrack that he is still the master of movie score writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting Star Wars Music","review":"This soundtrack is one of the best that John Williams has ever done. He employs both dark and tragic melodies while interpolating these with soft motifs. Perhaps the most tragic piece on this recording is the love theme for Anakin and Padme, the first love theme for Star Wars. This piece perfectly conveys the tragic consequences that this love holds for the galaxy. However, the best part of the soundtrack is the fact that he uses the themes from the previous movies, to provide links between the classic trilogy and the new one. When he uses the \\"Duel of the Fates\\" when Anakin is searching for his mother did the trick for me. Also, when he uses \\"The Imperial March\\" on the two occasions, he showed what a truly great talent John Williams is. This truly brings \\"Attack of the Clones\\" to the top of the Star Wars totem pole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"Wow! This CD is fantastic! The love theme just takes your breath away. It is very beautiful. :)The only thing I didn't like about this CD, is that it didn't have the great music that plays in the scene where Anakin and Padmé are in the droid factory. That is good music, and I was dissapointed that it wasn't included in the soundtrack.Overall a wonderful CD. I would suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack","review":"This is really a great soundtrack. The only thing missing is the rest of the movie. With the other movies (Episodes I, IV, V, and VI), you could get the \\"full\\" soundtrack.

John Williams is such a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely John Williams","review":"This score is includes the typical music that has made John Williams famous all over the world, and one of the most prestigious film composers.It features also some new instruments and sounds that i had never heard from him. We have to wait to see the movie, but even without having seen it, i can tell that it's a very immersive score, you can see all that Lucas' universe if you listen to this music with your eyes closed.Wonderful piece of music in \\"Across the Stars\\" it represents perfectly the meaning of the love stry between Anakin and Amidala, beautiful and tragic at the same time.Some people may say that this score, along with \\"Phantom Menace\\" is not as good as the ones from the first trilogy. I would say that it's kinda different in many ways, not exactly the same music, but in any case i would say it's inferior or worse.Enjoy it, all you music fans, and may the force be with you.:)Agustín"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams does it again","review":"What a beautiful sound track. Accross the Stars is an incredible love theme that expresses the love between Anakin & Oadme but also foreshadows the darkness that is to befall our heroes. This darkness is fortold during the confrontation with Count Dooku when Darth Vaders theme is heard before the climatic rush of Accross the Stars. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for more...","review":"Whenever a Star Wars film hits the screen, we, as a musical audience, are taunted with a mere 10-16 tracks that seem to be plucked from the movie. Often times these are concert pieces of the best themes in the film or actual pieces from the film mixed & mashed together. Either way, they are wonderful, but sadly lacking. With the original trilogy, we had to wait almost 20 years for the full scores. Fortunately, with \\"The Phantom Menace\\" we only waited a year or so until The Ultimate Edition.Where I enjoyed the scant selections from \\"Attack of the Clones\\", I'm waiting for the full score from the film. The 13 tracks are nice & have a few FUN surprises in them, but they're really just a tease. The only real gripe I have (aside from the CD being too short) is the same I had with Phantom... not enough use of the Star Wars theme. In the Clones soundtrack, it's present in the Main & End titles & that's about it.So, if you like Star Wars, buy the score. It's short, but sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams Has Done It Again!","review":"The soundtrack to the follow-up of Episode I is simply, amazing. Comparing it to the Phantom Menace soundtrack can not happen! Both are totally different in their scores themselves. Of course like the famous \\"Dual Of The Fates\\", John Williams has created a touching, heart-filled, and mysterious love theme for Episode II, \\"Across The Stars\\". Simply put it, it is beautiful, though not as powerful as \\"Dual\\" was when realeased! Other songs to it are simply outstanding like the \\"Anakin And Padme\\" or \\"The Meadow Pinic\\" scores, all the songs, well mostly all the songs revolve with the slight hum of the main score from the Love Theme. The songs are nto only filled with love but with a tone of mystery. As with the movie, in which Anakin falls in love as well as turn to the dark side, it shows both of these perfectly. PERFECT FIVE STARS, BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"The Attack of the Clones Soundtrack enchanted me from the moment I got home and put in my stereo. The music is exciting when it wants to be, is glorious when it wants to be, and beautiful when it wants to be. The Love Theme from Attack of the Clones is a magnificient piece, will have a permanent place in my playlist, right next to Duel of the Fates. A perfect soundtrack to a hopefully perfect movie!!The only possible way this soundtrack could get better is in a Two-Disc Set, which I can't wait for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas should quit the cut and pasting","review":"It was tragic watching 'Attack of the Clones' in the theaters, listening to passage after passage of re-used 'Phantom Menace' tracks. Shame on Lucas and crew, and shame on the studio execs who released this LIMITED collection of tracks on CD. The music is beautiful but over too soon. What other music was there in the film? What music got scrapped?Lucas created the original Star Wars 20+ years ago, and without Williams score his film would have been another 'Logans Run.' Williams is THE star of the Star Wars films, and his music was [not treated well] in 'Attack of the Clones'. Lucas and crew should know better.Think about it: what music could we have heard as Anakin and Padme arrive on Geonosis, or in the arena battle, or in the clone battle? Certainly new music, and not 'cut and paste' music from Phantom Menace. The treatment of Williams music in 'Clones' was SHAMEFUL and sad. Lucas and company should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff. Welcome back to a galaxy far far away.","review":"I really don't know what to say about this score except that I loved it. John Williams again expertly mixes lots of excellent brand new music with snippets of tunes from previous Star Wars movies to weave together a beautiful tapestry. This has just the right balance of different kinds of moods in it, going from tense and mysterious, to heroic and adventurous, to tender and beautiful and back again. Every track was wonderful. Even an electric guitar was used in one piece and it fit beautifully. Soft choral passages in two pieces worked like a charm. And the love theme made me cry. While there are standout tracks, each track to me is excellent. None of these pieces are weak at all in any sense of the word. Pick this up and follow John Williams along as he takes you on another brilliant musical tour of a galaxy far far away. Enjoy it. Peace. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack to perhaps the definitive Star Wars film","review":"Ok, I aint seen the movie yet, but this one is the crux of the whole saga -- where Anakin goes bad. And all because of love, or rather love denied. As a Jedi, he cannot take a lover, yet he is passionately in love with Padme. The love theme Across The Stars engages this doomed romance with grandeur, and is perhaps the best of the Star Wars themes. Let's hope there will be a complete score (a la Phantom Menace special edition) some time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Star Wars Score","review":"Yes, this is truly the best Star Wars score that Williams has ever wrote, and is truly his greatest work of all time. From the infatuating \\"Across the Stars\\" love theme, to the revival of the \\"Imperial March\\" in all its grandeur, this is Williams at his best. Every piece seems like new, or at least recycled well. Every track features its own personality and brings a newfound sense of greatness into the Star Wars universe. The Finale is sure to bring you chills. This is really music at its greatest (especially when listening with a THX certified sound system). It is a must buy for any music fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new....","review":"I was rather disappointed listening to John William's latest Star Wars score. Nothing in the cd stands out as memorable or original. Williams use of drum solos in the chase sequence echoes Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon soundtrack but it never achieves originality. The Love theme sounds like a variation of Williams' theme to Harry Potter, and I swear at one point he just lifts part of his own score to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The only exciting moment on the CD is when Yoda's Theme and the Imperial March start up, both of which we've all heard before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather unimpressive, but typical of Star Wars today.","review":"I've only listened to the CD a couple times, but not only do I find this the weakest of all the Star Wars soundtracks, but probably one of Williams' blandest. I can hardly compare this to the stellar achievement of the Empire soundtrack, or the musical beauty of the Star Wars soundtrack. It even fell below the Episode 1 soundtrack, and this kind of relegates it for me. It was like he did it in a rush and had to borrow a lot. If it grows on me I will modify my review, but I found nothing on this CD to cheer about.Now two years later, I give it an extra star, to three. I actually have ended up listened to it more than the Episode 1 soundtrack, often quietly as background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd.","review":"This cd. is so cool. I just love the music. The songs are in enchating. I can't wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Full Circle","review":"Destined to become a favorite with Star Wars fans, the latest soundtrack offers more brilliance from John Williams. This is a more satisfying effort than the Phantom Menace, and begins to come full circle as themes from Episode 1 come together with stunning new music, as well as the re-introduction of classic Star Wars themes. 'Across The Stars' is sure to become another romantic favorite along with 'Princess Leia's Theme,' 'Han Solo and The Princess,' and 'Luke and Leia' from the original trilogy.Williams uses an awesome blend of percussion as well as strangely, psychotic flourishes of electric guitar on Track 3.It is also fantastic to hear the emergence of 'The Imperial March' as well as 'Yoda's Theme' on this soundtrack.Great music. Simply stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"(GREAT SOUNDTRACK TO A GREAT MOVIE)","review":"I bought the soundtrack last april and it was great I havelisten to it a lot since then.My favorite track is #13 becacusethe new theme to Anakin is back to back with the old Darth Vadertheme it give ya goese bumps because you know what already happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected","review":"The correct Williams soundtrack. Everything here is like a clock, and he's so graphic that sometimes he may be telling us the movie. It's 50% the story, you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good. very moving.","review":"This soundtrack has arrived and it is better than The Phantom Menace score, although a bit mellower. The presence of Star Wars is fuller and themes of old raise it to an almost instant classic level. Very majestic, especially the love theme. If you care about Star Wars, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredbile soundtrack from the master of great music, JW","review":"John Williams is truly magical. All of the songs draw you into the moment and really keep the suspense as well. The soundtrack is a wonderful assortment of all great new songs for Episode 2 with some oldies mixed in. I really enjoy this soundtrack. Confrontation w/ Count Dooku and Finale is & Across the Stars are captivating songs. It's one of the best soundtracks for the Star Wars set"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome!","review":"What can you say, it's Star Wars! This CD is great. I have all the soundtracks to the Star Wars movies. I'd say this is one of my favorites. There's not a single piece that commands attention like \\"Duel of the Fates,\\" but it's really cool how Williams starts adding some of the themes of the later movies, especially with Confrontation with Count Dooku. They start playing the Imperial theme. I can imagine what's going on during this time, but I won't say for fear of spoiling the movie for anyone. Let's just say I think Attack of the Clones will parallel The Empire Strikes Back in many regards, and remember what happened to Luke at the end of that.The Love Theme is really awesome! It's a lot different from all the other Star Wars music we've heard so far.This is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh not as good as I expected","review":"It's very typical John Williams music. This CD is mostly background-soundeffect music. Not a whole lot of actual music. The best music is the love theme -- track 2, but this melody is repeated often through the other tracks. There are some short repeats of music from the previous starwars movies. The CD is ok but not great. Maybe I'll like it better after I see the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not Star Wars","review":"Every once in a while a score comes along that transcends the media for which it was created, either stage, screen, or television. John Williams accomplished this with his original Star Wars score and to a lesser extent with Episode I and \\"Duel of the Fates.\\" Unfortunately the music for Attack of the Clones falls far short of the standard we've come to expect from Hollywood's premier composer.Listen to \\"Across the Stars\\" and DON'T think of Hook, I dare you. Uninspired and largely thematically irrelevant, the entire score rambles like a sentence without punctuation, and leaves the listener wanting much more.Perhaps the movie will make up for it by being able to carry the music for a change, but I'm already sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams hasn't let us down!","review":"This is probably my second favorite of the prequels, mainly because of the Love Theme. It's so emotional, and sort of unlike Star Wars, which is why I love it so much. However, you also get your fill of action (listen to the \\"Chase Through Coruscant\\" and \\"Love Pledge and the Arena;\\" you'll know what I mean!) The End Credits probably is my favorite song on the disk, because it starts to incorporate Darth Vader's theme (listen very carefully at the very, very end... the cello makes you shiver!) with the Love Theme. A good foreshadowing of events, in my humble opinion. I'd highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams does it again","review":"I have always loved the music of Star Wars, and this album is no exception. The Love Theme is, in a word, beautiful. You simply cannot go wrong with John Williams. Williams's music always has his signature sound- so while it's true that it sometimes makes different songs from different movies sound the same, it is the familiar feeling of his music that makes me smile. It's an old friend come to visit.Another triumph, sir!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!","review":"I am a TOTAL star wars fan. I love this cd because i like track 7when jango fett and Obi-Wan-Kenobi are fighting. And I like track 3 when Obi-wan and anikins speeder is chasing zam wessel's speeder. I own this cd and I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"SW Attack of the Clones original soundtrack","review":"Powerful music. As always John Williams is brilliant! A must for every Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By The Title","review":"The title leads you to to believe the book will be a survey of horror books and films. Instead, it's an ultra-consevative political rant that refers to specific horror works only occasionally in order to score dubious points. The author hijacks Stephen King's insight, \\"the horror story is as conservative as an Illinois Republican in a three-piece suit\\", and proceeds to hammer his themes over and over: sex=death, everything was better before the 16th century, a group called the Illuminati is plotting to take over the world. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MAIN THEME IS MISSING!!!!!!!!!","review":"What is wrong with these imbeciles? The best piece of music on this show, the main theme, IS NOT HERE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never use Amazon again.","review":"I was totally disgusted with the product that was sent to me. It was dirty,, scratched and four song s couldn't be played whatsoever. I won't be purchasing any more products via Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT light up","review":"I ordered this item in October 2010, and the toy I received does NOT light up, it just plays music. It is also somewhat different from the picture shown. There is no ring at the top, just a strap with a velcro closure to hang it by. And the pull cord is not at the top of the star but attached at the bottom middle of the star (just under the baby's chin). Also, the butterfly is hanging from the pull cord at the bottom middle and there is no snail (so there are only 3 items hanging from it instead of 4).I wonder if there are two different versions of this toy, one that lights up and one that doesn't?.... But even the manufacturer's tag attached right to it says it's supposed to light up, so I doubt it's a case of them mistakenly shipping the wrong item. Very disappointed, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and requested a replacement. If the replacement does not light up either I will return the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price tag; no batteries required!","review":"This toy has it all for babies 0-12 months. Lights, music, teethers and a mirror. Best of all the toy is wind-up so no worries about changing batteries. Great for car rides and on the changing mat. Handy hook means baby can't misplace it while you're driving, too! Price might raise some eyebrows, but this is a quality toy and will survive the test of time and several siblings. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music for everybody","review":"very mellow mix and lots of good songs,was expecting only 1 good song but the cd pulled trhrough the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpeice","review":"This album unfurls like an epic masterpeice. Their lyrics and song titles are still growing more serious and farther from the toungue-in-cheek joke-driven material that spearheaded their career, but their picking harmonics and layered vocal and string harmonies are mind-numbingly precise this time around. This is a really beautiful album, but the songs have a certain maturity that may turn off listeners who are still hooked on the way they sounded three albums back. Whatever! This is a very ambitious record that I like much better than any of Cave-In's spacey post-rock, and much better than groups who only have one good album (like Sparta). Minus the bear are an ever-evolving group, even though none of their work is really a major departure. I guess the little changes turn some people off though. Get it anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"playback melodies and invigorating noises","review":"Much of the music on the CD uses recorded guitar played back over a foot pedal, at different intervals, and the resulting sound is awesome.The drums are also amazing. Definitely purchase this if you or someone you know is experimenting with new guitar/drum angles or looking for something eerie in their music-making. The song moods are all over the emotional spectrum and its great: manic, sultry, regretful, amorous. I have listened to it, through and though, dozens of times and it doesn't get old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeping in mind I am a huge MTB fan. Revised","review":"Im not sure what is going on, maybe I am just not listening to it correctly but this is the first ever release by mtb that I didnt instantly love. I have tried listening to it on several occasions and have yet to be brought in at all. Maybe in 2 years from now I will find it under my desk, throw it in and be like \\"Ohhhh, ok, now I get it.\\" For now I would say its a pass.Ok a few months later and after learning to skip the first two songs I get it. This is a great album and the last song is spectacular, I still maintain that it is not as good as the other releases but they set the bar pretty dam high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic resource","review":"I bought this book to polish my English grammar skills. The whole structure of this book with all the exercises is simply fantastic. I go through 30 to 40 exercises every day and make progress fast.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any other program","review":"I purchase plans on just about everything I buy and must say this plan is a great deal...not only less expensive than other competitor plans, but in my past experiences with NEW, they always do their best to take care of the customer (unlike most manufacturers). Other programs are not always insured, so if they go out of business, you're not covered. The best thing I like about NEW is that every plan is backed by an insurance company. If something happens to NEW or Amazon, I don't have to worry about my contract not being valid."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS WARRANTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this extended warranty a year ago and thought it would cover what it claimed to cover. This july I was on a trip to India where the temperature's were extreme up around 120 degrees. After a day out in the sun, I noticed my camera's LCD screen had broken w/o any drops or impacts. When I tried to have it fixed through my NEW extended warranty they said it must have been accidently dropped or abused. When I told them where I had been and how hot it had been they basically told me I was out of luck and they had to assume it had been abused. They argued that the sun could not even do that to the camera and even told me how the camera is not under direct sunlight if it is in your hand. (Still can't figure that one out) Anyway be cautious when buying this extended warranty. Customer service was hostile and very hard to deal with. So if you feel like wasting your money on this company who won't back up their word...go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it","review":"How I wish I could review this video buti never got it there seems to be no space provedProvided for complaints!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Existent Customer Service","review":"Who knows if these Mini Crystal Silver Titanium Earrings won't lose their finish? I bought some silver hoop earrings from Simply Whispers, and the hoops turned black very quickly--I'd only worn them a few times. When I emailed Simply Whispers' so-called \\"customer service\\" about the problem, I got no response, even though I attached pictures that showed the defect. After several weeks, I mailed the earrings back to them, with an explanatory letter. I thought if they saw the defect for themselves, they would respond. Again, ZERO response. Once they have your money, you can expect NO response from Simply Whispers if the product proves defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING TITLE ......DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS ITEM IS SOLD PER PIECE....

I opened the easy open packaging, unrolled the \\"Glove Locker\\" and nothing else came out of the package. There was NO Glove Lube as the description states. Nothing like having a stiff new glove, a ball and a wrap, but nothing to soften the leather with. I just considered this to be a novelty type item. Rubber bands have always worked perfectly fine for us for years. I ran out of leather conditioner and thought I would get it at Amazon, saw this fancy little thing, saw it came with some conditioner and went for it. Now I still couldn't use this 'kit' to get my son's glove ready. Disappointing. The wrap works fine and seems to hold the mitt nice and tight with the ball inside to form the pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Markwort Baseball Glove Locker, Black","review":"Works great. Just perfect for breaking in any adult size baseball glove. Comes with small amount of oil to rub into the pocket. Has a pocket to put baseball in which then is placed in the pocket of the glove and then rapped around the glove tightly and locked by a velcro strip. It also protects your glove when you store it away for the winter. For 10 bucks you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speeds up breaking in a mitt","review":"I bought this to help break in a Nokona Proline catchers mitt. From past experience I know that breaking in a Nokana is a labor of love and I wanted to form the best pocket possible. The last nokona glove I broke in by putting a ball in it and sleeping on it, catch, etc. For a mitt I wanted to be a bit more careful.On to the glove locker! I was concerned that it wouldn't wrap around a mitt, but I had no trouble getting it around the mitt. The material stretches nicely and there's plenty of velcro to hold it closed. The pocket for the ball in the glove locker is a nice touch - it would be nice if it was a little bit larger though. You really have to jam the ball in there.Overall very happy and I feel like it has cut weeks off of breaking in a new mitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase","review":"I purchased two of these items and I LOVE THEM.

So my advice is, buy the Rawlings glove, but buy the Markwort Glove Locker. The velco attachment is what makes this so good. It can be stretched to accommodate the size of your glove. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Structure and Agency: Duality or Dualism","review":"Professor Parker provides an illustrative overview of the problems of relating agency to structure. He provides an excellent review of the writings of Bourdieu and he introduces the works of Archer and Mouzelis. He uses Giddens as a mechanism to develop a theory of post-structurationists. He compares and contrasts the various positions and demonstrates their strengths and weaknesses. He addresses the issue of postmodernism and shows that post-structuraionists are moderate postmodernist. This is an excellent book by a scholar who understands the issues and discusses them reasonably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calls himself a christian yet blatantly lies","review":"I don't understand how Duane Schmidt can write such a horrendous piece or literary work and act like its true. He argues that evolution is not real even though it's a known fact now. Just because something is still a theory doesn't mean it is not a fact. He obviously doesn't understand how science works. I don't understand how this man calls himself a Christian with the amount of lies he conjures up in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-evolution Distortion","review":"The author tries to debunk Darwin's theory of evolution. He states that he has a sweeping case against Darwin, and will show the flaws of his arguments and the lack of supporting evidence. Amazingly he not only fails, but in all 13 error-ridden chapters makes a fool of himself by showing his ignorance about science and evolution. The other amazing thing is that Phillip Johnson, the ID guru, endorsed it. It clearly raises the issue of whether Johnson is really interested in the truth. This is the worst book I've ever read.

In particular, the theme of the hunt was marred by putting the microphone too close to the french horns, ruining the soundstage. The horns were mostly isolated to one channel, glued to one speaker. The sense of depth was thus totally lost. Otherwise the recording was good if not great.I used babelfish (though it yielded some comical inaccuracies) to translate the text and I think it really helped me appreciate the development of the music.

After several months use, I am very pleased with this drill's performance. It has a nice feel in the hand and it has plenty of torque.

If you can't register it, you can't contact customer service or get updates. It's a catch-22. You can't fix the problem about being unable to register it, because you are unable to register it. Because you can't register it, you can't get any online help about it. Since Roxio's website does not recognize that this program exists, you can't even get information in frequently asked questions. If Roxio does not recognize that this program exists, then why should you buy it?

First, it doesn't work. Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why. They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down. Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time. RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what Roxio used to be","review":"Corel has done to Roxio CD burning programs exactly what it did to Jasc Paint Shop Pro, which is to say ruined the whole shebang.Just as I went back to Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7 after having tried Corel's horrible Paint Shop Pro X, I'm going back to Roxio Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, which does work with Windows XP and reliably turns out a quality CD.This new waste of time and money is NOT backward compatible -- you can't even read open CDs created in REAL Roxio programs. The system requirements for authoring DVDs are much higher than those listed for merely installing the program. (I'll go back to Nero Essentials for DVDs.) I would not have purchased the program at all had I known that in advance. Although Corel claims it works under Windows XP, it is slow to install, balky in use, and not particularly capable when it does work.Roxio easy CD & DVD burning is a huge disappointment, and in my opinion, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic help needed","review":"Is it quite beyond the capacities of modern programmers to include written INSTRUCTIONS with their products?

It does provide an easy to use way to convert old LP's to digital filesThe bad news:The label portion of the program is almost totally useless! I have not found a way to import song titles. You can't change the font color. When you try to print out a CD jacket, it prints it way to big to fit in a CD case.

It wasn't. This is a badly done program that runs you over the river and through the woods, and when it's all done may or may not burn the disk. The added bonus is that it locks up your computer half the time (I'm running XP SP2 with the updates installed). Ever since Roxio took over, Creator has gone steadily downhill. I uninstalled this and dug out my old Creator 5 disk. It installed and works perfectly. It's still the best program for burning CDs (Pinnacle Studio gets top honors for DVDs, not counting professional-level products in the $700-up category like Adobe Premiere). If you want to burn CDs with a current program, or want a basic CD-DVD combo program, go with Nero. It's far better than anything from Roxio (Easy Media Creator is a mess).

Yes, this textbook had writing throughout the margins. Yes, a lot of the review questions were already answered right in the book, but I figured that it was cheap so what could I expect. But I think that if a bookstore buys back used textbooks, maybe having all the review questions answered inside the book isn't a book you should try to sell. The worst part, though, was discovering that whole chapters were actually missing from the book. I've calculated that close to 100 pages have actually been physically removed from the book, some back to the binding making them hard to see until you are reading/studying along and the next page you turn to makes absolutely no sense. Then you find out that a bunch of pages are missing and that you are now reading from the middle of the next chapter. I would not recommend this seller since the book looks OK from the outside, but has cost me more time than the price savings bought me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"Thank you for sending my order in time and being reliable.

Even though as a science-fiction writer I'm supposed to predict the future, I had no idea in 1969 that the Internet would arise and many years later so-called \\"publishers\\" would find this book and distribute it against my wishes for their own profit. It may be \\"classic' science fiction now but it's also the work of a beginning writer who, in later years, did not choose to offer it to readers, Someone else chose to do so anyway.

Rather than describe Burgess's life in any useful or even thoughtful way, it is instead a sustained exercise in hatefulness. All biographers either like or dislike their subjects, but good ones know them well enough to feel that they cannot be classified as wholly likeable or or detestable. This author has an axe to grind, though we are not told what it is about. He allows himself to use his book as a spiteful tirade against Burgess, a selfish exhibition of childishness and I am surprised that a publisher agreed to see it into print. It reads as if written by a spurned lover, rather than an intelligent observer of another's life.

Be suspicious of how all the negative reviews have have been voted upon. There are some unfair marketing techniques going on around here, and the book TVparty needs to be revealed as a book that is a product of mass marketing and false claims.I don't care if the book is nostalgic or not. Simply put, TVparty does not live up to the hype. Most of the book contains material that would not make it on to the website. Some stories are interesting, but most of the book contains useless information and background. This is the worse purchase I have made in quite a while and it makes me mad that I didn't take more care and do more research before I bought this book.As an avid reader and fan of old tv shows, TV Party rates very low on my list of books about television."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations - low delivery","review":"When a book is read, you either like it or don't. The high energy rate of people fighting over the issue of whether this book is \\"AWESOME\\", \\"THE BEST\\" or other hyperbole is besides the point. Obviously, some people feel that if they like it, then YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT too. On the flip side, those who didn't like the book should take note likewise...to each his/her own.All I can say about TV Party is that I didn't like it one bit. It promises so much but delivers so little. I suppose that people who are desperate for nostalgia will like TV Party even if it was poorly done, which it is. The book has nothing to do with my personal tastes of how the book should have been written. My major complaint is what it promises and how it fails to deliver. The stories in the book are rubbish and are tabloid in nature. It ISN'T fun reading. Personally, I don't care how glowingly this book is reviewed here.

Maybe you have to be over 40 years old to enjoy this book? I certainly didn't. ... the book has nothing to offer in regards to the \\"untold tales\\". The book promises more than it delivers.

It also gives a new perspective of shows and people that I already knew about.I was surprised that with each memory, I turned the page and another story was there about something else I remembered from my early days of watching television.This book is a delightful and well-documented history of television and how it has impacted all of us in society.I would highly recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on time","review":"There are very few books that I have purchased in which I have felt swindled.

Some people think that the book is toilet paper. Fine. But don't step on my blue suede shoes and try to take the validity of expressing my opinion here by dregging up some ridiculous theory about people writing bogus reviews.

All in all, I don't think the book quite hit its mark. I was entertained by a few stories but I was expecting much more since many of the reviews here had such high praise. I think the warm fuzzies that some people get by reading about their childhood memories overshadows the point that the book really isn't all that great.

That's pretty much how I felt after reading TVparty. I really wanted to like the book and tried my best to see the silver lining in the cloud, but the more I read and looked, the darker the cloud became. The book is a gigantic joke filled with tidbits of old stories unrelated to the topic at hand...television. If you are looking for a genuine book regarding television, try Joe Garner's \\"Stay Tuned\\". Not only is his book heads and shoulders above TVparty, it has an excellent DVD/CD combo with excerpts of landmark television episodes which is a far cry from the cheap and scant content of the TVparty CD, which is, in a word, a scam. It's very rare that I buy a book so terrible, but TVparty suckered me. My fault. I should have believed the other reviews. Oh, well.

I've finished the book and it was lackluster at best, and boring at worst.I was not impressed with the quality and selection of \\"untold stories\\" with the exception of the article on Superman and a few of the early children's programs from the 1950's. I wish there were more to the book except the weak stories that were included in this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I can only say that this book was shallow at best and a complete waste of time at worse.

No way.","review":"There are a lot of misinformed individuals here. Either that, or the marketing department for TV Party is posting all the 5 star reviews on this site. :)Basically, this book could have been so much better if the author had been more determined in adding real value by adding more stories that were centered upon the old tv shows and characters. I found the book particularly lacking in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"There used to be an old tv commercial where an elderly lady would look into a hamburger bun and exclaim \\"Where's the beef!\\" The commercial was funny in that it was trying to demonstrate how certain burger companies overstated their claims of big and juicy burgers. As for TV Party, I would like to say \\"Where's the Party?!\\".TV Party is a valiant attempt to bring to the general public, some \\"insider\\" stories, but for the most part fails in execution and style. The stories are ok but not very well written. Much of the book was boring for me because a lot of the stories have to do with programming that I never saw or knew about when I was growing up as a kid. That is very odd, since I was pretty much a tv baby watching lots of television when I was growing up during the era this book is covering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking forward to the next edition","review":"I give tvparty a two star only because I think it is a work-in-progress.

I got this book for Christmas and I just loved it. It's not the same old tired TV shows like you find in most books. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of these slick books with the same old stories. I enjoy reading about the obscure and unusual, and the unsung heros of the early days of TV, and this book does it better than any other I've found.I never even heard of Tallulah Bankhead or Bob McAllister but now I want to know more! The inside story on the mystery behind the deaths of George 'Superman' Reeves and Alfala was facinating. My definition of a good book is one that makes me want more and I want MORE TV PARTY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"TVPARTY! brings together many of the best written and most interesting articles originally published on Billy Ingram's phenomenally popular TVPARTY website.

If you love baby-boomer pop culture, you will adore TVPARTY!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and confusing","review":"I'm not quite sure what happened to TV Party. The book starts out with a BANG and ends with a whimper. The first story about George Reeves is very interesting as I didn't know that there were suspicious circumtances revolving around his suicide. The book goes downhill from there. TVP starts to lose direction by dedicating a very large segment of the book to kiddie television programs and commercials. Not only is this stuff esoteric, it has nothing to do with the mainstream television era of the 1950's. The book is disorganized. The CD included with the book has very little information on it also. I really wanted to like this book, but ended up feeling that I had been taken by the glitzy packaging and offer of the free CD. My criteria for a good book is if I can see that at least 50% of the book is useful or entertaiing in some way. I would say that TV Party is in the low 20 percentile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little below average","review":"As a youngster, I remember sitting in front of the television set and watching all the classics such as I Love Lucy, Wagon Train, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best, and many others. Purchasing TV Party was my hope in re-entering the memories of my childhood. While the book presents a good treatment of certain subjects such as television shows for kids in the fifties, it is lacking in information regarding many of the really big hits of that era. This is where the book TV Party falls short. It is still an interesting look at the past, but there is a gigantic hole of untold stories regarding the major shows of the past. I might have given the book a three star rating just for effort, but the CD that was included with the book was very low in quality and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"TVparty: Unfulfilled Tales","review":"I don't know, even at half price, I still feel it is not worth the money. The reviews here differ so widely that the truth has to lie somewhere in the middle. In the case of this book, most people are reacting on a emotional level than an objective level. The people who love this book gush about the warm memories etc, while the people who hate this book talk about how TVparty didn't meet expectations. I think I will fall on the side of not meeting my expectations. If you really look at this book objectively, it doesn't do what it says or advertises.The price of admission was not worth it because much of the info is pretty much common knowledge. Since I didn't get any warm fuzzies from the stories, I can only rate it in an objective manner. The book fails to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftovers for the book?","review":"I am a big fan of Billy's internet website, TV Party. I purchased the book because of the reputation and quality of his website. To make a long story short, the book seems to have articles and stories that are second rate. I think this is because there would be a conflict of interest if all the goodies found on the website were transfered to the book. As a result, the book contains much of the lower quality articles. People have to pay a fee to see the entire website, so if much of the good web-content were in the book, that would have brought down the subscriptions to his website. At least that is my theory. The book wasn't terrible, but neither did it meet my expectations. I think that with all the feedback that is here about how the book could be improved, I am hoping that the second edition, if there is to be one, will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated book","review":"I am a big fan of nostalgia and the early televison shows of the 50's and the 60's and love to gobble up books and information related to these great eras of tv.

What happened?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An odd book that presents an interesting idea which the author tries to develop without success. Most of the book is spent exploring the characters' personal lives but without in any way relating them to the plot or subject matter of the book, so that we're left feeling that the author just let his mind wander. Unfortunately, the characters are flat and uninteresting, so their prolonged contemplations of their sexual and family problems, which have no bearing whatsoever on the subject or plot of the book, leave the reader bored and baffled. The mystery with which we're initially presented, involving Native American beliefs, the desecration of sacred sites, etc., is interesting and engaging but soon lost amid these meanderings and comes to seem a mere aside. The denoument of this mystery has no relation to anything that preceeds it and leaves the reader even more deflated. This book needed a sharp-witted editor to lead the author back to his subject matter. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly delightful","review":"I found this album a treasure.

The gameplay itself is very well done, although some of levels can get tedious at times. A nice feature is meeting the characters and gaining more power, as well as reading about them once collected.

I knew I would have to take my temp several times a day in the weeks after the surgery. Unfortunately, this thermometer was horribly inaccurate. I could take my temperature one time and I would show that I was running a fever. I could reset it and take the temperature again and it would show that it was below normal. The fluctuation could be as much as 2 to 3 degrees at time.

I get a temperature variation of 5 degrees when doing successive readings. It will go from 101 degrees to 96 degrees, and just jumps all around, it is totally useless as a thermometer. Yes it is fast, but by fast all they did was program it to stop reading the temperature after 3 seconds or so, which means the reading is always still fluctuating; the stupid machine will not wait long enough for the temperature to normalize so that it can get an accurate reading.You are better off just guessing what your temperature is, that will be more accurate than this piece of garbage. The lesson perhaps is: don't buy medical equipment that is made in China.If you are sick or your temperature is important to know for health reasons, this thermometer could kill you.

The downside, is its accuracy does not seem to match its speed. While I don't have a good way to calibrate the thermometer, I have tried taking my temperature a couple times in succession and gotten readings that vary by more than a degree.

The performances are excellent as is the sound, but be prepared for the sound of the piano-forte. It's not a modern grand.

The music is a delight to the ears, inventive and fresh. Some of it could easily be mistaken for early Mozart, but then Mozart studied with J C Bach during his trip to London as a young man. The style can generally be described as Mozartian without the usual \\"lilt,\\" but not quite as \\"masculine\\" as Haydn's concertos. One can very definitely hear where Mozart may have picked up some of idioms so characteristic of his piano concerto writing. Certainly a worthy addition to your classical library if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpie King Size Markers","review":"The product received is not what is shown in the picture.

The power supply that came with my computer was 250 watts, so this was a good step up for my system. It also comes with two SATA power plugs for a possible future upgrade.

On the plus side they did allow me to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Based on everyone else's positive ratings of this book, I ordered A Garden in Paris hoping it would live up to those reviews. Sadly, it didn't. I found the character of Elizabeth extremely annoying- too petty, judgemental, and confrontational with her mother. The author relied too much on \\"telling\\" the story instead of \\"showing\\"- through more dialogue and action. Despite the good premise, I couldn't make myself keep reading. I'd recommend Kissing Adrien or Chateau of Echoes by Siri Mitchell if you want some wonderful, French fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I really liked this book, and look forward to the sequel. I love all things french and romantic. I am at the age where I want to believe it is never too late to achieve your dream, and this book reinforced that!

Pick it up, it's a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully written enchanting book about love, loss and God's grace","review":"I could not put this book down. The characters, the story, the scenery. Mary has lost her husband (he passed away), and is struggling to find her way back to who she was. She had definitely lost herself over the years and finally is ready with God's help to make some monumental changes in her life. She leaves her home in Omaha and goes back to Paris. Paris was a big part of her young life, but she has not spoken about it for years, her daughter doesn't even know she's ever been there. The mother-daughter relationship is another vital part of the story. Mary takes us on a wonderful tour of a beautiful city and I was enchanted. The story has many twists and turns which kept me interested until the very end. This was one of my very favorite books I've ever read and I read everyday. I couldn't wait to purchase the sequel, \\"Hilltop in Tuscany\\". If you like Christian fiction you will love this book, I guarantee it. Read on!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was very well-written and disagree that it was hard to be pulled through. I rarely can't put a book down, but the last third of the book caused me to play hookey from work and life to just finish it!I thought she captured the struggle so many women have in finding value after a marriage has ended, and the conflict so many of my friends and I are having with our adult daughters who don't \\"see\\" us. Her book gave me hope that there are always new starts--good ones. It was one of the better reads I've had in some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoiled Daughter","review":"In A Garden in Paris, the message of French flavor was strong. For one that would visit Paris, this book would be a sweet reminder of the richness of Paris. The family dynamics of this story is very interesting; dominate husband, passive wife and outspoken and spoiled daughter. Elizabeth didn't really even give her mother a chance to breathe and express her own identify after Sam's death. I loved the passion that Mary had for returning to her memories of Paris. I would not have stood for the verbal hurts that Elizabeth vented towards her own mother. Good friendships in Paris and nice ending. An OK read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"I was hoping to dive into this book and find proposals on what to do about all the Mexicans that have poured into this country due to our God-given prosperity but instead the author delves into a boring story of buildings in 1950's New York and rental rates.Verdict: Boring and irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"There is nothing special about this side dish. There is a hint of tomato, a hint of some other spices and a very vague ting of heat.The dish is VERY easy to prepare but there is nothing special about it nor anything terribly wrong either. There are no \\"off-tastes\\" - really there is not much taste - period.I'm afraid bland says it all. To call this dish \\"Mexican\\" seems terribly wrong. Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.At the right price I'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes. They are extremely easy to prepare, have no off tastes -- yet they are not stellar.My favorites in the Lipton/Knorr family are the Teriyaki Rice and the Stroganoff and Alfredo noodles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taco Rice","review":"I found this one rather bland and dry, like most Mexican rice.

I believe Christians need to refresh their minds & encourage themselves with this type of information because we live in a world of manifestations of unbelief everywhere. This is why it is so hard for people not to have unbelief, they see the results of unbelief all around them every day. It's when we start walking by the spirit & living under the God-given faith that we all possess & cast out unbelief that we can live in a world showing the manifestations of that faith.I am excited about my own personal growth in God & this book is a great inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"I have been hearing about this book for a LONG time.

You will not only learn solid Biblical doctrine but the history of the chuch from its inception, its journey trough the centuries, and its recent return to Biblical New Testament apostolic Christianity. You'll be inspired, motivated, and I'm sure you'll even shed a few tears as the Spirit of God moves upon you like never before. Also, the present-day miracles recorded within are likened to those recorded inWrongfully Accusedwhich I also strongly recomend to Christians of all faiths and non-believers as well. After reading these two books you may discover that you've had God in a box and you may even be faced with the challenge of a lifetime. My life has been changed and I wouldn't go back to the old for anything. Thanks to books like these, God is alive and working in my life now more than ever, and they sit side-by-side in my bookcase and are read and re-read often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megashift Review","review":"Most amazing book.

Hilarious and enthralling, I started it right before going to the beach and found myself too absorbed to even swim-I just spent the whole time reading. Bubble-gum fluff, of course, but then isn't that what it's all about? Anna is a character you can empathize so much with, there are plenty of plot turnings and small details to keep you interested, Mark Swann is of course gorgeous and amusing and unusually for this type of fiction, someone you feel like you could actually meet in real life(except for the whole director thing, of course) And I especially appreciated the fact that the romance isn't driven by or founded on lust, with love something following almost as an after-thought. Clean, light, and fun, this laugh-out loud summer fling left me in a glow of well-being. A really unusual chick flick that's a good notch above most others in its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"I learned so much about writing in this book.

Quercetin is claimed to work for a variety of potential ailments, but the main focus - as for myself as well - is usually in the anti-inflamatory properties. Whether actual, or placebo, my use of Quercetin seems to have alleviated some joint issues that I had had. So currently I do continue to take it, but am also awaiting more studies. This particular brand and bottle also includes Bromelain, which is derived from pineapples, and also is claimed for its anti-inflamatory properties, and is also known for easing digestion. So this particular product offers a \\"two-for\\" ability to squelch inflammatory issues (as claimed).

Basically just good German progressive rock. Tunes here I dug the most were \\"The Sniffer\\", the srtaight-ahead rocker \\"Mary Green\\", the eight-minute title cut \\"Illegal\\" and the beautifully played \\"Raintime\\". Also, this CD reissue's three added bonus tracks are good enough, to be tempted to obtain a copy of this import title.

The author gives his e-mail address in the book and I also sent him an e-mail about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a sad and juvenile attempt at humor.","review":"The cover of this book is misleading. This is not humorous, nor is it for cat lovers--or anyone with compassionate feelings for animals of any kind. C'mere Kitty is nothing but a juvenile attempt to find animal abuse amusing. It is sad that in these times, with all signs of animal abuse and child abuse being interrelated, with crimes against animals being tried in courts, with serious criminals being connected with earlier charges of abusive behavior towards animalss, that this book would be published and sold at the level that it is. Shame on Alan Katz and the publisher of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for cat lovers","review":"Does Mr. Katz have cats? I doubt it - they've probably run away. Even though the suggestions are made in fun (I hope) they are potentially harmful. In the hands of a wrong person this book may transform into a book of horrors for a good-natured friendly cat. Mr. Katz may want to ask himself if he would like to have these suggested tricks played on him by someone 6 times taller and perhaps 12 times heavier. As suggested in the last pages of this book, don't let the SPCA see you doing any of these things to your cat. My copy of this book is in the city garbage dump where it will not give anyone ideas of torture.

The camera already comes with a warranty to begin with so you are overlapping things if you buy the two year plan because it begins on the day you buy it. The part about credit cards offering extended warranties is true, also. And, normally most problems and defects are going to make themselves known earlier on rather than later, so it would most likely happen during the camera warranty period anyway. Repairs that happen outside of the warranty period are often due to user error or damage so this wouldn't be covered anyway.The prior reviewer who seened to think this was a good idea only gave the two year warranty 3 stars. If it is such a good idea, why only three stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst service ever. Would put 0 stars if I could.","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.

I have been lied to multiple times and have had to prove over and over again to the service company that yes I made the purchase yes I sent it back correctly, yes I bought a service plan, and more. Do not bother to buy this service plan.If you do buy service plan anyway, make sure you; keep every scrap, invoice, original packaging, use usps delivery confirmation. Follow their rules. If you don't keep EVERYTHING that you can that refers to your purchase you will probably be screwed. I still haven't had my service plan honored and I have all the information they want.

I understand it was important to talk about Timothy as a young boy, growing up with racism, but, the author made it very boring.

Not only do you have all the single sounds to choose from, you can combine 2 of them to create a custom white noise experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An often immitated story line.","review":"Boris is a quack prestidigitator whose premonitions suddenly begin to come true. One of the first of these kinds of stories possibly, but often immitated since. Reminicent of a One Step Beyond story. Worth a look though."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Here Than You Might Think","review":"I'm writing this because it's a pity that people might think this book is not educational. I'd put it at the core of a unit on teaching kids how to write riddles.What makes a cow laugh?MOOseums.MOOvies.And so on.Such word play is educational in the best sense of the word.The board format makes it unsuitable to take into classrooms. But it sure works while writing lesson plans.Susan Ohanian, a long-time teacher"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing sleep aid","review":"this is an amazingly effective, non-invasive calmative. Although marketed as a calmative, I find 2 or 3 pills can induce relaxed sleep for a few hours. Great to induce sleep when over-tired, or when you wake too early and thoughts flood your mind preventing going back to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect over the counter solution for quick anxiety relief","review":"I can take two of these and it helps me stop thinking about the crazy day I just had and then just go to sleep. I can wake up normally without feeling groggy. Calms are also great for long plane trips where sleeping is difficult and especially for adjusting to time differences and having to try to fall asleep earlier than usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes wierd side effects","review":"I took this one night and woke up with a hangover type headache. Product on a good day seems less useful than just mouth melt Melatonins."},{"rating":"1","title":"good when it works","review":"When it works this stuff is great. When it doesn't work however, both my wife and I had anxiety and racing thoughts. I've been unable to sleep for 48 hours after taking this once or twice, though I had messed up sleep patterns from working nights anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game! Poorly made...","review":"As an interactive DJ I am constantly in search of fun and easy games to entertain with at my events. This looked to be a pefect picnic/pool party game. The first time I used it the rings broke out of two of the holes! If you are going to make a game where you will be throwing things at it as part of the activity it needs to be made well. This was not what I would consider to be an inexpensive game either. The workmanship and overall quality of the game is poorly designed for the manner in which it is to be used. I now have to repair the game and make some modifications so that it can once again be useful to me. It is essentially a good game but it needed to be designed better."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function P(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(x,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-0af2555c"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/19.md","filePath":"sponsor/19.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/19.md"},j=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
