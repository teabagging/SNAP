Oh my, whomever put Paul Lynde in the role of Templeton the Rat gets my vote as casting agent of the century (closely followed by the person responsible for Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head in Toy Story...but I digress).

Debbie Reynolds is a noble and nurturing Charlott, Henry Gibson is a perfect Wilbur, Agnes Moorehead is a hilarious stuttering goose, and who else but Paul Lynde could play Templeton the Rat with such panache??

Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true \\"fiction\\" and the parallels between her main \\"villain\\" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped in 10 dots...","review":"I thought this book was horrible. I was reading it on Kindle, so I can't give you a pg number, but I stopped reading it around the 5th chapter. I don't usually give up on a book, but did with this one. This story was a bit of a autobiography and not very entertaining. For writing about one's self, the author did not give a good insight into her character. The book was hard to read because the author kept going in and out of script. Like I said earlier in this review, I just had to give it up. A waste of $9.99. The real disappointment was that I am a fan of Hughes the actress and was expecting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"Oh my how I really wanted to like this book. I am a person that with a good storyline and great writing I could read a book in a day's time; it took me over a month to get through this book and I was on vacation for a week!!I found it very difficult to follow and to keep track of the players when we are constantly waffling back and forth between real names and stage names. And I feel there were too many characters to keep track of but I guess that's just the way with a soap opera.I also found the story to be quite depressing. I felt bad for the lead character but then she's going to turn around and do the exact same thing to her best friend?Maybe I was not taking the book in the light it was intended, maybe I missed the boat but this one sank as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this!","review":"Bravo! Soapsuds was such a delight. It is so much fun to read a book about soap operas. It has so many cliches about soap operas. Everything from the hunks that are required to take their shirts off to the constant recastings!My favorite parts are when the diva of the show, Meredith Contini, is around. She represents many of the divas that have been on their shows form many years, for example, Susan Lucci or Deidre Hall. The scenes in which she is hysterical about her character being aged is a laugh riot.

A huge hit at last year's Sundance Festival, Tao of Steve totally lived up to the hype. The script is very funny and well-written -- dialogues are a bit Kevin Smith-esque, but more genuine and less over-the-top. Jokes work because the actors don't sound like they are just reading their lines. Interesting note: I had a chance to attend Q&A; session with Jenniphr Goodman (the director/co-writer), Duncan North (real-life Dex/co-writer) and Donal Logue (who plays our slacker lothario to perfection) at the Seattle Film Festival, and apparently very little, if any, of the movie was improvised. Donal said since it was written by \\"real\\" people (as opposed to those non-human screenwriters ;) he felt natural saying the lines that were given to him.Despite a rather predictable ending, \\"Tao of Steve\\" is a super fun movie -- something worth keeping around for occasional viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aweso movie!","review":"This movie is great. It brings us a lot of memories about who we were and how stupid we were when young.

It's a movie that lifts up your spirits and makes you feel good after whatching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow, tedious movie about a lumpish loser","review":"I rented this movie because a lot of people said it was sooooo good.

It's not a horrible movie, but it isn't really very good, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do they know in Brooklyn","review":"The Tao of Steve is actually quite well written contrary to what the Brooklyn reviewer opines.

Look: there are plenty of books out there -- thousands, in fact -- that seem more concerned with exhibiting the subtleties of craft than actually affecting the emotions of the reader. The Greyhound God ain't that kind of book. It's beautifully written, deeply felt, quite funny, but without one whit of post-modern \\"irony.\\" I've read the book three times and each time I found myself entering into the world of Luke Rivers, the loss of his family, the tragedy that spurs this loss, his journey across America, and his strange, wonderful canine obsession.

The choices are ours. In a somewhat detailed account, Diamond takes the scientific approach, providing the step-by-step analysis of the factors causing the demise of a number of cultures beginning with the situation in Montana's Bitterroot Valley. It presents an ominous sign of the future due to historic neglect, disagreements among newcomers and old timers as to possible solutions and lack of financing. Although \\"modern\\" in its causes and solutions, Montana's problems often parallel similar issues in older societies that once flourished in various parts of the world, such as Easter Island, Polynesia the Anasazi of SW U.S.:the Mayan culture of Mesoamerica and many others.Recommended reading for all who care about future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history with implications for the future of our society","review":"A fun read.

The prose is easy to read and free of technical jargon.The first chapter (about the Bitteroot valley in Montana) provides and excellent context for the remaining discussions because it allows the reader to see the process unfolding in a contemporary setting that is easy to relate to. As an American living in the western U.S., I can relate situation and the conflicting priorities that drive social decision-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good wake-up call","review":"A very interesting book -- and one that, if people can get past its somewhat daunting length, contains a lot of wisdom. It's easy in this high-tech age to look back at the Maya, the inhabitants of Easter Islands, and other civilizations that have done themselves in through overpopulation and overall ecological misjudgment and say, \\"That can't happen to us. We'd see it coming and do something about it.\\" In truth, though, I think civilizations all balance on a knife edge, and an ecological catastrophe can push them over that edge -- a drought, an earthquake, land that has been grazed or cultivated to exhaustion. We drive from our climate-controlled homes or offices to the grocery store where an abundance of foods unequaled in history awaits us -- and we don't realize how easily the system could fall apart. \\"Collapse,\\" while overlong and a bit windy at times, is an important book. Doubtless the Maya thought their civilization was impregnable, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious examples","review":"Mr. Diamond has sifted through several millenia of human history, and the most relevant cases he can come up with are . . . Easter Island? Greenland? The Anasazi tribe? Were there no examples of larger societies available? Presumably, the bulk of his readership will be Americans, but it is difficult to understand how a nation of nearly 300 million people is supposed to draw conclusions from cases of tiny, remote societies going adrift. Had he developed his theories from an examination of, say, the fall of Rome, or of the Mongol Empire, they may have been more compelling. Any attempt to extrapolate findings from communities of 5,000 to nations of 300 million is going to be flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy on your Kindle","review":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised EditionThis is a fascinating book, but do not buy it on the Kindle.The text references a series of plates, and images.

The choices they make are based on their economic and values systems, but their choices are also limited by their geography, climate and resources.The details given about some of those societies portrayed in the book may be debatable, but there's a common theme that cannot be dismissed......Since we cannot manipulate our climate and we are limited by our geography and resources on this planet, this book is a reminder for us to examine our economic and values systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theory is decent, but personal interjections unneccesary","review":"Diamond's book does a fairly good job at evaluating the conditions of societal collapse, but his theory lacks the modern analysis of imperialism, which is an enormous factor in collapse today as resources are brought out of the third world into the first for consumer purchase.Diamond's personal interjections break the flow of the book, and often are quite offensive, \\"The U.S. explicitly forbids the importation of kangaroo meat, because we find the beasts cute, and because a congressman's wife heard that kangaroos are endangered.\\" Diamond's personal commentary has no factual basis to support it, and is quite offensive.Collapse approaches potential solutions but instead favors a small, insignificant substitutions for \\"unsustainable factors in society.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the Rough","review":"Jared Diamond is at his best when he takes a simple question and finds the answer by ransacking the cluttered annals of biology, history, geography, anthropology and archeology, as he does in Collapse.Mr. Diamond sometimes weakens his otherwise fine work with gratuitious conjecture, and, like his earlier books, Collapse could benefit from less indulgent editing, but these nits are easily forgiven when reading a book this ambitious and important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"This book presents a lot of information, but no discernible thème. The author doesn't tie the information together with an opinion of why something is good or bad. For example, Montana is poorly suited for agriculture; the rivers are fouled with fertilizer runoff & salinization caused by agriculture; outsiders have bought up farmland and converted to estates. Does the author propose that the last item is a good thing or a bad thing? Why? He also relates the transition, in a later chapter, of primitive island society changing from inherited hierarchical leadership to leadership by victorious warlords. What's the point? I have no notion that one is more desirable than the other, and the author gives me no understanding of why this transition is significant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"I bought this product for school. I liked this product, it was shipped quickly and was exactly how it was described in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Collapse by Jared Diamond is an excellent book. I found the book to be extremely engrossing and interesting and it was packed full of detail. Jared Diamond covers many different time periods, places and people. He also points out specific details to why each society failed or thrived and uses evidence to back up that claim. He thoroughly covers each subject and leaves no detail out. I also liked how he was able to bring in modern day examples in addition to the older ones. While reading Collapse, I learned many new things that I had never even thought about before. The book is a little slow at first but soon starts to pick up. I recommend this book to anyone who has a serious interest in this topic because for others it might be a little too long and boring. Although Collapse might take you a while to read, it's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapse is must-read","review":"The analysis is right-on and the book is an enjoyable read, unlike typical textbooks. We're using this for professional development on my team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapse review","review":"Another excellent book. I realized when I bought this book that I own and have enjoyed all of Jared Diamond's books. His topics and hypostheses are fascinating and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad, fascinating and inspiring read.","review":"Collapse is too vast to review. The topics covered, the ideas presented and the facts Diamond lays bare are so vast and overwhelming that not only did the book take me a long time to read, it took me completely by surprise.Definitely recommended reading if you're interested in sustainability, anthropology, history or futurism. It's got it all, and it's scientific as hell.His Pulitzer prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you want to see in science","review":"This book was a required read for one of my college courses, and it proved to have some interesting ideas. Diamond hasn't thought his own ideas out, and has proved to be one author that is weakening the science field as he picks out only the science that \\"proves\\" his hypothesis, not a review of all the ideas that exists. He attempts to play the role of an anthropologist when he is an environmental scientist. He contradicts himself with his previous books, clearly a sign he is trying for sales, not complete information for the audience. I suggest readingQuestioning Collapse: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire, as it shows clearly how Diamond could be wrong. I am not saying Questioning Collapse is completely correct either, but it gives a more rounded idea of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 100-word book review","review":"Collapse is a thoroughly researched and fascinating book offering reasons why civilisations have failed in the past. The Mayans, Easter Islanders and Greenland Norse each encountered complex problems that eventually became catastrophic. Jared Diamond offers no simplistic explanation but describes a number of causes, such as climate change, geography and psychological flaws, which can reinforce one another and lead to disaster. The author does not take an overly pro-environmental stance, recognising that industry has a vital role to play in protecting our world. He provides a salutary lesson from history that current and future generations would do well to heed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erin Brown Review","review":"This was an excellent book because it shows the truths about how close our modern day civilization is to collapsing. This book shows different civilizations strengths and weaknesses and what truly caused them to decline. He discusses 12 different environmental reasons as to why societies collapse and that is his main argument for most of the book. He points out that there other a few other reasons why a society might decline but environmental reasons why the main reason. He is worried about our modern day society failing because of pollution and many more reasons. He states how people know what is happening but choose to do nothing. You should definitively read this book, even if you're not interested in economics or the study of societies because it gives you a different outlook to view modern day society. He has definitively done his research for this book so it is easy to trust his knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a Giant","review":"Look no further! Everyone who cares about the future of the world economy, and the prospects for our planet in general, should read this book. Though it discusses complex issues, it offers really enjoyable reading if that is what you're looking for. I once saw one passenger reading it on a plane, it was a long-distance flight, and I found the title very appealing (probably because I come from a country that did not have an easy life). Though it was nearly 4 years ago, I remembered the title and bought the book only now. I received a revised edition which gives an insight into what happened after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Enjoy and use the ideas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Interesting read.

The author presents factors that lead to a society's demise, and also illuminates several factors making our own future perilous.

Unfortunately, I found it disjointed, anectodal, and very disappointing. Although Diamond is obviously a good man and probably not guilty of this, I got the impression the Montana information was included so he could write off his vacations there. There is valuable information in here, so if you're interested in the topic it's worthwhile, but this has all the hallmarks of a quickie follow up to a commercial success (Guns, Germs and Steel) you expect from a new movie star but not a Pulitzer-prizewinning author.

You've heard it all before. His buggabear is deforestation. Legitimate, perhaps, but if I want to read opinion pieces I disagree with, I'll read the NY Times.

It's amazing how Diamond could make the plant life, etc., of 900 A.D. seem interesting, but he does repeatedly.

It is a lot easier to put down, but I had to finish it like a dose of medicine that tasted bad so it must be good for me. Actually, that sounds a little harsh and I really do recommend it. It seems less inspired that \\"Guns\\" and a like a bit of exploitation of that former great success. Maybe I am a little depressed because this is the third book I have read recently that presents a rather bleak view of the future. It is definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Swing and a Miss","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel was a tough act to follow, and Diamond doesn't deliver with Collapse. Generally readable and contains some interesting bits, but vastly verbose and about twice as long as it needs to be.

I was fully rested on both of the disks on 2 seperate nights. Good thing I was not listening in the car.

Although he has no qualifications or training whatsoever in the fields of anthropology, sociology, or archaeology, none of this prevents him from making bald assertions that would never hold up under any sort of professional inquiry. Instead, Diamond is willing to assert claims that biologists let go of in the 1950s, in order to re/create his model of biological and ecological determinism. Utter rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Collapse...\\" by Jared Diamond is an interesting introduction","review":"I have enjoyed \\"Collapse\\" as the first book that I have read on the subject. Jared Diamond's reconstruction of collapsed societies is very interesting although I have heard lately that it is not original. Garbage and feces are rarely subjects of interest but in this book they lead to important insights. Diamond discusses how various societies rise and fall with emphasis on causes such as climate change and, especially, destruction of the environment. Underlying his discussion is his debt to the Reverend Malthus who made the famous prediction that population would outstrip food supply. Clearly, this theory is validated over and over again.I gave the book 4 stars because it could have used better editing. There is some needless repetition and wordiness. However, I think that he offers a very interesting introduction to an important and timely subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Journey...","review":"...across time and around the globe.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jared Diamond is the bomb!!","review":"Professor Diamond has written an informative and mind-expanding book. As he ponders the question of how decisions in a culture effect their survival, he invites you to question our present world situation and he inspires the reader to do something.

I enjoyed \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". This one is a challenging but illuminating read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much...","review":"This book starts off on a very biased footing, with an micro study of the author's favorite ranch, why he liked it, and what it represents (who cares!).

Its Kindle version is an incomplete book since it refers many of these pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not outstanding","review":"There was obviously someone awake in the sales department when coming up with the title of this book but it really was not as scintillating as I had hoped. Collapse starts out kind of slow, with some rambling on about Diamond's experiences in Montana, before it gets interesting. The middle section is decent, concerning societies that have collapsed and the various reasons why and then the end gets kind of preachy, about what we can do to save-the-spotted-owl and that sort of thing. For those who have read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", Diamond's exhausive (and exhausting) statistic-laden writing style will be familiar but, if you have not read his earlier work, don't pick up \\"Collapse\\" expecting a white-knuckle thriller. It is really more of an academic tome than popular reader. In all, I think many people will be duped into expecting more excitement from \\"Collapse\\" than it delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This book was assigned to me for a course in Sustainability, it brings you through thousands and thousands of years of collapsed societies based on five main points. It was the same story over and over about a different society. The whole book was very dull and despressing. Very few interesting facts, wasn't written too long about but feels out dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Make Sense","review":"I'm guessing Diamond was given a huge advance to write this book based on his last success, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" - which was a terrific book. Collapse opens up with a completely non-sensical description of Montana based on anecdotal stories. He mentions global warming many times for no apparent reason. The book seems more like incoherent ramblings rather than the careful analysis of a skilled researcher. I rarely put down a book once I start but I couldn't bear to continue after 3 chapters. Sorry Jared, but terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collapse: How Socities Choose to Fail or Succeed","review":"A great and timely theme. Unfortunately, supporting this theme with spurious, old, and disregarded data doesn't make the case. The result is that anyone half-way sophisticated enough to be familiar with the issues and up-to-date information will be at least unimpressed. The previous \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was a good piece of work, at least from the purely materialist perspective, but this one will not make converts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book. Though the concept is intriguing, the writing style is tedious and repetitive. It is said that Social scientists in an effort to ensure their scholarship is recognised, often obfuscate their material to try to make the point. This book is a fine example of that phenomena.Still a good editor could have probably saved this book. Alas that was not the case. Good book to put you to sleep though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version more expensive than paperback.","review":"The Kindle Edition of this book is more expensive than the paperback edition sold new. This is not Amazon's fault, it is the publisher's fault. This is not acceptable. A digital edition of a book costs essentially nothing to produce and nothing to distribute. There is no inventory to manage and no risk of being burned with returned stock. When publishers choose not to deliver a digital version of their books at acceptable prices, it puts eReader users in an unfortunate position. I will read this book by taking it out at a library for free. If the publisher had priced the digital edition below the physical edition, I would have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad sequel","review":"Guns, Germs and Steel, though somewhat ethnocentric, was a decent book with good points. this one remains ethnocentric, but loses the good points.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual Diamond babble","review":"In case you haven't figured it out yet, Jared Diamond does not, and never has, know what he is writing about.

You made your money Jared, now hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Science for the Simple Minded","review":"The best thing about this book is that Jared Diamond explains why there are no trees on Easter Island: the natives cut them down. What was it like, he asked, for those natives who cut down the last tree? Does Diamond really care? This book is for people who hate their neighbors, who supposedly hate materialism, and probably run around with ipods in their ears.

Why do these societies choose to prosper or fail - Diamond leans slightly left in his thinking but gives a balanced account of what we may be able to learn from past civilizations, and how what they did, or did not do, helped or hindered the way they went about living.I found the book fascinating - but it could have been about 100 pages shorter. It gets a bit preachy and redundant at the end, and took forever to get through. The book is long. The first half goes a bit quicker and has concise points.

Jared Diamond's technique of juxtaposing far-away Norse Greenland and the Mayan Empire against something so familiar sensitized me. From that point on, I put myself in the place of the Mayans, Easter Islanders, Chaco Canyon Anasazi and imagined their heartache and terror as the endtime of their civilizations approached. To imagine the same on a planetary scale - That's the real lesson of the book we should all heed. There's imminent need for government action to preserve the ecosystem. Hmm... now who didn't sign the Kyoto accord again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Anyone who calls himself/herself an environmentalist should read this book. It should be considered one of the great environmentalist books of our time, even though Jared Diamond does not intend for it to be so; he approaches the subject as a scientist, and his conclusions illuminate arguments for responsible stewardship of the environment, from the front yard to the whole planet. I liked it better than Guns, Germs, and Steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I liked Guns, Germs and Steel, and I thought this was also good. It's a little more accessible (GG&S could be dense at times), but focuses only on one issue - what things (esp. environmental damage) can lead to the downfall of societies. Definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reading, unfortunately lengthy at times","review":"the width and depth of Prof. Diamond's knowledge is truely amazing! At the same time, this book is a refreshing disgression from the usual (at least in Germany, my home) \\"tree huggers'\\" attitude of sorting all people into \\"good\\" ones (who support their agenda), and \\"bad\\" ones (who do not). Instead, he argues, that incentives guide people's behaviour, and if they are set wrong -and this can happen without any bad intentions!- the results may be desastrous.The only problem, I have with this superb book, as compared to, say, Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author is that it is too long winded at times. 100 pages less, and it would have been perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"Many people have written about the positive attributes of this book. I would like to add just two observations. First of all, I've read few non-fiction books that grabbed my attention to the degree that I felt like I could actually visualize the times and places being described. My favorite two sections were the ones on Easter Island and the Norse colonies in Greenland. They left images that are burned in my mind. Second, as someone who is interested in topics such as peak oil, global warming and so forth, the idea that this time, the entire planet may be exhibiting some of the same behaviors that individual collapsed civilizations did was both enlightening and scary. I have noticed that this is a book that is becoming widely quoted, and rightfully so.

I have thrown the book away to be sure that at least one copy of his pretentious, superficial tripe goes no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was the most disappointing that I have read in years. I was a huge fan of Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee but this book was definitely not up to the standard set by Diamond with those two.While the book is clearly very well researched, and thoroughly explores issues brought forward, it gets lost in Diamond's rhetoric and preaching about environmental measures that must be taken. At times I was sure that I was reading a book by Naomi Klein.Unfortunately, this book does not live up to previous titles by Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense writing but informative reading","review":"Like his best-selling earlier book, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" Jared Diamond has written a long, dense, often repetitive book that is nonetheless both fascinating and informative.In \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond offers lessons from the failures (and less common successes) of past and present societies that have struggled to survive environmental challenges. Sometimes the challenges arise from difficult local conditions, but they are always made worse by societal decisions on the use of resources.Diamond applies the lessons learned to world environmental problems of today and offers insightful conclusions. His chapters on present day issues in China and Australia are particularly informative. Although the read can be slow because of his writing style, it's a book worth taking the time to absorb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Balanced Look at the impact of environmental catastrophe","review":"I enjoyed the authors somewhat balanced view of the impact of environmental catastrophe on many societies throughout history. Though we can guess on which side of many environmental issues that he leans, he does well in positioning both sides of many questions.The example of Easter Island is exceptionally chilling. The inhabitants basically denuded their island of trees to build the impressive stone statues they left to show their power. The author asks what could the person who chopped down the last tree been thinking? With no trees there were no more canoes to catch fish and dolphins, no more rope, and with soil erosion depleted gardens. The population fell from several thousand to several hundred by the time the first european explorers arrived.The author takes the lessons of the past and shows how fragile our modern first world economy really is in the long term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Australian scientists show Diamond got it wrong","review":"The Australian Institue of Agricultural Science and Technology found chapter 13 \\"Mining\\" Australia to be deeply flawed.

Diamond's GGAS is one of the most riveting NF books I've ever read, and has given me excellent fuel for numerous intellectual conversations. So I expected more from this. I don't need to go into its structure, as 166 previous reviews certainly cover that. I'm disappointed that this entire book is basically environmental statistics from history. It reads much less like a discourse on sociohistorical problems (as GGAS did) and much more like the findings of some obscure UN charter committee.I know the negative checks are going to roll in for this one, that's why I'm doing this as a kid's review. I don't need my good average screwed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapse is coming. The question is when","review":"This book is mainly about the economy of ecological systems and the disruptive influence people have on this well balanced ecosystem called earth. The book starts with an explanation on collapsed societies, where this was done by man through handcraft.The end of the book describes the modern and sometimes hidden damage that we create today. If you would extrapolate the behaviour of the current global society, then a collapse is coming. The question is when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summarized information but too wordy","review":"I'll first say the only people I see giving this book a bad review are those that know a lot of details about the ancient societies covered and get to picky at them, then some that read Jared's first book advise not to read this one due to repeated information, and then redneck republicans that think it's a political agenda to acknowledge science and reality.What I liked is that the book shows you the point of view of the society and those that destroy the society for their own personal gain. You see why some businesses don't find it in their own interest to sustain the environment, yet others do. Some businesses do actually get their act together and this book explains why and how. So I like the book for it's explanation of both sides of the story in these instances, but it does get a bit wordy in parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Environment and the Man","review":"This is a brilliant book. It is very well laid out. The ideas in the book are so very relevant to our times. The argumentation is very well presented, and very logical indeed. The positions that Jared takes in this book are positions not to be taken lightly. The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.All in all, a highly recommended book. It is a book to be read slowly, with care. The lessons are to be absorbed, not forgotten when the book is put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapse","review":"In Collapse, Jared Diamond explains the failure or survival of societies spanning thousands of years and diverse geographies. Despite the subtitle, as he examines the complex ecological and social systems, it seems that, knowing what they did, there is little the 'failed' societies could have chosen to do differently. The answer to why some make it and some don't occasionally comes down to simple geography, but most often it has to do with how they adapt to their environment, not realizing that their way of life is, in the long run, unsustainable.Diamond makes the decisions and fate of the inhabitants of Easter island seem as logical and important as the concerns of modern day residents of Montana, and the broad variety of groups profiled shows why we can't think ourselves immune to the same problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collapse of civilizations","review":"I had read Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author previously. This nicely rounds out the other work and I would sincerely recommend that both be read in order to come away with a more comprehensive view of the advances, declines and falls of civilizations and some of the things that are germaine to those processes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be full of scattered opinions and incorrect assumptions. I bought the hardback and will throw it away rather than give to another. Parts of the book are interesting, and as I read it I took the authors work at face value. However whenever he ventured into my area of expertise, agribusiness, I found that the author had only an armchair understanding and opinion of agricultural markets and practices - this led me to doubt the complete work.I greatly anticipated reading this book - sadly I can not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion masquerading as science","review":"While parts are interesting, the overiding message comes off poorly substantiated and reads mainly as opinion weakly supported by data. In fact, there are almost no direct references for the purported facts reported which leaves the reader wondering if much of anything in the book can be believed. Unfortunately, when he got on topics where I have direct knowledge, he exagerated secondary drivers and largely glossed more significant factors. This is either due to naivety or perhaps because fact didn't fit the 'script' - or a mixture of both. He tends to seek special cases to justify a general conclusion. As with most subscribers to the doomsday scenario he seems to be picking factoids to support his story but isn't looking at the big picture, probably because the big picture shows his case to be without much merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good Introduction for absolute beginners","review":"This is a pretty good book for beginning users who have no experience with other graphics programs or little familiarity with Windows & Office either.It is well written and easy to read with plenty of screen shots and step-by-step instruction for a beginning level user.

The quality is very poor. The paint started chipping off within days and the pumpkin on top is badly shaped (and not in a Nightmare way).

The book reads like a reference book: it explains every function of every component and provides sample code on the way. However, it also includes tips for the deeper insight. Knowledge of Win32 API and C/C++ is required, though. If you are new to windows programming, I highly recommend Windows Programming for Dummies. Together with this book they make up a perfect introduction to DirectX."},{"rating":"1","title":"No MFC? Hardly Any C++? C is in the stone age.","review":"I was expecting more from Microsoft Press. The authors are C programmers who don't realize the power of C++ and it's reusabilty. I find no reference anywhere to MFC! The authors are still stuck in the stone age of C programming and I'm assuming they have never heard of MFC even though they work at Microsoft. I wish I hadn't bought this book. I am anxious for the book DirectX Complete With CDROM by James Boer and Michael Root. It won't be available till November 98. From the synopsis it will use the AppWizard in VC++ and use MFC and C++ the way any true Windows program should, for reusabilty and maintenace."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECIEVING","review":"When i bought the book i had only the intention of learning directX. That's it. But after buying th book, i got stuck after the first example because it uses MFC and the Win32 API. It throughs you for a loop because it barely describes those concepts.

Hope I was able to warn at least ONE person"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-have\\" book!","review":"A no-nonsense approach to DirectX.Instead of attempting to create wrapper class for the DirectX objects, they reference and use it directly. A book for those who are more interested to know how to use DirectX then having a set of ready wrapper classes.It was disappointing however to note the lack of D3D. Perhaps they should come up with a book on D3D or DirectMedia.Very good book, a must have for beginners and experts! After all, experts may know the tips and tricks of DirectX, but do they realy know the 'how and why' of it? Who better to know those than the developers of DirectX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"Sorry to say but this book is pretty bad, the fragmented code while saves space is not very comprehensible. I was looking for a style like Charles Petzold's book but was disappointed, the sample code on the cd makes up a bit but I have a specific problem with the code on the cd. Some samples actually crashed my machine(Blitz) and Surface did nothing, then I looked at the code while the authors had code to see whether the user had a 16-bit RGB enabled gfx card, they messed that up by setting the mode to 32-bits with the call to SetDisplayMode, so if you have a gfx card that only supports 24-bits the program either does nothing or crashes, why the authors assumed that everyone had a 32-bit gfx card I have no idea to make the programs work change the argument of SetDisplayMode from 32 to 24 and it should work. After reading this book I should email Charles Petzold and beg him to write a book on DirectX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coverage of the Basics","review":"If you are looking for an overview of DirectX, you will find it here.

This book is perfect for people with programming experience who want to get into DirectX programming. The Direct Draw stuff is the best I have seen.

In short if you want to do DirectX get this book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment","review":"This seems like a book on DirectX theory, but not a programming guide. The examples are somewhat obscure, and hide the relationship of DirectX and windows through wrappers.Most of the Microsoft Press books I've got are great, except this one. This book is a true disapointment, don't expect it to get you developing DX apps unless you've got lots of other resources and time.To put it bluntly, \\"This book sucks!\\" Any other DX book is bound to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but...","review":"I use this book primarily as a reference to directX, but I believe it would serve as a good \\"tutorial\\". However, DirectX is a low-level windows API, and does not mix good with C++. By using C++, you are adding extra overhead to your program, defeating the purpose of DirectX. C is the best language to use for fast, low-level win32 application programming. I personally think that if you need to use MFC to program windows applications, you should move on to a more whimpier language such as visual basic. However, if you know how to program Win32 applications in C, this book is for you. All examples compiled nicely under my VC4 compiler, with a few modifications to some. Astonishingly, even though this book was written by some guy at microsuck, I really think this is a great book.

I don't feel like a frumpy mom while carrying this. Also, it carries quite a bit without looking bulky. I regulary carry wipes, diapers for my infant and my potty-training toddler, plus at least one change of clothes for each child in the two larger compartments. I still have room for my keys, wallet, cell phone, sun glasses, and a hair brush in the two inner zippered pockets.I only gave it 4 stars because the shoulder strap needs a little more padding.

Devil does the right thing and offers to marry Honoria and secretly he is pleased because he recognizes her as his mate. Honoria has visions of adventure and vows never to marry. I liked this story because although both characters are stubborn, they both realize that sometimes certain courses are inevitable and they happily accept their fate. The chemistry between the couple is hot and the scene of them in the window is subtly, but tastefully erotic. The only flaw in this story is the whodunit of Tolly's murder. The killer was entirely too obvious from the beginning.

I borrowed it because it reviewed so highly, but was disgusted at the end of 30 pages.

Having read Rogue's Proposal, which I also found dreadful, I thought I'd give this one a try, since it's \\"said\\" to be the best of the bunch.

Do yourself a favor, and miss this bandwagon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored all the way through","review":"Yes, like many people I have a compulsion: I must finish books I start. I also love families in historical romances. This was a huge family of hunky men, so I thought I had to give it a chance. Big mistake. The writing is not as good as many other writers and there are tons of love scenes and little other substance to the book. I was just not entertained, but I still read 4 more of her books hoping that she just wrote a few bad ones at the start. Well, guess what they all stink. The characters are dull, the plot boring and the writing makes it all the more painfull. Save yourself some time and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO WORDY","review":"WARNING!

Devil and Honoria were great together and the other charaters added to the books attractions. Being a fan of Lindsey, Deveraux and Kane I have found it hard to find authors that match them.

I was excited to uncover a new-to-me romance series. I like spunky, non-traditional heroines. I like big, dark, surface-scary heroes. The back of this book sounded like it was tailor made--just for me! Alas, I struggled through all 388 pages looking, in vain, for a story. For a snippet that would make me smile or send my pulses pounding. To be fair, there were parts of chapters--heck, toward the end there was a solid 30 pages or so--that were riveting and fun and moved the story forward.But, ultimately, this one goes to the next Friends of the Library book sale and this author goes off my \\"must have\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best in the series?","review":"This series was recommended to me, so I decided to start with the first one. At least I think this is the first one in the series. Anyway, it was one that got very high reviews, so I thought it couldn't be too bad. It was pretty boring. Stephanie Laurens seems to write well, yet her characters seem to hold themselves slightly apart from the reader - I just don't seem to connect with them totally and therefore don't feel strongly about them getting together or not. This has been a consistent problem with all the books that I have read by her, so I think I probably won't read any more of them. If you enjoyed this story, great.

Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives, is a great regency romance hero - aristocratic, extremely masculine, very sexy. He's made up his mind that Honoria Prudence is the wife for him, and he doggedly sets out to win her. Honor is a refreshing change from most regency heroines. She's sophisticated, not spunky; commanding, not wilfull; elegant, not dainty. It's easy to see why Devil (yes, the names of the Bar Cynster cousins are silly - do your best to ignore it) is so determined to have her as his duchess. Their courtship is wonderful - lots of tension and steamy love scenes. Even better, we get to see their relationship mature after their marriage. I'll be reading this one again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"This is my second time reading Stephanie Lauren's. I bought All About Passion, first.

True, you do know who did it from the beginning, but what the hey, it was still entertaining, and a great love story.Buy a mystery if you want a who dunnit book.

Good cinematography, but a lot of that was borrowed from M*A*S*H. The last twenty minutes of McCabe and Mrs. Miller is incredibly slow and boring to sit through. And finally, make sure you understand this: it's a film that embraces whores and whorehouses. Hey, thanks, but no thanks. I love the look of the shanty town. Warren Beatty does a decent job of acting, breaking away from the usual \\"stare at a wall with a vacant expression\\" routine. Julie Christie once again turns in a very overrated performance, but then again, the Academy loves giving out nominations to those who play prostitutes and/or are raped. Oh, how I love the fake snow. It's just so obvious. M*A*S*H is a classic, but Robert Altman is still one of the most overrated directors. All in all, watching McCabe and Mrs. Miller once is enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"While I thought the story itself and the cinematography was good, I was totally unimpresed with the dialog given by Altman to Beatty and Christie. Beatty basically has mumble dialog and Christie business dialog. I never really could get involved with the characters. I also thought Cohen's 1971 sounding music was annoyingly out of place for this early century movie. I think this is the clear failing of the director and wonder how much better this movie could have been had someone other than Altman (Huston, perhaps?) directed & controlled the screenplay/movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altman Agonistes","review":"If you like Altman, you may like this, but Christie is horribly miscast as the female lead and Beatty, as the male lead, might as well have \\"mailed in\\" his performance.

Does anyone really think the man who made \\"Popeye\\" is a genius? Everyone I know hated this film - and not because of some perceived attack on capitalism (which I think you need to have a wild imagination to see in this film) but because it seems so pointless, boring, downright pretentious. It is a grade Z art film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Documentary, not the movie","review":"I bought this DVD thinking I was buying the movie, McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Instead, when I began to play it, I found that it is actually a backdrop for commentary by Robert Altman (the director) and David Foster (the producer). As the movie begins, their commentary on how they made the film begins and there is no way to turn it off. The \\"Special Features\\" has a selection for \\"Commentary\\", but selecting it does not provide an option for turning it off; there is no way to turn the commentary off. Don't buy this DVD if you want the movie. This is a DVD of Altman and Foster blabbering about the movie with the movie as a backdrop, it's not the movie. I would give the movie five stars, but if there were a way to give this DVD no stars, I would. Don't buy this if you want the movie!

Though fans of Surprise, Surprise, Surprise may feel a little left out since these songs lack the darkness found in the previous albums, Mark's sonngwriting has only grown stronger. Perhaps the production is to blame for the lighter feel of these sonngs.

Most mp3 players come with this accessory.

My other players have buttons that are easy to feel and navigate once you learn where they are.--For the same reason, it's also difficult to change the volume.When running, I actually prefer my older mp3 player that doesn't hold as many songs as my ipod.

I make sure to not keep it in my pocket with keys or change and take great care to place it in safe locations when not in use. Still, somehow the front has scratched. I read an article on the web that using Brasso and a soft cloth will get rid of the scratches.A friend told me that, unlike the nano Tubes, there are 3rd party protectors that do cover the screen with a clear film -- the screen is the most important area.

That one came with dock, charger, 2nd cord for usb, nice case, caps for the connector, and a volume and pause control feature that hooked up in-line to the headphones.

She can't sing for her life, so I do not recommend this CD for any customers who want to hear a good showtune or two, because you'll get Elaine's interpretation of a good showtune, which is most offensive. Sure, she's funny, but her singing is out of tune and scratchy. Most importantly, her life is not very exciting or eventful. All she is really known for is singing \\"Ladies Who Lunch\\", from Sondheim's show, Company, which is half forgotten already. In another 15 years nobody will even remember her. No memorable movies or television shows. She is, however, very funny, which is entertaining to listen to... but still, she can't sing and will soon be forgotten. True, she did win a Tony award, but even from that she'll be known as the old biddy who made a fool of herself after accepting the award she's been waiting so long for...

Admire them, CERTAINLY, but for goodness sake we're annonted them with some kind of 'you can't possibly do wrong.' From everything I've read, Noel Coward was NOT thrilled with Ms. Strich.--- Nor she of him --- Ms. Strich has simply taken time off from getting her picture in Theatre Weekly to do this.

Certain lines, such as what Ethel Merman said to Elaine when she needed to leave an understudy role for Merman to sing in another show - are classic catchphrases. It's a shame that such an honest, warts-and-all performer was treated so shabbily at the Tony Awards. This CD shows that the lady is a brilliant talent who still owns THE LADIES WHO LUNCH and I'M STILL HERE. (Even though,as Stritch says, she's still too young to sing the latter.)

Being a 70's synthesizer junkie, the sounds that come out of his ARP 2600 and Odyssey (as well as an EMS) are absolutely magical and wizard-like, and the sonic patterns he creates on 'Picture Music', in my opinion, are every bit the equivalent of 'Moondawn' and all of his other more critically praised records. It holds up amazingly well, and 'space music' fans cannot afford to be without a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Listening for Rainy Days","review":"Picture Music remains something of an anomoly in Schulze's canon. Rather than the long, sweeping synth pads and choirs on other albums of this period, it relies primarily on a chunky, fascinating bass line that flows effortlessly underneath gentle and moody solos. Side 2 is less successful, employing an awkward drum kit and some synth work that is a little too invasive, but overall this album is a essential for any Schulze fan. It could also serve as a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the Old Master because of it's bassline hook and flowing rhythm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad digital transfer","review":"I downloaded this without looking at the sample (well - it was 99c) but this is a poor transfer with a lot of formatting errors and before the end of the first chapter I had deleted it and downloaded the New York Times version which is much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep.

I have to tell you that I am a book lover. I cannot fall asleep without a book in my hands. But I hate this book too! First of all, the poor language. I don't know what kind of English kids can learn reading it. It's a language of poorly educated americans. The contents are not very exciting either.

It gave a clear picture of what any person could do if they so wished. It gave hope and joy to the reader, but it also made sure it was understood that life is not all fun and games, but many emotions playing on each other. It was very emotional and some what exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very fun with lots of wisdom between the lines.","review":"These were the most down to earth characters and the author fills the book with interesting and genuine people with real problems.

Absolutely excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly inspiring story brought to life","review":"When Barbara Kingsolver wrote this novel she brought a great American story to life. Taylor Greer, who is a women from Pittman County, Kentucky, travels down a road that eventually leads her into terrible things, but in the end it always comes out good. The way Kingsolver depicts such things as; family, culture, and irony is truly unique. This was a great book, I would hghly recommend it to anyone who loves a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure From a Great Storyteller","review":"Kingsolver is a genius at creating and developing characters. Each one, from the main characters to the old woman we encounter in the motel, is real, multi-dimensional, interesting. You care what happens to them. Her locations have life so her characters can have real experiences there. You can smell the air on a hot night in Arizona just before the rain comes. You can feel the humidity in Kentucky and the aridity in the desert. Best of all, though, is that Kingsolver is a great story teller. She will take you with her on whatever adventure she sets off on with her amazing characters. Sit back, relax. Get ready for a great ride. I envy you just getting started on a Kingsolver story. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first novel","review":"This was Kingsolver's first novel. At first I felt disappointed that the writing was not as poetic and lyrical as in PRODIGAL SUMMER, but then realized that that type of writing would not have fit this story. It needed to be gritty and real.I thoroughly enjoyed this story of a young woman's coming into her own and deciding what was important to her. I'm looking forward to the sequel, PIGS IN HEAVEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world's introduction to Barbara Kingsolver","review":"The story of how Taylor Greer got her name has nearly passed into literary lore. Determined to get out of Kentucky without getting pregnant, Marietta Greer drives a decrepit heap of an old car due west, determined to rename herself after the town where the car stops, she coasts to a stop in Taylorville and thus became Taylor Greer. In short order, she is given a baby she names Turtle, makes it to Tucson, rents a house near Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, makes some interesting friends including a battered divorcee with a pissed-off ex and a little girl of her own, faces motherhood issues - and somehow does it all with whimsical humor.The Bean Trees spawned an entity called Barbara Kingsolver, a gift to readers and other writers. Start with this one, and then read everything else she's written. She's a national institution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected journey through the mid western US","review":"The Bean Trees is a well written novel about a young woman fighting through life.

After she decides to travel west, Taylor finds herself in Tucson, Arizona. Lou Ann, Mattie, Esperanza, Estevan, and many more of her new friends help Taylor through her transition with a little unexpected miracle. A story with pleanty to say. Barbara Kingsolver couldn't have done it any better. Great book for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tucsonian","review":"Living in Tucson and having migrated here from the Midwest at about the same age as the main character, and being from a blue-color background and having worked in the area the book talks about I think the author's characters are from a fantasy world and represent the authors personal politics. I found the characters very boring and self-indulging. It is a good example of liturature that doesn't present the opposing views of life that make reading meaningful to me.I almost made it half way before I said I don't have to read anymore of this book and exchanged it at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting. They grow on trees?","review":"This was an interesting read. Not a fast one, but a good, well written, interesting story that draws you into the life of the main character and her \\"adopted\\" daughter.

I like the people doing what people should and not what the world expects of them just because there are guidelines which don't necessarily fit everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! First Chapter lacks hook.","review":"This book was written with seamless literary connections, and was fun to read at the same time. The author's characters are multidemintional and real. The story is flawless. My only complaint is the first chapter lacked a hook to catch the reader, but the rest of the book will keep anybody from putting it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't a great book","review":"I read this book for a book club and I didn't think it was that great. First of all the beginning was kind of slow. It started to get interesting by the end of the book but it wouldn't be a book I would recommend. Maybe I need to read it again since a lot of the club members enjoyed this book. Anyways wouldn't read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story about important life issues and growth","review":"I thought this book was great story about some very important issues many people have to face in life.

Barbara Kingsolver has written a very enjoyable novel filled with hope and inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!! Totally enjoyable.","review":"Such a powerful well written novel bringing to light abandonment, diversity, friendship, and the power of love.

A great summer read that was purchased simply because it was a recommended book at my local bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed the book and its colorful dialogue.","review":"I enjoyed the dialogue the most. iliked seeing how Taylor dealt with her problems of motherhood and how she developed into a wonderful woman throughout the book. Have fun with the book, because I thought it was very funny and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope springs eternal for those willing to change their names","review":"Ms. Kingsolver reels you in to a small town only to quickly throw you back into the cruel harsh world. The changing names of characters and the hidden world of the refugees exist in our world even though we cannot always recognize them. I loved the way the main character held on to her \\"head rights,\\" not realistically, but to combat her own insecurity. In the end, she is strong enough to overcome her fears and finds she doesn't need to fall back on anything. Yes, it was idealistic, but it was well written and made me feel better about the people I live with in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"The only memory I have of reading this novel 20 years ago is chasing my roommate around the apartment reading aloud, while she covered her ears and screamed for me to stop. Yeah, the prose is that stilted, hackneyed, predictable, and plain old lazy.The characters are flat. The situation is reworked from hundreds of other novels. The ending is stupid in its warm fuzzy falseness. Ugh.I guess I took it all too seriously. I suppose if you're looking for a light, breezy, mindless read, this would work ... but why? You have so many better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts slow, ends too quickly!","review":"I started this book with a few qualms. It began slowly, and I found myself drifting away from it and finding myself stuck on the same sentence.Once it got going, right after Marietta renames herself Taylor and acquires Turtle, I got interested. I nestled in a chair and read straight through the rest of \\"The Bean Trees\\" and I enjoyed it immensly. Ms. Poppy, Louann, Esperanza and Estefan, Taylor, and especially Turtle, were all vivid before my eyes and when I found myself on the last page, I felt as if friends of mine had moved away!The book starts slowly, but it seems that the best books always do."},{"rating":"2","title":"great summer read!","review":"The characters are rich in this non-traditional family novel. I really began to care what was going on in their lives. I'm champing at the bit to read the sequel to this book (Pigs in Heaven). Being from the South myself, I could really relate to the language of the story from Taylor's and Lou Ann's point of view. The main story is set in Arizona though, so don't go thinking this is just for Southern gals. You learn about the lives of some people that have had a bit of a rough time of it, but they are struggling through, and their lives don't seem to be quite as bleak as they think. The characters were not stereotypical that's for sure! Take a chance on this book - you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bean trees","review":"i read this book as a class project and i thought it had a very slow start but after i got to the second or third chapter i realy got into it i would recomend this book to alot of people because i cant stop saying good things about this book. people that know me think im crazy because i finished this book within my first week of starting it and the look at it and think that it is so long but once i started i realy got into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read.","review":"Before I start I have to say I read this book for an English class, but regardlessly it is still terrible.

Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a faver, don't read this book!","review":"This book really did stink. A horrible waste of time and effort to read. When I first started reading the book, I was genuinely interested. The first chapter left me with a feeling of suspense. But after that, the book really goes downhill, starting at the point when Taylor acepts a baby from a total stranger. The characters were dull, and the book gave you no incentive to turn the next page. This book is only fit to be used for kindling on those long cold winter nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it less than 1 star.","review":"This book is about nothing. There is no point, or whatever little there is of it is very well hidden in the nonsense. I bought it based on the good reviews on Amazon, thinking that 300+ reviews could not be wrong. Bad mistake.Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST books I have ever read","review":"This book is truly awful. I cannot evenly remotely imagine why anyone would want to read this book or why they would enjoy it. Overall the book communicates three main messages: 1.The Unites States should open our borders and let anyone who wants to come, regardless of their background. 2.The majority of men are stupid self-centered perverts who are completely useless. and 3. America is full of and is run by a bunch of cold-hearted hypocrites. It eludes me how so much stupidity can be packed into one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy For Turtle","review":"This book, like the other Barbara Kingsolver books I have read, has a definite crusader undercurrent. This time the issues addressed had to do with child care, immigration bureaucracy, the irresponsibility of American white men, and the need for strong women to make up for that. Most of her points were well taken, and I mostly agreed with her. (However, she could have used a man to tell her the difference between a rocker arm and a tie rod.) The book is heart warming story about a little 3 year old abused Native American girl (named Turtle), and the tough young single woman who finds her, loves her and starts her on the road to having a life. This is my third Kingsolver book. I liked them all. She is a gifted writer. (My kindle version had some strange proof reading errors toward the end - don't know if these were in the original.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How a Child Can Give Life Redirection","review":"I really enjoyed the story's hard truth and honesty of feelings.

I didn't like the first chapter but after that I was sold. I loved the down-to-earth charachters and the different relationships (especially Taylor and Turtle and Taylor and Estevan). The story shows that your \\"family\\" does not necessarily have to be blood relations but can consist of those you care for and are close to. Highly recommend this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking story of Family Values","review":"Imagine leaving your hometown because you don't want to suffer the same fate of being \\"barefoot and pregnant,\\" only to have to take the responsibility of a child you really didn't need. The Bean Trees is an amazing book that gets your attention from page 1 to the end. A story of the value of family and friendship, brought to present times.

A must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as everyone said!!!!","review":"I loved the description of this book- it sounded like something I would enjoy. I was wrong.

Good characters, but it left me feeling like I wanted more of a story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver was unwillingly rammed down my throat to read by my english teacher. This book was awful. After reading it twice, once for plot, the second for inspection. I realized how ashamed Kingsolver should be for writing such an atrocity. There was absolutely no detail put into such fine details as how she escapes with this indian baby. At a glance, for uncaring readers this book may be alright. But if you cannot stand the fine line between reality, and how fake the authors reality is. You honestly want to throw-up your lunch after reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bean Tree by Barbara Kingsolver","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has stimulated the minds of readers through her book THE BEAN TREES. In the novel, 22 year old Taylor Greer, a young woman searching for a different path in life, abandons her home town in Kentucky and travels down to the sunny state of Arizona. On her way to her new adventure Taylor is given a 3 year old child, who she names Turtle, and has no other option but including her into her life. This heartfelt novel tells the story of Taylor and Turtle as they grow and evolve their lives over time in a tire shop located in Tuscon, Arizona. Reading this book made me both tear and smile from its unexpected turns and captivating adventures. As piece of literature for all age groups to relate to, it is impossible to put it down. I recommend this novel to anyone in search of an entertaining story."},{"rating":"1","title":"LETS SLEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I dont know who Barbara Kingsolver is directing this book to, but if it is teenagers then she's got a lot of work to do . This book is boring enough to put somebody asleep, and it did me! This book was not interesting in the slightest way! The hardest thing that the main character had to do was go across a STATE border with illegal aleins that were dressed like Americans, and it was sooooooooooo easy. My review on this book is that it wasn't worth my time, and the only good thing about it was that I caught up on my sleep!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vaguely disturbing book, with simplistic characters","review":"I was bothered by the fact that it was a-okay for Taylor to take this child, who presumably has relatives on the reservation besides her mother, away from her family. It was sort of patronizing, promoting a stereotype that Indians are alcoholics who don't pay attention to their kids, and that those kids are better off with someone else. The device that Taylor's grandfather was \\"part Cherokee\\" is, in my opinion, a convenient way to fend off this criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"12 years ago as an 18 year old in High School, I remember being very angry at being forced to read this garbage. Now, at age 30 and with the benefit of hindsight, I'm still very angry at having been forced to read this garbage.It's funny that most in academia would turn their nose up at making, say, a Stephen King book required reading (just using an arbitrary/contemporary example)-- yet on his worst day, King could still write character with far more depth than any in this.I barely remember the plot, so at best you can say this book is forgettable, but I do recall every single page being painful to get through. Made \\"A Separate Peace\\" almost good by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"The whole theme of the novel is along the same lines as Steel Magnolias and Fried Green Tomatoes.

On page 136 Taylor Greer makes one true understatement when she says, \\"I know I'm ignorant.\\" This story is pathetic in that when she is given the Cherokee Indian child and takes her to a motel, she sees plainly that the child has been sexually abused, yet she doesn't take the child to a doctor for several months. He then shows her x-rays where the child has had multiple fractures from abuse. The book has no wisdom, except for the proper English spoken by the Mayan teacher and what does Taylor do, but thinks she's in love with him, when his wife is along with him. This was just sad. This Kentucky hillbilly character is sarcastic and rude, and too lazy to get a starter in her car, so she doesn't have to push it. I have no intention of having my daughter read this book, as it does nothing to teach values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random [...]","review":"This book is horrible, when I read it I cried at the obserdity of it. It starts out with the main charactor driving in a car, she stops at a bus stop and suddenly recieves a small native american child for no reason. The child's name is Turtle, she's at least three but because of sexual abuse looks like an infant. Again ridiculous. Unfortunately this book doesn't stop there, for about ten chapters she just complains and complains about how hard it is to find a man and raise a kid, tear. In the end the novel simplely implodes with no real conclusion.

This book is horrid. It lacks literary value. Any hidden meanings must have been merely coincidental, considering the probable intellect of the author. It's rather unfortunate that it somehow worked its way into the curriculum of some schools. It's sad to think that impressionable students are forced into reading and assessing this book by people that probably thought it was wonderful. I highly anti-suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"When I first began reading The Bean Trees, I could relate to the main character. She was several years younger than I, but basically matured during the same period of time. What really got to me was that I found it highly, if not extremely unlikely that a 22/23 year old in the late 70's would even consider keeping a child that someone left in her car. If she even had considered giving the child to the proper authorities I might have found it somewhat believable. If this did appear in the book it was soo brief to have escaped my notice. This issue somehow permeated my thoughts while reading the book and for that reason I couldn't involve myself to the greatest extent.Her writing style is interesting and poetic but give me a break. I still can't believe anyone, especially with her desire to start a new life, would have kept a child. Very unrealistic how the care of the child was underplayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good.","review":"This book was not to interesting for me because of the plot.It started out interesting when they found Turtle but after that it got boring.

I also read a review saying this book is too sexual, well let me tell you this right now if this book was too profane on sex for that person they must get offended very easily. The author seemed to show great dislike in pornography. Several times in this book she makes negative remarks on a local porn shop by the main characters job. This story is a wonderful tale of a young, explorious women who leaves her small town for adventure.

This book is funny but also keeps you thinking of possible outcomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It is one of those books that is just about life - the people you meet, places you go, things you do. It explores the need one feels to help those worse off, and has an even sprinkling of comedy too ( just enough to make me laugh out loud sometimes). Over all I enjoyed the book because it finds a nice way to share the universal troubles everyone has to deal with in one way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"something for everyone","review":"The Bean Trees is excellent.

It's inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a disgrace to English language","review":"Dear Friends, I have read this book, and other reviews, and I have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, I, Jason Xu, appreciates the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this \\"interestingly unique\\" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, \\"Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations.\\"P.S. I'm unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop! Stop! I'm already dead....","review":"It has been 3 long years since I read Barbara Kingsolver's \\"The Bean Trees\\", and to this very day, I still feel completely violated in the worst possible way. This book was an utter nightmare, and I'm pretty sure Kingsolver is an avatar of the Dark Lord we call Satan. Seriously, this book made me wish I had never been born, and only by jabbing my eyes out with a moldy chopstick did I keep myself from drifting off into a coma. Sometimes, I'd be in my bed, trying to go to sleep... and that's when I feel the dark shadowy presence of Turtle, just watching me, breathing heavily. The ramifications of Kingsolver and her atrocity in my life are indescribable. STAY AT LEAST 30 FEET AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL TIMES! Run for the hills!

This book is evil , like the game board in jumanji.It has no climax ,some the characters have no point to exist in the story .Lou is talked about for numerous chapters and then never again mentioned.The big word to this book is random ,the symbolism of the bird,the Disneyworld metaphors,the fact that the man who interviews lou ann stares at her chest. I just don't understand this book!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"I'd like to say that I thought this book was horrible. The story has no plot to it and is purely descriptive. Definately a slow read that will put you to sleep and the story is very frustrating. The girl leaves KY so she doesn't end up like the other hick girls but still gets an unexpected baby and works at a mechanic store (that has a religious name - religion being another characteristic of hick towns) Extremely boring - read something else unless you want to experience what hell is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I were stranded on a desert island,","review":"and I could take 5 books, 5 albums, and 5 movies, I'd probably die of exposure. If I took the bean trees, however, at least i'd have something to start fire with. This could possibly be the worst book ever written. It is easy to read, because the author doesn't try to hard to challenge the readers mind. It is a boring, unrealistic book about a girl's journey across the country. The fact that i'm of the male persuasion may taint my view of the book, but I'm allowed to have an opinion, and also maintain the right to spread it everywhere I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly the tapes don't work properly","review":"I wish I could have enjoyed this book but the tapes didn't work, I won't be buying used books on tape anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting book","review":"A friend encouraged me to read this book, as a \\"change of pace\\" from my usual choice of reading material. I have to say, it was an enchanting book. Kingsolver's style is very readable. Her use of dialect creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable. Her attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive. The journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences. She seems to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge. Her involvement with others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would like to claim as our own. A very companionable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author takes you to new heights in reading!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I had to read it for school, and then I read the sequel for fun. Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful author because even though I've never had any experiences like the characters in the book, I can relate to them and picture myself in the beautiful southwest. Absolutely awesome. I couldn't put it down and I still read it at least three times a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"This book is deceptive. It starts out a bit slowly, but suddenly you find yourself really caring about Taylor & Turtle and really wanting to know how things will turn out. I really loved this book and its sequel PIGS IN HEAVEN. It really deserves more than 4 stars but not quite 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the flawed characters","review":"When you look over Kingolver's pedigree and education you might expect her characters to be stuffy intellectuals. Although her books are full of meat, her characters are never full of bologna. Taylor shines with courage and resolve. Kingsolver's rendering of the setting in Arizona has sparked an interest in me. The intelligence and thoughtfulness of this blue collar woman is refreshing to American women's novels. As part Cherokee indian myself, I found her use of the Cherokee culture and the dillemmas facing it sensitive and profound. The fact is Taylor and Turtle are two of my favorite Kingsolver creations. I highly recommend this book and its sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and insightful","review":"This book was phenomenal. Barbara Kingsolver had an incredible sensitivity in writing this book. The plot and the characters were beautiful and realistic. Kingsolver thoughtfully approached the issue of importance--is the little child whom no one wants, is abandoned, and sexually abused as important as the person who \\"has their life together\\"? I would strongly recommend this book. Please read it with an open heart, and over look your prejudices."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trifle tiresome","review":"I finished this book because I am persistent. The writing seems to be episodic. The author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen. Although I know this is fiction, I always expect a certain amount of credibility, so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won't start and leave town for destinations unknown? And how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer? I know that this is meant to include single mothers, independent women, helping the great unwashed, the plight of refugees, Native Americans, abandoned children, and domestic abuse, but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book, about a typical country girl wanting to become something more, simply amazes me. The plot seemed sketchy at first, but it turned out to be so meaningful and completely changes ideas about motherhood, families, and friendship. It uses a simple, blunt tone, which highlights the honest voice and deeper meaning beneath the words. It's a great modern classic and the character development is prodigious. The metaphors are superb. I truly loved this book, my only complaint is that it ended too quickly for my tastes. This novel was also very different from what I'm used to, so this book is probably mostly suited for people with a high level reading/inferring ability, to enjoy it, but pretty much anyone can understand it. I would however, recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was written some years ago but speaks to the modern day world. Most young people look to the day when they will go off on their own to see what life holds for them. Most would probably not take on the responsibilities the young woman in this book shoulders nor have the compassion for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional story, quite thought provoking","review":"Excellent book!

I am personally not a reader, but when I was forced to read it for an English assignment, I realized that this book was GREAT. It mad me laugh, cry, and think that this could one day happen to me. Not the exact same circumstance, but something that leads me to such difficulties that Taylor did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for someone searching to belong !!!!","review":"Excellent book, Excellent author! This was a fantastic journey. This is a must read for mothers who wonder if it's all worth it at times.This book allows one to feel as lost as Turtle did, gives you the feeling that you are giving your child (and yourself) that sense of belonging and sense of security these people were all searching for.I strongly urge anyone with a heart to read this book, these characters will stay with you always, just like Turtles St.Christopher medallion!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bean Trees doesn't score high...","review":"I had been forced to read this book..and analyse it with great detail and this may add to why I think this book isn't a \\"10\\".

It is outdated (telegrams) and the examples or actual buying and selling do not and cannot match today's market requirements. The writing is awful and the ideas presented are unrealistic.

The book was written in 1959 or something and $2 million was a lot of cheese back then....I feel like I am no better off after reading this book....

When I first learned about the title it suggests that I will learn about the tactics and strategies of how to win $2000,000 in the stock market. It turns out that the title is false and misleading. All Mr Darvas did is to describe \\"what\\" he did to earn $2000,000. At no time did he mention the \\"how\\" to make $2000,000 in the stock market. Furthermore, the timeline was not appropriate. All the shares were bought in the 50's and now we are in 2009. Is Mr Darvas still alive? I feel I have been cheated by this book and lost a small fortune.

That's the whole book in a nutshell. If your more interested in strategy than entertainment you may find the book drags a bit, but it is a small book. The one thing dangerous about this book is that the author makes heavy use of leverage which is very risky. His whole success really stemmed from one very very lucky trade where there was an incredible short squeeze due to someone trying to take over the company which he had no premonition of - just very lucky timing. A beginning investor could take this success story to heart and go leverage themselves to the hilt and create a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like fiction","review":"The only useful technique of his that can be used in today's market is his box technique; A.K.A support and resistance lines. If you know about them (and quite frankly what new trader doesn't) then this book is a waste of time unless you want to read something that isn't going to tax your brain.The reason I gave it two stars is this book turned out to be a break for me from reading a lot of rather intensely technical books, and I was able to tackle the next book on my list feeling a bit refreshed without having lost my rhythm for reading stock trading books.Things have changed since the 1950's. There is so much irrelevance in this book for today's market, and that which is relevant is available to learn in almost any other book written this century.If you spot this at a garage sale then spend the 10 cents to satisfy your curiosity, otherwise don't waste your time if you are more interested in learning something useful from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money .. it's merely buying on Break-out","review":"In 1957 to 1958, the Dow Jones Industrial went up 60%.

Stops placed are subjective (based on how he felt the strength of the market is)3. Use Trailing stop-losses4. Stocks selected should be in a 'future' industry eg GM, Chrysler during that time as opposed to railway stocks (though I don't believe this is strictly adhered to in his stock picks)Also, the stocks you pick must not have a tendency to retrace when they are moving up, otherwise I'm pretty positive your trailing stop-losses will be hit 90% of the time and won't let your profits run as much.I'm highly skeptical and I've been in the market for 15 years"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read this book over 100 times!","review":"It's that good.

At least that was the conclusion of the New York State Attorney General, Louis Lefkowitz. A write-up of the allegations against Darvas can be found at[...]Aside from outright misrepresentation of gains actually made, Darvas excluded his trades that resulted in losses and omitted the fact that much of his investments were made with the proceeds of margin loans.While it is clear that Darvas did not make $2 million in the stock market, it is entirely possible that he made a comparable sum selling books to benighted people who actually believed that some benevolent individual who discovered the secret to attaining fantastic wealth in the stock market would be happy to share it with the whole world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Even though Mr. Darvas made these stock transactions about 45 years ago, many aspects of his system are still in effect today.

It is a very good book and a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suprising Little Gem","review":"When I saw the title I thought this would be an infomercial. What a surprise! The narrative of the investment activity in 1950's of a Hungarian Jewish immigrant who fled Nazi genocide turned successful ballroom dancer reviewing his learning the trading business that leads to $ 2,000,000 from a $ 10,000 seems like a novel. In reading about the book I learned most of the public and the government didn't believe his story either. In addition to dancing and investing Nicolas Darvas is an exceptional writer. The organization of the book and the narrative is not only easy to read but is an excellent teaching tool. Having read the Market Wizards books by Jack Schwager I see the same lessons learned by Mr. Darvas as the greats in the Wizards series. I cannot attest to the validity of the Box Theory employed to make the $ 2 million ($ 14 million in today's dollars) but I can say I enjoyed a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can dramatically increase your wealth!","review":"I shunned this book 10 years ago because of its title and its use of margin. Following the recommendation of Investors Business Daily I bought the book and started reading it. The author's experience of trading stocks echoed with mine sentence by sentence and I was totally absorbed. I admired his relentless pursuit of how the stock market actually worked and he finally figured it all out to make two million dollars. To create tremendous wealth you must concentrate on the best acting stocks in the market and use trailing stop loss orders. I am glad the author, a dancer, was willing to share a secret that Wall Street pros will trash but who made $2 millions? The book has already doubled my net worth and whoever follow these words of wisdom will become the millionaire next door!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice motivation","review":"This is a nice little motivational book. Darvas went from an absolute novice who knew nothing about stocks to a millionaire in a short period of time. He basically stumbled upon simple price/volume technical analysis without realizing it. The lesson to be learned here is unemotional discipline, which Darvas clearly points out that he did not have at times and shows you the disasterous results. His trades are followed in detail along with the mindset that went along with each one. Surprisingly he really didn't diversify that much. There are no groundbreaking techniques here, but it is a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap book that can save you serious money.","review":"I doubt doing the things he actually did to make his money would work today.

The ideas seem solid but if you look up the actual records it was about 200,000 USD. Just to keep in mind there is no better trader than one who thinks for themselves.

However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Darvas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"This book is an excellent way for someone to gain experience though an autobiobraphy. As such it covers most investment fallacies and mistakes new investors tend to make. His big run up in value took place with large companies that were rapidly growing during the late 1950's. He was wise enough to select stocks that went up 200%, 300% or more in a matter of a year or two. His job shielded him from getting too close to the daily ups and downs of Wall Street, which worked for his advantage. I am not sure this can be repeated in today's modern investment world. So much has changed and communications are now at light speed. Still an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stock market books ever written!","review":"A bookseller gave me a copy of Darvas' book with the comment \\"Read this if you get a chance--it almost seems possible\\". This book changed my life. I never had any interest in the stock market until I read this book. Darvas made every mistake but kept on and finally came up with a method of buying stocks that really works. This edition is great because it has a section at the end of the book entitled Questions and Answers that did not appear in the original hardback edition. By the way Darvas was Hungarian and he pronounced his name DAR-vash not DAR-vas. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it but it lacks something","review":"I enjoyed the system derived purely from his experience.

It was a page-turner, if that's possible with a book about investing. The book is concisely written, entertaining, and inspirational. One of the lessons in this book I immediately applied to my trading was to eliminate \\"noise\\". So bye bye to CNBC and TV/Internet gossipping of markets and stocks.

I also found the deterioration of his investment results when he had too much information to be very true, and this was in the pre-Internet age! I think if you read this book and no other, you can do well in the market, if only because you will keep it simple. So often people hold on to losing stocks, hoping and praying they will come back, whereas his approach mechanically and automatically forces you to cut your losses early. The charts in the back are very good despite their skimpiness, and illustrate how he would purchase a stock as it is making a new high out of a base (a \\"box,\\" to use his terms).

He decides to go after it. During his journey we meet some interesting characters such as Suzuka, Aisha Clanclan (My favorite character), Kei Pirates, the MacDougall brothers, Harry, and Lord Hazanko.

It's basically an American Saturday morning cartoon with crude jokes and nudity. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. The main character Gene Starwind is cool, Caster Gun and all, and the concept is original, but that's where it stops.There is absolutely no depth, each and every supporting character is lame and under developed, nothing is explained, the episodes leave you wanting so much more, and the ending is a total let down. It's got sub par action and a hand full of pretty good action scenes but nothing more.Don't compare this to the likes of Trigun or Cowboy Bebop, especially the latter. Outlaw Star is simply okay, B-/C+, nothing more. Watch your friend's dvds before you buy this first."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Grown Ups or Kids?","review":"I originally watched Outlaw Star when it was on Cartoon Network, and thought it was one of the best anime's I had ever seen.How disapointed I was when I ordered and actually started to watch it.Outlaw Star is another tragic example of people trying to mix a very simple and almost childish atmosphere with mature themes and language. Which in short means that the storyline and the dialog my attract the attention of younger people who shouldn't be exposed to the language and the nudity that is in the cartoon, while more mature audiences may feel almost embaressed to be watching something so simple.Baisically, it's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon with foul language and sex. It's a very poor mix.Except for their dialog, the characters are great. the storyline, although sometimes predictable and simple eventually picks up, and by the end, you truly want to know what the Galactic Layline is, if you can get that far in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"this is the worst anime of all time. the animation sucks, the shot composition is perfunctory and awkward, the storyline is melodramatic to the extreme and the characters have about as much personality as a loaf of bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update to old review","review":"This is my father's book.

Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.This was low budget, over-stuffed with action and bad special effects and ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"A more or less sequel to John Carpenter's smashing take on vampires, Vampires: Los Muertos finds Carpenter's long time collaborator Tommy Lee Wallace (Halloween 3) directing this low budget direct to video shlock fest, starring Jon Bon Jovi of all people as a vampire hunter in over his head. Assembling a haphazard, rag tag team (including Lost Highway's Natasha Wagner) to combat a vampire queen (Arly Jover, who played a vamp in the original Blade, and she looks much better here), the film rolls briskly along with some over the top overacting, plenty of leaps in logic, and plot holes aplenty. It's a shame John Carpenter's name got attached to this drek of a horror film, those who enjoyed his Vampires should definitely avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tame Vampire Fare","review":"This is a sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires, a minor hit that saw director Carpenter return to form and break the cliches of vampire films. This is not bad and not good either, as they changed the whole film from its initial release. It did have a lot of nudity and gore and was kind of suspenseful, but this sequel just serves to put yet another American vampire film on the shelves. Check out the 1998 original Vampires by John Carpenter to get a good look at breaking the cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor John Carpenter","review":"Why in the world did Carpenter let himself get dragged down into this mess? Jon Bon Jovi assembling a vampire hunting team of a 16-year old Mexican kid, the brother from Family Matters, a sorta-vampire on a anti-vampire drug (even though being a vampire means being dead, which medicine can't help), and a priest whose acting was so wooden every time he lied his nose grew? It's just as bad as it sounds.A master vampire desires to exist in sunlight, and JBJ's crew must stop that from happening. To do so they must eradicate all vampires in sight, protect a black cross, and keep their head above a tidal wave of campiness. Most of the acting is so nonchalant I could swear one of the actors fell asleep while delivering a line. Some decent gore here and there, but action is horrible and acting is worse.Just because Bon Jovi made a song called \\"Shot Through the Heart\\" doesn't mean he should be \\"acting\\" in vampire movies. Avoid this like syphilis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires - Los Muertos","review":"Vampires-Los Muertos was quite an entertaining movie in my opinion. OK, so it wasnt on the same level as Vampires with James woods but Jon Bon Jovi did a good job playing the vampire slayer.

Now onto every reason not to...it doesn't follow hardly anything I've ever known about Vampires, it lacks action in a major way, it is slow moving...or maybe it just seems that way because you have to force yourself to stay awake through it. If you are a die hard Jon Bon Jovi fan, like myself, buy it, he looks great. If you want a good vampire more go get \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", \\"Queen of the Damned\\", or \\"Blade\\" and \\"Blade 2\\", those are vampire movies worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire: Los Muertos","review":"Good fun!

This movie didn't do either for me.

I will buy anything with vampires and thought it would be interesting to see Bon Jovi in a horror movie. I was wrong the two do not go together.

If you like anything Vampires with Bon Jovi thrown in, you might want to keep this for your amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"power suck","review":"i didn't even see this movie and I know it sucks. All that I had to see was Bon Jovi and I threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out.

I'm an English Lit. major and wanted to focus a bit on science and got myself this book. It's so wonderfully written! It explains very clearly and it has a CD-rom with excercises. Even if you're not taking an intro-biology course this book is useful and easy to use for self study. The book is devided into theme chapters and covers about everything you can think of in the natural world. It's no doubt a very good introduction to further study in biology.

It trys to cram way to much imformation into way too small a space, and the way it covers the topics is very hard to understand. It uses way to many words i don't understand and does not put them in the glossary. I have to use a dictionary to even understand the glossary. For example-\\"Mutation- A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA; the ultimate source of genetic diversity.\\"I get, \\"a change in...\\" and then it loses me. I do not just hate science, or reading. Our school has a different book for class work and i understand that book perfectly.

I would not recommend this book to people at my age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, thorough but dense book","review":"I used this for high school freshman introductory biology, and boy! The writing is dense and excessively formal, and some concepts weren't explained very well. It's a gorgeous book, though, with beautiful color photos and computer diagrams, and it's chock-full of bios and anecdotes. Buy it was a coffee-table book, not as a simple biology text for regular high school kids. (The test questions, which my teacher used from the cd test bank, were devastating. You wouldn't believe the nitpicky details they asked you)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for discussions","review":"I knew little about black cowboys and that's coming from a gal who lives in Texas and went to the rodeo as a child. The book is the first I've come across the history of black cowboys and since it's in fictional context, students might appreciate it more than reading about it in a reference book. The book teaches a few lessons regarding gender stereotypes and learning how to do something.I didn't find the book exciting. If I were in elementary school, I'd probably pass on reading the book. The nice thing about the book is its main characters are Black, and we need to see more diversity in children's fiction books. It's a good book for parent/child and classroom discussions because of the lessons it teaches. I debated whether to give it a 3 or a 4. It's more in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that teaches that you can do anything!","review":"This is a great book about an African-American boy named Justin. Over the course of a stay with his cowboy grandfather, he learns that there is no such thing as women's work, you can do anything once you learn how, and a cool history lesson about black cowboys. My 4th grade students loved it and we had a great debate over whether there is a such thing as women's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read along with your kids and talk, talk, talk","review":"My son read this book with his 4th grade class. I read it along and out loud with him because we are really working on reading comprehension.This is a terrific discussion-starter book for parents and children. Not only is there the sexism parts, but there is also the theme of Justin being never shown how to do things (or made fun of when he tries) to the extent that he just stopped trying.I was very surprised to see the \\"n-word\\" (it's on page 82 in mine) in a book geared toward such young children. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I would not have known about it if I had not been reading the book with my son. They did not discuss it in school or let the parents know which is a shame, as it led to a few great discussions in our home about racism and the power of words.Overall, a great book. It was nice to see some diversity in my son's required reading and to have a completely boy-centric book where the main character is not sickeningly perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's short.","review":"Justin is a whiny, lazy, sexist kid who is miraculously transformed by a trip to his grandpa's.

I've been reading graphic novels for 30 years and I received this book as a gift. I thought the concept was a great idea and I couldn't wait to open it up. I was incredibly disappointed. I kept reading, hoping the stories would produce some meat, anything at all! But it was second rate cop show bland. All they had to do was take one of the many great Batman stories and write about it from the police departments point of view. I can't imagine the people that wrote positive reviews actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotham City Gloom","review":"This book does not live up to the reviews others are giving it. Of course anything tied to Gotham City will feature Batman, but, in this case, only in cameo shots (perhaps the writers were too embarassed to feature him more). This is supposed to be a \\"behind the scenes\\" kind of effort wherein the \\"real\\" heroes of Gotham City are its dedicated police officers. I cannot honestly see any point in serving up these stories. They are really very poorly written for coming from Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka; actually pretty hackneyed which would give credence to one reviewer's saying it recalled the good old days - the language seems right out of an incredibly bad Mickey Spillane pulp novel. The whole Mr. Freeze arc starts off good, but fizzles out very badly. Maybe this was better at some point as the editing seems very choppy. The art was good, but the story should be the driving force and it lacks any real suspense or drama. Look elsewhere for better (way better) stories by these writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong with Gotham Central","review":"Gotham Central is a great series that is unfortunately under-read. This volume collects the first five issues for a very reasonable price -- and is a great way to get into this series. In fact the collected TPB is almost a better and easier read than the single issues. This is an intelligent book and appeals to a wider audience than just Batman fans. If you enjoy Law & Order or any crime drama, you will enjoy this book. Even if you haven't picked up a comic since you were a kid -- pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any season of Law & Order!!","review":"This is a series that should have never been cancelled. Its like a Law & Order episode taking place in the DC Universe's Gotham City. The book, while definitely focusing on two detectives, still has a great team aspect and Batman isn't needed in the book but when he shows up its great. Here we get two different storylines and both are fantastic. Greg Rucka has such an amazing feel for these characters. You can tell he loves this book and that's why I love it. The art by Michael Lark and Stefano Gaudiano is so perfectly suited for the events transpiring within its remarkable. Any other type of art style would be terrible here. Overall, this is a fantastic book and I wish it would have lasted forever. Great reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to snuff...","review":"As a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer I can't say I liked this book at all. Not because it was too basic or anything like that, but because the style of writing was extremely difficult to follow. Almost every page I read had major grammatical mistakes that made following what the author said to be very difficult. I get the impression that this book was rushed into print without proper proof-reading and without a knowledgeable person reviewing the contents to make sure a person unfamiliar with the subject could understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through.","review":"I'm not a newbie to Shakespeare or any similar writers. I'm not put off by the idioms or way of speaking in this movie. It was just utterly awful in every other way. Imagine Blade Runner meets Romeo and Juliet - that's what this movie made me think of. For the most part, save the lead role played by Eccleston and the actress who portrayed Castiza, the acting was atrocious. The direction was all over the place. I generally like bizarre movies, but this was too much - I don't like bizarre for the sake of bizarre. I found the meaning of the play was completely lost in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why must producers insult great literary works?","review":"The Revengers Tragedy is one of the worst modern adaptations I have ever seen in my entire life!

His mother (Jeri Arredondo) wants to shelter him and his Dad (Kevin Anderson) wants to treat him like a regular warrior. That includes learning to hunt deer.When Hunter accidentally shoots a doe instead of the manliness proving buck, he's earned the insulting name \\"Doe Boy\\".

In the rest of the Cynster series, Vane is portrayed as one of the most enigmatic of the cousins. In his own story, however, Vane falls into the mold of the regency period rake. There is not much development to his character outside of this formula.Patience is just as typical of a character. I was bored with her.Laurens is also in the habit of repeating herself over and over again. She will use 3 adjectives where one simple description will do. I don't understand what her purpose in this display of vocabulary is, but it has the result of cluttering up the page with meaningless text to the point where it is difficult to follow the storyline.Between the flat, formulaic characters and the excessive verbiage of the descriptions (particularly when dealing with the emotions of the characters), I was just annoyed by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rake's Vow","review":"Just when you thought Stephanie Laurens couldn't get any better, she writes another stunning novel.Following Devil's Bride as the second book in the Bar Cynster series by Laurens, this book manages to top the first.Vane Cynster makes a mad run for it after his cousin Devil's wedding, as he refuses to be caught in the parson's mousetrap as well, but leave it to a thunderstorm to force him to take cover at his godmother's house, and introduce him to Miss Patience Debington.When Patience gets trapped in the intrigue surrounding a petty thief at the house party she's attending, things begin to look up for her and her brother Gerrard when Vane shows up and puts his investigating skills to good use.Though Patience hates the idea of getting tied to an \\"elegant gentleman\\" for life, she finds herself falling in love with the handsome cynster.Laurens continues to amaze with her talent for writing.

This was my second book in the Cynster Series, and I really liked Devil's Bride much better. I don't know if I will continue with the Cynster Series (when and if I even finish this one). At least I can see from other reviews that I'm not the only one disappointed in this book. I'm going to force myself to read the rest of it, but I honestly can't see myself continuing with this series.The plot is thin at best, and taking far too long to get interesting.

The relationship between the hero and heroine were not well developed leaving me only understanding the lust between the two.The story moved so so slowly starting from the middle.

By the end if I had to watch Zenki break his bonds, get the axe and be powered up by his brother one more time I might puke. The character never seem to develope, they are the same emotionally by this saga as the first. I would have liked to seen Zenki grow up emotionally just a little bit and Chiaki too. Just when the plot looks like it might get iteresting the DVD is over, so unless there is a 4th saga that the end mid plot point and everything.

Schulze, Michael Shrieve (of Santana) and Wolfgang Tidpold (on cello) playing nearly 40 minutes of highly rhythmic, droning music. But unlike a lot of space music or prog rock of the time, there was almost no melody or chord changes or even consistent rhythm here. Just a lot of hypnotic, trance-like, sequencer like, machine like (though almost entirely hand played) music.Now, over 20 years later, it sounds as amazingly unique as it did back then. Unlike much other music by Schulze in this vein that didn't have the same energy, or his older efforts which sound much more dated, this album has a certain timeless quality to it.I can't guarantee that if you buy it you'll love it.

It's too lightweight and disorganized to be a reference manual and too cursory to be a learning guide.I am over 100 pages into this and I am not quite sure if I have learned anything useful.

Instead, it's SonyNashvilles attempt to get some of their soulless country music in the public eye. The songwriting is so bad that listening at times becomes it embarassingly painful. It seems like they showed the film to a 4th grade class and had them write what they thought about it. There are a few gems, but not enough to justify buying it. Hopefully the score makes up for it.

I bought this cd right after the movie, not thinking to scout out the cd when I purchased it. I had assumed that this cd would feature the score and IT DIDN'T!

Buyer beware, though, this cd only has one song from the movie. If you want my honest assessment, buy the REAL movie score, not this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd reflects true emotions of soldiers and families affected by war","review":"Coming from a family member of one of the soldiers that served and died under Gen Moore's command in the Ia Drang Valley, I must say that this cd fully captures the wide range of emotion that everyone involved has felt along the way.

Your music brought me to tears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read the title!","review":"First of all I'd like to say to anyone whining about the fact that a lot of the music on the soundtrack is not in the movie: READ THE TITLE! I believe the title is something along the lines of Music From and INSPIRED BY the movie We Were Soldiers. On that note, the music is a fitting patriotic tribute to the themes of the movie. While I don't love every song on the soundtrack, that may be because not all the songs cater to my personal musical tastes. However, I would like to say that \\"The Beautiful\\" by Five For Fighting is a TRULY beautiful song."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were Soldiers (Music From and Inspired By)","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD, as there were only 2/3 songs from the soundtrack.

The songs were written specifically for the movie. Standout tracks are Carolyn Dawn Johnson singing \\"Some Mother's Son\\"-she sings this with a great deal of emotion and the song paints a perfect portrait of what it is like to lose someone in a war. The incredible pairing of Johnny Cash and Dave Matthews in \\"For You\\" is also a standout track on this album. Most of the album is contemporary Christian artists (Steven Curtis Chapman)and country artists (Jamie O'neal, Tammy Cochran, Montgomery Gentry). Overall, a very enjoyable album to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sountrack, \\"We Were Soldiers\\"","review":"I wish I could provide a stellar review of this soundtrack; the problem is, it's not the soundtrack from the film \\"We Were Soldiers\\". The only similarity between this and the wonderful music selections and performances of the film are in two cuts: \\"Sgt. MacKenzie\\" (you know, the \\"lay me doon on the cold, cold groond\\" song); which is, admittedly, some great music by Joseph MacKenzie. And of course, the US Military Academy Glee Club and Metro Voices \\"Mansions of The Lord\\", so beautiful and fitting that it was chosen to be played at the late President Reagan's funeral. This cut alone was worth the purchase price of the CD. But I wish I'd parted with the $.99 to just download these cuts, and skipped the rest..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music on this CD wasn't in the movie","review":"this cd is a huge disapptionment. I remember watching the movie and being moved by the music. Half the songs on the CD aren't in the movie.

Don't waste your time with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book taught me a lot about blind children. The basic plot was interesting, but was not developed very much.

As early as the Council of Ancyra (314 A.D.) the Church spoke juridically against those \\"who.. commit [acts of] defilement with animals or males.\\" Certainly that the Church spoke in different terms, even in circumlocutions, to avoid describing acts so foul against Christian morality provides no \\"cover\\" for the sin.

While there are other books available, this is perhaps the best for someone new to method, as well as those who suffer from various ailments to which our esteemed medical establishment often turns a blind eye.

This was a modern recording, so why is it only in 224kbps 2.0 stereo? What about a PCM or Dolby Digital 5.1 mix? The 2.0 stereo sounded almost as if it was really 2.0 mono.\\"ten:thirty\\" was boring. A collection of home movies shot during recording with the band doing mostly nothing, edited with short commments by the band members.Also, couldn't they have included some music videos from \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" as bonus material.If \\"Jars Of Clay\\" is reading this review, they might want to consider hiring an experienced crew to film, edit, and mix the concert, and an experienced DVD author for better navigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good representaion of Kitaro's early works","review":"I always like Kitaro's earlier works the best, up to about the mid 80's or so. This is a nice, mellow,melodic, flowing album that was very much the style of Kitaro at the time. This is probably his third best studio album after Ki and Tunhaung. There are several versions of this album, but if you can find the original analog recording, you will be richly rewarded. The newest remixed/remastered version is a bit edgey and slightly bright, which does not help this otherwise relaxing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Kitaro never quite gets 'it'. The 'it' a Jarre, Vangelis, Schulze did get in those days. Oasis is a bit cheesy, a bit too commercial, too clinical, can't lay my finger on it, it seems to be missing a 'soul'. Maybe in the 70's this sounded great, but nowadays it just very very dated.Granted, a few nice songs such as 'Rising Sun' and 'Aqua' (for two songs it gets two stars), but mainly elevator music, best soon forgotten.Btw, the beginning of 'Rising Sun' and 'Floating' from the album Moondawn by Klaus Schulze are eerily similar. What's that about mr. Kitaro?Well, maybe Schulze got it from Kitaro. He produced the Japanese 'Far East Family Band', of which kitaro was a member, and Moondawn was inspired by the Far East Family Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have.","review":"This album is without a doubt a must- have in my opinion. The vocals are absolutely amazing mixed with brilliant lyrics.. You can't help but love The Blood Brothers. I recently saw them with Coheed and Cambria, Dredg,and MeWithoutYou. Besides Coheed , the got the best response from the crowd. They have pure raw energy as well as sound, which makes them the unique band they are. A big breath of fresh air,much appreciated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely phenomenal!!","review":"I can't begin to describe to you how phenomenal this CD is. I saw the Blood Brothers live a few months ago, and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to and I've been obsessed with them ever since. I picked up this CD a month ago and haven't been able to stop listening to it. It is a really smart album; these guys really know what they're doing. They have a sound that is all their own. I can honestly say I have never heard anything like this before. You can hear the energy that they possess when you listen to this CD. The lyrics are incredible and obscure and I love them because these songs are written like no other band I've heard. I love the entire album, but my favorite track is \\"Peacock Skeleton With Crooked Feathers\\". You won't understand until you listen to the Blood Brothers \\"Crimes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply speechless","review":"This album is simply devine. When i first heard it, i was skeptical because it wasn't the screams i had somewhat hopes for like \\"Burn Piano Island\\", but when i thought of it, \\"Piano Island\\" was nothing like \\"March On\\", which was different from \\"This Adultery\\"... so my thoughts changed. The beats may be different, but the lyrics are as imaginative and strange as ever. Which was half the reason i started listening to the Blood Brothers in the first place. Once i listened to songs such as \\"Trash Flavored Trash\\" and \\"My First Kiss\\", I was hooked.If you have ANY love for the Blood Brothers AT ALL, and you liked anything from \\"Gagged In A Casket\\" all the way up to \\"Six Nightmares At The Pinball Masquerade\\", i highly suggest buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sons of Volta","review":"BB are one of those try-too-hard-to-be-edgy indie bands who, deservedly so, got some attention with this release. It is almost a shame that they put so much stock into the attention-grabbing vocals, because it's obvious the band has more going for it then gimmicks. As it stands, they sound like the bastard offspring of Mindless Self Indulgence and Sleater-Kinney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a terribly commercialistic release lacking creativity and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the WORST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children. My advice: If you're getting into the Blood Brothers, buy their previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Napoleon Dynomite\\" of music","review":"This has got to be the worst CD I've ever heard in my entire life. I came on Amazon expecting to hear more of the same but instead I find a handful of people with obviously malfuctioning ears claiming that this is the \\"future of hardcore\\" and proclaiming \\"the singers voice is so high-pitched and annoying, I love it!\\". Obviously this is one of those \\"it's so bad, someone will have to like it just to be different\\" gimmicks, similar to Napoleon Dynomite. And just like Napoleon Dynomite, by the end you will wonder if you will ever get those precious moments of your life back again."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT followup to burn piano island burn","review":"Okay, so Crimes is a little bit more mellow, (i dont want to use that word, because it is NOT a mellow album), than Burn Piano Island Burn. but that's what makes it a great follow up album. it has a little bit of a different sound, as apposed to sounding the exact same, (as sparta did with porcelain :-\\\\). every song on the cd is amazing and very well put together. you won't need to use the skip button on your cd player at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy sums it up","review":"I've never made music while on an acid-trip but if I ever did this is what it would have to sound like- welcome to the world of the Blood Brothers. The music is really difficult to decipher as there are so many ideas thrown out there, both lyrically and musically. I can honestly say I've never heard anything like this before, incoherent bits of melody mashed with a singer that screams at off-the-wall decibels and another that I was horrified to find out was a man (his singing is insanely high-pitched). While the album may wear on you after a few listens, it is a welcome break from your standard pop formula. If you are new to them I would definitely pick up \\"Crimes\\" first, and if you enjoy it branch off to the other highly enjoyable \\"Young Machetes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm....... What happened?","review":"This cd has some stuff that I really like and some stuff that I really hate. I like how they experimented with new sounds and hip-hop beats. My favorite song is LIVE AT THE APOCALYPSE CABARET. Another good one is WOLF PARTY. Besides that the album pretty much sucks. Its really plain and simple. All the songs sound the same and the lyrics arent written as good as their previous albums. I would recommend MARCH ON THE ELECTRIC CHILDREN as their best album. Also BURN PIANO ISLAND, BURN. This one is just not as good. It does'nt even compare. If your a fan of previous Blood Brothers cd's, then dont be surprised if you hate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are the other reviews talking about??","review":"This cd is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.Are people just trying to be trendy or something by saying this is good? I'm tired of reading good reviews for BAD MUSIC. I get sucked into buying some really terrible music!This cd is nothing but some guy screaming in a high pitch, GRATING voice, over random drum beats and music, the ENTIRE time. Some of the music has potential to be good...if you can tune out this constant screaming.Screaming is good for EMPHASIS in a song... NOT good for the ENTIRE song... EVERY song. I can't believe it made it onto a label. I can't speak for their past works, but this one is TERRIBLE. I wish I could give it ZERO STARS but Amazon won't let me.*Do yourself a favor and get cd's from Modey Lemon, the Distillers & the YeahYeahYeahs instead.

I really wanted to love it, but couldn't. I am a Blood Brothers fan, hell... I live in Redmond where they are from. But this disc is not as good as the last one at all. Yes, I am glad that they are growing as musicians and trying new things, but this disc is not that great. It doesn't have the intensity and complexity of the last album, also Johnny's voice becomes a little to much to take on the record. His high pitched squeals sound much like Karen-O, and makes me want to turn of the disc. A few songs are good, And yes the Blood Brothers are great but I'm not going to give a disc a high rating unless it really deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, there's a trend here somewhere","review":"I really don't understand how the previous reviewers can refer to anyone that likes this album to be trendy or \\"scene\\". Seems the trendy thing to do is to dismiss a band when they start to experiment musically. To call them \\"sell-outs\\" and walk away to find the next underground phenomenon so you can say you heard of them first. Fortunately, some of us are more concerned about music itself, regardless of what genre, who writes it, or what they've done before. Alright, now that I got that out, this album is IMO the best Blood Brothers effort to date. Anyone interested in hearing something that breaks out of the norm should give this a spin. The person that commented on how this sounds like \\"Mars Volta with a case of Red Bull\\" was pretty dead-on. One of the best cds I've bought in awhile. Maybe now I can go see them live without all the little boys running around with cowlicks and girl pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than all!","review":"Just to advise you, if you LOVED Burn, Piano Island, Burn... with all of your heart and you want that same sound from this album you'll be dissapointed.

This particular volume isn't quite as good as the Oreilly intro Perl book(s) I taught myself from, but it's a good source for someone who already has some experience in scripting using Perl or PHP.

The organization is also pretty haphazard. Quite often concepts are introduced briefly and off-handedly, but then dropped as \\"not quite ready\\" to be discussed, with no further reference given.Most of the examples used to demonstrate basics are either trivial or very abstract.

Unfortunately this book has none of the helpful examples that the Perl books have and also dissappointing was the reluctance to write the code as you might using a text editor.

However, when you want to write something slightly different to what is covered in this book, you suddenly realise how incomplete this book is.Eg, it covers the hasattr, getattr, setattr, and delattr built in functions, which is fine if you already know what attributes an object has, but in no way can I work out with this book how, or if it is even possible, to get a list of an object's existing attributes.It is incredibly frustrating trying to learn Python from this book.

I first saw this film when I was ten years old and it contained many elements of vintage 50's monster movies which kept me riveted to my seat as a youngster. I was also accustomed to American sci-fi movies featuring one creature whose appearance was slowly revealed to the auidience. This film was a nice change. It included a nice variety of mine monsters, just a touch of UFO thinking, and ultimately Rodan and neat flying monster effects for the times. Personally, for an early Japanese film I enjoyed this particular movie even more than Godzilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kaiju","review":"Now, This flm, Rodan was the first movie to consist of the famous Rodan monster. and was also the first Toho Kaiju (Giant Monster) film to feature Color Video.Rodan all begins when several miners are found dead, and then suddenly GIANT FREAKY monsters appear in the town, this all leads up to the hatching of Rodan, the giant prehistoric flying dinosaur, that is so big, when it flaps its wings it is propeled forward so fast it creates a sonic boom.The film itself features a lot of human dialog, and there are not many Monster VS Monster battles, but we do get to see some interesting destruction scenes.Without spoling anyone I would say that the ending was sort of cheap.Overall would I sugguest Rodan to people? Yes, but not as much casual fans as fans deeper into the Giant Monster stuff. But if you like classics, and think you would like like a Giant Prehistoric bird flying around killing planes and sonic booming cities, then you probably will like this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sora no daikaij Radon","review":"I originally saw this movie at an all night Japanese monster movie feast at a local drive-in. Ecology at it's finest. Rodan has a pterodactyl feel. You can not worm your way out of this one. I do not like to compare this to movies like \\"Mothra\\" (1962), however the formula is similar. However there has always been a fond place in my heart for this movie. It is strange that it is one of the last to be put on the market.The color is spectacular. And the appearance of the big bugs in the beginning set the action for the surprise that is to come later.Unlike the USA \`bug\\" movies, you can feel sorry for the creature. Since Tokyo is already destroyed, how about making it a game preserve?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining movie, bad DVD","review":"Rodan remains one of the most entertaining of all Japanese monster movies, with nice color photography and more consistent special effects than the original Godzilla. This DVD, though, is a disappointment. The print that was used is by no means the cleanest you'll ever find--lots of scratches and dirt on the image--and there really aren't any extras. No effort appears to have been made to find better source material, and that makes for a less-than-stellar DVD experience. They could have done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent presentation of a minor classic","review":"It's not Godzilla, but it's not bad, either. The DVD features a decent transfer and good sound. It's a minor classic, if your taste runs towards giant monster movies, and my taste sure does. I'm delighted to have a \\"real\\" copy of another one of my favorite old giant monster movies after putting up with a crappy VHS copy for years. Entertainment like this brings me real joy and having a clean copy is a delight.You've gotta love the ending of the movie and the hero's voice over asking himself if he could ever die as well as the monsters die in the movie -- SUCH a Japanese sentiment, I just love Japanese movies, the hack translations offered such tantalizing clues into the culture of Japan. Fascinating stuff on several levels at once. Nothing like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic Pterodactyls","review":"Toho, the force behind the Godzilla movies, created another monster mainstay with this one. This time, a small mining community is visited by giant worm bugs. First they cause disappearances in the mine but eventually move out to the surface. But they are the tip of the iceberg for the mine has connected to an ancient cavern containing a gigantic egg.Once the egg hatches, Rodan is born. It eats the bug worms and flies around. For the most part it is an indifferent creature no doing any purposeful harm but its wake causes severe damage. Then there are two of them and the government decides that the creatures must be stopped as their simple existence can cause countless damage.The final moments of this film are sad and tragic. Rodan and spouse are not rampaging monsters, just misplaced. One does not feel any victory at their defeat, only sadness. This was a wonderful film from Toho that took the giant monster (kaiju) film in a new direction. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Creature Feature","review":"I aways loved rodan. I liked Godzilla the original, but this movie has better effects, such as the scenes when the guys are going after Rodan in the jets. It does not look like minatures. The Rubber suit in this movie, looks pretty good and does not look fake. This was the first japanese monster movie in color. It was also one of the monster movies of all time to be in full color. The effects surpass Godzilla in a way. The film had a better story than Godzilla. I also reccomend Godzilla to be bought. Get this film the last time i tried to get it, it was last year, it was out of print and now it is back on DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glossy, but some interesting details","review":"Unlike the recent book by Tina Sinatra (which I give five-stars) this book softsells any of FAS's well known liabilities.

My one complaint is that Nancy Sinatra's other book \\"Frank Sinatra, American Legend\\" seems to be indistiguishable from this one, and indeed contains 80% of the same material yet was not published as a revision. This, earlier version is better in my mind because of her notes about each of his movies and albums at the end of the book. That material is missing in the American Legend version.

The series of stories as told by the disenfranchised narrator is filled with keen observations and poignant vigneetes, together forming a good carricature of the suburban lifestyle during these safe, post Cold War years where spirituality dwindles. I found the apocalyptic seres of vignette the most effective, as well as the relationship to the sister.

A brilliant novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Coupland at his best","review":"As a Coupland Frequent Flyer, I almost lost perspective while I was reading this book. I had enjoyed (does anyone remember what it is like?) \\"Generation X\\", \\"Shampoo Planet\\" and \\"Microserfs\\" so much, that I bought \\"Life After God\\" without much thought. In the end, I was standing in a crossroad: Should my zest for Coupland's style rule over the randomness I had found in most of the stories (in typical brain-heart conflict)? Or should I accept that this was for Coupland what \\"Almost Blue\\" was for Elvis Costello? Although I don't regret buying and reading this one, I still think it pales in comparison even to cronicles like the ones he usually does for Wallpaper Magazine, so my advice is this: Buy and read this book only if you have done so with ano-ther from the ones I mention above. If you like them, welcome aboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is Enough","review":"There were some slightly profound, thought provoking passages in this book. Being in my late 20's, naturally I could relate. But after a while, I began to wonder why it was the Mr. Coupland felt that we needed to be included in ALL of his deepest thoughts and lonely banter. I too would love for the world to read MY existential life thoughts, family secrets, and childhood memories, but does anyone really care? After awhile, I just didn't care anymore. It would have helped if this \\"stories\\" were collected in a more organized semblance, it seemed a bit sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Coupland","review":"Life after God is a collection of short stories told in the famliar Coupland manner. As I've felt with his previous work, his work is more about expressing the feelings of the collective unconscious of his generation than actually telling a story, at least as he sees it. That's why he is probably better suited to short fiction than novels. Not for everyone, but that's Coupland for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"good prose no plot","review":"Life After God is well written, there is no argument there (despite a few consistency errors). The problem is this nice read goes nowhere, it just delivers lots of little stories with nothing to tie them together into a cohesive whole. Coupland is good with his prose and is very easy to read, but I want more than that. And really, a plot is not too much to ask for is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Staggeringly bad","review":"Apparently \\"God\\" was crucially involved in stuff like prose style, characterization, and plot development. Coupland -- owing to . . . lack of talent? unfamiliarity with the literary canon? -- runs afoul of that fallacy whereby the affectless stupor of the things one represents dictates an affectless, stupor-enducing manner of representation.

But I soon discovered that this \\"life\\" that is being discussed is precisely how the world exists.Coupland hasn't merely written blatent observations about spirituality, or even about morals or living, but about rather philosophical views of life.If one was to take the time to read and ponder the views of the author, he/she might be able to connect with that inner belief. What Coupland is trying to portray is not so much that there is a God, but that we need a God."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never want Coupland's books to end so it only gets a 9.","review":"A small book full of stories: some related, some not.

Grapevine's transfer to DVD was made from an extremely bad print of the film, with absolutely no attempt at restoration. Many of the title cards are so dark as to be unreadable; surely it would have been a simple matter to create new title cards for this release--unless the Grapevine people couldn't read them either. The contrast in one section of the film is so high that characters and objects are reduced to featureless blobs on the screen.I agree completely with the other reviewer's comments on the acting and the cinematic qualities of the 1922 film.

At first read, it is a riveting, albeit, troubling journey of a devoted mother and her out-of-control son. The book is unsettling in it's raw, unabashed exposure of the power of the dark tunnel through which many adolescents pass - both male and female. As a counselor who has worked with adolescents for many years, I know, first hand, that the author's experiences are much more prevalent than most parents, and society in general, would like to admit.The ultimate power of this book, written in a seductively honest, often poetic style, is the message of the true nature of healing.

(The Great War) It tells of courage, cowardice, patriotism, family ties, family integrity, family shame, insight to our families, God and death, A Mother's evaluation of God in the taking of her baby, innocence of the mentally retarded....A feeling like you are there. The background of a slaming screen door, the lady next door practicing for the next week church choir, the distant locomotive, the dog barking, the crowds celebrating the end of the war... the meaning of life and deathe in a small Texas town. The social structure of the family and the social structure of a family with a son that just isn't measuring up to expectations. A wonderful movie. And in my opinion, the best movie ever made. I felt as if I was there experienceing all of these things with the actors and actresses, who to me seemed like live participants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I got hooked when I saw this movie!

Then, the aliens rebuild him and see if this dinosaur called Titanosaurus can help Mechagodzilla kill Godzilla. Of course, Godzilla beats the heck out of them. It's actually kind of funny at parts. I think this is the most stupid Godzilla. He practically acts like a super hero at times!!! Titanosaurus is pretty cool. I know that they could've beat Godzilla if they tried. I mean, Godzilla was buried. Mechagodzilla didn't really do anything. He just stood there and watched Godzilla beating up Titanosaurus. I think that Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus should have been in Godzilla Final Wars. They deserved it. Well, atleast Titanosaurus deserves to be in it any way.

One major cut is the ending when Katsura gets shot, she is supposed to kill herself but then the movie just ends leaving you wondering what happened. I guess there was just too much suicide in this movie or something.

Naturally, only Godzilla can save the day. I loved these movies when I was a kid and I still want to love them now for their nostalgia value, but I just can't get past how clunky, repetitive, and, well...dull they are. Nevertheless, I give this film a couple stars because I can still get a thrill from the iconic image of Godzilla stomping through Tokyo, the classic score is great, and there are a few moments of goofy charm that deliver the experience I was hoping for./"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY! The UNCUT U.S. version is available!","review":"For those who are not aware, this film was originally released to U.S. theaters as \\"TERROR OF GODZILLA\\". This version of the film was heavily edited, removing bad language and any scenes of violence. This version of the film was so badly chopped-up that it is barely watchable. Later, UPA re-released the film to U.S. TV as \\"TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA\\". With the exception of a brief \\"nude\\" shot of the cyborg girl's artificial breasts, the film was uncut and included a brief \\"History of Godzilla\\" prologue before the opening credits. However, when the film was first released to VHS, it was the edited version that was used. Unfortunately, this version continued to be used on VHS, DVD, and TV, while the uncut U.S. version disappeared.

It addresses those of the Jewish faith. The book involves two main characters, Danny, a Hasid with an inherited position from his father as a rabbi, and Danny, a Jewish boy whose father is a Zionist.

It is a very deep and moving story about the friendship between two people from different backgrounds and the history they both share."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen","review":"The book started off great, you could tell the friendship between the two boys was full of hatred, but it ended up to be a great story of how a boy lives on his life with his father practically controlling his every move, but does it in silence. Great book, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Interesting, and Moving","review":"I read The Chosen for my literature class at school, and I enjoyed it very much! Chaim Potok did a wonderful job of portraying the life of two young Jewish-American boys. Based in Brooklyn in the 1940s, we first meet the narrator, the modern Orthodox Reuven Saunders, as a 15 year old. An incident occurs to where he becomes close to his Ultra-Orthodox (Hasidic) counterpart, Danny Saunders. One is a mathematician and the other aspires to become a psychologist. Both are brilliant scholars of the Torah and the Talmud. Although I had little knowledge of Jewish customs and cultures, after reading this book, I learned some aspects of Judaism I never knew before. Potok defined many Jewish and Yiddish terms that otherwise I would not have any clue understanding. He made this a novel which looks into the lives of two brilliant young men who struggles to preserve their friendship and their own beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and exceptional","review":"I am not Jewish nor was this book required reading. In fact, theboys in this book.... But I found this book deeply moving andsatifying. I am not going to change my Faith because I read it, andit seems to me that it is encouraging that belief is held as deeply asis illustrated by the characters in this very fine work. I am goingto read the sequel because I want to know what comes next in the livesof these intelligent, admirable characters. This is one of the bestbooks of fiction I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not keep me on the edge of my seat.","review":"The chosen was very boring and uneventful.

It took to long to get from conflict to climax, to much beating around the bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen","review":"I love history, culture, how cultures came to be, and how they interact. This book is full of that. The author has a very comfortable writing style and the book made me feel like I had visited these people in their homes.

That's why I went on to purchase several other books by Chaim Potok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring, and boring some more","review":"Although this book's story moves along well, it is pointless.

I should have picked a shorter book as to not waste my time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the chosen is phat $$$$$$$","review":"in my opinion, The Choosen is a good hook, but not nearly as good as some others that I have read! This novel taught me a lot about the Jewish religion in general, mostly because of Danny and Reuven's differences in opinion. It can drag at some points though! For instance, when Danny and Reuven are forbiden to see each other! And from the time when they begin colleage to the ending, there are some parts where little action takes place! That's why I gave it three stars!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i was very dissapointed with this book","review":"i was not only dissapointed about this book but bored with every moment of it.

I didn't like the book because it seemed a little unrealistic . I couldn't really relate to the book , because i'm not familiar with Jewish culture and I don't know any Jewish terms. I myself like action books and don't care for any boring Jewish books. there are facts that show that Hasidic people do not get along with other cultures they keep to themselves. So why would Danny try to be friendly with rueven. I don't think any parent would act like that to his child, and the child would be okay with it. I would of like the book if it was a little more exciting. I suggest this book to anybody Jewish or who is interested in Jewish culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"[in comic-book-store-guy-from-the-Simpsons tone]","review":"worst book EVER.The repetitive inanery of Potok's prose made me want to scoop my eyes out with a dull melon-baller.sample dialogue:Davey: What do you think?Reuven: They're a snooty bunch.D:What do you think about their playing?R: They're lousy.D: They're murderers.[later]D: Well?R: Well what?D: I told you they could hit.R: So you told me. So what?D: I wasn't bragging or anything. I just wanted to know what you thought.R; They can hit.D: They're murderers.and so on, for 50 pages.Unfortunately all the reviewers with insights into the shocking awfulness of this book seem to be 16 and illiterate, which destroys my credibility.

After that, nothing happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I found this book to be completely boring. Don't get me wrong-- it did have some good content, but it just wasn't exciting. I like to read a book where there are some suprises that keep me reading. This book had none, which may be the reason I had difficulty staying awake while reading. THe first chapter caught my attention, with the baseball game, but from then on I was bored. I do not recommend this book-- SO TAKE THAT DORIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chosen- BAD! BORING!","review":"This book was uninteresting. It was boring and uneventful. I felt it had a lot of unneccessary details that made the book even more unexciting and slow. The book had no meaning to me and I felt the ending was horrible. The author made led you believe that something would happen at the end because the rest of the book was not eventful. Instead, he just let everything go together! BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep.","review":"I had to read this book for an academic decathlon, and i thought it was very well written and complex. the characters are multi-layered and change throughout the book. at times, though, i got a little lost and confused, and had to read the same page several times. i dont know much about jewish culture or customs, or the controversy about a jewish state, but i still understood the book. i even learned a little. i would reccomend this book, but if you like shallow reading, dont read it. if you enjoy good literature, then by gosh, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"Although i read this book for a class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book hooks in the reader by opening out with a tension-filled baseball game. Needless to say, this book is a real page-turner. Furthermore, the book was a very enriching read. The often overlooked customs, history and varying religions of the Jewish religion is covered in a way that doens't put the reader to sleep. The tale itself is also very well-developed, as it shows the clashing between two Jewish realms.The only downfall of the book in my mind, were the unrealistic qualities of a few of the characters. It seemed as though they were too smart for being just teenagers at time, and many of their discussions seemed unrealistic.This however, didn't detract too much from the read, and I'd recommend this to any adult-level reader. Once again; it's a page turner (took me only about 3 days) and well worht the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I read this book for outside reading in my English 10H class, and i loved it. The prose was wonderful and i really appreciated the themes. The ending almost made me cry. It is true that there is not much action in the story, but that is because this book is about friendship and the relations between fathers and sons, not about runaway trains and hijacked nukes. If you want action, go buy the latest John Grisham or Stephen King. This is a really moving book for those who want reading material with more depth. It is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Chosen\\": A Friendship Story","review":"I read \\"The Chosen\\" as an assignment preceeding my becoming a Bat Mitzvah. The basic story was very easy to understand for a 12-year-old, and it described the evolving frienship of two once-enemies, now best buds. There are three books within the novel, and as the second book culminates and the third book starts, the text begins to get \\"heavy\\". The average reader easily becomes distracted with the in-depth writing about Hasidic Jews, the Talmud, and other subjects pertaining to the Jewish religion. Even I, a well-educated Jew for my age, was confused. In a nutshell, \\"The Chosen\\" deserves four stars for its vivid description and interesting plot; however, it was a incredibly intricate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulfillment and Disapointment","review":"After spending part of my summer vaction reading Chaim Potok's novel The Chosen, I felt that I learned more about the Jewish religion, but I was also a little disappointed. The Chosen is a novel of two Jewish boys growing up under different Jewish customs in the 1940's. Reuven Malter, the main character in the book is an Orthodox Jew, and Danny Saunders, the other boy is Hasidic. Since the two are different in religious ways, Danny being more serious about his beliefs, and Reuven being more relaxed, there is a lot of tension between the two at first, but they get around that and evolve to become best friends. I felt disappointed after reading this because I expected much more. It has wonderful reviews, so I expected non-stop excitement. At times the book was fun to read and interesting, but most of the time it was rather monotonous.I give this book two of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping","review":"I recently ordered this book for my daughter; it was on her summer reading list.

I was only allowed in the garage, and my best friend had to fight to allow that much access. I can't imagine what it was like for blacks...segregation sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a Different Light","review":"The book was very inspiring and motivational. It was very hard to read. It took a very long time to get into the book. I almost gave up reading it but I had to see why other reviews that I read spoke so highly of it. Once I finished the book I realize why. It was about true friendship and how it can last through anything. It was also about a young man and his thirst for knowledge, and the lengths he had to go to to reach his final happiness. It inspired to to follow my dreams, and decide my future for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok....i wouldnt read it on my own time thats for sure","review":"it was ok....if you dont have to read it for school then DONT READ itother than that it was ok :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CHOSEN - Good fun!","review":"The Chosen, by Chaim Potok, was a great book about two Jewish boys from different sects of Judaism. Reuven Malter , one of the main charchters from the book gets hit in the head with a baseball by Danny Saunders, one of the Hasidic boys during a baseball game. Throughout the book, Danny and Reuven become good friends. The two boys do alot of things together, such as study torah and Talmud. Not only is this book about the boys good friend ship, but also about the relationship of father and son. But because of the different beliefs of both their fathers, the boys are not allowed to see each other. This book, demonstrated friendship and helped educate people on the Jewish Religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad....","review":"This book is ok...it teaches important life lessons, but the whole book is a waste of time and too long to read.

I went over and gave him a big hug. After that we went for a long walk. We walked for about two hours. We walked at a medium pace. While we walked, we talked about the Torah. Danny does four blat of the Torah a day! Danny's so smart, I can only do two blat. After that we went to Danny's house and argued with his dad. We argued about the Torah. Then I went home and cried.Now imagine if this paragraph was two hundred pages long. That is pretty much all The Chosen is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable to read","review":"I read this book last year because my mom suggested to me. I started to read it at first and slighty after the baseball part I got bored. Then A few months later I picked up the book and read it again and found that it was very intresting. Being a reformed jew I found that I acutally did not realate much to the hasidic and othordox jews. I did however know the terms and I did not find it difficult to read. I do not understand how people could find this book boring and I think that if they would of given the book a chance they would of enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing and informational","review":"I had previously read this book and given away my only copy. It is one which deserves a permanent place on one's bookshelf. The story features a young Jewish scholarly boy growing up in Brooklyn during WWII and afterwards.

The characters are memorable and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fastpaced...","review":"The Chosen does an incredible job in explaining the ways of the Jewish people.As a Christian,I was able to have an insight in how the traditional Jews lived...

The book was able to explain history and lives of Jewish people through a very engaging way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship and Dissension : A story of two best friends","review":"\\"The chosen\\" is the probably best book I think I have ever read. If you want to be captivated by a world of two intellectuals, who's main goal is to remain the best of friends, through the thick and the thin, then I would strongly suggest reading this particular book.I have never read a book that I literally couldn't put down, but as I was reading \\"The Chosen\\" I stayed up all night because I just couldn't stop reading. The way Potok writes is so mesmorizing that the reader is drawn into a world of dissension and yet a world of true friendship. If you have'nt read this book already you are missing out on one of the best pieces of classical literature there is (in my opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen","review":"Experience with the service was very good. The quality of the product was in conformity of what was stated. I would rank it as very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful book that brings words and charactors to life","review":"Our 7th fomr English teacher gave us The Chosen for our chosen book to read for bursary.. Now I was not much of a reader, which is a bit unusal for NZDers. Once I picked up The Chosen I couldn't put it down. Danny and Reuven just seemed more than charactors held together by a bunch of words. They really came out to real life. I finished the book in 2 days and followed by reading the sequal, which I finished that week. I am so grateful for reading these books, as I have learn't a lot through the lives of these 2 people. I have also now recieved a passion for reading and learning more. Since moving to England I have now brought both The Chosen and the sequal, which I have read them many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"enter into the magical world of American Judaism ...","review":"To write a summary of this book would do it injustice. Moreover, giving away the plot takes away the fun. Potok has a gift for sketching out what the magical world of Judaism looks like. While I was reading the dialogues, I could almost hear the characters with accents (like Danny's father, Reuven's father, their Talmud teacher Reb, etc.). I do sympathize with those who do not know some of the Jewish terms (e.g. tzaddik, Torah, Mishnah, Talmud, etc.). It would have helped to have a glossary, but an attentive reader would be able to figure out from the context what the terms meant.The story is not merely about Judaism; it's about friendship and parenthood. What does it mean to have a \\"soul\\"? But none of these values or principles makes sense unless it is embedded in the narrative of two rather different Jewish boys growing up as best friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potok is Awesome!","review":"Potok is one of my favourite authors. I am not even Jewish, but I found this book in my mother's library. I read it in High School and was totally intrigued by Judaism and the Jewish culture. I learned about Jewish life, Hasidism, Hasidics' view of Conservative (or secular) Jews and vice-versa, father-son relationships, and following one's dreams which might go against a parent's expectation.I absolutely cherished this book (sadly it was already falling apart and I had to tape the cover page back on).For anyone who is interested to know more about the topics that I mentioned above, go ahead and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book about relationships and religion.","review":"The book begins with two boys divided by their religion. Throughout the book is a wonderful portrayal of how friendship can overcome boubdaries. The Jewish language causes a bit of a stunbling block. However,the reader can simply bypass that block by looking at the context describe in the surrounding sentences. This book is an eye opener about common Jewish people and how they handle different struggles. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in a heartwarming book that crosses all religious boundaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"This was not at all what I expected when I picked up this book. Reuvin and danny lead me into a world which I had never visited. It provided wonderful insight into the jewish culture, which I had previously been clueless about. A wonderful book for any season. Kept me hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring...","review":"I have heard for years how good this book is. It never looked particularly interesting to me personally, so I put it off and put it off. I finally got around to picking up a copy, and was pleasantly surprised for the first 75 pages or so. It did engage me. And then...what I expected: the author began to describe the tedious nuances of the slightly-different faiths in excruciating detail. I just didn't care. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs hoping to get back to the storyline. Eventually, I just threw in the towel. Judging from all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and from friends and coworkers, I trust that there is something worthwhile here. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. So, take the advice that makes sense for you. You know yourself better than most, right? I should have trusted my own instincts. But, sometimes we're wrong, right? Might be worth picking up at the library first. If you can make it to the end, more power to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but difficult book","review":"I think this book is a real good one. I've read it for a schools assignment and first I thought it was boring to do, but later when I was reading the book, I started to like it. It is a very interesting and high quality book, and even easy to understand for people who don't read English very well. I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerfully moving work","review":"I read Potok's Chosen in Summer 2003, following my graduation from high school.

I recommend it to all literate persons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found The Chosen to be a very confusing and difficult.","review":"The Chosen by Chaim Potok is about two boys, Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders, who meet at a baseball game, when Danny accidentally hits Reuven in the eye with a baseball, and Danny and Reuven become instant friends.While they are friendly, they have some problems. I thought that the book was a good portrayal of how good friends should always stick together, but I found that the author, Chaim Potok is confusing at times. He used Hasidic and Hebrew words that the reader if not Jewish might have difficultly understanding.The book was good for someone Jewish; otherwise, it was a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Ignor all of the other reviews cause this is the truth.

It really blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally BORING!!!!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for my Honors Social Sudies class but everyone hated the book with so much passion that the teacher said we didn't have to finish it. I, however, am one of those people who can't stand not finishing a book once it's started, so I strugled through the ending. This book is basically meaningless, confusing, and most of all BORING!!! All there is is all these Jewish tems I didn't get, and the book basically went no where fast and was pointless. I don't mean to disrespect any Jews out there, I just don't get the Jewish termenology. What is a Tora anyway??? Well that's basiclaly it except I think everyone but Jewish people should avoid this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW- This is a REALLY GREAT BOOK---LOL","review":"Oh- wow- a softball game. It is just amazing the way chaim potok can make something such as softball turn into death and gore.This is sooooooo exiting!!!Its almost as god as resident evil,only it is really boring and a waste of treesif i wanted to read about jews, i would read the bible, and if i wanted to read about softball i would read some biography...even that is more fun than this bookdo not waste money OR trees unless you must get this for school. it is BADby the way, im 14 not 12, i just didnt feel like getting an accounthave a nice day(unless you are willingly reading this in which case: may your bookshelf catch on fire)would anyone like to buy this from me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Potok!!!","review":"This book was class assigned, by my english teacher... and right away i thought, \\"Oh God, class books are soooooo boring!\\" But as soon as i finished the first page, i got really into it, and I ended up loving it. The friendship between Danny and Reuven is heart warming and inspiring. Their experiences can alter the way people view religion for years to come. Good Job Potok!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The touching story of two boys maturing in separate worlds","review":"This book is my second all-time favorite book! (George Orwell's 1984 is my favorite.) This should be read by anyone, especially people exposed to much diversity. Throughout the masterpiece, I would think in my mind what I thought would be the most effective cont nuation of the story from whereever I was, and I would say 99 times out of 100 (No exageration!) the book took the course that I thouught would be most effective. If you are looking for other books that empathize with the Jews, try EXODUS by Leon Uris. While EXODUS is not as good, it really gets you wrapped up in the story. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable book I've read to date","review":"Wow. I can see why this book was a finalist for Book of the Year. Mr. Potok brought me right into the soul of the characters in this book, and even though I know very little about Hasidic culture, I was certainly not at a loss to the plot. This is great writing, and a great story. I have read hundreds of great books in my lifetime (including classics), and I enjoyed this one more than any so far. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a subtle story, written simply","review":"This highly lauded book is a tale of fathers, sons, differing traditions, changing times, and ageless truths. Written in deceptively simple style and from the point of view of Rueven, a teen-aged Jewish boy in WWII era New York City, \\"The Chosen\\" is the story of his unlikely friendship with Danny, the son of a leader of Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg.Inextricably woven through the narrative is the study of the Talmud, which in terms of time and attention, is the center of both boys' lives.The two boys must work out their relationships among themselves and their fathers, and must find a way to pursue theircallings. Ironically, Danny's vocation is to become a \\"secular\\" psychologist rather than, as tradition dictates, a rabbi in thefootsteps of his father. Rueven is the one who senses a call to the rabbinate.Potok writes cleanly, never letting his style get in the way of the story. At its close you will know the hearts of its four major characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Chaim Potok novel","review":"I found the cover intriguing on my way through the bookstore, and picked this one up. Being raised Catholic, I wasn't sure that I would relate, but the premise seemed interesting, so I bought it. This novel really turned me on to Potok's work, and I've since purchased all of his other books. I find this work the easiest to read by far, as those who are not familiar with the Jewish faith will still be able to follow it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written, moving story","review":"The Chosen is very well-written and contains a very moving story. I have always been interested in history; religion, wars, whatever. It facinates me. This book offers a wonderful view of two boys with exceptional differences that create a great friendship. Even though this book does not offer a lot of action, it is so well written that it just captivates you into the story. Kudos to Potok."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book to be very inspirational.","review":"Chaim Potok wrote one of the most memorable books I have ever read. \\"The Chosen\\" clearly displays the effect of religion on teenagers. The two main characters, Danny Saunders and Reuven Malter, meet during the most unusual of circumstances. Danny actually injured Reuven while playing in a baseball game. Throughout the years, they developed a long-lasting friendship. The respect and devotion they show towards one another display the coming of age of two young men. This novel is perfect for anyone who enjoys reading about the importance of maturing over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was enjoyable and an eye opening experience.","review":"\\"The Chosen\\" is a book that I typically would not read. It has subtle ways of making you think about what happens in a religion that can also be split. I enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters, I felt they grew through time. They both gave eachother what the other needed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This was the first book by Chaim Potok that I have read. Since then I have been working my way through his other novels. I find them all excellent, and once you finish \\"The Chosen\\", I would recommend the sequel \\"The Promise.\\" The Asher Lev series is also outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen is worth a little work to understand","review":"It is a shame that some teachers assign this book without preparing their classes with a basic understanding of Judaism. However, because one does not understand a book at first try does not mean the book has no meaning. Reading The Chosen is an opportunity to gain some insight into another culture, as well as another time and place. The characterizations are very rich and the themes are universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"i also had to read this book for school, and i think its superbly written and a very emotional and touching story. I'm sorry that the other students still can't understand what good literature is when they see it. this is a very strong book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mature Or Searching Audiences Only","review":"I picked up the Chosen because it was assigned to my son for his summer reading program, for fifteen-year-olds. The first chapter describing a heated baseball game had potential for capturing a young readers attention. However, the terminology, the in-depth history, the passive conflict, and the lack of action soon gave way to tedium. Yes, it contrasts Jewish sects and compares relationships with fathers, but to get to that point is almost as mind numbing as a marathon Talmud lesson! Lets challenge and inspire, not overwhelm and bore our students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Bicycle!!","review":"I bought this bike for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and she just loves it!! It was made perfectly with the pinks, purples, flashy decor and Big bright white wall tires!! Truly Charming!! Excellent price too!! Thanks Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New York Rocker Not So Rockin'","review":"Actually I'd probably give it 2 and a half stars. I did finish it. But inbetween I read a true crime murder story. I found the style of writing a bit elementary and hard follow. Especially the first 2 years with Blondie. Lots of blank spaces in this book, so maybe it really does live up to the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"What ever happened to Gary Valentine?","review":"If you are one of the millions of Blondie fans who ever wondered what happened to Gary Valentine (the composer of Blondie classics \\"Sex Offender\\" and \\"I'm Always Touched By Your Presence Dear\\") after mysteriously disappearing from the lineup in between the eponymous debut LP and Plastic Letters--and if you wondered why Valentine looked so uncomfortable being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next to Debbie Harry and Chris Stein -- then this is the book for you. Valentine spent ensuing years as a writer and it shows in this gripping, insightful and informative book. Though there are some awkward misspellings--like Ric Ocasek of the Cars' name-- this is an absorbing, entertaining and anecdotal account of the birth of punk, the malaise of latter-day new wave, and the rivalry within a classic band--by someone who lived it every step of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sympathy for the devil","review":"It would be almost impossible to have lived through the time period and cultural place that Valentine did and not have a few interesting stories to tell. Unfortunately he reveals himself as a not very likable character. He credits himself with Blondie's success - although he only played on their first album. Nasty jabs at the other members of Blondie, as well as complete disregard for a former girlfriend and sick child, make for very unpleasant reading at times - vitriol and envy seem to be the driving force behind his writing. Still, it's a least a better book thanTurn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius, which is a completly embarassing, amateur mess. Not sure how it's possible to make such fascinating subjects boring and repetitive, but Valentine manages to do it. 'New York Rocker' is certainly interesting, but it leaves a bitter taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly a great read if you're interested in punk","review":"Extremely readable memoir of Mr Valentine when he arrives to NYC as a young teenager. What's makes the book a worthy read is that he has a knack for offering interesting details about what it was like being part of the music scene in NYC in the late 70's. Even when he wasnt in a band he was a active \\"fan\\" and part of the scene. The book is well-edited and it moves along at a nice pace. As some of the other reviewers point out, the writer isnt particularly nasty in his opinions but he also doest shrink from saying what he feels about other folks he knew at that time. There was prodigious drug use going on around him and it was eye-opening for me that so many rockers where sticking needles in their arms in those days. If you like NYC Punk, this is quite an intersting and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as described","review":"The Instahanger was easy to install and is very compact when closed. It has a very low profile and the unobtrusive design makes it useful anywhere. I mounted it inside a closet door to give extra hanging space for coats and laundry. I will be sending two as gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All that we needed","review":"We moved into a new house and had no place, in the utility room, to hang clothes as they come out of the dryer. We saw this collapsible hanger made of plastic and another one made of wood. It was a tough decision because the wooden hanger appears to be more sturdy, looks nicer but is much more expensive. Since all the trim in our utility room is white, we finally decided to go with the more reasonably priced white plastic hanger. We couldn't be more delighted. It does everything we need it to do and doesn't look bad. We have hung the weight of two dryer loads of clothes on it without a problem. Those loads included three pairs of jeans. Manufacturer claims it holds 50 lbs and I do not doubt it. When not in use, it collapses neatly against the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well!","review":"This is a very well built item that was easy to install and holds a heavy load of hanging clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved my laundry room problem.","review":"I love this product!

It has totally solved the lack of hanging space in my laundry toom."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's So Simple and So Smart!","review":"It's just a white piece of plastic on the wall most of the time, but when you need it it becomes a little closet. There are many times you need to hang things temporarily -- when you're ironing, when clothes need to hang to dry, when company comes over and you don't have room for their coats -- many reasons. This is an inexpensive and easy way to have extra closet space whenever you need it.It comes with really good instructions and extras for hanging it in any situation, and installation was a snap.No more hanging clothes off of counters and door frames!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrow Hanger","review":"Works Great, Its not super strong but it works.Its a place to hang stuff right out the washer or dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"The picture/description shows it coming with a bracket to hang over the door, but it does not come with it!

I keep my extra clothes hangers on one and use the others for hanging clothers out of the washer that shouldn't go in the dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I love this clothes hanger. I just needed something small for a few items every week and this is perfect. It's out of the way and doesn't take up any floor space. When it's closed you don't even know it's there. Like always, I knew I could find what I was looking for at Amazon. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy item","review":"I like this. I used this in my soon to be born daughter's room where I needed to hang some of her clothing. I didn't want to buy a huge closet or clothing organizer because she's a baby and doesn't have too much stuff that needs to be hung up. THis was a perfect solution for us. Easy to install, holds clothes and when we don't need it, it folds neatly against the wall. My only complaint is that the material used to make this product seems a bit cheap. A sturdier plastic would have made me feel more comfortable. All in all, a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy item, everyone can use one of these.","review":"Built out of very thick and durable plastic, not cheap feeling at all. Very easy to install since you can drive the screws right through the existing holes, meaning you do not need to measure or cut a template. Goes up in a minute and folds out of the way. Wish I had these all over the place whenever I need to hang something up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you expect it to be","review":"I got two of these little things when I moved into a room with no stoarage or closet. They were easy to install and work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gadget","review":"This is just what I needed for my laundry room. I can hang shirts straight from the dryer so they don't wrinkle. Some don't even need to be ironed.

When using a drill or screw driver it was not easy to atttach the top part to the wall"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real convenience!","review":"A great convenience item! It arrives with three different methods for hanging: 1) available stud (nails are supplied) 2) no stud but dry wall (screw anchors supplied) 3) plaster (different set of anchors supplied). There is also a template that can be cut out so that the precise areas for the screws can be marked prior to hanging. You will require a drill and bit, of course. You can also order a metal attachment so that you can just hang the device over a door. The instructions are exacting and warns you to make room for other items in the room that might interfere with its function and they even provide the optimum length from the floor to hang the device. It works like a charm and holds plenty of weight. Great for when I bring home that large bundle of clothes from the valet or when I am packing for a trip or for my guests to hang their coats, etc. A great idea, well designed and solidly constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a laundry room hanger that doesn't get in the way (usually)","review":"Works very well as a hanger while emptying the dryer - just have to remember to close it up when I'm done because I've bumped my head on it several times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ed tool","review":"Good educational tool to reinforce concept of opposite the muppet at the end as the credits are rolling sings and my 18 month old laughs and giggles at him as he sings and demonstrates opposites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"My baby loves it.

After you have read The Goal and are use to its style of teaching manufacturing principles in the context of a novel, this book leaves you feeling really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy & Me - A look at lean tools in action","review":"Nice overview of a lean journey just kicking off. Lots of good example of lean methods, just not the same old kanban Mistake proofing, SMED materials. One lean method that really stood out was the example of Policy Deployment and how it was tied to daily management (A3 Sheets). I also like how it showed the leaders involvement from the standpoint of taking responsibility for providing training and stability. Too bad it was a spin of the Goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I'm a big fan of books that can teach a lesson in a simple way. Totally suggest this book to anyone who's interested in taking on the Lean Journey. Good Luck to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book took about an hour and a half to read, and while quick, it wasn't worth the effort. The LEAN portion of the book was vague with little explanation, the characters were shallow and unrealistic, and the details in the book were pretty pointless for the most part. While it wasn't terribly written, it seemed very rushed and I gained little to nothing from having read it. A textbook would have been more informative, and a true novel would have been more interesting. Save your time and don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Golden Nugget","review":"I have read a few business improvement novels in the past few years, but this one blew me away. I picked it up and was halfway through the book before I was forced to put it down by some prior engagements. It had a wealth of information that someone eager to learn could consume and digest without trouble, as well as a story line that kept me interested and willing to keep flipping through pages. I highly recommend this literature to anyone interested in manufacturing, lean initiatives, or reading.I wouldn't recommend this book to Amazon, because rather than buying the next book I'm probably just going to re-read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an ignoramus for the foolish","review":"I never write book review but had to in this case.Why I Hate Israel: A Candid Account is the result of what happens when anyone can self-publish a book.Priya Gandhi-Ganesh is obviously a very angry person.

Why is it surprising that Jews who killed Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, will destroy global peace by oppression and suppression of poor people.

It's in their religion as Book of Acts clearly accuse Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I hate Priya Gandhi-Ganesh","review":"Garbage, pure and simple. The author didn't even try to research the subject.I wonder if there are other countries that can be mentioned in a context like this. Why I hate India? Why I hate Pakistan? Why I hate Iran?

Claiming that \\"Gandhi-Ganesh argues from Hinduism, Christianity, International Human Rights, and ethics why her hatred is justified and even encouraged,\\" is despicable. Decent Hindus, Christians and those involved in human rights know that none of these beliefs can ever legitimately be used to justify or encourage hatred.This does NOTHING to advance the cause of peace--on the contrary, it can only serve to inflame prejudice.Amazon should be ashamed of selling and promoting such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for young kids, others skip it!","review":"Out of all the books in this not very good series, this was probably one of the worst. Right behind Zorba the Hutt's Revenge and Queen of the Empire of course. As much as I enjoy it when the characters wander around jungle planets,(my favorite) this book had an unbelievable plot, weak diologue, and an extremely childish writing style. And that Ken is a nice boy and all, but a complete geek. An attempt to relate to the \\"normal kid\\" who would be reading this book. Also the characters from the movies are either grossly exagerated, or practicly nonexistant. All of them are warped and and barely recognizabal as Star Wars characters, most of all Luke. Kids twelve and under, for whom this book is intended for, probably won't mind any of that, though, adult and teenage Star Wars fans, such as myself will probably find them boring and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is one of the worst Star Wars books I have ever read!!!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the spliced-in Raymond Burr scenes to \\"Americanize\\" the story. I have a VHS copy of the original JAPANESE ONLY release, not shown in the U.S. That versin is longer, the scenes are in different order and the story takes on a whole new look, focusing more on the characters. Oh for a DVD of that version!That aside, this is the film by which I judge all 'creature features'. You forget the monster is a man in a rubber suit, stomping around a miniature set. The black & white photography, the attention to lighting details make this a winner all around.I feel guilty for being sad at the end as Godzilla dies, but that's just how the story pulls you in. The 1995 movie of the same name was an insult to this near-masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Classics","review":"A true classic monster movie...done just how it should be done, with shaky scientific explanations, atomic age wariness, and a look into the human side of monster-made disasters. Those who grew up with the 70's-era movies with it's cheesiness need to see the original, with Godzilla very much the bad guy. The Americanized segments with Raymond Burr are actually not that bad, giving the film a more documentary-like feel, and emphasizing the helplessness of the many victims, though it trips the continuity somewhat.The most commendable aspect of this feature is its focus on the victims with haunting images of the injured and dying, and unforgettable location shots of Tokyo in flames. There is no monster vs. monster battle, just simply humans vs. monster, and the results are powerful and stick with you. It's back to the basics with this one folks, and you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick....","review":"I rented this movie, and the quality was horrible. I have the Simitar release, and that was way better. Now I have the R2 uncut Japanese version of this movie, and that is far superior than any release here of this version. It was remastered, so there are hardly any scratch marks on the print, which is what it should be when released for dvd. It was worth the price I paid. While the original version wasn't made with a widescreen format, the US release was, and only the Simitar release is widescreen, this isn't. Classic Media should be punished by all us Godzilla fans for this blasphemy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"No matter how much you may want to see this film, DON'T BUY IT. This transfer was made from a beat up, soft, poor-contrast 16mm print, and to release it on Blu-ray was nothing short of thievery on the part of Toho or whoever was responsible. The film is worthwhile, but unless they issue a new Blu-ray transfer from good 35mm source material save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disapointing","review":"One expects a higher priced Blu-ray Edition to be an improvement over the DVD Release.

Going by the title, this may be the original Japanese version without Burr.Quote from Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide: \\"Originally released in Japan in 1954 as GOJIRA (a far superior film), at 98m; over 20m. were eliminated and inserts with Burr were added.\\"Going by the title on the cover and the 98mins in the discription, this is more than likely the first release without Burr, that I have never seen. I hope this is the original Japanese version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible picture quality","review":"Yes the movie is a classic, but there is no restoration, so the picture quality is appalling.

The Americanized version destroys the sublety of the film and reduces it to a giant guy in a rubber suit crush-crumble-chomp fest.Everyone has seen this version of the movie dozens of times on late night TV. Avoid this purchase and you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Is Still A Classic","review":"When I was my nephews age I enjoyed Godzilla very much. Now that I am much older and this movie is much older too (at least 30 years ago) I was very very surprised that my nephew gave this movie 4 STARS when I asked him how many he would give it. When a movie like Godzilla can still touch my nephew soul just as the way it touched my soul as well as my brothers soul when we were his age this is truly how to define a movie a CLASSIC :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla - King of the Monsters","review":"Allthough the American version of \\"Gojira\\" is not quite as good as the original Japanese version, give Raymond Burr credit for doing a pretty job of not only his narration during the course of the film, but for his portrayal of United World News reporter Steve Martin as well. Sure, people may think that the American version of this film is not quite as good, but I think the American version does alright.Nonetheless, the special effects for this film are very good and after seeing this film for the first time, it scared me out of my socks. I also became a huge Godzilla fan because of this movie. \\"Godzilla, King of the Monsters,\\" as it is known in the USA, or \\"Gojira,\\" as Japanese fans know this movie, are both good. Purchase the Japanese and American versions of this cult classic and judge them for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramond Burr is a Party Pooper for Godzilla","review":"This American version of Gojira stinks. The quality is horrible, the audio is horrible and the only special feature is a corney and home-made trailer for the now out-of-date Godzilla: Destroy all Monsters. Ramond Burr ruins the whole movie and who the heck would go on a trip to Egypt from The East coast and stop in Tokyo? You go ove rthe Atlantic Ocean duh! Unfortunetly, as for the time being this is the only DVD of the black and white classic you can get. Simitar had the rights to it but Simitar's now out of business and the DVD costs a heck of a lot more because of supply and demand. I'd wait for the Ratio Pictures DVD release of the original Gojira if they ever do release it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but..........","review":"If you pick this up expecting blu-ray quality like I did, save your money. Whoever transfered this to blu-ray did so without \\"cleaning up\\" the film's imperfections first. It's full of scratches. I had the standard DVD release of this and was disappointed when i put on the blu-ray version and saw all the flaws still in it. They didn't even have the courtesy of English-dubbing it. If you don't understand Japanese, sitting through 2 hours hearing all the screaming in a language unknown, it grates on your last nerve. Why couldn't they English-dub it like Criterion did to Salo? In a nutshell, I think the manufacturers of this blu-ray release are in it purely for the money. The bonus features are pretty decent, including the making of the Godzilla suit, which was interesting but other than that, I'd say don't waste your money. You can get the standard dvd of this at a fraction of the cost with the same quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally released after 14 years","review":"Criterion first announced Godzilla on Laserdisc back around 1998. That release never happened and took on somewhat legendary status. But now around 14 years later we finally have Godzilla done to the standards of Criterion. The picture is fine but not perfect. Its difficult to know the reasons for that given we dont know what the state of the materials were that they started with. But its still hands down better than any other previous release.The extras are up to the usual standard as well. The paper booklet was very terse and not all that great. But there was some useful details about certain films contemporary to Godzilla dealing with nuclear weapons in Japan. I liked the design of the packaging and the use of color.This is hardly a great work of art as a film. But its historically interesting in many respects.I just hope we don't have to wait another 14 years for the other five Godzilla films Criterion promised in 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray version is missing Raymond Burr","review":"Blu-ray version is missing Raymond Burr!!I have seen both the American and Japanese versions of Godzilla.

However vlc told me that the program does not have an appropriate codec for a s24l (monaural PCM). The product does not have any responsibility for this, but there might be a problem when you attempt to play the movie with vlc. So, I use \\"mplayer osx extended\\" to play the movie, while mplayer has less control than vlc.QualityThe monaural sound is the best, much clearer than the other sources. Focus and contrast are better than the definitive blu-ray edition from Toho (even though Criterion's source was suspected one-generation lower). \\"Silky rain\\" scratches remain \\"much\\" more than the Toho edition but do not hinder enjoying the movie.

The Blu-Ray version does NOT include the Americanized cut. Amazon appears to have lifted this wording from the 2-disc standard DVD set, \\"Gojira / Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition.\\" And considering this Blu-ray's poor image quality (described in other reviews), that standard DVD set is clearly a better choice at half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WRONG Godzilla","review":"I recently saw the ORIGINAL Godzilla released in 1954, which was directed by I. Honda. The AMERICAN version has\\"cut out\\" critical footage to make the film \\"lacking in writing and direction\\" by Terry Morse. This version is a rock solid lack of truth, because of the failure of Hollywood to \\"leave it alone\\".All reading this review should see the original and not purchase the 1956 version which has been \\"cut to ribbons\\"The film because of Hollywood is a disaster, and should be avoided at all costs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criterion is best, but...","review":"...this rating is for the Classic Media release. If you're a minutia grognard, like me, this is worth picking up for the commentaries.

I am getting two copies this time - one for me to keep and one to share with my nephew who is 15. This is a fabulous book for both adults and children. It is a story about a horse who was pretty homely looking, with none of the pedigree looks that breeders say make a great horse. He wasn't even given the benefit of great training. But he had such a great heart that he became a phenomenal race horse when he was well past the age that he should have even been able to race, even after he had been put to heavy work as a utility animal.

I purchased it because I am in the middle of a project that requires the use of CORBA. I am now purchasing another book, since this one did not cover the topic in enough depth to make me comfortable with the technology.I would consider the book an overview of framework development. It attempts to cover enough material to allow C programmers to transition to C++ OOP. It wastes a lot of time rehashing the same points repeatedly, which gets real tiring after the 10th time you've read the same point. Since it tries to cover so much material, it fails to obtain the necessary depth in any of them. It teaches just enough to whet your appetite for a better book.Finally, the title is misleading. It is not an advanced book, since it only covers the basics of C++, OOP, UML and CORBA."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for a computer science major - not a cook book.","review":"Deals with concepts of OOP and introduces the OO framework and then object model for CORBA. It is deals more with the concepts behind the code rather than give you code samples to cut and paste.

His morning goes from bad to worse as he wakes up in a bad mood, misplaces his hat, misses breakfast, and struggles with the eternal question, \\"Why do I always have to go to work?\\". His day is \\"saved\\", however, when he crashes to the ground into the world of a little girl who thinks of him as very improtant. She even defends him from her teasing playmates and makes Winter feel special again. With friends like this one, one can hardly stay grumpy for long- not even Winter! The pictures are absolutely hilarious. From the cowboy-like Winter, sporting a handlebar mustache and a ten-gallon hat, to his snow-creating dump truck, one cannto help but smile. The splashes of color and white, done in pastels, pencils, and watercolors, make the reader feel like he or she has run right into Old Man Winter- Brrrr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Man Winter wants to know who he makes the snow for...","review":"Up here in Northern Minnesota we always knew Old Man Winter had it out for us big time, but we never really knew why. Stephen Gammell provides an interesting explanation in his book \\"Is That You, Winter?\\" We discover that Old Man Winter is an ornery old cuss, who releases his icy blasts from the back of his truck. But Old Man Winter has a question: \\"Who do I make it snow for?\\" The answer is to be found in this book and you will not be surprised to learn it is an answer that makes even Old Man Winter happy.How much you like this illustrated children's book is probably going to depend on how much you like Gammell's artwork, which strikes me and my limited knowledge of art as something of an impressionistic cartoon. Certainly the work is stylized and I would be willing to bet that children are going to find it more acceptable that some adults. I sort of like the way he depicts the snowstorm and you have to admit it is pretty distinctive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stankowicz on piano","review":"This moody and slow cd of the trumpetplayer Tomasz Stanko is pretty good. Just not good enough for 5 stars, but that doesn't mean you should leave it be.The album has the same atmosphere as (other) ECM piano-albums: melodic and free at the same time, with a lot of slow music on it. The music is subtle and very easy to listen to, but the occasional free-jazz elements restrain it from getting boring.The bass and drum are often used in a percussion-like way, and not in a rhythmic way, just like other ECM-material.Marcin Wasilewski pianoplaying is so present (and good) that I think it's almost more a piano-album than a trumpet-album. And that really is a compliment for Stanko, who leaves room enough for his band to play. Stanko's playing is moody and most of the time very accessible.There's just one thing. When you own more work of the ECM label you can get bored with the same approach over and over again. It that way this album has nothing new to offer, but it's still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Customer Who Thinks This Is The Best","review":"\\"The World is founded on a pillar, which is founded on the Deep\\".The Deep is my favourite book. Is has a strange, ethereal quality and a satisfying completeness that matches the encapsulation of the world described. I've read it at least 5 times, probably 10, limited only by having to leave a gap of a year or two between re-readings to forget the details. Fortunately I have a poor memory.Engine Summer is also excellent, though pipped by The Deep.Beasts I've read only once, many years ago, but remember it fondly.If you've been put off Crowley by the unfortunate Little, Big then please try this instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is in fact the best sci-fi novel ever!","review":"Engine Summer is beyond great:this book has it ALL, great writing, wonderful plot and absolutely poignant and mind blowing ideas. This is one that should never go out of print and should be required reading for as many people as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance from the Sahel","review":"This is simply a great album, picking up where Denke-Denke left off, adding the occasional godje (violin) and in places a slightly more bluesy feel. Yacouba Moumouni, and his musical arranger and guitarist Abdoulaye Alhassane have an incredible vision for their group. The music has both the river-in-the-desert feel of Malian blues (listen to the desert in the rasp of the flute and voice, and the river in the accompaying molo and komsa lutes) and the swing of Wassoulou singers like Oumou Sangare. It's Niger's greatest musical export, and it's irresistable."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this cd","review":"I ordered this cd with another one from the same artist.This one was used and the other one was supposed to be brand new but the cds were terrible,they appeared to be scratched and they keep skeeping when i try to play them.I wouldn't recommend them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Material","review":"This book is very unreliable and possibly offers some disastrous information for a first time Grey owner that does not know any better...the material is very outdated. With all the new information that is available today, this book suggest things that we know now to be harmful--such as clipping only one wing, keeping a bird out in winter, etc...in it's time (1979), this book might have been imformative, as not much was known about Greys then, but is no longer of any use. I was very disappointed. For a more up to date book, with excellent and up to date information, I suggest \\"Guide to a Well-Bahaved Parrot\\" by Mattie Sue Athan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"Pease do not buy this book!

Nice to see Rodan come out on DVD. Doesnt Sony have competent research people? This is the second box set with Terror of MechaGzilla and still no widescreen.

These versions are the reason giant monster movies get a bum rap. These are the same old tired versions that aired on tv. Anyone who has any of these movies on video, should just keep your videos and forget about it. All the companies out there who plan on making a fast buck with poor versions of movies, keep your crappy DVDs we don't want them. It is about time that we get some quality versions of the older monster movies. In Japan you can get every film uncut and in widscreen; why can't we be treated the same, isn't are money just as good. We are fans who love these films and want to enjoy the very best version that we can. In the future please think of the many fans out there. We will probably be the ones that buy 99% of the movies and we know when we get cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Godzilla!","review":"I've been waiting, waiting, and waiting some more of a Godzilla Boxed set to come out. Finally, it's here, and I must say that I am pretty derned happy with it. The Box is gorgious, the DVD pictures are gorgrous, and the movies are great. Despit Revenge of Godzilla, which is a pretty much 'crap' film the flicks are great. I love the original, and dig Terror of Mechagodzilla. I do have a few things I would've wished made it into the DVD set. I wanted widescreen, and I wanted better extras. Sure, the Destroy all Monsters Melee preview is good, but what about theatrical trailers? I would've been happy with just that. The animated menus are good, though look like Kung Pow's. Overall, this is a solid box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"These dvds are the classic movies when I was a little girl. I was so excited to see them. I hoping for more special features like extra footage or behind the scenes documentaries but otherwise the movies are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"I have to admit the King of the Monsters. The original black and white film was the most content full movie. The rest are geared towards children. I guess that's ok because most of us watch Godzilla to bring back the past. As so with other shows like Dracula, Frankenstein, Creature from the Black Lagoon, or even Johnny Quest. Anyway, these Godzilla films should be passed on. The favourite in my book is the Terror of Mecha Godzilla. I've seen the recent release of Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla and I don't like the name Kiryu or Mecha G as they call it. The original just has a better body suit Mecha Godzilla.The only thing about this box set is that it is in Pal format and I wish they had the wide screen. I guess we'll have to wait until Sony and Toho Ltd. re-release all 24 movies.By the way I can't wait til Godzilla Final Wars comes out here in the United States. The final Godzilla movie is worth taking your children to watch I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The music is fun and purely Mann, but the transfer to CD is obviously direct from a record on a turntable and with all the inherent noise.

You won't find this material in standard history books. My one regret is that the author, a secretary to Hitler, probably couldn't really reveal her feelings about her boss considering the outcome of that war. Hitler had four main secretaries - two of them declined to write or discuss Hitler out of admiration and respect after his death, and the fourth did write a book I haven't read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Very Interesting Book. While Hitler was a villain, history seems to avoid telling the \\"in-depth\\" story, preferring to cater to the general view of the masses. In this book, we see a more human side of Hitler as the \\"boss\\" of his secretarial staff. We see a young woman (Traudle Junge) who can only see Hitler as a caring, fatherly figure (during the war) as opposed to the deranged Dictator that we have come to know through written History. This book takes us into the day to day lives of Hitler's staff during the final days of the Reich. If you are a WWII History buff, this book is a must read. This book will certainly enhance your understanding of the complex character that we have come to know as \\"Der Fuhrer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Layout Pouch","review":"I use 4 or 5 different belts in the course of a job and this one hangs on 2 of them.

The DVD has a long documentary-interview between two crop circle experts and researchers, who appear to be friends and supporters of each other. They make a good team as they talk over various photos and films. Nothing fancy, but it felt like a great evening spent in the presence of interesting people, who know a lot about this fascinating topic. The photos and other data files are amazing, if you are interested in the phenomenon - they really make you stop and wonder why we don't hear more about this in the news. No Hollywood editing and razzmatazz, though - just a serious, well-presented film with a lot of research materials so you can make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A buddy film - a disappointing DVD.","review":"I was seeking an objective documentary about crop circles.

For example, the author spends some time in explaining HTML form submission, and CGI POST and GET methods. These are all very elementary and really only necessary for beginners who have not even written a single CGI program in perl or C. Fortunately, the author does not waste time on quickly introducing JDBC in one chapter, to the point where he actually shows us how to do database connection pooling. A few publicly available articles on servlets miss out this important issue for thread-safe processing of a servlet (where a single servlet can actually handle multiple services at the same time due to the multiple threading nature of servlets). However, one issue that the author does not spend enough time on is maintaining session information. This is very important for writing, for example, a shopping cart servlet for E-commerce."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to learn the ins and outs of servlets","review":"This book not only gives you a great introduction to programming servlets (including hosting and configuration, chaining, etc.) but also delves into related topics such as HTTP tunneling and using introspection to simplify servlet programming. I especially liked the amount of JDBC/RMI information included in the book since many servlets written will want to interface to other Java servers or databases. Having written an article on servlets for BYTE, I was pleased to find this much information packed in the book. My only disappointment is that the author didn't include more on managing state with servlets (e.g. through cookies) and about the future of servlets (covering developments such as Servlet Beans, and the impact, if any, of EJB on the servlet standard).

I will admit alot of the movie did seem left out and scenes did jump but being a lover of all the cast and the music I simply filled in the blanks. I think this is a perfect movie for young people to see. That way they will see faith,love, and devotion is not just for the older people but its in us all. This movie had me thinking of when I myself doubt faith sometimes and ask myself is it all for nothing. Its not a blockbuster its a simple beautiful film. If you have a teenager and your finding a hard way to get them to understand why its important to do right, from the premarital sex to the hanging out all night, this is a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"This movie is poorly written, produced and executed. Many of the cast members were out of their element and compensated by over acting. I was confused as to what the message and moral was; and the story itself seemed to glorify the protagonist despite the use of bible scripture. The flow of conversations were comical at best; it didn't seem realistic or believable. The movie failed to paint a picture and the plot has many inconsistencies. It is my opinion that more time and care should have been taking to perfect the story; and more money to hire a professional camera and audio production crew. If Christians represent Christ, this movie is a gross misrepresentation of excellence across the board."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars but I don't regret buying it.","review":"4 stars, but I don't regret buying..I just feel there should have been more details in certain parts and the one part with the club did not have to be in there all, but I guess to some that's ok.

For what the movie was I thought it was very inspirational and the songs were very good. Deitrick Haddon is a true talent and if this was his first try at writing and directing a movie it was well done and he should get better with it in time. The only dislike I had with the movie was the overacting and unrealistic of actions of KiKi Sheard,I mean you are hysterically crying instead of calling 911, that sort of caught me for a loop. I love god and have faith in the lord but in the real world with medical emergencies we call 911. But, overall the movie was very inspiring too me especially the song \\"Mighty God\\" it actually inspired me to stop smoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"The David and Saul story is clearly shown here although most of the people I know who watched it thought it would be on the storyline of David and Goliath. However, it shows the storyline of the jealousy that Saul had for David because of David's anointing. As Saul tried to kill David, so did the Bishop try to do to Dwight's spirit. However, just like in the Bible, Saul was not able to kill David as the Bishop was not able to kill Dwight's anointing. Fortunately, in the movie, the Bishop was able to repent. I would have loved to hear Karen sing something with \\"her son\\", but besides that, I enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This was a confusing picture.

This game is a gem from the far east, don't let it slip by.Did I mention that the animation is silky smooth, the graphics are some of best that the Dreamcast can produce and action is fast and furious. The frame rate never drops below the standard 60 and this makes for some great action. The time and effort taken to produce each Mech is seen in the level of detail for each character. The character backround stages are also exceptional which makes for some serious eye candy.

The problem is the controls are designed around a peripheral, which most of you know, called Twin Sticks. Playing the game with a standard controller IS possible and ALMOST fun, but it's like playing Quake without a keyboard, possible but not tolerable. I purchased the game and decided the Twin Sticks were a must, so I attempted to acquire a set. I found that the controllers go for around $75 each AND even if I felt like sinking $150 into one game I didn't have the option because the controllers are not sold in the US (as of June 2000) and all mail-order shops I found were sold out. So unless you already have Twin Sticks (actually Sega Saturn Twin Sticks work with an adapter) I wouldn't purchase this game. Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome, but true gamers won't be able to put up with the lack of control. ---2 stars, for now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best map of Belize i have found yet","review":"Having a good deal of detail including minor roads and lots of points of interest, as well as elevation gradient lines, I will find this map very useful in our upcoming trip.

It blasts out of the chute like a bucking bronco with her rendition of \\"How High The Moon\\", Andrews Sisters-style, and never looks back. The only thing I didn't love about this album was \\"Dream\\". I know--this version is much more true to the original in tempo and styling than C&T;'s version on their album of the same name... but wasn't that a luscious way to end that album? Truth be told, \\"All Of Me\\" would have garnered 5 stars had its predecessor not been as amazing as it was.

I think that this book suffers from the author's only having interviewed a limited range of sources and very few close friends of Nancy's.

She had no time to clean house because she was so busy going to club meeting for her book club. Finally she just leaves her children and moves in with her boy friend whose mother is the same age as she is. Her husband was a jurk but she never should have left her kids. Now these kids have no parents because both of them are dead.She should have just taken her kids and gotten out.

Punctuation can be found randomly in the middle of sentences, parts of sentences are missing, words are misspelled right and left - so much so that it is very difficult to follow Chesterton's arguments.

Amazon should no longer carry anything by Wilder Publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off publisher","review":"Great book, a classic, but... It should be illegal for publishers to sell books with so many errors in it.

Words are frequently misspelled and punctuation is missing or misplaced. Wilder Publications appears to not be an entirely legitimate publisher which furthermore feels the need to add a legal disclaimer to Chesterton's text.

I was furious with the lack of editing and resolved that the moment I finished the book I would write the publisher.Turns out the publisher does exist.

Who edited this book?!The work itself is truly brilliant. Evolutionary thought has come a long way from the theory of slow and rolling accent to punctuated equilibrium, but don't let the limited knowledge of science stop the argument.

The work itself is a masterpiece, but (as others have said) this edition has so many typographical errors and portions of missing text due to poor editing, that it makes it virtually unreadable and incomprehensible. For example, just click on the 'look inside' and notice that the preface is not only incomplete, but ends mid-sentence with a question mark.

Chesterton's method of composition consisted of reading several books on a subject, then dictating his thoughts aloud to his secretary. Such a modus operandi, if true, would explain why Chesterton's works are sometimes a bit wordy, as though no one had edited them to prune the excess verbiage. The Everlasting Man is a loquacious monologue where the style is occasionally irritating, but if you can look past this minor shortcoming, The Everlasting Man is an outstanding apologetic for Christianity. It is a pleasure to recommend this book for consideration, because Chesterton had a real knack for revealing the truth in a surprising and often paradoxical method. His books are not \\"dry\\", but lively, full of wit, fun, good humor, and fine reasoning. C.S.

I'm a novice to crocheting so this video is perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source for beginner crochet","review":"I had only a book to learn from and my starting chains were a mess. This video made it very clear what I was doing wrong, how to fix it, and how to balance my stitch out so that it looked like crochet, not making knots in yarn.The video's are extremely detailed and take you through the process step by step for each of the 5 stitches that it teaches in the video. Once you get these down, learning a new stitch is very easy.The only negative I would say is that for a DVD, I would have liked for them to have spent a little more time taking me through the patterns that come with the book. To help you read them, and understand them, and basically bring together the lessons on stitching, with the nomenclature used for writing patterns, with the act of actually putting that into stitches. But I guess that is left as a \\"user exercise\\".All in all, Excellent DVD. Worth every penny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Indeed","review":"If I had known that this DVD was all I was going to get I would have purchased a used one. This DVD was supposed to have 4 different colors of yarn and instructions to crochet a project. That was one of the MAIN reasons I bought it new form Amazon. But all that came in the mail was the DVD. It is hard to crochet a project if you don't have the supplies to do it with. Very Disappointed Indeed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"Very in depth instruction on crocheting! I'm very pleased with this DVD! I already know the basics (how to make a chain), but after that I'm lost. I've tried looking at books, but I need to physically see someone doing the stitches. My grandmother and mother are pros when it comes to crocheting, however, they work too fast for me to really see how they're making the stitches. Now that I have this DVD, I can roll with them! Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Informative Without Personality","review":"Overall, I would recommend this DVD. It is a little bit confusing to navigate due to the multiple and nested menu/index screens. Each segment is short and returns you to the menu screen when it finishes playing. Don't expect to sit back and play this all of the way through.Melissa is very professional, but is devoid of personality. She is robotic, but informative and clear. She does not smile. You cannot tell if she likes or hates to crochet.All of the information is presented in a way that is easy to grasp the concepts. The video and sound are fine. The lighting is flat. The close-ups of Melissa's hands and yarn are clear and easy to see. Instructions are detailed and comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is Fabulous!!!","review":"This DVD has everything you need to begin crocheting.

It doesn't even say what size it is, but after I bought a kit I matched it and I think it was like a size h or something... i don't remember... Anyways the crochet hook is the only real bad thing in this kit. Plus the fact that the patterns require the different hooks that isn't even that size on the crochet hook... seriously if your going to make a kit, you should provide everything we need or at least warn us on the case that we'll have to buy more crochet hooks. I didn't really mind that much because I already owned those crochet hooks, it's just that if someone didn't know how to check the sizes of the hooks, or that different hooks were different sizes, it'd confuse them and that is why I gave this kit 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"You pray,buy this book,and the Oral Roberts clone,Mr snake oil salesman, gets rich.

Expect your assumptions about gaining wealth and the meaning of success to be challenged. Examples: Success means deliverance from a past that limits us. Also, wealth is a neutral, though powerful, tool. We need more people of faith to have wealth and use it for wholesome causes. Gaylord writes from a very fresh and independent perspective. You won't find him repeating or mirroring the ideas of other authors in this field. This is a true original.

You can practically smell the salt air and taste the rum. Crowe makes a commanding but compassionate hero, and his friendship with ship doctor and scientist Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who'd like Aubrey to slow down so he can collect samples of unknown species, provides some interesting character by-play between the full-bore battle sequences. In all, a flavorful, bracing adventure, suitable for family viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect 1800s Naval War Video","review":"This movie amazed me after the first war scene. It's not the blood and all that that interests me. It's the insight into the 1800s and the exquisite storyline that kept me watching it over and over. Such as the naval command that they used, the fine weaponry they showed, Dr. Maturin's quest to find his flightless bird, and you can't forget the jokes!'In the service, one must always pick the lesser of 2 weevils!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivetting!","review":"A true must-see for any wartime & maritime action movie lover! Peter Weir has done an excellent job of bringing Patric O'Brian's masterieces on to the widescreen. Great acting, great special effects and outstanding soundtrack and music! Truth to tell, I watched the movie and then read the Books \\"Master and Commander\\" and \\"Far Side of the World\\" - plus I ordered 3 more books of the series from this site!In this movie one can trully experience life onboard a napoleonic period warship - all the hardships, malnutrition and injuries that the crew faced on a daily basis.Ok, it is true that many alterations have been made to the plot for the film version (which is of course an amalgamation of the two books mentioned above) but they are completely understandable for this purpose.The ending of the film left me wanting more though, and I am looking forward to a part II of this movie! It is without question the best thing after \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" with Gregory Peck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking Entertainment","review":"I finally got a chance to see this movie and I was not disappointed. I was unfamiliar with the source novels (Patrick O'Brian's novels) but it didn't matter much. This is a movie that takes you back to the days of Captain Blood or the Sea Hawk.Finely made in every way (10 Oscar nominations), Russel Crowe is terrific in the part of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is great as his friend and alter ego Dr. Stephen Maturin. Kudos especially go to Max Pirkis in the role of the very young midshipman Blakeney. This is not a movie with a message but one made for entertainment's sake and it does that on a grand level.Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voyage Adventure.","review":"Master and Commander is a great voyage adventure that has not been seen in Hollywood for ages. Russell Crowel is fantastic as the leader of a navel vessel that is on the run from napoleon ships who want to sink it.

Now go and read the books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master And Commander The Far Side Of The World","review":"\\"Master and Commander\\" was a great guy's flick - intense battle scenes, rugged sailors aboard a ship (indeed, most of the film takes place on the ship except for a brief time on the Galapagos), surviving a storm and drought, and other challenges.The acting by Russell Crowe and several other characters was great and I would imagine would be realistic for a ship crew during that time period. At a little over 2 hours, the film seemed to breeze along smoothly and was enjoyable the whole time.The basic plot is an English ship trying to capture or sink a French ship during the time of Napoleon. Without giving away the ending, I will tell you that the action was riveting and the film kept my interest.Watch and enjoy this \\"guy's flick\\" - okay, some women will enjoy it too!Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top flight entertainment","review":"Very realistic and accurate story of the British Navy during the Napoleanic Wars. Actually filmed on a real replica of a British Frigate, the HMS Rose was acquired for the movie and refit in Ensenada Mexico. Re-named the HMS Surprise, she still sails San Diego Bay.

I love it. I would recommend this movie to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real movie making marked by characters","review":"It's great characterization that make great stories and this film is a great story well told. The major character - His Majesty's Ship - is a creature who we meet at night as Russell Boyd's brilliant camera glides over and through her. We immediately are conscious of claustrophobic innards, her movement, and the complexity of her makeup manifest by the hundreds of ropes, knots, stays, that encase her, thread through her. We get a fish eye view as she weighs anchor. We listen to her groans, creaks,sighs - literally a breathing thing.Much of the joy of the novels is the attention to detail which give the works an authenticity - Peter Weir has achieved a similar success in his attention to detail. A brilliant journey. Oh yes, the actors are fine. The story exciting. The \\"special effects\\" believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie wish they had made the others","review":"I love this movie the scenery and sets are just breath taking.

Not only did it get great reviews, but it is set on a wooden square rigger. The golden age of sail! There were all these stories about how Peter Weir did all this research to really get the authenticity. Wow! I thought. Well, all that doesn't amount to squat if you don't have a story or characters that are interesting. And what about a cohesive timeline? One day they are off the coast of brazil, then next in the cape, having the same conversation! Who was it that died overboard when poor Crowe had to cut the mast off? It took a few minutes to figure out what was happening every new scene.

This film, unfortunately disappoints. The inane mis-casting of Russell Crowe, with his innapropriate Aussie drawl, is the biggest flaw. He in now way portrays the original character, either in stature or speech.The same can be said for Maturin, who is the \\"raison d'etre\\" for most of the missions undertaken by H.M.S. Surprise. If one wishes to see the fullness of this crime, read the series.I was soooo dismayed to see this in the theaters. The entire emphasis seems to be on the visual aspects of this work, which standing on their own are creditable, although lacking in many ways to show the immensity of the seafarer's world in Aubrey's time. I can only pray, that like \\"Mutiny on The Bounty\\", this great epoch will be revisited by artists with clearer intellect and vision. Sorry, but I can not recommend this juvenile epic in any regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Video Quality","review":"This review is for those of you who already know this is a great movie with a great soundtrack...but are considering upgrading from a DVD to this Blu Ray for an expected boost in video quality.Don't bother with this \\"upgrade.\\" The video quality of this blu ray is no better than my DVD (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV). Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific movie! But don't expect Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"I've read all the Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian, and this movie stays true to their style. This is not a swashbuckler. It is the story of the extraordinary friendship of two men set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. The movie, like the books, is in no rush to tell the tale. In fact, the sometime slow pace of the movie adds to the feeling of authenticity. This is a great movie, but the hardcore action movie buffs will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read the books","review":"I have indeed read the books and re-read Master and Commander and The Far Side of the World prior to hopping down to the local theater to review the movie. I must say that I was not disappointed at all. Quite the contrary.The characters and plot were masterfully brought to life by the actors, writers and directors. Almost all books are short-sheeted by their movies but it's the spirit of the books that must be adhered to. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World definitely came with that distinct Patrick O'Brian spirit.If you've got [money] and 2 hours to spare - go see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie","review":"Master And Commander wasn't too shabby. Although I am no Naval Historian, I have seen other peroid pieces (Horatio Hornblower Series, etc...), and they were better in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, but it lacked more action. The final battle scene could have used a little more work also. I understand that close quarter battle needs to look confining, but from a viewer standpoint, it would have been more enjoyable if you could have seen more of the fight. Not quite the epic masterpiece that a lot of people say that it is, but it was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thar she blows","review":"I can't believe the over the top reviews for this one. This would have been a great Sunday afternoon TV flick in the late 80s but nothing more. Lots of sailing, drinking and gore (not that there is anything wrong with that mind you) but there was just no compelling storyline arround it. This was painfully long to watch. Swimming lizzards and birds that won't fly, however fascinating, seemed to be odly out of place it was more like Gladiator meets the nature channel. It seemed to me that Russel said 'Hey, I like the Galapagos Islands and sailing, so lets do something there', I usually like his work, but that thing stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master Of Crapness","review":"This film is what I expected, a generic Hollywood style film.

It had one decent battle scene at the beginning and a marginal battle scene at the end. Everything in the middle was uninteresting filler. They spent more time on the Galapagos islands then anywhere else looking at animal specimens that I couldn't care less about. If I wanted that I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau. I was expecting a movie about wooden naval ships, but those were more of a background scene in this movie. The character of the captain was also as shallow and see through as plastic wrap. All the other characters around him has to tell the audience how great the captain is because the captain character sure couldn't demonstrate it on his own. The political correctness was also nauseating. Make better use of your time and money by checking out something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flotsam (seagoing trash)","review":"This movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has read the books on which it claims to have been based, or who knows anything about 18th-19th century naval warfare before ironclads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitiful display of directing and acting.","review":"This film was perchance one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. To begin with, the cinema at which I saw this film was filthy. Refuse and spilled drink were ubiquitous, rendering the floor sticky and thus completely abhorrent. The staff was terrible, and they all had a terrible attitude. Furthermore, the man who was selling the popcorn was a racist, and his relentless taunts will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. As for the film, it was quite enjoyable, and quite worthy of the Academy Award (TM) nomination it garnered.

I sat through the first several hours, and it was slow and tedious. I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action whatsoever. Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened involving a the cabin-boy, I think. That kept me watching for a while longer. But hour 10, I gave up.

The movie spends a painfully long amount of time on useless and irrelevant little stories about so called \\"Life on the sea\\". This film shouldn't even be described as a Full length movie.

Buy it today, by all means.My extreme distaste is to the fact that in the book this is based on, the British actually fight (and beat) an American ship in the war of 1812 (which the poor Brits had to fight at the same time as the Napoleonic war). What's the matter with you Americans? Can't you stand to see a little defeat on the big screen with some great historics to go with it? You won the damn war in the end, anyway! In most historical films the British are portrayed as evil and tyrannical (Braveheart, The Patriot), or else just bumbling, and ultra-posh. What a load of Hollywood Hogwash! It's like in \\"The Last Samurai\\", where you just have to have some American heroe gloating over victory.Free your minds people! (Take no offence, please.

Those who has read the books will appreciate a few glipses of favorite character but thats all you get. I love Russle Crow but he didnt get much of a chance to act, mainly because there absolutely NO PLOT.

Russell Crowe is superb in his role as Capt Jack Aubrey. But I would think that 13-year old Max Pirkis as Midshipman Lord Blakeney, came neigh close to stealing the entire show! He is marvelous and for his feat of rendering an endearing and sensitive portrayal of the courageous one-armed Boy-Officer, this movie rates 5-stars. Pirkis is fabulous! Oh yes, do not forget to CRY when his best boyhood friend, Midshipman Calamy is killed in battle. It is a VERY sad scene which will haunt the viewer for a long time.The VISUAL effects are second to none as are the audio effects. You actually SEE what late 18th century/early 19th century solid shot 12-lb cannon balls can do to a ship and what they do NOT do. The sounds are remarkable!

It really did gather the tight spaced feel of a warship during the 1800's. The dialogue was annoying, so don't watch for the screenplay. But the set designs, the sound, the editing, and the acting are pretty good. I had some problems with the middle of the film which went a little slow (but so did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and that was IMO the best picture of 2000). But it picks up at the end with a great battle scene. This isn't a fast paced movie. It takes time to enjoy but its well worth it. 4-stars for the movie. 5-stars for director Peter Weir."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Isn't Pirates Of The Carribean!!!","review":"Why do people compare this movie to Pirates of the Caribbean!? It's the exact opposite of Pirates. Life onboard a ship is seen as joyless, cold, dark, and dirty. NOT glamoures! And this movie can actually be taken seriously!I thought this movie was a wonderfully great film! This generation's DasBoot. Very intense and emotional thought out the entire film. Deserves Oscars in every category!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Watch, But Maybe Not The Buy....","review":"To be honest, I'm usually not crazy about movies like this, but this is a total exception for me. It reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean and Pearl Harbor to some extent, but otherwise is totally original.There are a lot of little stories going on in the main story, which is pretty cool. There's the main story, about the rivalry of the two ships, the friendship story between the doctor and a young boy, and a few others that run on and off in the movie.If you liked movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Pearl Harbor, this movie is a 'must-watch'. Even if you didn't it's still worth watching. I wouldn't buy it before you have watched it, because it's one of those 'make-or-break' movies, but it's without a doubt worth a five dollar rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent film","review":"What I loved most about this film is that it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience but asks the viewer to make the connections. Peter Weir is a brilliant filmmaker who allows the camera to unfold the story. From the opening scene to the final battle, he doesn't allow a lot of exposition where the characters go into lengthy explanation to a dumbed down audience. Every scene is organic and the rich details tell the narrative. The acting is just first rate and Crowe is miraculous when depicting the character's inner conflict. I also love the fact that the dialogue had not been watered down. Sailors exchange with lightning fast speed authentic nautical jargon. By the end of the film one feels fully immmersed in the experience. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Finally a good made movie, and not trash that runs in theaters nowadays such as Swat or Fast and Furious. This movie is like a movie should be, spontanous, character development etc...I cant see why some people are turned off by the dialogues and the music. Crowe did another masterful job in portraying a real hero, who is able to admit mistakes. If you cant pay attention more than 5 mins this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking good macho BS fun","review":"Russell Crowe is excellent as Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey, the head of the HMS Surprise. The movie details the skirmishes between the English Surprise and the French war ship, Acheron, set during the Napoleonic war. Captain Aubrey is a study in Leadership Values. He is a classic tragic figure, a hero with a fatal flaw. The revelation of the flaw is quite good but opposed to greek literature, Aubrey is finally triumphant not in overcoming his flaw but in that he is finally victorious (we believe) over the French ship. Oh well, I don't think it was intended to instruct us in higher moral values. Anyway, the movie is beautiful to look at, contains a dash of human interest (however, I did get a bit nervous about the lovely young men who served as midshipmen, etc), shows the comraderie that must have developed on such ships and from my 2004 perspective details daily life on board in an authentic manner. Recommended for a rousing good night of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent historical adventure","review":"If you like historically accurate adventure movies, this one is for you. Be prepared, though, for favorite characters to die and for an unusual twist at the end. Russel Crowe portrays Capt. \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey, who's been given orders to take down a larger and more powerful French warship, and by gosh, he's gonna do it, even with a disabled ship and inexperienced crew. One warning to parents: there are some bloody scenes probably not totally appropriate to young children. Again, this is historically accurate; this is how it was in those days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Fun","review":"The best thing about this movie is they tried to convey what it must have been like aboard a 18th century Naval Frigate (The HMS Surprise). My Uncle who served in WWII said Saving Private Ryan did this for the European battles he was in, but all the military men of Captain Aubrey's day are gone, so we have to take Patrick O'Brian and Peter Wiers word for it. Attention to detail was key in this movie; the costumes, the weevils, the ships rigging and the English Language of the day took you to that time and place. It's a fun movie to watch, so sit down and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Big fan of the O'brien books. The movie didn't try to follow any one book. It created a composit story with some of the best characters. O'brien would have been proud of the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Epic Tale","review":"This picture makes you think you're actually on the HMS Surprise! The casting was superb and the sailors looked like they've been on a ship for years! The soundtrack completes the movie espically thru the battle scenes....you'd swear the cannonball is coming through the TV .I've had a major man-crush with Russell Crow from the Gladiator days and he plays this role without any overdone or unecessary melodramatic overtones.Drawbacks? No sequel made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing and action","review":"The best sailing/war movie ever made so far. Touches on a lot of historic events to boot (Darwin and such). The old sailing ship stuff in this movie is so real - movie doesn't play fovorites w/ characters either, pis some folks off"},{"rating":"2","title":"master and commander","review":"this was a good movie although at certain times it does get a little slow. russel crowe is amazing in this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"After waiting, purchasing, and watching this movie I have no idea why it was granted the accolades it was. Peter Weir is a very good director but has little to work with as Crowe goes beyond character and tries to utter failure to not be a part of the movie but be the movie itself.In Weir movies often the landscape becomes a character in and of itself - think for instance of Picnic at Hanging Rock. However here he loses this advantage and opportunity. I know that the Hollywood money men make decisions to formula but keeping Weir from creating the landscape character of the ship and sea is really inexcusable.A universally poor cast and script lead this film into the depths of mediocrity which is such a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring ship movie","review":"This was a very boring movie, there wasn't much to keep you on the edge of your seat or to just keep you entertained. Russell Crowe saved this movie from me giving it 1 star. He is definetly one of the best actors out there and should get better movies to showcase his talent in. Without him this movie would have been even worse than it actually was. If you want to see a good ship movie check out Pirates of the Carribean. That is a very entertaining movie and I look forward to the second one. I very much hope there aren't any sequels to Master and Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tired Goose Chase","review":"This is a movie that threw away all the potential it had to be at least better than average. We are introduced to Captain Aubrey and his crew, who are chasing down a French ship and constantly being thwarted. And that's it. By about halfway through the movie, one wonders when this chase will get interesting, or if it will harken back to the good old days of pirate movies, ala Errol Flynn. It does neither. The characters are so bland that the names are even hard to recall.The movie's one redeeming quality, and why I gave it two stars instead of one, was the historical accuracy involved. We get a glimpse into the past that is neither overblown or trite. However, even a documentary needs interesting commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it's lacking a bit","review":"First of all, I will get my bias out of the way and say I haven't seen that many \\"sea\\" movies that I have liked. So when I saw this one, and came to realize that it is more about the relationship of two characters, Russel Crowe (Captain) and Paul Bettany (ship's surgeon,) then I realized I just did not like it. Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator. Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received. This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there. Give it a chance; because open-minded is better than close-minded, still I felt personally disappointed by the movie more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie if you are....","review":"Great movie if you are a single male, in your 50s, and own a boat. Otherwise, paint drying is more exciting. Dull, dull, dull.I think the Patrick O'Brian's estate should sue. His books are lively, humourous, exciting and, well, had a story. Not this movie.\\"No women allowed\\" should be on the cover of this DVD. My girlfriend was so bored that I am condemned to three \\"chick flicks\\" for picking this stinker. Thanks Master and Commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"My goodness! I'm still asleep after watching this movie! If you're having trouble sleeping, try this snooze fest. It'll knock you right out. I almost fell asleep several times in the theater. It was hard to get into the movie and difficult to understand a word they're saying with that accent! So basically the whole thing was confusing and it lost my interest. I couldn't wait until it was over. The beginning battle scene was exciting... then the movie went downhill from there. I got tired of seeing the same things over and over again, sailing, more sailing, feasting, and mumbling words. Not sure why critics rave about it so much. Just warning people out there not to waste money on this dull dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's boring","review":"This movie is boring. There's nothing here that I like.

This film is so incredibly boring it almost put me to sleep.(Like a sweet rocka bye-baby melody)Theres like zero action and like 2 scene changes, the ship and the little rock island. The one battle scene is a joke too. This is just a horrible attempt. I even had a hard time understanding the dialog. My mistake is that I bought it before I watched it, I wanted to like this movie so bad and I had high expectations for it. Thank God I was able to unload my copy for 6 bucks, I just wish I could have the time I wasted watching it back. I'd give it a quarter of a star if I could. Horrible! Too much talking and playing violins (Hee Haw !!!) This one sucks bad...Real Bad!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox is the pits","review":"even at a discounted price of 28 dollars - it feels like an enormous jip by Fox to assume blu-ray buyers would fork out that much for SO LITTLE - for the film... fine... but for so few supplements - that's highway robbery. Shame on you Fox, shame! 'Predator' was mentioned, but 'Commando' was omitted as being another lame attempt by Fox, 'Master and Commander' continues the trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"ON THE GOOD SHIP LOLLIPOP","review":"About as much fun as playing with your toy boats in the bathtub. These 19th Century British military seamen seem better suited for Never-Never Land and a bottle of rum, given their ridiculous offensive war strategies of disguising the ship and building dummy ships to fool the enemy. I've had better ideas in 'Stratego'. There's a flogging, a tormented officer, an amputation, sentimental characters getting killed, and a good-hearted commander who will stop at nothing to destroy his Napoleonic archenemy. The only thing missing is a great white whale to smash the whole thing to smithereens. Given the current state of seafaring movies, if this were a ride at Disneyland, it would be the safe, innocuous Dumbo elephant ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't understand a word they said...","review":"My husband and I bought this and eagerly sat down to enjoy it. We found the noise level in the movie coupled with the heavy British accents made it impossible to understand what they were saying. We are not old or hard of hearing, either! This definitely detracted from our enjoyment to the point that we were glad when it finally ended. The cinematography is exceptional. The story was hard to follow (mostly because we couldn't understand the dialog). If there had been subtitles it would have helped! Maybe we are the only people reviewing this who had this problem, but I am reporting honestly our reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooooowwww! this movie sucked!","review":"I was hoping to sea an epic, sea adventure with loads of realistic violence. Instead, I got A freakin' 2 and a half hour long boring movie. The only action was at the beginning, and the end. The movie is a failed effort. WARNING: THIS MOVIE SUCKED, YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY BORED, SO IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FILM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!","review":"Masters and Commanders is an excellent movie. Its portrayal of life at sea at that time seems very realistic. Wonderful acting. Very interesting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Do you want a guillotine in Piccadilly? No!\\"","review":"Set in 1806, MASTER AND COMMANDER follows British Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he sails his ship, the HMS Surprise, toward Cape Horn in pursuit of a French frigate known as the Acheron, which had previously attacked the Surprise. Despite the fact that the Acheron is larger, carries more guns, and has a larger crew, Aubrey convinces his men to begin a chase that takes them across two oceans around South America.Russell Crowe gives a stunning performance as the lead character. I was completely drawn into in this film and the war came alive on the big screen. With very few exceptions I am not a fan of the action genre, but I have to admit that this movie stands out from the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Entertaining Movie","review":"First of all --- don't listen to the naysayers who have trashed this film with their silly 1, 2, and 3-star reviews. Most of those reviews are either totally unobjective or so nitpicky that you wonder if the reviewer has ever enjoyed ANY movie!!Also, for the reviewers who have criticized the movie because \\"it's not like the book\\" --- when have you ever seen a film that captured the entire essence of the book(s) it was drawn from? There is simply not enough time to do that on screen!!This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the time. The action scenes were probably the best ever for a seafaring flick. Of course, there were stretches that went a lot slower, but these were for character development (for those of you who complained about the \\"lack\\" of such).I won't go into the storyline here, as numerous other reviewers have already covered that. I love movies with sailing vessels, and this is probably the best I've ever seen. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh yes.","review":"Holy cow is this ever a great movie. One of the best of the decade in all honesty. It's just an incredibly enthralling adventure. It's long yes but it's so freaking lean. Not one second of it is anything less than mesmerizing. I would kill for this to have been a success and become a franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master and Commander","review":"The movie was outstanding. Story line was great, action and life decisions added to the suspense. Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute masterpiece!!","review":"One of the best high-seas films ever made since \\"The Caine Mutiny.\\" And one of the best historical dramas ever. Just don't make the mistake in thinking that this is your typical good guy vs bad guy movie, or else you'll probably be bored to tears. If you want a movie that takes place on the seas but with the good guy / bad guy stuff, then stick with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.But if you want a compelling story about a crew of men who come together through trials of conflict and great peril (sans the lame computer special effects), then look no further! By the way, I also recommend the Patrick O'Brian novels that this film is based on. I think it's blasphemy that this film was nominated for 10 Oscars, but walked away empty-handed ('Return of the King' getting Best Picture instead of 'Master & Commander?' You've got to be kidding me!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just don't care","review":"Listen I watch a movie for the movie. I rarely if ever watch the extras. Nowadays everything is green screen or blue screen anyway. All you every really see is some guy on the extras disc sitting next to a computer talking about what he did to make the scene on the computer. I'm sorry but this is not that interesting. I'm sick of hearing people bitch about it and give good transfers on blu bad reviews because of this. This does not help someone purchase it. Is this really so important to you 1 star people for the Master and Commander blu-ray? There are better things to bitch about. And for this Peter character to compare Predator to other blu-rays. Come on dude the damn movie was made in the mid 80's you really think the thing is going to look good as a new release transfer. Get your head out of the clouds. Every one of the blu discs I have from Fox I'm happy with this one is no exception. As for this disc great picture and sound and a good movie to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures Napoleonic Naval Warfare","review":"I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent. This is a war film which is certainly worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Crowe is Commander of a ship.","review":"If you like Pirates of the Caribbean or the Columbia Ship at Disneyland, you will probably like this film.Russell Crowe is the captain of a ship. Some young lads that are part of the crew are on watch. One of the lads believes he saw something in the fog. Another ship. Nobody else saw what he glimpsed. The Captain believes what the lad saw and continues the watch. Boom! They are attacked. When the battle is over. The enemy ship is gone. He's a very nice Captain and knows his business. He is creative as well. He makes a map out of food which is dinner. It is way of showing the crew where the next destination is. The Galapagos Islands. There he believes the enemy ship is hiding.I can not imagine anyone else in this role. Russell Crowe is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD's are losing their freebie extras","review":"Don't get me wrong. I loved Master and Commander which I call a thinking man's swashbuckler. It definitely is a great plot and worthy of an Oscar Nomination. What I have gotten used to and missed here was the commentary that usually comes with DVDs. If you want that, you have to pay for the 2CD set...:-(Also, if you have a regular TV (30 inches or less) the letterbox effect of the wide screen version cuts out 50% of the viewing area, which ruins the special effects that made this movie so awesome in the theaters.The Wide screen version is a good investment for the future. If you want to see the action up close, get the regular version and if you want the commentaries and the making of the movie (which I do) buy the 2 CD set. For 6 dollars more, you get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Those who give this movie 1 star for being boring: There is a lot to this movie if you watch.

I was expecting there to be tons of action but there wasn't hardly any. My husband who usually really enjoys these types of movies commented that the movie needed some more action. I was so bored & confused. The talk was boring & different. When people got hurt or died I didn't even know who the person was because you didn't get a chance to see & even when they would mention a name I'd already heard so many names that I just forgot who was who. I didn't laugh one time in this movie & I felt like the movie ended with so many questions still unanswered. I don't know if it was left open for a part 2 but I just didn't get the ending. In my opinion the movie could've been so much better & I don't really recommend it to anybody unless they are really into the ship battles in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"its official - the french cant fight","review":"what a lopsided battle at the end.

In the parts where I wished the movie would slow down, it went too fast. In the parts where I wished the movie would speed up, it went too slow.If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating film, steer clear of Master and Commander. It's a cat and mouse chase that lacks creativity. I thought the chase scenes in the Matrix were long, but compared to Master and Commander, Matrix's sequences are short and deep. Master and Commander is only a thriller, there is nothing epic about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Crowe lovers and haters ..","review":"A movie about a very hard way of life in very harsh conditions.

At another moment, it seems to be an \\"expose\\" of life on an 18th century vessel. At yet another moment, it seems to be a pretentious moral investigation into the balance of military vs. scientific priorities. Unfortunately, from trying to be so many things it never succeeds in fulfilling any one of them. Nor do the characters give us particularly much to care about them. The end result is a definitely underwhelming impact leaving one wondering why this film was made in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any ole accent will do.","review":"First, are we supposed to be fooled that Russell Crowe's Australian accent was British? The only reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one was because of the art direction and costumes. As for the rest, I've seen better on the History Channel. Lucky Jack's obsession parallels, Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, but less interesting. I wanted to like this film, but it just didn't engage me. Surprising enough, it probably would've been a pretty good book. Nah.

I guess I'm spoiled by the Horatio Hornblower series, which is much more exciting and a better tutorial of ship life in those days (Master and Commander got a lot wrong, but like Russell said, \\"If you watch movies to learn history, you are wrong, Mate!\\"). There are 8 Hornblower espisodes (A&E) I know of and I have 6 of those in a boxed set. I presume you can order the other two on DVD, which are the most recent. All are feature-length, so in all, you get almost 16 hours at sea.Russell Crowe, whom I love, really did seem fat and slow, which is what all the previews showed but I blindly ignored. At least *rent* it first. Don't buy it without seeing it like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the MTV generation...","review":"The negative reviews for \\"Master and Commander\\" that I've read sound like they were written by those of the MTV generation, or younger still. Anyone who is just looking for action, graphic violence and nudity will be sadly disappointed in this movie. Believe it or not, this movie actually has a Plot. I know many of you remember the days when movies still had a good plot at their core, but they have become very few and far between these days. Once in a while we get some great movies, like The English Patient, Dances with Wolves, or Schindler's List. \\"Master and Commander\\" ranks among those few films worthy of the term \\"masterpiece\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memorable","review":"One measure is what I draw from a movie. For the life of me, I can remember little but Crow hanging from the riggings, powder smoke, some island research and wine drinking. That's it. No catchy phrases, no memorable scenes. Nothing.Its been probably eighteen months since I viewed the film. At the time I thought is was a bit dull. I served in the modern submarine navy and I think a film about the sub during even my time on board would have proven more interesting.Good production value, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Horatio Hornblower Series is Much Much Better","review":"Yes they both have the costumes, the floggings, the weevils crawling from the biscuits and of course the swashbuckling action but what separates them is the sense of believability and attachment to the characters that Master and Commander never comes close to. I also found the script awkward and unbelievable and the pedestrian plot is an afterthought. The new Horatio Hornblower series is a much better take on this exciting era and it captures the sense of adventure and romance on the deep seas that makes it linger in your memory while Master and Commander has long faded away."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Slow","review":"Having read some of the books, I was really excited to watch this movie. It just never could get going. There was so much dealing with the boat that the plot line never progressed, and had I not read the book, I wouldn't have known what was going on.

There was no theme, no plot. Just sailing about. There were no characters to root for, no story to follow. I ended up picking up a book. The battle didn't make sence because they never addressed the issue of why? Then the battle was over as was the movie and I was left with .....WHY???The only mildy interesting thing was that the young officers were school aged boys without hope of sprouting facial hair anytime soon. That one of these boys underwent a dramatic and maiming event and walked away... was the only riviting tale. It would have been interesting had they addressed the issue of why such young boys were sent to sea... as they were obviously blue-blooded chaps . This sub plot was too short and vastly unexplored though.If you want a good tale of the sea... try Finding Nemo, it is superior in everyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master and Commander have not mastered the movie industry","review":"This was a very unclear movie. There was very little information from the communication of the characters and I could not understand why they needed to chase that ship. Also, it's all very stretched out. Only about half the scenes needed to be in the movie. It was also very boring and had very little excitement. In the end it seemed that the captain was fooled and started to chase the ship again and then it just ended. They should have deleted the useless scenes earlier and made the end a bit better. A waste of time, don't watch it unless you really, really want or if you're a Russel Crowe fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the rest of it","review":"The movie was allright, nothing to get excited about.I often read while watching a movie. If a movie is good enough to really command my attention, I stop reading. This movie did not command my attention.The worst thing about it was that there was no ending. The movie just stopped in the middle of something. Im sorry I spent the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & Boring","review":"You can't make up for poor directing and boring dialogue with special effects.This movie was a complete failure. I would give it no stars if that was possible. Having read all of the Lucky Jack novels I was hoping that Russell Crowe would be able to bring to the screen something of what Patrick O'Brian had created in his 20 novel series. After the first hour I had to begin fast forwarding. It was a complete and total waste of my time. Even if I had not read the novels, this movie was just poorly done. I didn't care about the characters, the fighting scenes had good special effects but since I don't watch a movie for the special effects this did nothing to add to a movie that simply didn't make it as far as directing or acting was concerned. Save your money and time, give this movie a miss. Or better yet, get a copy of Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy & a Fraud","review":"I haven't the slightest notion how good or bad this film might be.

I know I'm in the minority, but the individuals set of films just rubs me the wrong way. I doubt the historical accuracy of the films, and do not enjoy the sense of self-importance and bravado. Want to be a leading man? Lose 30 pounds and get a haircut. I find Ben Affleck to be a better leading man, and I think he's a robot in a Daredevil costume. The day these folks re-make Deliverance with Russell Crowe as Ned Beatty, Ben Affleck as Burt Reynolds, Matt Damon as John Voigt, and Tom Cruise as Ronny Cox is the day they take some daring and bold roles. I think Norm McDonald and Artie Lang from the film Dirty Work would nicely reprise the part of the Hillbilly's that victimized Ned Beatty and John Voigt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot damn, summer in the city, people at night gettin' dirt and gritty","review":"Okay, now, in all fairness to this movie, I didn't watch the entire thing. I couldn't. I sat through the first four hours, and it was slow and tedious. I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action or plot whatsoever. Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened. That kept me watching for a while longer. But hour ten, I gave up. I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters. I'd also grown a beard. It was looong.-Steve[...]And don't say that this review wasn't helpful.

I couldn't wait for the DVD to be released. However once i saw that there were two versions, and one of the versions cost twice as much as the other i was to say the least angry. One version is just the movie and it costs just the same as any other DVD (might as well just wait for it to come on cable). The other version (the collectors addition) contains all the extra's that you would find on any other DVD movie only they are expecting you to pay twice as much for something you would normaly get for the regular price of a dvd.

The story is set amidst the open ocean, in which Aubrey is frequently attacked by the French army. The story tends to be slow at times and the characters lack development even with the films length. What holds the movie together is its realism and accuracy to history and the period. Russel Crowe gives a performance worthy of Oscar nods but doesn't outshine his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind. This film is a must see of 2003 and a great film for fans of films like Treasure Island and Mutiny on the Bounty."},{"rating":"2","title":"--Awesome seafaring adventure--","review":"MASTER AND COMMANDER fulfilled all of the hype and advertisements that preceded the film. Russell Crowe, as Capt Jack Aubrey, delivered an outstanding performance. The supporting characters were also well chosen and compelling.This fast paced story takes place in the early 1800's and begins and ends with riveting sea battles fought between English and French warships. The music was lovely and haunting. I found all of the characters to be realistic and the story to be memorable.Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL MOVIE","review":"From the characters to the special effects to the atmosphere it created, this movie is wonderful!!

Russel Crow takes his performance by the horns and prooves it by playing the violin. The opening action sequence was more realistic than most I have seen and the could never gain the upper hand. However, I was expecting more of an action flick than a plot filled movie that kept you interested. The previews showed it as a constant battle, but it was a struggle against nature that they showed. The movie was still very good, and the performances were delivered solidly. Watch it if you like movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great affection for detail...","review":"I finally saw this film, and am awe-struck! The attention to detail is quite exceptional, thanks to the brilliant vision of director Peter Weir. I was wondering if ths might be a franchise...\\"Far Side of the World\\" ...maybe there'll be more. The action scenes and the flawless cinematography, not to mention brilliant editing, draw the viewer in and you're taken away. Crowe is great, as is Paul Bettany, who creates a sense of purpose and legitimacy to the proceedings. And Billy Boyd is certainly a busy guy, appearing in two Oscar nominated blockbusters in one year (\\"LOTR\\"). This is a well-made, seriously endearing action drama with loads of heart. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World","review":"This film turned out to be a whole lot better than I expected. I had heard that the film was slow, the acting was bland, and the action to boring, but turns out this movie is pretty good. Russell Crowe plays Jack Aubrey well, and the other acting is great too. The plot may not be full of excitement and action, but the film has brilliant special effects and realism that will keep the audience occupied. I disagreed with the Best Picture nomination and some of the other Oscar nods. That is the only thing I disagree with about the movie. The DVD is packed with extras and the digital transfer is amazing. I reccomend this movie for Russell Crowe fans and epic lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Epic","review":"Russel Crowe does a great job on this great epic film. The story is about two warships (one French one British) fighting each other on the high seas in the early 1800's.

Now, that is not to say the PLOT is historically accurate, b/c it is completely fictional. However, the representation of life at sea is absolute perfection. The battle scenes are extraordinarily realistic, fast and furious. Many boats contained young men or children, as this movie portrays. Battles on the high seas were either excessively protracted, or brutally short, depending entirely on the range of the fighting. Everything this movie shows is historical perfection. Some may find it a little slow, but for anyone with even an iota of patience, Master and Commander is very much worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"the far side of innovativeness","review":"amazing cinematicsRusselle Crowe is amazing in this oneI'm speechlessall I can say is I loved watching this on dvdand when I cansince I bought it of courseI can't wait to see it again and again and againit's really a timeless piece of workand the plot is moving and genious all at once"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for ABAP programmers, less so on the SAPscript side","review":"This is the only book on SAPscript.

Pernilla August is absolutely fabulous in this role.

The rating comes from the fact that Columbia decides to continuously reissue the same material, most of which is not that great compared to other versions of the same songs. It is a true shame that Columbia seems to think that no one would be interested in a complete reissue of the catalog of music. It is even more frustrating when you see titles on this CD like, \\"Royal Canal\\", and think \\"Wow, this must be from \\"Bold Fenian Men\\", only to find out it's an inferior release from \\"Ain't it Grand?\\" Same with \\"Old Orange Flute\\".

That's all that this movie really is... Rosemary's Baby with a dash of sci-fi cloning to make it feel like it's something new. Only \\"Blessed\\" is done with none of the subtle style of Roman Polanski or Ira Levin.Instead, the suspense is supposed to be built with ultrasound images that have the Devil's face hidden in them like a Rorschach ink blot. Apparently, some rich guy has managed to procure a vial that contains a few drops of Lucifer's blood. Being a moron, he thinks it'd be a good idea to clone Lucifer using a local clinic that he owns. Poor Heather Graham has no idea what she's in for. When will girls learn that if you go to a fertility clinic, some old man will impregnate you with a Devil clone?Sounds absurd, right?

Lo and behold, Heather is pregnant with twins and all seems right with the world. But of course, the clinic is merely a cover for a cloning operation headed by a sinister David Hemmings. The movie's script is so jumbled, however, that exactly what's being cloned is never truly clarified; why is another couple ceremoniously dispatched? Is the husband in on the scheme? Why did LORD OF THE RING's Andy Serkis sign on to play a somewhat maniacal cleric?

It's pleasant enough but I would have preferred them to stick to their folk-pop roots. The other notable feature of this album is that although they have recorded many traditional songs, they have added new words and / or music to many of them, presumably so that they can get royalties. Some of the differences seem small though the new music for 'Twas the night before Christmas is certainly noticeable.Once you accept it for what it is, this album is rather good. It includes some original songs (The Magi, Light one candle), some rarely heard traditional songs (The friendly beasts, Cherry tree carol) and a couple of re-recordings of songs from their sixties repertoire (A-soalin', Blowing in the wind).This is a fine album but I would have liked it better if they had recorded a folk-pop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third one","review":"I have worn out two of this CD!

That DVD gave viewers the option of widescreen and fullscreen images, though it was light on extras. This reissue from Sony only offers the fullscreen version, and a scratchy print of it at that.

If you are a Godzilla fan, buy this 4th film in the series(I hope they get the rights to King Kong vs. Godzilla).

The story was confusing ,but the costume designs were great.IF you want action heres a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, not great","review":"I'd say this one is okay, but there's nothing really that great about it. godzilla looks impressive here, but rather clumsy. The special effects are good. plenty of scenes of the milatary attacking godzilla, which are more enjoyable then the fight scenes which are brief and boring, can't understand how godzilla lost to two little catapillars when he just should have stomped em, pretty embarising. However, nothin's worse than listening too those little twin faries singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST HEISEI Series Godzilla movie!","review":"The plot is bad.They steal from Raiders of the Lost Ark when getting the idol and only Battra,Mothra's evil twin,keeps this movie from bombing out completely.After you watch it once to know whats going on in the series so far you shouldn't watch it again.Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mothra and Godzilla fight in yet another badly dubbed film","review":"This is basicly a remake of the 1964 classic. This is more high teck but the new Shobijin are really bad and ern't even twins and there is a really bad dub job. Thus this ends up not even coming close to the original's power."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent transfer at budget price","review":"The DVD image quality is excellent. I didn't expect much at the budget price, so the sharp, stable, colorful 2.35:1 widescreen transfer was a nice surprise. The box says \\"images of superb quality taken from the film's original print.\\" It's usually best to ignore puffery, but here you really do get gorgeous video--about as good as (say) the Bond DVDs of the same vintage. Minor nits: there's some dust at the ends of the reels, and the widescreen transfer is not anamorphic (that is, not \\"enhanced for 16:9 TVs\\").The 5.1 audio is choppy and strange at times. Whenever the dubbed English pops in, the sound quality changes, almost as if it briefly drops into mono. But part of the joy of vintage Godzilla is its glorious cheezyness. Making it too sterile would cut out its soul.The DVD \\"extras\\" are negligible. At the price, it's unfair to complain about this. The important thing is that the film itself looks great. If you like Godzilla, don't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie was alright. I wasn't impressed though. The final fight was a little poor. I mean come on. What is so amazing about 2 little larveas spraying silk at Godzilla. Not impressive. And the little fairy chicks get annoying. Really annoying. But if you are a fan, get this one any way.Mothra starts out as an egg thingy, and when people are touring this egg, Godzilla awakes and he's mad. He storms Tokyo and Japan. The mothra awakes into 2 little worms and they spin Godzilla into this little cacoon. Too bad. I actually give this movie a 3 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEATH TO FULLSCREEN!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! \\"Godzilla VS Mothra\\" Is a great movie, it is a shame that it is presented here, with this DVD, in a full screen format. I just watched the uncut, Japanese LETTER BOX version DVD a friend loaned me, and was greatly disappointed at just how much the American full screen formatted version destroys the film.

Drama, Plot, Effects are spot on perfect. The pacing of the film is just right, action seems to proceed naturally throughout. The music for this movie is awesome. If all the Godzilla movies had been this good, I probably wouldn't have a life, because I would keep watching them over and over again. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Star Cheese","review":"This one is pretty good. The thing about Godzilla movies, everyone knows they are cheesy (even the producers) and know one cares. Mothra is pretty cool(my personal favorite Godzilla nemesis) and ya' gotta love the fairy twins singing to the egg. Keep in mind the rating is done compared to other Godzilla movies, after all Godzilla is in a realm of his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Given the DVD technology, why is this dubbed?","review":"It's wonderful that this, the best of all the Godzilla films, can be seen in its full format in the crystal imagery of DVD. But, considering the audio channel and subtitling capability of DVD, its almost unforgivable that this move has been released with only a dubbed audio channel! The dubbing for all the Godzilla films robs you of your chance to fully enjoy the performances of some of Japan's best actors (Takarada, Fujuki, Sahara, and Tazaki) and gives the film an extra level of silliness that hurts it. Come on, this is DVD! Simitar must really be a cheap company if that can't muster up the energy to provide a Japanese language track and English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing Film","review":"Other reviewers indicate the viewpoint of those familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan. I am not. I do, however, remember with pleasure the light tenor voice of Kenny Baker on the Jack Benny and (later) Fred Allen radio programs. Occasionally, any of us can see him in the Marx Brothers at the Circus, as the singing circus owner or in one of the other numerous films he made in the thirties and early forties. To my regret, I did not get to see him on Broadway with Mary Martin but being given that role indicates professional respect for his abilities. He never reached stardom but always performed well in the light roles to which he was consigned.I can commend this film to the general viewer who seeks only a pleasant hour and a half of good 1938 technicolor and a lively score well sung. All the performers handle themselves well and the Marxian (Brothers) type of plot makes for appealing nonsense.All in all, a welcome diversion from the normal mass media fare these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poorly produced: Worst quality of sound and video.","review":"If you need to throw away some money, this DVD is it. Quality of sound is horrible. Stage is a mixture of everything you can think of from all over the world, including Japan. Amazon.com needs to watch this DVD before they classify this DVD into their classical music category. I would put this one into a garbage section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite garbage but could've been much better","review":"Martyn Green was a great Savoyard whose Ko-Ko was famous and was the reason for the film. In that case, it's a shame some of Ko-Ko's best material was cut. One article I once read said that \\"I've got a little list\\" was omitted because people knew it so well. If that's true, then the producer was a major idiot. If anything, the film is worth seeing for even a bit of Green plus Kenny Baker. Baker's recordings are only of light popular music so having his bright tenor in something approaching classical is a treat. Too bad he didn't get to at least try his hand at Nemorino or Almaviva - on records."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important document of legendary performers.","review":"This Mikado was filmed with singers from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, custodians of the Gilbert & Sullivan tradition for more than a century. Two of the players in particular--Martyn Green (Ko-Ko) and Sidney Granville (Pooh-Bah) were among the most beloved G&S actors in history, and their performances here are a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostolgic but Nice","review":"I saw this movie as a young person in about 1940 and it was my first exposure to Gilbert & Sullivan. I enjoyed it so much that I have collected CD's etc. of them ever since. This is a short version of the full production with a number of the orignal songs eliminated, some important and some not. If you like Gilbert & Sullivan I recommend the D'Oyly version of the Mikado as the keeper but if you like nostolga with Kenny Baker, an early star of radio from the 30's, and some of the D'Oyly cast this is the one that I would pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tey's detection masterpiece","review":"If you want actual detection, as opposed to character studies, this is the Tey book to read. Her later books have some interest, but more as straight novels than as mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness and Coincidences","review":"As an audio book, this is a great production. As a mystery, this was a disappointment. How convenient that people stumble onto critical clues, characters and evidence. It's as if all of England were no more than four acres large. I am still wondering what the motive of the killer was; the ending was abrubt and nonsensical. Please read \\"A Daughter of Time\\" if you want to experience Tey's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testamentary Bequest","review":"There is a dead body. Where is her car? Why is she swimming alone? It seems her body is expensively cared for. A young man appears on the scene, weeping. It seems that he had taken her car.The name of the drowned woman is Christine Clay. Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard is called to the scene by a worried constabulary. The young man, Robin Stannaway or Robert Tisdall, the name had been changed to Tisdall to please a relative, stayed with Chris. She had picked him up when hitchhiking, saying that she was alone. The boy clearly has charm. Grant and others determine that it is probable murder.The book suffers from having the most likeable characters mainly off-stage or dead. In other respects, of course, it is wonderful, given that Josephine Tey was one of the best people writing in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as ever!","review":"I am happy to say that this album rocks.After seeing them live this year I knew I was in for a treat as Jaworski is a more than sufficient replacement as vocalist.He has the same power of delivery and even more depth to his voice than Grady.The album has a dark, atmospheric sound helped by producer Shaun Lopez.The heaviness does not let up throughout and every track has something good about it.Check out the synths at the end of 'Landing on Ice' they are sick. 'Helena' has a killer hook that ends without warning.ThereIrwin's riffs are still great and there is no holding back on anyones part.Show your support to a great metal band and purchase a copy, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 years in the making...","review":"I was suprised to see that Grady was no longer singer & was very interested to see how Will Haven would sound with a different singer. I wasnt sure Will Haven could pull it off. Thats not the case here. New vocalist Jeff Jaworski is a great fit & this album is one of their best. I love El Diablo & it is still my favorite. This album may be their next best & is very well produced. Every song on here is good & get better with every listen. The best metal album of the year so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"Extremely comfortable and great looking. However, the left side is more comfortable than the right.

I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair. I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.

With phrases like, \\"You wouldn't understand unless...\\" or \\"You may call it immoral, but...\\" the author consistently seperates himself from his readers. Unless one is \\"Black\\" (as opposed to \\"black\\"), Christian, fundamentalist, from the inner city, poor, male, and possessing a child in the system, it is very hard to find much to sympathize with in this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"one great pure rock British album","review":"I would say they used a lot of the same sounds on this album as they do on definitely maybe. The album sounds like a mixture of the later beatles and stones combined with a little more edge. I can't get enough of it, every song is just so pure british rock I love it. I would even rate it 5 out of 5. Even if you don't like oasis I believe you will enjoy this rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Classics","review":"Go Let It Out and Gas Panic! and anybody who has seen these live can attest that NO FUTURE does not apply to Oasis - Gem and Andy sound great - Liam and Noel forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's here not to like?","review":"I don't get the new wave of Anything-but-Oasis rock fans.

Time for this band to split up or think seriously about the music they're putting out as this album is plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...this is their worst","review":"Having been a fan of Oasis since almost literally day one (I saw them for 5 bucks at the old 9:30 Club in DC), I have followed this band VERY closely...bought all the b-sides, etc. This album is mediocre. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs that are worth listening to over and over again. It is stale, there is not much of a new direction at all except for the first (explicit) track. Buy this used, or find it as a promo, but don't drop $17. Liam sounds good, but if you're looking for more songs like \\"Wonderwall\\" or even \\"Don't Go Away\\", you won't find them here. And NOTHING here matches the brilliance of \\"Definitely Maybe\\", which is still probably their finest moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"FxxxING IN THE BUSHES","review":"It's a great Album. They improved noticeably from Be Here Now. Fxxxing in the bushes, Go let it out, put yer money..., I can see a liar, Little James, are all superb.

But thats definately not a bad thing. The whole album as per usual is influenced heavily by The Beatles, but also with a suprising amount of other groups, such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Jam. The songs are very solid, and makes for a cohesive album. Now if only this album can sell better than Be Here Now, which sold 7 MILLION COPIES, and was first met with critical acclaim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"Oasis on this one changed there sound here a bit.It actually properly there best album as a whole, of course thats not saying theres any songs that can match \\"Wonderwall\\" \\"Live forever\\" or \\"champagne supernova\\" but give it a few listens and it grows on you.Forget Heathen Chmeistry too, its far to patchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis's 4th album.","review":"Although this is another dissapointmenting album from Oasis compared with their earliear albums, its still good.The only reason why this album gets run down and \\"Be Here Now\\" is cause they are not classics.The worst moments are here to though.The lyrics are pretty terrible in \\"Little James\\" and \\"Put Yer Money Where Your Mouth is\\" and \\"I Can See A Liar\\".Best bits? \\"Go Let it Out\\" \\"Gas Panic\\" \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great oasis album.","review":"Its ovious Oasis were'nt just about singing \\"Wonderwalls\\" all the time, they were oviously also about progression, any real band is.This album is Oasis progressing and sadly their last good album.After this they released \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" tried to repeat themselves with their first two albums, and succeeded somewhat for a time, but \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" does not stand as a classic Oasis album.And funnily enough, this one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Oasis CD but great","review":"I like Stading on the Shoulder of Giants. It's the first CD with the new Oasis bandmates. It's probaly the worst of the albums that Oasis has put out. If your new to Oasis this wouldn't be the album I got first. I'd go get What's the story(Morning Glory). My favorite song on the cd is \\"Go Let it Out.\\" It's a catchy tune and will get stuck in your head. I saw them do this one in concert and Liam's vocals on it are fantastic. I like Gas Panic and did like F***in the Bushes. This CD is a must for Oasis fans, but for somebody new go get Morning Glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a regression","review":"I like most of the songs on this album and I would reccommend that any Oasis fan get's it. However it feels slightly depressing and is a definite regression on the powerful production on Be Here Now. I like all the tracks except 'I Can See A Liar' and 'Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is' - both sound idiotic to me. 'Go Let it Out' is wonderful. Oasis have lost the bright sound of earlier releases but are still great musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could have been better, but it still rocks!","review":"This album is not as good as Definitely Maybe, but this new album is their most challenging yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great cd!","review":"I had my eye on Oasis when their last album came out, but I didn't buy anything of theirs until \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.\\" My original thoughts were they were too derivative for my taste, but this cd, while borrowing from sounds of the past, have come out with a sound that is truly their own. I was smitten in one listening of one song off the radio-- \\"Go Let It Out.\\" Within 24 hours, I had the cd in my happy little hands. If you like Beatlesque clever production, psychedelic touches, attention to melody and musical craftsmanship, may I suggest Oasis' newest project."},{"rating":"2","title":"just try to be open minded","review":"Let's face it. Oasis will never be the same Oasis we know in the '90s. They are evolving, musically. Just like any other good artist is. If you expect this album to sound like \\"Definitely Maybe\\" or \\"Morning Glory?\\", don't bother buying it. But if you can put your prejudice and expectation aside, I promise you, this is an album worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"They will always amaze there fans and critics","review":"Not only is this a great rock album, but it is also one of the best cd's Oasis has ever made. Almost everysong will hook the listener in. It is a great rock album, at a time where everyone listens to nothing but teeny pop music. Thank god for Oasis, to show people what real musicians can produce and make. They are talented and no one can dispute that, and they will keep making music that inspires and entertains people. In ten years most cd's will be old and no one will listen to them, but Oasis's music will never get old. I still love their first album, and listen to it on a weekly basis. They are defenatly one of the best band of the 90's, and with this album they have moved into the new century with style and grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"remind me--why do we like oasis again?","review":"\\"be here now\\" and now this. how many more thoroughly ordinary oasis albums will we rush out and buy before we forget how good \\"morning glory\\" was? this is yet another oasis album that starts with a couple of catchy openers, then descends into samey, oasisey, beatlesy nothingness until you realize the cd stopped ten minutes ago. maybe if you don't buy this one, they'll try harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This schtick is getting tired!","review":"Well, it's bloody Oasis, innit? I'll give them points for at least playing guitar rock when the rest of the world has moved on to rap metal or teenybop, but there are only two good songs! Is this all they've come up with in the two and a half years since Be Here Now? And if ever there was a band that should NOT include their lyrics, it's these guys... I mean, Little James is cringe inducing. If you like Oasis, borrow it, tape the second and third songs, and go buy the new XTC record. The rest of these songs are rehashed, reheated stuff... the usual mid-tempo chuggers that never go anywhere, but go on way too long... sorry guys... this sounds totally bereft of inspiration..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Oasis Album","review":"I'm a big Oasis fan, but this album just falls flat. It only has ten tracks.. It opens with an instrumental (a rockin' one, at that).. and 3 of the remaining 9 songs are pretty horrible. These are \\"Little James,\\" the Doors rip off \\"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is\\" and the lame \\"I Can See A Liar (Sitting by the Fire).\\"The album has several highlights.. \\"Go Let It Out,\\" \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\" and \\"Roll It Over\\" are worth the price of admission.This album isn't much of a band effort since 40% of the group left before the recording and Noel did most of it himself. Noel sings all but one of the album's b-sides and ruins some songs like \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" and the b-side \\"Just Getting Older\\" with bombastic choir backing vocals.. He almost ruins \\"Roll It Over,\\" but pulls it off.They pick it up a bit after that.. their next album only had two bad songs.. (the last two) and then \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" was a total gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME","review":"THis band is a disgrace to rock'n roll. THeir arrogance is clearly demonstrated in this lousy album, in which they only copy their idols. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am not a fan, I don't like Oasis, I never did. They did have some good melody, now, even that is gone with the wind. The single \`Go Let It Out'is supposed to be a progressive move for them, it sounds like they have been hanging around with the Beta Band for a long time, it would be good if they had the latter's standard. Poor imitation! They are trying very hard to sound like bands like Pink Floyd or the Beta Band, not Beatles anymore? People move on? Have these people grown smarter? NO WAY!! They are still stubborn and stuck-up as ever. Feel like doing them justice now, Liam has good voice and if he wants to, he can really do some fantastic stuff like what Thom Yorke does to his voice, in a different way, of course. Back to the subject, this is a terrible album, by anybody's standard,yet it still sells better than Beta Band. Isn't it ironic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My brother hates it so I love it even more","review":"Oasis doesn't sound like the beatles which is there best trait. This album beats Morning Glory because every song puts a different feel into your head. Noel, has incredible lyrical talent which is perfect with Liam's voice. You should like every song if you like good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"noise and blather","review":"What IS this??!! Effing in the bushes is what I would expect to hear on some William S. Burroughs/rock star of the moment project...tripe! The remainder of this record is formulaic and uninspired...it's no wonder that the rest of the band abandoned this project and the band so they could salvage their dignity. It's too bad, because I used to buy anything with Oasis' name on it whether I'd heard it or not. Those days are over, just as it seems the band's are."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you people need to shut up","review":"This album is great. Just because it is not traditional oasis doesnt mean it sucks. When radiohead made Kid A people got mad, but in the long run they loved it. This cd is great. it sounds like it was made in the 60s which is good and songs like Gas Panic are instant classics. If you like Oasis and hate this album then you should not even be a fan. I love every cd the same cant wait for the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis - Still Standing High on the Shoulders of Giants","review":"Although this latest album hardly measures up to the genius of \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory),\\" it remains a testament to Oasis' prolific contribution to British pop. Not a complete listen through, however the two songs fronted by Noel, especially \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" epitomize the peak of Oasis' songwriting potential. The catchy hook and significantly deeper lyrics leave the listener wishing Noel would replace Liam's vocals in other Oasis collaborations. Although not the apotheosis of what the band could create, this album is a good listen and addition to a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants took so long coming out that I almost forgot what Oasis was, but when I bought this CD I remembered. Although there isn't too much new here it's definitly worth getting. I must admit I was little disappionted. I only like half the tracks, but the good ones are really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"oasis' time has been over for years","review":"oasis had its glory days (i.e. definitely maybe and what's the story morning glory) but now they're DEAD and GONE. it all went downhill with be here now. just because they've maintained their sound from the said previous albums (which isn't even necessarily a good thing) doesn't mean this album is good. go let it out wouldn't have even been deemed worthy of release if it had been on what's the story morning glory. now they're just a waste of airtime and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis simply rock","review":"If you truly love Oasis and if you can relate to their music, then there is no good or bad album, only slightly better ones.

There are 4 or 5 good songs (none of which are excellent) and that was not what I expected. I think the other 3 albums are great (even Be Here Now, which by the way is my favourite Oasis album) and they don't deserve to share discography with SITSOG. Hope Noel gets the message for the next time. Did you know this is the best-seller cd in the second-hand shops in London?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 3rd best Oasis CD, maybe even 2nd","review":"Wow burried in 293 reviews of Oasis' Standing CD, I'll say this is a GREAT album. Oasis had some awesome stuff, and this is among their top releases. If you have and like Morning Glory, Standing is a must have. I'd say 9 out of 10 songs are classics on here, the only bum in the lot is the stupid Little James (nobody cares about your kid Liam just stick to singing rock and roll). Some tracks are more classic than others, and the standouts are the incredible opener F'n in the Bushes, which leads into the classic-of-classics Let It Out. Gas Panic is possibly one of the coolest, most eerie tracks ever done by a rock band, and Where Did It All Go Wrong/Sunday Morning Call - that 2 track combo (it's kind of one big happy Noel fest really) - is Oasis at their finest. I also really like the Doors tribute Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is. Very good groove. Like I said, it's a 9 out of 10. A must for any Oasis fan, this is one of their peaks for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was a big fan of What's the Story... I believe it's one of one of the top three albums of the nineties. I even liked Be Here Now -- while not a musical or creative marterpiece, it had some catchy pop tunes that played well (e.g., Don't Go Away, All Around the World). Despite somehwat better reviews for SOTSHOG than BHN, I think the album sucks. It is completely devoid of creativity. Not one song jumped out at me. After a listen, I have absolutley no interest in hearing any of the songs again. They are boring! Further, Liam's vocal style is growing really tiresome. The band should dump him and let Noel take care of all lead vocal duties (the songs that he fronts on the album are at least somewhat bearable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oasis are dead.","review":"Easily the worst album (they're ONLY bad album), SOTSOG is so unbelievably disappointing that it makes Be Here Now look brilliant. For any new fans of Oasis (how can there be when this is what they put out?), go buy Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory, two of the best rock albums ever made by the former-best-band-in-the-world. Only two songs on this album truly shine and those are \\"Who Feels Love?\\" and lil' Liam's \\"Little James\\". The rest is mostly average-to-poor by Oasis' standards, ESPECIALLY \\"Gas Panic!\\", \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\" and \\"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is\\"! What happened to the band that gave us \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" and \\"Digsy's Dinner\\"? Yes, Oasis, rest in piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the ... don't work (or work too well)","review":"Just [garbage]. They fail. This was Oasis' last chance - I won't ever bother listening to their lousy records again. This is so ineffably lame, so uninspired...why did they bother?Apart from some impressive production, there's next to nothing worth listening to here. There's some half-hearted attempts to clone \\"Wonderwall\\" which leave them sounding more like Chicago than the Beatles, and then of course there's Liam's songwriting debut, a touching (read: ...) ode to his \\"Little James\\" which blatantly steals from \\"Beautiful Boy\\" - ... (...).The rest is merely prog-rock dressed up as lamb - Supertramp for the year 2000. Keep up the hype, lads, because there's plainly precious little left in the art department."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY They Can't Be CLoned","review":"Oasis has spent too Much Time trying to SOund Like The Beatles&Bits of The ROlling Stones.I have Never Gotten The Oasis thing.they Lack any Kind Of Originality.This Album Just Sounds Like Poor Left-Over Beatle Tracks that were kept in the Vaults for a Reason.In Fact i Got the Perfect Solution for Oasis:Get Puffy to Produce You SInce Both acts Just take from Original SOurces with No mind of Originality.Oasis Hasn't changed much at all and that's the Problem.they haven't been around that Long for Formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Good Songs","review":"It breaks my heart when heavyweights fail to deliver. We had pinned our hopes on Noel and Liam. Indeed, I thought they might represent the most brilliant part of the future of rock and roll. But this is their worst album, with only two good songs, Go Let It Out and Who Feels Love. It's all the more heartbreaking that these two tracks are so fine, because it suggests what Oasis might have been. Maybe if their next album is good it can salvage their place in the pantheon. But we'd been literally aching for THIS one. Their output since the magnificent What's The Story now seems to prove that they can't consistently deliver. And that's the difference between artists of historic proportions, and those who had a good album or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standing On The Shoulders of Giants","review":"A low point. Listening to this album, one can only pray they go back to drinking and drugging themselves to death - when they did they had a much better run at the compositions. You can really see they want to be the Beatles in this album... let's hope Yoko Ono will break them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just simply, a good pop CD","review":"I don't think Oasis sounds anything like the Beatles. Sure the sounds they use are similar and they're trying to recreate the fab four's broad music-scape, but Oasis has they're own writing, vocal, and attitude style. The songs on this CD are really good and they stick in your head: that is what pop music SHOULD do. That's why we're still singing all of the Beatles tunes to this day. And, I'm sure we'll be singing all of Oasis' songs tomorrow. If you like good music, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"For a band that's been away from studio releases for a few years you'd think that they could come up with some new sounding material. I think that the main review above explains it best-- while Oasis may think that they are improving on the old sounds of classic rock and are the new Beatles, the songs on this album are illustrative of those old bands low points. Stick with the first two albums, that's where Oasis actually had some clever, more original material. Of course, if you are a diehard fan, this should not disappoint you TOO much, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing On The Shoulder of Giants","review":"This latest album from Oasis definitely has it's good points. Unfortunately, at 10 tracks there isn't enough. There are very good songs on here however. Roll it Over is very \\"Champagne Supernova ish\\" while Where did it all go Wrong and Sunday Morning Call are Oasis at their best. Liam Gallagher's first song \\"Little James\\" is also very good. The album also includes a second disc with a classic Oasis B-Side called \\"Lets All make Believe\\". Length is really the only problem. It may not be anything new but why try anything different when you're doing just fine. Oasis returns to glory on this recore, definitely one to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"It's had a pretty lukewarm reception in the press, so I was surprised to find myself thinking that this was their best work yet. It's definitely a step forward from their previous work, especially the very good (if somewhat bloated) \\"Be Here Now\\". Some people are likely to be disappointed by the CD on the first listen, because its not as immediate as their previous work. Repeated listening shows this to be much more mature and intelligent, though - the songs actually say something for a change. Highlights: Gas Panic!, Sunday Morning Call and Where Did It All Go Wrong. At the end of the day, it's a great album that grows on you and it rocks, too. Buy it. Play it until it wears out. You won't regret it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm.......","review":"Everyone knows that \\"WTSMG\\" is by far the greatest Oasis album and quite frankly, as we say in dear old Blighty, this is pants. Apart from the brilliant sneeriness of \\"Go Let It Out\\" (a UK no. 1) and a couple of others, this is even more of a disappointment than BHN. Anyway, to be totally objective,I quite like BHN after 3 years so maybe SOTSOG is a grower and, well, Oasis are after all the greatest Beatles tribute band ever so I can't diss them too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats Oasis? Are You Sure?","review":"If youre really really into them and you love Oasis, then maybe you should ask someone to buy this for you as a gift. Otherwise, youll be highly upset when you buy it and actually hear what youve spent your money on. Maybe I'm just still stuck on their first two (awesome) cd's. Maybe I need to evolve, maybe this cd sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manchester Lads","review":"Well, I have to say it, the geasers from Manchester have done it again (its a little ironic to have a NYC photo on the front cover). This album is brilliant, to put it simply. Oasis with that famous Beatles touch again, but a little slower than previous album - mostly Whats the Story. Simple lyrics but musically it is excellent, possibly from the changes in the band lineup. Basically, get this if your an oasis fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible!","review":"\\"Standing On The Shoulder of Giants\\" is a truly remarkable album. Much like WTSMG it gets better with every listen. This record will only get better with time. The mid-tempoed \\"Gas Panic\\" and soaring \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\" are true high points, while \\"Roll It Over\\" proves as epic and emotional as \\"Champagne Supernova\\". This might prove to be Oasis' best record to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Oasis Album - no exageration!","review":"And songwise - well definitley not.But musically they are at their best here, there is not one pointless noisy track such as \\"hey Now!\\" or \\"Digsys Dinner\\"its pure quality all the way,a lthough \\"I Can See A Liar\\" and \\"Little James\\" could of been replaced with something a bit better - oh well there you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Oasis","review":"Oasis are a band whose goal is not to be revolutionaries or originators of new musical styles, but rather, skilled preservationists of classic rock & roll. \\"Standing On The Shoulder of Giants\\" is Oasis' latest collection of memorable songs that will have you humming the familiar tunes wherever you go during the day. Oasis have the rare and unique ability to create albums whose songs sum up every emotion you experience in your daily life. Oasis' music serves as the soundtrack to the lives of their listeners. \\"Standing\\" is one of Oasis' best recordings, ranking right up there with 1995's \\"(What's the Story)Morning Glory.\\" People who wish to judge Oasis' music by the band's personal lives or their comments in the press miss the point entirely. Oasis' music may not be revolutionary, but it's tremendously entertaining and pleasing. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get off the bandwagon.","review":"Let the Oasis bashing stop right here. This album is so much better than Be Here Now I can't even begin to describe it. I dare say it's as good as What's the Story (Morning Glory). Bold statement, I know, but I believe it. Even the b-sides to the singles are great (especially Cigarettes in Hell). So don't listen to all the fools who say they're washed up, over, finished, etc. Buy this album right now. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem for Oasis","review":"Noel does it again. Finally, after some time off, Oasis released SOTSOG. It was well worth that wait. Noel has come up with another set of classics that'll surely add more luster to the Oasis lore. The lyrics are fantastic, especially on \\"Who Feels Love?\\", \\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\", \\"Sunday Morning Call\\", and on the bonus track \\"Let's All Make Believe.\\" The music is also great, matching the mood of the lyrics. Overall, this is another job well done for the band. But I still yearn for an album that'll match \\"Defintitely Maybe\\" and \\"What's the Story? (Morning Glory)\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will grow on you....","review":"First listen I was a little dissapointed, It wasnt the exact \\"straight ahead rock\\" kind of sound that we are used to from Noel and Lliam. Several listens into it, I am starting to highly reccomend it to Oasis fans. Noel's injection of \\"electronica\\" isn't overwhelming, it is still guitar driven rock, and the drum loops really change the landscape of several of the songs in a catchy way. This record showcases Lliams best vocals yet... and although Noel takes the music in a little different direction, it still has the big-loud-audacious-in-your-face feel to it. And isnt that why we all love Oasis?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but still worth it!","review":"Well, I have just bought the cd, and may I say, it takes some getting used to. It starts off with a catchy instrumental and then takes off into the Oasis sound. I wasn't expecting what I got, but after some listening, I enjoyed it. Some people are not giving this album the credit it deserves, while I do admit, dome people give it too much. Overall, I urge you to buy this album, it is worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freedom From Fundamentalism","review":"If you enjoy being deceived then you will like this book. The existence of Mary Ann Collins is questionable. No one that I can find has ever seen or met her. She refuses to give it any information about what convent she allegedly joined.

I kid you not, I compared these two books page by page and the text on all of the current technologies is identical word for word. Sybex burned me on this book but never again. It makes me wonder if all the current Minasi books are thrown together the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie!","review":"I have always been a huge fan of both Helen Hunt and Bette Midler so I thought that a movie with them together had to be a winner. Big mistake on my part! I was and still shocked by the screenplay's continual negative reference to international adoption. The movie's dialogue has constant commentary about \\"no, I don't want a Chinese baby\\". As an adoptive parent, I am painfully aware that not everyone understands my choice or how international adoption works but I found the commentary offensive. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A punch in the stomach.","review":"Love all these actors. The story was interesting and flowing nicely. Felt a jab when Bette first said my Lord's name, but a real kick in the stomach toward the end of the movie when His name was mixed with a foul word. This should not be. I am offended.

Light mindless entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No laughs,maybe one chuckle","review":"I found this movie very sad and rather boring since I enjoy laughing.There were no laughs, even the actors had nothing to laugh about.I agree with some of the other reviews in that Bette Midler was the only spark ofentertainment in the whole movie.She was the only one worth watching.If I had the \\"zero stars\\" option, I would have clicked that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This movie was reccommended to us by a relative who enjoyed it. Throughout the whole movie, April (Hunt), just makes a bigger mess of her life. I was waiting for something signifigant to happen, something good, but it never did. The ending was nice but not well done. I cannot give it away but it skipped around a bit and ended abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad movie","review":"I think that it is very sad that Colin Firth will take up any role as long as he is paid for it. For me his 1994 movie \\"The Playmaker\\" is an example of that. Now I can add another movie \\"Then she found me\\" to this list. Dialogue is strained and not flowing too well. There is no fire between him and Helen Hunt. Even with tons of makeup on her face, she looks older than the supposed age of mid forties. If you do not believe me, look at the movie ratings, it has not been out for 2 weeks and its sales rating is above 200."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it had to get better??? Right?","review":"With Colin Firth and Bette Midler and Hunt I thought it had to at least be decent. I kept waiting for it to get better but it started in the gutter(metaphorically) and stayed there. I stayed to the end only to wish I had the time back but thought maybe it would redeem itself. I don't blame the actors completely, the writers and director seems to have beaten the life out of them and they acted just enough to get out of their contracts and hope like heck that no one ever sees this \\"film\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not romantic and not a comedy","review":"I'm not sure what to say about this movie.

The acting was superior from top to bottom, the dialog --- let me just say, nothing should be this funny and honest and sad and true, and the outcomes! This movie falls far away from the familiar, in that, just like life, you don't get what you'd hoped for, and people don't come in neat packages, but you do get all that you need. Helen Hunt, I can only pray that this will NOT be her last directorial excursion. Well done"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painstakingly boring.","review":"There are many movies that don't get made for a long time because people are afraid to take a financial risk on something different. There are other movies that maybe just shouldn't be made. This is the latter. I can't give it one star because it was well acted. The few people who recognize this title probably sought it out and are into a very niche sort of veiwer. They will like this because it is what it is. A bad Lifetime movie sort of offering but well acted and filmed. This movie just isn't compelling or funny or other. If Helen and the artists involved made it out of their own pocket and produced it as a labor of love, more power to them. They created what they were after and it is a work they can appreciate themselves. It doesn't matter what the world thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch if bored","review":"Story about a woman who was adopted at an infant age.

I found the movie choppy, unbelievable and poorly written/produced. Helen Hunt appears much older than age 39 and malnourished, but even that would have been tolerable if her character was truly believable and, in my opinion, authentically Jewish. I've enjoyed the actors in previous movies, but this movie, Then She Found Me, seemed to be thrown together without being constructively reviewed or edited. For me, it was excruciating to watch because I hoped at any moment there would be chemistry between the characters and a well produced movie. There were a few touching parts of this movie toward the very end, but those were overshadowed by the lack of consistency throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Family story","review":"We had never heard of this movie byt because of the stars we watched it.

Such a disappointing movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"In reality my review reflects more on Helen Hunt's appearance than the movie itself. It is difficult to evaluate and appreciate the movie when you are bogged down by the appearance of one of the actors. Hunt has aged considerably and quickly and additionally looks oddly thin. I am all for an aging actress landing a role and doing so without Botox and other wonders of modern medicine, however, casting such an actress appropriately is essential to the flow of a film. In this movie, Hunt plays a 38 year old, while in reality she was 43, and looks beyond her 43 years. It is not a good casting decision. Unfortunately, Hunt directs and obviously made a poor decision here. Normally, I would hate to criticize appearances, but when casting someone to play a character a few years younger, the actress needs to convincingly convey a younger look. The opposite happened here, with a character that looks ten years older than she is portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stinker","review":"As a Massive Bette Midler fan and quite fond of Helen Hunt - This Movie is a Stinker...Boring to boot, no excitement , very little emotion...Hads i seen this at the cinema i would want a refund...I love you Bette however this was another bad choice of movie role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets a No Stars Rating!!!","review":"PLEASE- DON'T let this whiny, selfish, humorless- and *always* scowling Helen Hunt- centered piece of garbage put you off reading Eleanor Lipman's sweet, gentle, humorous novel.This DRECK only resembles the book in title and that a few of the characters bear the same name as in the book.

No emotion or relaity in it at all.Helen Hunt walks around looking like a total hag with a wrinkled brow (she looks well over 50 when she is supposed to be playing a 39 year old. And skinny! What happened to her?) I did not like her character at all. AT ALL!!There is no chemistry between her character and Colin Firth's .. It's ridiculous. And I hated the way she treated her birth mother.Can you tell me ONE possible motive for someone to lie about being someone's mother??

She looks like she's aged 30 years since that sitcom. Maybe she was abducted by aliens and drained of all fluids. To make matters worse, just when you figure out that there's nothing wrong with the TV or your eyes, they make an issue out of her turning 39 when she looks like she's 59.

And in general why is the Helen Hunt character so unlikeable and yet is so loved by her mother, bio-mother, brother and two men? There is nothing to make all those people want to be with her.

Stinkeroo!","review":"Helen Hunt plays a newly married 39-year old woman whose biological clock is ticking. Her callow hubby, played by Matthew Broderick, dumps her and she soon thereafter takes up with the father (Colin Firth) of one of her preschool students. Right!The cast is strong but cannot carry this weak plot. The characters are two-dimensional and formulaic. There wasn't a single one I cared for. At times, Helen Hunt sounds like she is literally reading her lines. The pacing is slow as a tortoise.I wish she hadn't found me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Then She Found Me - touching and funny","review":"Bette Midler's performance made this movie. Great cast.

I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime. If I had paid for it, I would be annoyed more than I already am for wasting one hour on this film. Admittedly, this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched the whole film and now I wonder why I did","review":"I kept waiting to care about the characters in this film but, after wasting the nearly 2 hours it took to get to the end of the story, I found that NONE of the characters had a single redeeming or likable quality and I couldn't have cared less about how any of them ended up.I'll admit that I've never much liked Helen Hunt as an actor but, since I do (usually) like the other leading actors, I didn't but should have followed my better instincts to just shut the film off.What this film shows are 4 different examples of totally messed up adults that never managed to mature. The ONLY \\"grown up\\" decision was made by one of the characters at the age of 15. Beyond that, nothing but emotional cripples. Sound like your cup of tea? It sure doesn't come close to mine!I'd recommend you pass on this one.(2 STARS instead of 1 simply because I like watching a couple of the actors. Probably should have given it only 1 STAR.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed it","review":"Helen Hunt did a good job directing and acting in this movie about second chances. The romantic chemistry worked very believably for me, while it moved a bit fast. Ms. Hunt's unglossed appearance added at times to the emotional rollar coaster she was riding.

It's also a total waste of Colin Firth's talent. Ms. Hunt looks terrible in this film and I am not sure if that is the way her character is supposed to look. Even with a little bit of make-up on, she looks very tired. The dialogue is snappy and at times funny and that is partly due to Bette Midler's comedic talents. Both, she and Colin Firth, save the film in some of the scenes. Matthew Broderick looks like he is being forced to act. The story and how it evolves is choppy at best and does not have a consistency to it that could have saved the film on some level. Helen Hunt is a terrific actress and should stick to acting because directing and acting at the same is distracting.

Unfortunately, the movie comes across as stilted, unrealistic and a downer. Helen Hunt, who I love, gives a grimacing, frowning performance, sans makeup. She looks tired and like she doesn't want to be in the movie. Although she has awful things happen to her, like her husband leaving,she has sex with him in a car with the door open on a public street. What? And why Colin Firth would want to be with her is a mystery.This movie is a prime example of why some actors should not be directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horrrible Horrrrrrrible Movie","review":"This is a horrible movie. Don't watch it. It's boring and the acting is awful. You think it's going somewhere and then it leads you to a brickwall where you ask yourself \\"Why did I watch this movie?\\" The movie is slow, the lighting, sets, and writing are bad. The acting is just horrible. I really feel like the director failed these actors. These actors are great, just not in this movie. Also, the main character sucks, she really deserves a horrible life because she expects nothing from her life. She does nothing to make herself move forward in a positive way. Hey if you want to watch a movie about people who are negative and get themselves stuck in a hole, a boring, why watch this movie, hole? Go ahead and waste an hour and 41 minutes with this movie. It will make you want to blow your brains out due to the fact that anyone watching this movie could have written a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for free, a lame movie","review":"I watched this movie for free thru Amazon Prime. Helen Hunt - love her. Bette Midler - great. Matthew Broderick and Colin Firth - good actors. But the movie itself was just lame.

I don't recommend... even for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Helen Hunt looked awful - did not look age of \\"39 and a half years\\" as her character is supposed to be. Her acting was flat. Too many unconnected and weird things, too unrealistic, parts too over the top, others too flat. Watched the whole movie but it ended abuptly, seemed an odd finish. Not worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Half way through watching this I realized I had already seen it a few years ago, but it was so unremarkable I had forgotten all about it. Helen Hunt's character just has nothing going for her. She's cold and unappealing; her angst is uninteresting and seems self-centered. One wonders what the Colin Firth character (why there are 2 starts isatead of 1) sees in her.

It covers a lot of topics but most of them in a superficial manner. For problems I came across and turned to this book, I had in most cases, not been able to find the answers.

It was apparent to this reader that she started with strong feminist and socialist tendencies which caused the conclusions to be less than candid.Expect a book that starts with preconcieved notions that socialism is a very good thing and that without Castro's revolution there would have been no progress in Cuba in the last thirty years.Overall a very dry boring work that was difficult to follow. Many of her conclusions will ring very false with anyone who has visited Cuba in the last eight years or has the ability to form objective opinions of the state of the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately misunderstood by most","review":"If only people actually listen to the lyrics, and see George Michael's comments on his official web site, this song will be more appreciated. Many people just rush into the judgment. Rare for George Michael to make such an obvious political song, so I was very intrigued. He also continues to produce cross over between funk and disco, almost remind you of Prince. If you liked early George Michael songs, you will appreciate this song. I don't really care for remixes, but the video is worth it. I can't wait for his new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Naughton's, Alfie.","review":"I have read the book by Bill Naughton and seen both of the films and i think they are all very good. I thought the recent film starring Jude Law was unfairly criticised. Alfie is the story of a young womaniser who always thinks he has the best end of the deal, concerning his relationships with women. He loves his life, and he appears very happy and content. But what becomes apparent is that Alfie is quite a tragic and lonely character. He sums up the whole story himself when he says \\"without peace of mind, you have nothing, and i haven't\\" I think the story is really good, on the surface it appears this is just a story of a womaniser but as you read on you realize there is much more to it than it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alfie Waste of time and paper","review":"The nicest thing that I can say about this book is that it is a quick read. The main character, Alfie is a womanizing, abusive, egotistical,despisable man. He is every man you warn the women you love to stay away from. He hurts the married women that he dates (okay, they are cheating, so they deserve it)but he hurts innocents (Annie)too. None of the charcters are likeable - the woman are either stupid, cheaters, or weak. I found the book to be shallow and am very glad to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A transitional book","review":"While this book is not a bad read, it simplly serves as a transition for the series, and not a pivotal one. The relationship between Toby and Alexandra is deepened. Henry Blake's problems with his German nemesis and the new King of Spain are continued. Also, the debut of Cindy Holt's skills as an artist are begun. But really, this is a fairly easy book to skip if one is trying to read the whole series. Still, if you find it, buy it and read it.

But with her lucid, fast-paced array of voices, Ali Smith has done something very few peers are managing these days, cast a vivid new world with crisp, strong characters. While I can agree at some points the pool seemed to be growing shallower (the gimmicky use of '&', {can somebody help me recall the name of that symbol?} and the occasional moral lesson shouted and waved) I was hooked right through to the very end.If you tried Kerouac once and put him down forever, dont go near this book.

Or even an average book. Hotel World was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2001. I find that very scary. This to me is a pretentious, try-hard attempt at fiction. There are five separate, tenously connected narratives written in various first-person styles. Not a bad premise, but Smith manages to leave it dead in the water. The only really interesting section is from the perspective of a dead character. There are a few interesting snippets, but they are mired in boring dross about characters that i couldn't manage to care about - i kept waiting for a character to grab me - and they didn't.

His narration is flat and uninteresting and his timing does not match the visuals. The script and music are the same as the original BBC programme.I'm British living in America and I have found this weird anomaly of voice swap quite a bit with documentaries - overdubbing Oprah Winfrey for Sir David Attenborough in another BBC HD programme and so on. Why, I will never know. I simply find it annoying. And with the ludicrous Blu-ray Region locking (and incompatible 1080i/50hz), I can't just buy the BBC originals from England and play them in America.Oh well... more money wasted.Don't buy if you are expecting Sir David, otherwise it's worth a look for the outstanding BBC cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.

This doesn't make it unreadable, but they obviously didn't proof-read it after they scanned it, and did only minimal QA on the ebook conversion.

I've read through all of them again, and now I see why I stopped.This book is almost, considering the last book and the constant references to the ancient prophecies of the Dragon, almost completely pointless. It has no purpose, nothing happens, nothing is really resolved. I can see Jordan sweating, trying to squeeze out another book in this already bloated series for the money.The last conflict in the story is pretty cool, but it takes about 400 pages of prolix, incredibly irritating \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" lolly-gagging to get there.If you want a better series, read Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.

My journey to Tarmon Gai'don is over, having never reached the end. Ah, you say, it is not the end, but the journey that matters.

Alas, then there was book 6. This book was a warning sign of a very bad thing to come: a completely wasted epic story.Why wasted? Because it is overly elaborated in an additional 8 books full with more useless details than anything in this world. And it still hasn't come to an end!

All of his female characters are ambitious, arrogant, self absorbed, petulant, demanding, ungrateful, manipulative, and chauvinistic toward men.I would have long ago taken any one of his female characters across my knee and given a good spaking if I were any of the male characters because they act just like immature children. I certainly would not cow to them the way the men do, or stand for being bullied, criticized and belittled. I wouldn't fight back, I'd simply treat them as the obstacles they so often are and ignore them as if they weren't there and do whatever the hell I want to do anyway.These women do not add to or enhance or even support anyone in what must be accomplished.

I bought the first six ... now I think I'll just sit down and skim them over a few hours. The series looks to go for another five or six books....

By the time book 6 comes along, the characters have nearly become unbearable, and the plot has dissolved into people winking around from place to place with none of the excitement of the journeys found in previous books.

The first 3 or so books were good reads, and I had made it through the fifth (I think) in about two weeks when I discovered something. This author is continuing to write books for money, and will drag this series along until he has wrung every last nickel out of it.

I hate to say it, because I pride myself on perserverance in these long books, but damn I cringed every time he repeated a phrase...not to mention, he used the same sentance over and over.If Nynavene \\"tugs her braid\\" again or of Elayne \\"sniff's loudly\\"...I will be too young.If you like the idea, but want action...get Goodkinds \\"Sword Of Truth\\" series....much more readable..and not so plodding."},{"rating":"1","title":"his worst","review":"Am I the only one who thinks Jordan hates women? Why are all his female characters so manipulative, competative, and controlling? His books tend to start by re-intoducing the characters (since you may not have seen them in 1000 pages), setting up things tediously for 500 pages, then concluding in an exciting finale that somehow makes you ready to trudge through the next one. For a lovely reduction of the plot (which is pretty cool) and better writing, see the myriad of Wheel of Time fan-webpages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this a try","review":"Two things keep popping up in every negative review of any of the books in this series. One, everyone seems to think the books are too long, and for seemingly no purpose. Of course, Tolstoy makes Jordan look like a captionist for the New York Times, so remember, it could be worse. Two, everyone hates Jordan's women, especially Nynaeve. I can sympathize. So why not skip the female-bonding chapters? I have for the last three or so books and have discovered it's a much better read, and on top of that, I've discovered that it seems that what the women do (which really only amounts to whining about or bullying the men, anyway) is ultimately unessential to the plot. You will feel guilty the first few times you do this, but believe me, you'll be better off for it. And all those wonderful reviews! Sheesh! I can't imagine what they'd consider to be rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This review is for the casual fantasy novel reader, not teenage/young adult fanatics of the series.Okay, for all of you that have made it through the first five books and are wondering whether or not to continue, don't. The first four books are pretty solid work, well-developed and fun to read, if not a little long (where is his editor I wonder). But beginning in book 5 everything starts to slow way down. Book 6 is 900 pages and nothing happens. Even worse, the two stated goals at the beginning are not met by the end and it takes the author 100 pages in book seven to wrap things up. Finally, the characters are becoming less and less likeable in each novel, which makes you wonder what's the point?My advice is to read something by David Eddings or Terry Brooks, the true leaders in this field."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best yet!","review":"Jordan has now said that the series is going to go past 10 books and I am overjoyed! Read this book! It is a really great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, surprising","review":"This book was frustrating in that no problems that the characters faced in the beginning were solved. But many surprises delighted and amazed me as the reader and I know that Robert Jordan is just biding his time with the major plot, and that it will develop. I don't know how anyone who started this series wouldn't be able to finish it. Also i would like to add that my rating of this book is relative and that compared to any other fantasy book I've ever read it was 10x better. The whole series just blows all competition out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Jordan-Genius Writer and Smart Marketing Cookie too.","review":"I love this series. I agree with all the positive commentsand the negative ones relating to the length of the series.I thought that A Crown of Swords was the end but it isn't.I'm really ready for Rand and all the rest to resolve the many subplots and stop the insanity! They deserve a rest.

Action and suspense with emotional drama. Faster pace by all players. drew me to next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many directions","review":"The book is unreadable for someone unfamiliar with the series. Even in an intricate series each books need to have the ability to stand alone, this one does not. It's like reading a never ending soap opera, of the daytime variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, but the series goes on and on and on and..","review":"I love this series when I started it, but there is no end to it. Characters who died are resurrected two books later, subplots you are deeply involved in achieve no resolution in the currant book, are hardly mentioned in the next and not resolved until the third in line- by which time you hope the good guys die horrible deaths :) Jordan is one heck of a writer- but he abusing his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real page turner. I hope I live to read the final book .","review":"This book answers a few questions and begins to set the major players in place for the final battle. There is: a new Amerline seat, the three Women will share the Dragon Reborn are named. Elanine, Matt, Nynaeve search for a magic item in a city where looks can get you killed"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the series!","review":"So books 1 3 6 & 9 are the best in my opinion, but the best of the best have to be 6 and 9. This book has non stop action as opposed to book 5, where there is barely any action and mostly women bickering about clothing. There are major plot twists in this book that take you by supprise, and if you have read books 1-5 previous to reading this book, they will most likely make you jump for joy. At times it can be long winded and a bit boring, but they are few, short, and far between. So ignore what you hear from everyone about Robert Jordan being evil for writing his seiries so long... that's what makes it so great. I suggest you start from the first book if you are new to the series and no matter what do not give up on the 5th book. Don't worry about how long the books are... i got so involved in the first 3 books that i read all three in about 3 weeks. Size doesn't matter.... or atleast in books. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet.","review":"This is the best of the series yet, accept for book 2. It'sabout time, the gruby white cloak finally gets what he deserves. ifany one gives it less than 3 stars then they have no idea what a goodfantasy book is.

Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheel of time series, by Robert Jordan","review":"Excellent book series, don't get involved if you dont want to read a long story. like 14 books long. if you enjoy reading fantasy novels this is one of the best. it is a legendary story equal to the writings of Tolkien, better than any other modern fantasy novelist currently in writting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The book has some good stuff, but the majority is rand going back and forth. I'm pretty far, but it will take a lot of will-power to get myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Jordan-King of Fantasy!","review":"I am thoroughly impressed by the Wheel of Time series that Robert Jordan has written. His characters are round and full, his plot is thick and covers thousands of years of events. He conclusively proves his story with events in history. He makes it clear that what is happening to Rand, Mat, and Perrin has happened hundreds of time over and will always continue to happen is their reality. I wish this series would cover twenty books because I can't get enough. I wanted to scream when I finished the fourth book and didn't have the fifth book to read. And curse Amazon for not making it easier to ship books to APOs from their online order form. Robert Jordan is truly a master!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok Book With One of the Best Endings","review":"This book is ok. It's long and drawn out and doesn't get very far into the story but the ending makes up for a good deal of it. There are also more main characters for you to keep up with so remeber names. Yes it is neccasary to read for Wheel of Time fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop reading series after book 3","review":"This series stopped being good after book 3. Jordan is really stretching this series out. The action is severely slowing. There charcters are becoming cookie cutter an uninteresting. Jordan is wasting about half of the book on regurgitating things you have read before and the other 50% is wasted in overly detailed descriptions of what characters look like, clothing items, and how they they see another character.Jordan dropped the ball on this series and it should have ended in 3 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book","review":"People complain that this series and in particular the last couple of books have been stretched out and nothing happens but they're still great reading. The storyline doesn't develop a great deal in this particular book but that doesn't matter because it is so absolutely addictive and if it did, the end of a great series would draw nearer. While we want to know what happens, we don't want the series to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertaining series","review":"Great series if you like the genre. The new writer for books 13 and beyond is very good. RIP Mr. Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I have been a huge Robert Jordan fan since the beginning of the Wheel of Time books. I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed reading and now re-reading this series. I'm very saddened that we lost Mr. Jordan. His genius will be sorely missed. Keep reading the series, my friends, it's worth it!!!Book 6 is the first ebook version of the series I have read. I'm not real happy with the Kindle version of this book however. There are a HUGE number of typos and punctuation errors in it. I compared ebook six to the hardback book and the typos are not in the hardback version. Very poor proofreading there. Oh well, everyone makes mistakes. Hopefully, this will not be the trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book. need patience.","review":"I am in the process of re-reading this series as we get closer to closure with the final book coming somewhat soon. This is definitely a series of books that keep you coming back for more even though I sometimes ask myself why. Please know that there are parts that I've felt like I've read twenty times and these issues have been discussed in several reviews. I also find myself enjoying and hating certain characters based on their behavior. I love Matt but wouldn't mind if Nyveane and Faile took a long walk in the Waste. In the end, its a great story written in great detail. Its worth a few slow parts for the action that always ends up coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Jordan","review":"Lord of Chaos might very well be the summit of Jordan's wonderful WoT series. The next couple of books after this sort of trail off, don't hold the reader as well as the books up to this do. That being said, you can't help but read his books. Not for nothing is Jordan the reigning king (along w/Martin) of fantasy epics.I'm aware that there are many who critisize the series for its sometimes heavy-handed messages and dozen or so cast of major characters (my fav is Mat). My response to these nay-sayers; try to find someone who has written as much as well as he has, in the time that he has done it. It will be a very short list.Jordan's great, the series (while very long) is great, and Lord of Chaos is also great. (wait 'till the end, it is spectacular)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why read a book that does not move the plot along?","review":"I have been very pleased with this series up until this point. The plot has moved well, and all of the characters have been interesting.After the sixth book I expected to see a little closure on some of the issues facing Rand and other characters in this series, but instead I find that the plot of the story has only moved an inch, out of the mile that it still has to go and the mile that it has already gone. How can you, an author, expect to retain readers when you do not continue a story's plot? The only thing this book did was relocate the characters. The personalities stayed the same, and all of the problems that were there at the beginning of the book are still there at the end.Needless to say, I will never buy another book in this series again, since this one was frustrating and a waste of time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"and we just kept walking... and walking... and walking....","review":"I liked this book alot. Thats the long and the short of it. It had its slow moments, it isnt a page flipper like eye of the world was, but i greatly enjoyed it. The ending rocked... Anyway, some people think this series is getting too drawn out. I dont think so at all. Its great writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of chaos","review":"one word I would use to describe this book:awesome. The plot subtleties will keep you on your toes and the grand and gritty battle scenes will have you gasping for air. The 6th book in The Wheel of Time series will not disapoint. The schemings of the dread Forsaken will make you think and the triumphs of Rand and company will excite you. Hardcore Wheel of Timers will love this epic.

I didn't read any of the reviews since I knew I wanted Hopkins products for my tow vehicle. This kit already includes the bracket with it. I too won't be returning the >$5 bracket since shipping alone will be about that much, but that is not Hoppy's fault. This is a slam dunk for trailer hookup. No more need to carry the 7 pole to 4 flat adapter (greasy item rolling around in glove box). The holes in the included mounting bracket matched up perfectly to the pre-drilled holes in the Reese hitch I purchased at the same time.

It is the most unique and intellectually stimulating book I have encountered in all my history of reading. The way Kundera weaves so many seperate stories, anecdotes and historical facts along with some pretty heavy philosophical theory into the novel to make his views come alive is amazing. The section Litost (about the poets) was mesmerizing. This book has changed my view on life, love, laughter and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not laughing as I try to forget this one","review":"I was assigned this book by my monthly book club. I had great difficulty getting into the first chapter but forced myself to keep going. Many books start slow , then get better. By the end of the chapter I was doubtful but liked it a little better. I decided to read on. The second chapter had nothing to do with the first. It was like an entirely different story. It was equally difficult to read. The book took a turn at this point and started to become very dirty indeed. I threw the book away wih no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"intelectual and sexual arousal","review":"I see Kundera as a chintesence of the senses, here and ther weighing more or less on a particular one.

Indeed, I think it's stronger than the more famous _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful vignettes","review":"Another classic by Milan Kundera. Though this complete text did not resonate with me as The Unbearable Lightness of Being did, it contains a chapter/short story title \\"The Hitchhiking Game\\" that is the reason i picked up this book. When words on a page can bring you powerful reactions and emotions, there is something to be respected. See what this story does for you.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Kundera's best","review":"One of the things that is interesting about Kundera's works is how he often ties different stories and different narrators in together, and combines stories that flow in and out in different directions (like Unbearable Lightness, perhaps his most famous, which combines two couples). This book has many stories which flow together with varied narration, and in a few of them, the narrator rises out of the page to tell his own stories. Kundera is undoubtedly a post-modernist, but there is something fascinatingly easy to read about all of his stories. It's clear from reading this how he loves and obsesses about his characters. This book is a fantastic read that really makes you think a lot about the relations between men and women, and also about life in a (former) Soviet controlled country. I think in America we feel very removed from what went on in Eastern Europe, but much of Kundera's writing based on the horrors he experienced bring you in touch with that world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable family story","review":"I became interested in purchasing this because I discovered that it was a prequel to a Horton Foote story that I owned on VHS, \\"1918\\".

It wasn't boring like the romances that your mama used to read, but it wasn't tacky like the stuff your teenaged daughter might be interested in reading. I loved the fact that it wasn't about sex...but about genuine love and friendship which is something that a lot of relationship books don't have. I won't give away any of the story, but it was just a wonderful novel that I loved from start to finish. Hope to see a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Love and Grace","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was one of the best romance novels I have read. Everythng just tied together so well.

Not since Victoria Murray have I read a more refreshing story of love seasoned with wholesome values that left me with an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction. It's a wonderful emotional experience to actually feel that a story has met every single need and expectation that you would have desired it to. For Love And Grace is one of those stories. It's more than just a good story. It's so well-written that I felt like I knew the characters and I could feel what they were feeling throughout the novel. I honestly hated for this one to end and I've started reading it for a second time. It's not often that you pick up a novel that portrays positive Black male role models who make you just want to get on your knees and ask God \\"Where's mine?\\", but Greg, in this book did that for me. Even Derrick, in his imperfections was decent and loved his family dearly. I really, really hope to see more work from this author. She certainly has a fan in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mexicali Recipes","review":"I was expecting the border town of Mexacali food. It is anything but.

If I move the trash can, or if someone accidentally bumps it, the door becomes dislodged, and the batteries shift, losing their contact points. As a result, the can is no longer a \\"touchless\\" one. There is no damage to the door--it's just a defect in the engineering and production. There's no way to exchange it, as the postage to return it would cost too much. I've resorted to taping not only the door, but also the batteries. It is an annoying workaround. For this reason, I cannot recommend paying the price for this can unless you buy it locally and return it if yours, too, is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Battery Holder","review":"Wow, at least your can came with a battery holder.

It covers all the packages and classes of Java 2. It's style is very similiar to Java in a Nutshell. The search works by allowing you to type in the name of any class, method, or field. The CD-ROM will take you directly to the page covering that topic or give you a list of topics if there is more than one.This CD-ROM's major competitor is the Java Almanac. I prefer the almanac because it is paper.The CD-ROM has a nice browsing system, but given the fact that it does not have class/method descriptions, I think I will typically use the free HTML help that comes with JDK over this CD-ROM. The only time I envision using this CD-ROM is when I am working with a non-core API."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good reference","review":"If you are in need of a good reference, do not buy this one. It contains a book (~50 pages) and a CD-ROM. The book contains no details at all. Just an overciew of Java2 news. You can download this info. from sun for free. The CD contains a searchable API reference. The organisation and the presentation of the information is really poor. All the helping comments are taken away. You just see the method name and what they return. I was hoping to get a good on-line ref. but THIS IS NOT IT. I recomend the on-line help that comes with IBM Visual Age for Java. The hole product costs under 100 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD-Rom","review":"This \\"Reference\\" consists only of a CD-Rom with 130 MB and a very small booklet which concentrates on how to use the CD. The online reference on the CD claims to be a complete listing of all Java Classes and Packages, but without any example it's not as valueable as expected. Unfortunatly the surely required copy-protection causes a denial of service, when you try to copy all the files to your harddrive. This is a certain drawback, when you want the reference to be quickly available.

I already had our SBS up and running (and even if I didn't, I don't think this book would have helped too much). The book goes on and on about the features of Small Business Server and how easy it is for the administrator to set up and maintain (the book does this for at least a hundred pages). I believe knowing about all of the features are important, but the book lacks in not showing the reader how to troubleshoot and inplement most of them. Some of the features that I was trying to implement were advanced but not out of the ordinary. This book didn't halp me at all.I have read many text books in my days. I felt that this book was the worst purchase I have made in a long time.

As an experienced C++ programmer, but a newcomer to ATL, I looked for a single source of information on the hows and whys of ATL. There are many good books out there, but each seems to fill a niche. But with this book I found, in one place, answers to all the questions I've been wrestling with for months now. Besides covering ATL, it contains a wealth of tips and tidbits that you'll likely run across during coding and testing that arent covered anywhere else. This fact alone justifies buying the book. I'm resigned that one book cant cover everything a programmer may need to know about ATL, but after digesting this one I'm confident that I'll be able to digest the others as well. I paid list price for this one, but I dont regret it. Neither will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for something better","review":"I only wish there was a 0 star rating.

This spends most of its time explains in detail how COM does this etc and why, but never how to use ATL on the outside. I found trying to use this book to write a simple project painfull and confusing. Internals it might have but as a explation of how to use ATL forget it. Its internals information is not even that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This is a great book if you are already intimately familiar with COM.

I realize this wasn't supposed to a literal biopic, but the writer could have at least tried for a story. It was all random scenes I couldn't follow. As for the love triangle, it all went by so fast I wasn't even aware of when it started and ended.

I sent back all four wires to Nology for them to check out. They sent them back with the explanation that a metal connector was loose. I put the wires back on my car and they worked great,....for about two weeks. At a cost of $50 per wire I expected more. I have never had any spark plug wire fail except for Nology.

The ink cartridge is a multi purpose cartridge and it is so small that there is no way it could last for long without have to replace.

Sadly, I've never been so unhappy with anything as I am with this mini260 printer. After less than six months, of light to medium use, the printer seems to be worn out. I am faced with either replacing the print head (which Canon happily tells me may not solve the problem), or replacing the printer completely. Further, I have found that the ink cartridges are nearly impossible to find locally (so I order them from amazon), the paper is very expensive locally, and the printer is picky about using only Canon paper. Other papers give very poor print results. The user interface is very 'clicky', and I'm not impressed with the feel of the printer - it's very lightweight and fragile-feeling. Before I purchased this canon printer, I used an HP photoprinter (one of the first) for YEARS and was very happy. Guess what I am about to do now ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy for small projects...","review":"For a first timer on photo printer, I was quite proud of myself for putting it togeter out of the box.

Overall, it is easy to use for basic 4x6 prints, printing from memory card or from camera. Unfortunately it does not print from computer and cannot print other sizes.

Everything from $20/night cabins in Volcanos National Park to $400+/night super-luxury resorts are covered in its many pages.A word of caution, though. If you are interested in a guide book to aid in finding a resort to escape to for your vacation, \\"Hawaii Handbook\\" may have too much information for you.

This is a flaw that is recognizable in different cults. But, if you lay out everything exactly as it is, it is much more difficult to deny that there is something of value in the testimony of the ones who were successful in living for Christ.

Even though I'm not a very religious person I still enjoy this book and recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"religious connotations","review":"I bought this book for my 1 year old daughter because we love our Margaret Wise Brown books: Goodnight Moon, The Big Red Barn, and Runaway Bunny. I found the style of this one to be very different and was upset by the last page, which is obviously a Christian prayer. If you are Christian then this might be fine, perhaps ideal, but we do not practice religion in our home so I was a bit put off. I'm a little sensitive about this subject though so take it for what it's worth. Not as good as her other books IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delgihtful Book!","review":"Delightful book!

It's a bit strange that there are NO instructions as to how to actually do the lessons (i.e. are we supposed to repeat once and then say it with the Italian person?). I would have appreciated one piece of paper with basic instructions. Also it's hard to learn the language without seeing it in writing (what will I do when I see it written in Italy?) but overall, the Italian speaker is very clear and speaks at a slow pace, and the English speaker sounds like he's a computer talking, but I think it's a good course. I'm going to complement it with the \\"Italian for Dummies\\" book to help me along. It's difficult to drive in LA while learning a language (or maybe the other way around). I like it though. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Effective","review":"A big 'two thumbs up' for this unique interview question-answer style teaching method.The native Italian speaker's voice is excellent and is a big plus.An even bigger plus is the easy-to-learn method that gets you speaking your own mind in Italian and not someone else's.Makes learning to speak Italian easy and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many fake reviews","review":"These five star reviews all read like they were written by the same person.

The CD tracks do not go forward or back... so you might have advanced to the next track, but when you stop the CD it goes back to the beginning of track 1. This is a course meant to be used \\"behind the wheel\\" of a car... how can you you safely drive a car as you are fast forwarding, which takes forever if you want to advance much beyond the first track. So really, you never get beyond the letters, or the first few words. Believe me, I ordered Berlitz and that is the way to go.

One of the \\"good\\" discs had 54 seconds of dead air space at the beginning of the disc. A good portion of the discs (too much actually) concentrates on counting. Many references are out of date and irrelevant (how you convert from Francs to Lira? who cares, - there are no more Francs or lira....) Mr. Frobose discusses a few examples of words that have similar roots and sounds in Italian and English as a way to accelerate the learning of many words. However after this brief mention, he never expands on this idea. If he had given the listener a bunch of these words, he may have hit on a theme for a set of discs that satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Like the Plaque","review":"This course arrived with a xeroxed cover.

A small name in the foreign language business comes up with the best method and course. From beginning to end, this course, in an interested way, takes you from zip to conversational in Italian without having to guess. Everything is included on the CDs which makes this perfect for the car or gym. The English speaker gives you the English once, and Anna (the native Italian speaker) gives you the Italian twice. Most important of all, this unique approach to language learning gets you speaking your own original sentences so that you can really speak the language, not just parrot a bunch of incomprehensible jibberish.Congratulations to Language Dynamics, the small company, for having the creativity and innovation to make the best basic Italian language course on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I first bought this when Robert J.

This author's remarkable talent for writing has been violated by an obvious lack of proofreading by whoever put out this edition. I am 30% of the way through the novel, which I own in hardcover and read years ago, and I have found page after page of examples of missing punctuation, misspelled words (leaving a reader to guess what that word might be) and lack of capital letters where needed--just silly, annoying little mistakes that interrupt the flow of the actual work of the author.Really, it's just a shame. Perhaps it won't bother other readers, but as someone who knows this author and appreciates her work, it is annoying and the responsible parties should be embarrassed.

If you'rea big Keith Emerson fan there's something here, and likewise if you're a big Greg Lake fan there's something here as well. Palmer as usual does his own thing like no other drummer can.

Greg Lake's once awesomely beautiful and powerful voice is a ruin. It's shot; it's gone. The amazing classically-inspired construction of their earlier songs is gone, too. Instead we get horrible, cheesy MOR ballads. They can still play, but music this ordinary isn't worth playing. This isn't ELP; this is a ghastly OAP stage band, three guys who happen to have the same names. The real ELP died no later than the much (and on the whole justly) maligned \\"Love Beach\\".

Jodi Picoult's imagery that she has created in this novel is absolutely amazing. It makes feel like you know Faith and her family. Faith trys to convince everyone around her that she really is talking to God. She keeps her composure while dealing with her mom's depression after catching her husband in the act of an affair for the second time.

Keeping Faith is a highly readable, thought provoking look at religious dogma, family secrets and modern relationships. What would you choose to believe if confronted with the unexplainable? Can true religious miracles exist in this age of doubt? Picoult does not try to steer us in any one direction, just poses the questions and provides the fodder for thought and discussion. For that she gets 4.5 stars. My only negative comment pertains to the point of view, which jumps between a third person and first person narrative. I often found it confusing and rather offputting and would have preferred a consistent type of narration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible read","review":"Picoult has done it again!

Faith becomes a religious icon to some, a pawn in her mother's tactics to others, and plain fraud to the rest.As this story unfolds, I had a sure idea of what was to be found. But as chapters were read, I started to second guess myself. What really was happening?

Her writing style is perfect! I'm afraid I'll buzz through all of her books and won't have anything left to read!! I just found her books a couple of months ago and have already read 4 of them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Picoult's Best","review":"I'll start this review by saying, like many other reviewers, I am a big Jodi Picoult fan. I have read about 7 of her books, and I just finished Keeping Faith. Normally, Picoult writes a captivating story that keeps me enthralled. But with this one, I was turning the pages just to get through it. I found the characters unlikeable, except for little Faith, and the story never really went anywhere. Most of the middle section of the book was unnecessary, as well as the random forays into the stories of a multitude of minor characters, including numerous religious clergy and a guardian ad litem we barely got to know. The story didn't get interesting until the last third, and the ending was a big let down. If you are a Jodi Picoult fan, I suggest skipping this one. She has far better books that will keep you wildly entertained, such as Nineteen Minutes, My Sister's Keeper, Plain Truth, and Second Glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Jodi Picoult book, MUST READ!","review":"I am not a religious person at all, but this book is great.You will really connect with Faith and her mother.You can really tell Jodi Picoult did her research on this book.I would add SO much more but I don't want to give anything away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"One of my favorite picoult books. Everyone should read whether a religious person or not. Has controversial ideals that makes you think and question the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Exploration of Faith","review":"Jodi Picoult has another winner in KEEPING FAITH. I have read many of Ms. Picoult's books and I appreciate her rich writing style and her willingness to explore difficult issues and how regular people face them.In this novel, she explores the topic of faith - both faith in God and faith in the people we love. It was really ambitious to delve into the religious concepts she addresses here - a young girl starts to speak with God, who appears to her as a woman, and the girl both experiences the elements of religious ecstasy, including stigmata, and becomes a healer. Picoult handles all of these topics with respect, and she encourages the reader to come along on the journey of questioning, doubt, and eventually, faith.Setting these religious questions against the backdrop of a divorce and custody battle, Picoult grounds the story in the real drama and turmoil of a family. Ultimately, it is that love of a family that restores everyone's faith in each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really care for this book.","review":"This book is interesting enough to keep your attention and keep you reading, but I was really dissappointed in the book, and wished I hadn't wasted my time reading it. It has some okay moments, but it's very sad and depressing. Some of the events that happen in the book, the author just didn't follow thru giving you more information about, just leaves it, and you're left wondering what happened after that. The ending I hated. I read the last two pages 3 or 4 times, and never really figured out what it said. The book was a good idea, but guess the author isn't very good. I do not recommend anyone reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few \\"novels\\" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. \\"Pop lit\\" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing read","review":"I had several recomendations for this book and was anxious to read it. I was disapointed in the writing and the progression of the story. I found the story compelling in the beginning, but it lagged in the middle and turned too much into a ridiculous romance and less about the relationship between the mother and child. In the beginning, the mother was insecure, unsure of herself in her marriage and in her role of a mother...She was real and I related to her insecurities. However, as the book progressed and the more confident she became the less interesting and the less real she and the book became. I felt the character development was lacking and created an enviornment that I didn't really care about most of the characters, anyway. Finally, the medical information was innacurate, it could have easily come off a TV medical drama. I did find the concept to be interesting and it was a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite page-turner","review":"A friend chose Jodi Picoult's novel for our most recent book club. It honestly took me about 75 pages to get into this book, but once I settled in -- I had a hard time putting it down. I had never read anything like this book -- stigmata, a female God, etc. -- and it instantly intrigued me. I liked the concept of a mother believing in her child, no matter what. That unconditional love and support was what made me finish the book in one night. I would definitely read another book by this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite authors","review":"I was not disappointed in yet another Jodi read. The book took me on an enjoyable journey. Looking forward to more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Farfetched","review":"I usually like Picoult's works, but I did not like this one. Too hard to swallow. Please stop w/ the word requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I love Jodi Picoult - once again she chose a really interesting subject and wrote compellingly. I found Keeping Faith had to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the read","review":"This is my second book by Jodi Picoult, The Pact being my first. Although I didn't find it as amazing as The Pact (one of my all time favorites), I couldn't put it down and really felt like the character development was so strong. I couldn't wait to see what happened and I felt like I could really understand what the characters were feeling. As someone else mentioned in a review, I was always questioning different characters throughout...the book kept me guessing. However, I have to say I was a bit confused by the end and was disappointed that I felt like I didn't really know what happened.I feel this book is well worth reading. It was not my first Picoult novel and it definitely won't be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I was really looking forward to this novel because the storyline really intrigued me. However, I couldn't get past 100 pages and even those were a huge chore. Picoult's writing was unimpressive. Her characters and dialogue were plastic. The situations were overwhelmingly derivative and farcical. I have no problem becoming immersed in another world or believing the unbelievable when directed by a capable author. In other hands, this could have been a great story. But with Picoult, there was no getting past the fact that this was fiction, and poorly written at that. Truly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop telling people the whole book when you review it","review":"I was going to buy this book, but after reading the reviews I have lost interest. God people are you really readers? No one wants to know what's in the book before they buy it. You guys review the book by telling most of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I too was very disappointed by this book. Having read this author previously and enjoyed her books, I thought this one would be an interesting and enlightening read. No way. The story was flat. The romance reeked of romance novels (really, his hair was like a raven wing?). I was truly offended by that stuff. I wondered if we were experiencing a ghost writer and Miss Jodi has just become too successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Story!","review":"Jodi Picoult is at her best in this novel about a mother's love for her child; a love that allows for the stretching of the heart, the mind, and the spirit. Faith is a young character who glimmers off the pages, and who brings new hopes and challenges for her single mother. The novel is also a reflection of the media-filled society we live in today, and offers poignant insights into the lives of so many people who appear on our news channels. A definite must-read for mothers, daughters and those who are looking to stretch their ideas on spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking with awesome characters","review":"Jodi has quickly become one of my favorite authors. My teenage daughters introduced her books to me last summer and I have been devouring the books as fast as I can get my hands on them ever since. It is generally very hard for me to get into a new book but I have loved every one of them so far and this is one of my favorites. With the exception of the last page of this book, which is rather confusing, this book is full of rich characters and a wonderful story line that will keep you turning the pages wanting to learn more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever title; provocative theme","review":"\\"Keeping Faith\\" is a quick read that makes you think.The characters are interesting and not especially predictable. For example, Mariah White, mother of Faith, starts out as rather pathetic and annoying but comes into her own as the story progresses.There are themes of religion, custody, divorce and relationships that are developed and researched well and are not treated redundantly. The story forces the reader to think about various \\"what ifs\\" especially religious \\"what ifs.\\"What I liked best about this book is that it is not a rehash of ideas; I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Imagine Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, watering down their startlingly conservative theology so as to make even less cogent points than in their best-selling Left Behind series. Then collaborating with the Lifetime Network to crank out 400 pages directed toward the lowest common denominator of American readers. This book hurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, unusual topic -- a page-turner.","review":"I just discovered Jodi Picoult a few weeks ago -- read \\"The Pact\\" and then this one. While both were completely enjoyable, \\"The Pact\\" was a better, tighter story, I think. But I admire Picoult's willingness to jump into tough, controversial topics. I also enjoy her courtroom scenes a lot. One nit-pick with this story -- she has a 50-ish character recollecting how frightening Orsen Welles' \\"War of the Worlds\\" was for her and her husband. This is impossible because that radio broadcast was way back in 1938. It bothers me that an error this large made it by the editors. (Told you it was a nit-pick!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"The only Jodi Picoult book I've been unable to finish. It went back and forth and back and forth about the differences between the Catholic and Jewish faiths until I just shut the Kindle off and said \\"enough\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent storyteller","review":"I have recommended Keeping Faith to classes of adult students for its intriguing mix of current family dynamics, spiritual possibilities, and problem solving strategies. Ms. Picoult fascinates me and my students with real life characters who could be neighbors, but who experience life in ways that push the imagination. No problems getting assignments finished - everyone is spellbound and full of questions and opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"This is a book that reminds us that the age-old question of \\"Does God exist?\\" cannot be determined by scientific method or measureable data. It relies on the faith of an individual, and sometimes faith enters when one realizes the consequences of NOT accepting by faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked this story. It didn't go too overboard on the miracles but gave enough to help the reader keep his/her own faith. The characters were believable and likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Keeping Faith,right up there with Jodi Picoult's previous high standard,this kept me, glued to my Nexus tablet to the final word.This is the first time I've read an eBook, and I'm hooked.Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"This is such is sweet story.It is an intense story and slightly controversal topic like Picolt's other books, but has a lighter tone.I highly recommend it. It is one of the best and is also a good one for readers interesting in Picoult and wanting a feel of her writing style and story lines.Check it out, give it a read. Perfect any time and a great gift for Picoult and read lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonbeliever Cannot Enjoy","review":"I usually like Jodi Picoult novels although they tend to be predictable/similar to one another. This one actually wasn't because the ending made no sense. I've never written an amazon review before of a product but decided to review this book because it pissed me off so much. The ending is absolutely terrible. The book was pretty boring throughout and way longer than it needed to be but I kept waiting to get to the end so I'd finally understand why all this was happening. She explains nothing. It was so stupid. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEPING Faith","review":"Once again Jodi Picoult draws you into the story within the first few pages. The characters grab you and her story line once again is intriguing. A really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"I can't get enough of Jodi Picoult!!! You think you know where it's going but then she changes it up. Highly recommend this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through this book.","review":"Gave up half way through this book after trying very hard to finish. I thought the mom was a whiner and the wanted more insight from the daughter and father. It fell flat too early for me to get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop reading","review":"This whole book had me waiting to get off work or skip a meal so that I could read just one more page. The one thing I question about it though is; why did the priests and fathers never have a huge role in the end? They didn't come up in the case, or do anything really for me. Besides that, another book to keep me waiting for more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I loved it! Picoult did a wonderful job of making sure you felt like you HAD to know what happened next.This book really makes you think about God and peoples relationships with God. Something that is rarely done in modern literature.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ending leaves you second guessing as to what you just read and how you precieved the book up until that point. Which, depending on the person, could make it a better read or leave you confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I truly love reading Jodi Picoult, another wonderful read!!

It's stories like this that change the way you think forever. Great charactors, great writing, great story, GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"I thought this was an interesting book that provided some deep thought about religion today in our society. It is worth reading. Not the best book that I ever read, but definitely better than most of the other lighter books that I have read this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suprise","review":"Very good read. I would reccomend to anyone wanting to read. It kept me interested from the start. A must read for all Jodi Picoult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those you will not be able to put down","review":"I was riveted by this book. I imagine it will do the same for many people especially if they are more religious than I. I think the best part was the end, I actually kind of sat there a few minutes to really absorb it. I loved her other books but this is my favorite so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Faith","review":"I liked this book very much and have already recommended to friends who like to read Jodi Picoult...We have even discussed the ending and came to two different conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"fictional exploration of miracles and family love that rings true","review":"Jodi Picoult fearlessly chooses the most difficult topics for her marvelously moving fiction. This time it's miracles, visions, mental illness, broken families, and charlatans of several stripes. Seven-year-old Faith talks with God and casually, even unwittingly, heals the sick. Her fragile mother, intensely loyal grandmother, and puzzled, wandering, but loving father all try to make sense of Faith's experiences and of the media frenzy that follows her, even as they tiptoe through the legal minefield of custody hearings. Picoult deals with the clergy, the TV hosts, and the egocentric lawyers with a deft hand as she gently unwinds the truth that is the foundation of this family's love. One of the best,in a field of excellent novels taking on tough subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith, No one can take that from you","review":"This book was my first introduction to this author, but not my last.From the momen that I opened this book, I opened my mind. i found myself imagining as a parent what I would do if my 7yo daughter told me that GOD was talking to her. I would like to think that I would beleive her and do whatever i could to protect her.This Mother did just that in the process learned some things from her daughter. It is a must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"It really makes you think about what could possibly be happening to this girl... and challenges what your belief is in Faith as a religion, or Faith wrapped up in this little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I love this story. Couldn't wait for the evening to lay in bed and read the next chapter of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional and engrossing read.","review":"Once again Jodi Picoult brings us a messy moral dilemma backed up with meticulous research that will keep you glued to your seat, tense one minute and feeling tear jerker tender the next.The story revolves around Faith, Mariah White's daughter, who begins to confide in an imaginary friend and to perform miracles. She says she can see a beautiful woman who is protecting her and who is full of light and makes her feel safe. Is she speaking with God?The situation spirals beyond Mariah's control, having the media stationed in front of her house and fighting over Faith's custody with her unfaithful and selfish ex husband.One begins to question if Faith is truly a case of a girl with Stigmata or just a troubled little girl seeking refuge from her parents'divorce?When it comes to matters of faith and religion, it's hard to know who to believe and this book will have you hooked until it's final pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodi Picoult - Keeping Faith - A must Read","review":"Jodi Picoult delivers - again. This book is fabulous and is a true page turner. While it is not as good as My Sister's Keeper or Nineteen Minutes - or her latest, Handle With Care, it is (in my opinion), a fantastic read. I continued to ponder some of the trademark questions that reading Picoult's books always create in me. Her books force readers to consider both sides of events, no matter how certain we are of our initial opinions and views."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEPING FAITH","review":"JODI PICOULT ALWAYS WRITES A GOOD STORY.

It is a little strange for my taste. I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Alert:Large Print!!!","review":"I didn't read the fine print that this book is large print. So when I received it I saw the large print and sent it back to Amazon. Definitely be aware that this book has LARGE PRINT, if you want this book in large print great, if not don't buy it. I wasn't critical enough of the heading for this book and got what I deserved which was this book in large print. Never again, I'll check to make sure that the book that I want to buy is normal print and not extra large print like this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"keeping faith by jodi picoult","review":"I found this a tedious read, with an unbelievable story line..Perhaps Jodi Picoult is not for me although it is the second book of hers which I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of disappointed","review":"I did finish it and I love Jodi Picoult's books.

As the story developed, I was drawn to keep reading. Faith, a young girl, is in the middle of a divorce when she seems to be hearing and talking to an imaginary friend. This develops into much more as Faith is involved in situations where people are healed if only for a while. It is how all adults around her deal with Faith that makes this such an interesting read. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I loved this book, couldn't stop reading it. It was a wonderful story about a mother's love and the length's she would go to protect her child in spite of what the world view her as. It also threw curveballs in there about religion, adultery, tragedy, and finding new love. Highly recommend this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than anticipated !","review":"This book turned out to be such a pleasant surprise. I went into this book totally blind, I hadn't read any of Jodi Picoult's books, let alone one of this subject matter. I downloaded the sample of the book onto my kindle and as soon as finishing it ordered the book immediately. Jodi told the story so beautifully I had to believe it. I have recommended this book to many of my friends. Very touching and hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Faith","review":"Interesting unusual book but true to Jodi Picoult\`s form of writing.Keeps you in suspense but the ending leaves you hanging and I would have preferred a definite ending not for it to be left to my imagination.However I would definitely encourage you to read this book if you love to get into a book and not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow .","review":"i STARTED THIS BOOK ABOUT 6 TIMES. i LOVE jODY'S BOOKS BUT THIS ONE CONFUSED ME.

Keeping Faith: A Novel is one of them. The author makes us care from page one. The young female character is believable and vulnerable and honestly written.

I had a hard time putting it down just like all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many unexplained events","review":"I am glad that this was not the first Jody Picoult book that I have read - not sure I would have continued with her others...I have loved most of her other books that I have read. However, I felt that Keeping Faith left too many unanswered questions which made the events in the book unbelievable. The ending was very disappointing - it did not bring anything to closure, nor did it lead you to make any of your own conclusions.Sorry to say that this book was a let-down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not up to the level of Jodi Piccoult's other novels. The storyline lacked believablity, the writing was poor, some of the characters were either cardboard cutouts or unrealistic (and one in particular was lifted from The Rainman), and the book needed serious editing. After the first 100 pages, I skipped large chunks in a valiant effort to reach the end. If I hadn't already read many of Jodi Picoult's other novels before this one, I would have thought she was a bad author. She didn't do herself justice with this one. She is capable of a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I wasn't sure that I would like this book when I first picked it up. I am not a very religious person, and religion is a big part of this book. But then I started reading it. I like all of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone, and have already to a few people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It's one of the best, I simply cannot stop reading. Touching and thought provoking as we'll. I love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"American drivel","review":"I regret buying this book for my E -reader. I have read Jodi Picoult books before and enjoyed them, but this book was a lot of drivel. A most unlikely story with touches of Mills and Boon. A boring and unlikely plot which may be attractive to people believing in psychics, angels and the like, but I found it almost impossible to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not her best","review":"As a huge Jodi Piccoult fan, I was a little disappointed in this book. There was not the suspense that most of her novels involve and there was no surprise ending. It was well written, as usual, but it just wasn't my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS Book!","review":"This is a great read. If you enjoy Elizabeth Berg or Anita Shreve's books, you will LOVE this author.I felt that this book was very well written, it was insightful, funny, and painful at times. It held my interest for the entire book - no dull chapters or lapses.The storyline is about a little girl who is able to talk to God and it's told from her mother's perspective. The story is about so much more - how it affects her family, the media circus that ensues, and the power of love. It's really a complex plot but it's so well written, it just flows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Young Girl Speaks to God","review":"This book is well-written and a page-turner. It is also about a controversial subject as are most of the Jodi Picoult books I have read.Faith is a little girl who has been recently traumatized by her parents' divorce. She begins to talk to her 'guard', has visible stigmata and can bring the dead back to life. Even those who are disbelievers, believe that Faith is the real thing. The characterizations of Faith, her father, her mother, her grandmother, etc. are all very well done.The plot is interesting and tantalizing. This book has several sub-plots. The one I enjoyed most was the one about the mother's love interest. The book offers a lot of food for thought and is not one you'll soon forget.I highly recommend this book. However, don't start reading it right before you go to bed because it is a real page-turner and you're likely to be up all night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picoult is excellent","review":"Picoult is an excellent writer and develops her characters better than anyone I've ever read. The story moves quickly, and is fiercely entertaining. This book makes you think, and wonder, and question. Picoult has a gift for picking these types of topics. Her books are long, but she researches her subjects well to give you a full taste of the topic, but she lets you make your own mind up. The book is redeming and you fall in love with Faith, and all the main characters. The ending builds quickly and then at the end you are left with questions. I am not fan of that, I like to know what the author is trying to tell me, especially when I am that commited to a book (long). I still think her book My Sisters Keeper is better, but it's a masterpiece.Read that one first if you have not. Keeping Faith is definitely worth while if not just for the beautiful writing of Picoult, but also for the journey she takes you on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodi Picoult Never Grows Stale","review":"Jodi Picoult must love a challenge. This is an unusual book that deals with the issue of divine religious visitations, stigmata and miracles through the experience of a young girl after her parents divorce. Picoult understands the complicated relationship between parents and their children as deftly illustrated through Mariah White after her marriage disintegrates, and she is caught up in a media circus with her daughter. Picoult tackles a hot button topic with journalistic integrity; but still manages to weave a credible and believable fictional narrative.

The book is apparently a verbatim copy of JAVA programming with CORBA. The authors did not even have the respect to the reader to replace the word JAVA by C++, in a number of places the book talks about JAVA. I do not recommend this book at all.

I heard about this from a friend, and I would highly suggest getting one.

That's because this is strictly second rate. The storyline alternates between being laughable and being predictable. Pierce Brosnan portrays a bomb expert who usually works for the FBI but also does some side work for the local police. His marriage is on the rocks because he allowed their young daughter to drown in the pool. How nice. The incident is shown only in flashback and seems almost trivial the way in which it is presented. Brosnan ends up becoming involved with an investigation into exploding politicians. Yup...that's right. Certain senators end up combusting in a big way after drinking what appears to be water. The end of the movie borrows more than a little inspiration from the TV show \\"MacGyver\\". This movie never really finds its place and contains your standard action sequences and rather poor special effects. Brosnan is much more impressive as Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond fans, trust me on this............................","review":"............and follow me here, this movie is terrible. No matter what the other people tell you, I am telling you the truth and this is my business. If you are going to buy this film, and \\"pretend\\" it's a Bond film, you are better off getting \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\" This movie is so over acted that it is ridiculous, though, in reverse of the last three Bond outings, it starts off silly and gets a little better. It proves that playing 007 has been good for Pierce. He has gained confidence through that role that has served him well in his films about love or jewel thieves. He didn't have it here, bless his heart. My girlfriend likes to think that it's him in the love scenes and not a body double. She said,\\"Oh, so that's what Bond looks like making love.........\\"Pass on this one lads, trust me>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead of a big bang, Live Wire delivers a pop","review":"In this not-ready-for-Bond primer, Pierce Brosnan plays an FBI explosives expert who can't figure out a series of deadly D.C. detonations that has the nation's capital on edge. The mysterious explosive premise is a good one, however the movie suffers from a made-for-cable feel (perhaps because of the terrible music). The cast does a good job with a fair to middling script, but a few characters just don't belong. Namely Lisa Eilbacher as Brosnan's promiscious wife. Usually a reliable actress, she's reduced to eye candy in this one. Ben Cross does a smash-bang job as the heavy, but Ron Silver is dead weight as Cross's congressional co-conspirator. All in all, Live Wire delivers an interesting pop, but is far from the entertaining big bang you might expect from a film featuring the future James Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collection of exquisitly constructed prayers","review":"I am a minister and have used this book during worship around Prayer Time teachable moments. Baillie's prayers are superb, but they are written in an older style that would have been a bit difficult for our international congregation to grasp. But the content of these prayers was just too good to pass by. So in a typical implementation I took one of his prayers, paraphrased it, provided handout copies to the congregation, and then used the paraphrase as a template for that morning's pastoral prayer. Then I encouraged the congregation to take it home and use it throughout the week.I highly recommend this book.Pastor Tim Isbell ([...])"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually Cheap","review":"The overall appearance of the printed page is repulsive.

I even bought this book for my dad.That being said it is obvious this kindle book was just a scan and that nobody bothered to proof it. There are quite a few typos and this is made worse by the text being older english. I have found myself on a couple of occasions looking words up because I am not sure if they are a misspelling or some old word that I haven't encountered before. It has always been the former.

It's just that I've seen these all so many times now, that it's kind of like looking at a photo of a favourite place.You see a clip, you know the episode instantly, you know the jokes instantly. If you watch the episode, you know what will happen. Yes, it is funny. Yes, there are episodes that I'll watch again, but there are still moments that I'll hit the fast forward on, there are still scenes which I find embarrasing (for some reason).This means that the entire series collection becomes more of a monument than a watchable purchase.

Fawlty Towers ranks with the Honeymooners at the top of this select class. The similarities are thought-provoking. Both were \\"filmed\\" on a remarkably spare, almost theatrical sets. Both featured what might be called choreographed physical comedy as well as wit, whether it was John Cleese goosestepping his way through \\"Germans\\" or Jackie Gleason doing the Hucklebuck with Art Carney and \\"Mrs. Manicotti.\\" I've watched every episode at least a dozen times over the years, and like fine wine, it seems only to improve with age.

The visual quality is good (certainly better than my home-recorded video tapes!) but no 'cleaning' has been done to the image... Nothing matches the pent-up anger of Basil Fawlty cursing the Heavens, or beating his mini with a tree branch. The smarmy, unctuous sycophant has since never been so well portrayed.

This experience led to the development of \\"Fawlty Towers,\\" a sitcom that originally appeared on the BBC in 1975 and 1979. In the series, Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, manager of the Fawlty Towers hotel in Torquay on the Devon coast.Fawlty (mis)manages the hotel with his wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), and with hired help Polly (Connie Booth) and Manuel (Andrew Sachs). The four trifle with both the guests and each other, and the show is witty with fast-paced dialogue and comedy of errors-style humor. Some of the situations the crew stumbles into involve botched hotel repairs, restaurant meals gone wrong, and an untimely death.The first two discs in this set contain the twelve episodes of the series, and there is a third bonus disc recalling this classic series that containing interviews, outtakes, and other material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry, Black British humor at its best!","review":"I am British, so naturally think that fawlty tower is an absolute classic.

Well all thats in Basils eyes anyway. Definatly a must for all those who appreciate dry humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Show Ever","review":"Fawlty Towers is simply he best comedy ever written.

Each one is a gem in itself. No one can do comedy quite like John Cleese. The little nuances; the decor; the intricate character play; its wonderful. If you watch carefully at the beginning of each episode you will also find the twisted spelling of \\"fawlty towers\\". For something made in the 70's, this series has survived and is still enjoyable today.As for the interviews, they are great. With only 12 episodes made its nice to have the interviews filling the blank spots.A must for John Cleese fans and for anyone who loves Britcoms =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to hurt yourselves laughing","review":"There are very few comedies I would put in the gut-busting funny category, and this series is one of the few. I inadvertently caught the entire series a LONG time ago during a PBS marathon, and I was, in all honesty, in pain from laughing so hard. I'm not a big fan of Monty Python, so this type of humor appealed to me more: Not as reliant on obscure British references, but crafted in a way that can be widely appreciated by a more varied American audience. Think \\"Newhart\\" on steroids. Great, great caustic, physical/slapstick humor that's made even funnier by a fantastic cast. This stuff loses no appeal with repeated viewings; in fact, these episodes are as funny the 10th time you watch them as they are the first.

The 30th anniversary DVD set edition is offered at a special value price. Although Fawlty Towers is a superb period production, this immortal series delivers off-kilter insights on daily tribulations and strives to send messages applicable to today's viewer. Indulge yourself, c'mon and buy this DVD set.

Unfortunately, there are only 12 episodes (on 2 disks) and I would much prefer 100. I hated to see it end. There is a 3rd disk with interviews, history and trivia. At 30 dollars plus, it was somewhat expensive. But, it is in a league all it's own. John Cleese is definitely a master (and Manuel, the waiter from barseloma, is the \\"icing on the cake\\").

I expected it to be witty, refined, and just plain funny, I found none of that. All I found was an extremely boring and unexpiring comedy. I don't see the humor in Basil falling down in every episode or slamming Manuel's head into the wall. After the first \\"uno, dos, tres\\" episode with Manuel, any other times Basil has a tough time communicating with Manuel, it just seems tired. There is no subtle humor because everything in the show is such an overtly over exaggeration.

I had been hoping they would release it on DVD for some time and finally they did and i snapped it up. It is still funny.

He never owned Fawlty Towers but told me to watch it if I ever got the chance. I was browsing Amazon one day and saw it on DVD, and I purchased it. I am so glad I did!

That's right, naked. Connie Booth is topless through the whole thing and John thankfully has a bassoon covering his naughty bits. Needless to say, I'd like to see this non-fawlty ditty again.

Or, maybe you've stayed at a bed and breakfast like The Fawlty Towers. John Cleese (Monty Python) plays Basil Fawlty, who along with his wife runs The Fawlty Towers. Basically, the entire series is an excuse to let Cleese do his patented slow-boil, get caught in compromising positions, and be mean to bellhop Manuel.This is mean-spirited British humor at it's best. Cleese has rarely been better. And the supporting cast, lead by Connie Booth, is great. Stop in and see why this is one of the great comedies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant!!!","review":"fawlty towers is one of the most hillarious shows ever!!!! i could watch basil fawlty forever and still be entertained!!!recomended to all who are normal and those who are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Show","review":"The show is hilarious and the DVD quality is just fine.

Every actor but one is imminently skillful and every script but one will make you laugh out loud, hard. Hit \\"pause\\" until it passes. I hope you can cope with the workplace stress, which it will remind you of. I left the workplace long ago and it gives me flashbacks. And damn, I wish I could be as thin as John Cleese.

It is a short lived series that you can watch in a single sitting, but it will have your sides splitting, & it is great to show at parties.So many popular modern comedies draw from John Cleese, and Fawlty Towers is chock-full of excellent comedy to draw from.I actually like this better than Monty Python, because you don't have to take a break from it to not hate it. Monty Python wears on you, so it's great to watch every now and again, but if you watch it too often, it feels childish and irritating. Fawlty Towers deals with a much more mundane subject matter, reigning in the comedians to play in a much less abrasive realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series","review":"We always enjoyed watching Fawlty Towers when it was first released in Canada back in the late 70's.

I have honestly watched every episode at least 25 times, probably more. John Cleese has never been more hilarious. He plays this hysterical character who spends much of his time saying things to his guests/customers that we all wish we could say at our jobs. Of course, since I work in the Hotel industry, I can really appreciate all the humor but I really think anyone who works in any kinds of customer service would highly appreciate these videos. My favorite show is the \\"Communications problems\\" episode with the wicked obnoxios \\"classic guest from Hell\\" I only wish they would have made more than 12 episodes! *This set is worth the money*"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fauwlty Fan\\" loves","review":"Very happy with the service Amazon provides.

I well remember that after each new episode was aired, we would discuss it the following day with our History master during class, easily diverting him from the lesson plan he had. He loved it as much as we did.I swear that many times during the 12 episodes, I could barely breathe as I was laughing so much. There are so many funny parts in all the episodes. My personal favourite scenes are when Basil and Sybil have their verbal exchanges - priceless. Both the visual and verbal comedy are unsurpassed.I only wish I could erase my memory banks of this show and watch all the episodes again for the first time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Brit Comedy","review":"Have seen these episodes years ago when they first came out, which is why I bought it.

I've contacted them and they are sending a replacement with a return shipping label to send back the defective one at no charge. So bravo Amazon for correcting this problem so efficiently! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show but Sloppy DVD Collection","review":"POSITIVES: These classic episodes are even more spectacular on crystal-clear DVDs, most of the interviews are interesting, and there are a few good special features (for example, the documentary on Torquay and the real-life nasty hotel manager who served as the model for Basil Fawlty).NEGATIVES: The people who interviewed the cast members, and the people who provided the episode commentaries, seemed to be totally unprepared for their job, and appeared to be making up their questions and comments as they went along.BIGGEST SURPRISE: Andrew Sachs is a quiet, intelligent, dignified stage actor with a British accent, completely unrecognizable as the the goofy Spanish bellman/waiter he plays in the series!MOST UNPLEASANT SURPRISE: Andrew Sachs's interviewer never once asked him to do any lines in his goofy \\"Manuel\\" voice and character, so how do we know it was really him? It's kind of like interviewing Mel Blanc and never asking him to do Bugs Bunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Comparable To Monty Python - This Is Another Kind Of Fun","review":"All 12 episodes of the British comedy series Fawlty Towers! I fell for it'n' bought it, as a huge fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus.But Fawlty Towers is not the same kind of humour. It is more slapstick (without BEING slapstick), yet more complex since there's a continuous rise towards total chaos climax at the end of each episode!This is great! Great, and great FUN! Do buy the whole set - you will not cheat yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my odd size rifle fit. Nice case.","review":"Target rifles are large. The one I bought this case for is overly large and the rifle fit. The included front and rear pads, and two Velcro cinch straps fit easily. The rifle layed right down into them. Both straps are 1\\" x 19\\". My stock is very large and I'll need a 20\\" strap in the rear but for virtually every rifle 19\\" is more than long enough.

As far as I am concerned the verticle case is a great idea I hate my guns laying on there sides the scopes get banged around too much so good try bad flimsy item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very secure transport.","review":"This case suspends your firearm on blocks of foam.It keeps your rifle or shotgun from impacting any part of the inside of the case to prevent damage to the weapon or a scope.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is no better hard gun case than this one!","review":"when i first saw one of these cases at a match, i knew it was the best available, and the only one which held a rifle in an upright position, not squashed between to slabs of egg-crate foam.i can even fit my rifle into this case with a 4-16x56mm scope installed.i can't imagine any other case for my rifle on an airline.-bpps, i bought it at amazon, where it shipped FREE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Case is advertised as large, yet the lid won't clear my 56 mm scope on a Rem 700 with a Choate Tool Ultimate Sniper Stock. If it actually worked for a larger gun, it would be better than a double gun case, but it doesn't work, so you're better off with a double gun case to fit a large gun. It's a stupid idea considering it's limited storage size and large footprint. If it worked for larger guns, it would be worth buying. Cost more to return than what I paid. $35 of junk to add to my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged merchandise","review":"When I received the rifle case it was cracked and when I called the customer service rep, she informed me that the rifle cases are back ordered and I would not have a replacement before christmas (this was weeks before christmas). The rep told me she would send a shipping label for me to return the item and never told me how long it would take (i found out later that it takes 5 -7 business days for the label to be shipped and it took all of 7 business days). So even if the merchandise wasn't on back order, I still wouldn't have had a replacement on time. Needless to say my husband is going to get a damaged rifle case for Christmas because the whole ordeal of sending this back has been nothing but a hassle. Also note that the customer service rep who answered my call was very unpleasant and uninterested in my dilemma. Wouldn't recommend buying anything from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Transporting in the Vehical","review":"For the price this is a excellent case.

There is a lot of space in the case that can't be utilized which is a waste. it is such a big case, and you can only put the gun in there. no room for other accessaries.If I were to buy another case, I would spend extra $$$ to get a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality case","review":"I received my Plano case in a timely manner. The case is very sturdy for the type of plastic used. I would not use this case for air travel! Great for back and forth to the range or simply just to store your rifle/shotgun. Really my only issue with the case is that it doesn't seal very well. This may allow moister and/or dust to enter the case. Overall very happy with product, also my bi pod fit nicely in the case while attached to rifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had for 10 years and Great!","review":"My wife bought this case at least 10 years ago for me. I use a Marlin 30-30 with 9 x 40mm scope in it and it works great. It has kept my gun from damage and works great for someone that doesn't have a gun cabinet. I have not had any trouble with rust even though I keep my gone in this case all year long. The reason for this is the gun is suspended inside the case by being strapped to foam at the rear of the stock and forearm.

What's the Story Morning Glory kick-started a Brit-pop revolution, this one feels like it never even happened. There's nothing exciting, original, idealistic or inspiring in any of the songs and it feels like the band just got together to make some cash and help support their rock'n'roll lifestyle.I'm disappointed again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with iPod or other players","review":"Bought the dualdisc version and while the album is really great, actually the best Oasis album since 'Morning Glory', this version won't work with MP3 players, since it won't load on the computer.

Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised at the versatility, yet also consistency in this album. Thankfully, Oasis have come into there own again as great song writers, and they STILL are great musicians.

Listening to it as a whole album it sounds like a bad compilation of outtakes, and when listening to the songs individually to pull out good points, it is a difficult task. It has a couple of singles on it but nothing more.

This is their best album since Morning Glory.At only forty three minutes, you'd think you'd want more to hear however, satisfaction never came in such a small package. Song after song, you'll find yourself singing the lyrics after only hearing one verse.There's not a weak song on this disc so, you won't be skipping tracks. I can't wait to see what the band will pick as their next single. It's that good.Bottom line: 11 superb tracks and memorable lryics. This blows Heathen Chemistry out of the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downward spiral continues","review":"First a disclaimer: I am a big Oasis fan, own every album, every single, so don't think i'm coming into this review as an Oasis hater...Now with that being said, this album can be summed up in one word; BORING.

I hate to say it cos I love(d) Oasis.This album is too cheesy, too clompy (whatever that means!!!) and not what a top band should be producing. Lyla?!? Its so crap I cant believe it! Oasis are going through the motions and not moving very well at all.The Lennon influence on the vocals is extremely annoying (nothing against Lennon of course - I just hate the copied delivery) - what happened to the angry lead vocalist in Morning Glory? What the hell happened to songs like Some Might Say, Cast No Shadow...Oasis are still on the shelf way after their sell-by-date. I hate to say this!!!The live tour will no doubt be fantastic - thats only cos of the classics.Coldplay have royally kicked their ass with X & Y."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oasis have dried up.","review":"I was excited for the new Oasis album, to come out. Upon hearing the record, my hopes for a great album weredashed as \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is truly an uninspiring disc. Lazy arrangements, songs that don't seemfinished, eg. The Meaning of Soul, dominate this record. There are a two bright spots, Andy and Gem's \\"Keep TheDream Alive\\", and \\"A Bell Will Ring\\", give this collection some meaning. Other than that, this sounds like a groupgoing through the motions, void of any creativity and magic of earlier records."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of offal !","review":"Well I'm afraid they've really lost it now.

Honest to God, being an avid fan of there Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory albums, I tried as hard as I could to accept this new release, but I simply couldn't force myself to listen to it more than twice.

(What's The Story) Morning Glory is possibly the greatest rock album ever.

Don't get your hopes up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm....","review":"I'm one of the biggest Oasis fans out there. I own all the albums, all the singles, and all the DVDs. I can play all their popular songs on guitar. I've even got tickets for their tour this fall.BUT, this new CD does not do it for me. Call me old school, but I'm not liking this new Oasis. I think the druming is simplistic... same repetitive beat beat beat in Lyla and Mucky Fingers. The only good song is Let There Be Love. I certainly hope the new B-sides of this album sound like the old Oasis.Now, I'm kinda disappointed in their fall concert. Because I know the majority of the songs will probably be from this new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"oasis","review":"absolute brilliant album, i can't stop listening to it lol.

Do-ya-know-what-I-Mean?.....","review":"I've loved Oasis since the beginning. Who would have thought that British-guitar-pop would have provided a welcome breath of fresh air from the \\"I'm so sad in my gap flannel shirt\\" 90's music. Matured & assured enough to share the writing credits amongst themselves-it's how this band should sound in 2005. Theres not a throw-away in the bunch. If you have not listened to Oasis in awhile, nows the time to get back in. For the faithfull, you wont be dissapointed. Even at their weakest musical moments, they still rule over most! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic for Oasis!!","review":"Previous to this Cd, I was a little skeptical- I had been spoiled by \\"Morning Glory\\" and disappointed by \\"Standing...\\"Heathen Chemistry seemed the right direction.On first listen,I thought ok not bad- but from the starting notes of \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" to the last bars of \\"Let There Be Love\\", I became amazed that The WHOLE group could put something out so consistent.Real contributions From Liam and other members in writing really impressed me.There is no filler on this one.Personal favourites:\\"Keep The dream Alive\\", \\"Lyla\\",\\"Part of The Queue\\",\\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\",\\"Love Like A Bomb\\", \\"Let There Be Love\\".If there is a replacement for\\" Morning Glory\\" THIS is it!One thing I found a little cool: Zack Starkey(Ringo Starr's son) played the drums on this one.he plays well- Noel will have to put up with further comparisons to The Beatles-."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"i love this cd and its one of my fav oasis albums up to date.

It's the best new album I've heard in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Release!","review":"The lads from Manchester continue with their strong form to release their sixth studio album Don't Believe The Truth.What is immediately noticeable with this album is how much the band has matured musically. Oasis have probably realized they've proven themselves countless times and that they no longer have anything left to prove to the listener. What this results in is a more complete sound: a band that has thrown all caution to the wind to record an album that is more sincere and straight from the heart.That is why there is no point in comparing The Truth with (What's The Story) Morning Glory? or Be Here Now, because the focus of the music has completely changed. But of course, what still remains is the attitude, which frankly, Oasis couldn't get rid of even if they consciously tried to.Listen without prejudice and you will love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock 'N Roll - loving it!","review":"I only janked off a star from Oasis' 2005 release, \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" simply because there are quite a few moments throughout the album where I feel like I am listening to a line from the Stones (\\"Lyla\\") or The Beatles (\\"Let There Be Love\\"). But this aside (which is nothing 'new' in terms of Oasis' work), this is a solid Rock 'N Roll album to love and to blast through your speakers. After more than ten years around, and still standing tall among a sea of other rock acts, the sound of Oasis continues to come through loud and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical Hippy is a grade A a-hole!","review":"He writes the same crap about Oasis over and over. He thinks they are unoriginal and that they rip off the Beatles. It's not a rip-off, it's a tribute you dumbass.

No one should read what Radical Hippy writes because it's BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It While You Can!","review":"I first heard pianist Richie Beirach on an LP from the early 1980s titled \\"Rendevous.\\" Regrettably I don't think it was ever released on CD. But Beirach's \\"Common Heart\\" has and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves gorgeous solo piano work. Beirach explores nine pieces including two of his own compositions. One of them, \\"The Last Rhapsody,\\" was also performed on the \\"Rendevous\\" LP. It alone is worth the price, but all of the pieces here are outstanding. I have the feeling that this CD will not be around for long so get it while you can.

I found this book in a library, read it, purchased it and then re-read it. Her accounts of her experiences with scientists and their work are fascinating, and she made me laugh aloud several times. Her account of shared time at a remote site with an artist is an intriguing, interesting 'inside' picture of two artists sharing a unique environment, and contributing to each other's work. Her descriptions of her deeper reactions to the landscape are well done and left me realizing how difficult it must be to write well about such an experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"Combines modern and historic perspectives with humour","review":"A complete guide to the Antarctic experience, Sara interweaves anecdotes, history, humour and impressions until you feel as if you have been there with her.

Deadpan British humour and intriguing detail coexists along soaringly touching, even mystical, reverie. There is nothing sentimental about Wheeler's love for the Antarctic. This is a real journey told with incredible candour. It's a privilege to have read it.One of Wheeler's cleverest adjectives to describe detailed, jewel-like writing that she admires is \\"lapidary.\\" She uses it twice in the book to describe the Antarctic writing of other authors. But HER OWN writing is as jewel-like and detailed in the extreme. What an extraordinary book. It's not like a book at all - it's like a world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book","review":"The book goes on and on about Scott and guys who went to the Antarctic about a zillion years ago. The author continually says bad things about everyone she meets, then tells how they all loved her and threw parties for her. She marginalizes or even ignores the work of the people she meets. I read the book to learn about Antarctica, not about her. Having read the book, I know more about her and no more about Antarctica than I did before I read the book.

You will enjoy this book if you accept it as literature with frosty landscapes in the background.You will dislike this book if you want to learn anything at all about the place ... it will still be largely incognita when you have finished reading.Wheeler is part of the stereotype of female travel writers who are obsessed with the effect places and people have upon themselves; compare males who minutely describe the scenes and processes of travel.Antarctica seems to have an effect on its visitors which Wheeler adequately conveys. But you won't learn anything at all about why people work there, or what they have discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous description of live on a base","review":"Wheeler paints a vivid picture of life on the Antartic base where she worked as a resident writer.

Sara ought to take the time and try and learn why Antarctica and polar research is so important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather thin travel book","review":"Sarah's book could have been much better had she left her British haughtiness at home. Her fascination with Chilean political history takes a lot away from her usual travel insights. When she compared Allende's last days with that of Jesus Christ, his farewell the same as Jesus' farewell to his disciples, that becomes a little much. And of course, most of Chile's problems come from, where else, the US of A! Hitler, she observes, was the \\"Nixon of that era.\\" She's just one of the people, she hints, but can't help but comment on how smelly some of the peasants are, and when a servant in a luxurious hacienda brings her a drink, she refers to him as a \\"flunkey.\\" So, let her get back to her travel books with some pretty penetrating observations about people and place, and she'll do OK.

Received in good time. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Berenger totally naked!","review":"I will be 100% honest. I had purchased this video, because Tom Berenger had extensive nudity. Tom stripped down to nothing and walked away while his hot butt wiggled. It was a fine ass. He ultimately walked into a gathering of people frontally nude. He was a feast for the eyes. I was so happy that Tom had the balls do such a nude scene. The movie itself was decent. I would give 3 1/2 stars out of 5. For those who might have been interested, Daryl Hannah did a topless scene and Kathy Bates had a nude scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Play in the Fields of the Lord [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL., Reg.2 Import - SPAIN }","review":"I had been waiting for 'At Play in the Fields of the Lord' to be released on DVD for a number of years and was truly delighted to find that this movie was released on DVD in Spain.I must admit that after receiving the purchased DVD, I was really disappointed with the quality.

My advice is do not waste your money on purchasing this import version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the DVD???","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen, period. I can't believe it isn't on DVD. Of all the \\"junk\\" movies they put on DVD and no one buys, why isn't a movie like this available to the thousands (who knows how many) of people who are just waiting to buy it? Maybe some critics didn't like it but there are sure a lot of people who did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bates gives incredible performance!","review":"This is a 1991 film, but don't miss it! It's a rather long tale, but you won't be bored a single minute. Bates gives a stellar performance as the wife of a missionary sent to convert the 'jungle natives'. When the mission goes very wrong, she goes mad. Berenger plays a native american who flies them in on a plane, and after he sees the bravery of a jungle native, strives to return to his 'wild heritage' by heading out to join the tribe. It's a great tale of how horribly wrong things can go when the white world tries to force their ways upon a primitive culture. It's a very deep, passionate, historic movie that warrants being watched at least twice. All the actors seem to 'feel' the importance of its message and give their roles one-hundred percent.

It lacks what many good movies seem to lack. It lacks a standout actress or actor. Yes, Kathy Bates is good but she is a supporting actress throughout the movie.I would recommend reading the book before watching the film. Like all good movies the script started from a good source.The matter of nudity is one of ignorance.

She's 11 and it's her first year in 6th grade. The other kids all had wal-mart style \\"trapper keepers\\" and she didn't like the look of them so she just carried around a few spiral notebooks. On a whim I ordered this to surprise her and she loved it.It took her about 4 minutes to cut out an oversized photo of her and all her friends to place in the front and stuff it full of odds and ends. She couldn't be happier.Pros: Washable with a moist cloth.Photo in the front makes your kid feel like it's \\"customized\\" for them.Cons: The picture cover (protector?) is pink (as shown in the pic - the round center area) so any pics have a heavy pink tint when viewing from the outside.

This monster has proprietary cartridges that are verified via microchip. Fine. But the bigger problem is that the microchips tend to malfunction.

The movie is sick and disgusting but at times hilarious that its hailed as the muppets on crack but the humor seems copied from a South Park episode and the movie gets quite disgusting(Showing scenes filled with drugs,sex,or gore) and the muppet-like characters are nasty and the whole movie fills like your watching 2 hours of odd cinema from the director of Dead Alive. The funny parts are when the frog has flashbacks of his Vietnam duty or when the fly gets flushed down a toilet and they said he wanted to be a journalist and the only thing left behind was a journal floating around a toilet. The sick parts are the rat making porno in the basement and when the rabbit is popping his herpes and brown pus shoots on the mirror.Please rent but do not buy because you do something better with your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those with an odd mind","review":"This is like the muppets on acid.

Definately a must see for the sick and twisted child within you."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars for the movie....","review":"....1 star for the DVD transfer=2 stars overall.Mostly vivid, interesting movie is hindered by the poor quality print schlepped onto DVD (but helped by the bargain price!). There is nothing great here, folks, but it probably will keep the average fan of ecclectic films awake to the end. For uniqueness alone, it deserves a viewing by those who enjoy unusual films. \\"Meet the Feebles\\" is to \\"The Muppets\\" what \\"Fritz the Cat\\" is to \\"Bambi\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS a movie about love!","review":"This is a response to the Aug 7th review trashing the movie because its base and disgusting, and continuing by saying we should watch a movie about courage, nobility and love.This IS a movie about courage, nobility and love! That's the genius of Peter Jackson. In the midst of all this debauchery and chaos, there really is a very simple, honest, love story between a heroic hedgehog and a virtuous poodle at the center of this cinematic masterpiece, and its masterfully contrasted against the false love of the hippo/actress and the walrus/stage manager that ultimately ends in betrayal and tragedy.Make no mistake, this really is a movie about the characters, despite the fact that discussions of the movie always center on the more sensationalistic aspects of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane movie marred by poor DVD transfer.","review":"What if Kermit was a heroin addict? What if Miss Piggy packed heat? These are some of the crazy situations you'll meet backstage of \\"Meet the Feebles\\" -- an over-the-top, tasteless and bizarre tale of furry creatures in show-biz. The last musical number featuring a fox singing about a certain X-rated activity is a hilarious jaw-dropper!Sadly, this DVD seems to be nothing more than a simple transfer from the VHS version. No effort has gone into restoring or improving the smeary video or harsh sound -- and certainly no extras. Worth seeing if only to measure how far \\"Lord of the Rings\\" director Peter Jackson has come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANYONE WHO RATES THIS LOWER THAN 5 STARS IS A MORON!","review":"This is probably THE FUNNIEST PUPPET MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!! At first viewing, its really hard to stomach due to its explicit nature... but this movie will soon become one of your top ten picks. Trust me. This movie is sooo bad, its good! Meet the Feeble's is about the horrible demize of a musical variety show, and it's actors. All the characters are played by these really cheap looking puppets in poor lighting. If someone decided to make a cocktail with the elements of Requiem for a Dream and The Muppet Show, you would have this movie! If you are into \\"dark and twisted\\" comedies like Death to Smoochy, Pink Flamingos, or Dead Alive, this is the movie for you! It's hilarious but obviously not for everyone.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson 10 Dead/Alive 0","review":"Peter Jackson's second feature, a Muppet/splatter movie, is delightfully made and excellent fun for anyone with a warped sense of humour who always found the Henson creations cloyingly wholesome.

Avoid this release but get the movie - when someone who knows what they're doing puts it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst version on DVD","review":"I love this film, but don't buy this version. I saw 'Meet the Feebles' first at the cinema and owned it on VHS in Australia, and then on DVD from the UK. The US version is horribly dark and doesn't have the color of the original.

It's a funny concept, there are some funny moments, and it's depraved, but in a funny sort of way. That's about where my appreciation of the movie stops. To be honest, I didn't find it offensive, just incredibly boring. Any one who has sat through a more mainstream entertainment, like 8mm for example, won't find it all that shocking in comparision. The only twist is that it's a puppet show, but even that isn't took shocking. In addition to finding it boring, I found to be pointless. What were they trying to achieve here? If this is a satire on children's entertainment, why not throw in a bright musical number?

The box was broken in one spot and although it was supposed to be New the DVD was scratched pretty bad, it had come off the clip and was loose in it's box.... still worked thank goodness with no problems and Amazon gave us a discount on our next purchase and quickly responded to my emails.

So girls, if you bf's invite you over to watch this film you'd better watch your butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"Okay, so it may not be the worst movie ever, but it definately ranks way down there. As far as I can see, it has only one redeeming segment. The scene where the alligator (or whatever it was) is having drug induced Vietnam flashbacks, that was pretty good. In fact, if that had been the only scene, I might have given this movie a good review. The rest of the movie was the sorriest piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. I turned the movie off about half way through because it was so bad. I then watched the second half to see if it could get any worse... and it did. This movie was not funny, intelligent, thought provoking, or even mildly entertaining. The only emotions it got out of me was loathing and numbness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not campy funny--please don't drink the Peter Jackson Koolaid","review":"Would you give this movie a chance if you didn't know Peter Jackson made it?

While I realize that everybody must try to expand their horizons, etc., etc., this movie went over the boundaries of decency and was just plain wrong. The disgusting bathroom humor, which is a major turn-on for some individuals, will not please most audiences. The innuendos and other sordid details are in extremely bad taste. Please rent this movie before you buy it; it might be right up your alley, but I hope not.

This review, at two stars, is about the DVD release from \\"Substance\\".The DVD is 4:3 full screen, cropping the movie's original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. There are no extras on this DVD, barely even a menu. The video looks like it has been taken from a second-generation VHS tape. The colors are bleeding and are overly saturated. Everything looks mushy.I'm not sure why they did not do this right. The very next DVD in their lineup, Peter Jackson's \\"Bad Taste\\", looks great. It has a crisp 1.66:1 aspect ratio image in an anamorphic frame, and it contains a 25 minute making-of featurette. Why could they not give this Peter Jackson movie the same treatment?"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Well i had high hopes for this movie dispite its many negative reviews but in the end it ended up being a waste of an hour and a half. If i were a kid i might think some of the jokes funny but as an adult who has seen most of them all before this movie had little to offer and didnt shock or offend me but rather bored me. (spoiler) about the only memorable scene in the movie for me was the frog junky's flashback to nam and even that wasnt very funny but i always enjoy deer hunter parodies and seeing it from a junky frogs perspective was mildly entertaining. The rest of the movie was pea soup vomit gags and lengthy dialogue that lead no where.

This is not a good product and Crosley should make corrections. I received my first one for a birthday gift and it didn't work properly, so I bought another one thinking the first one was defective.

I will NEVER read this book again and I DON'T encourage anyone else to read this. PLEASE save yourselves the boredom and stupidity that comes from this book. This guy has nothing better to do than go around in little boondocks in the US and force people to have conversations with him. It's irritating. It's boring.

I thought it was the most uninteresting, torturous book I have ever read. If this book is any indication of what Heat-Moon's personality and his English classes were like, I understand why he was laid off (and why his wife cheated on him!). 400-something pages of grueling, thick, unconnected text ruined my entire summer and destroyed any previous desire that I might have had to travel cross-country. I would not recommend this book to anyone; I think it should be destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat-Moon in search of self..............","review":"Blue Highways tells an inner story as captivating as the external wanderlust it records. Heat-Moon sets out from Missouri and circles the country meeting commonfolk, providing commentary, and bringing the less traveled road to life. All too often life forces us into warp speed where we fail to notice the ordinary. With Heat-Moon's closer inspection, we see the ordinary as interesting and an experience worth having. The author makes this journey under a personal cloud due to a failing relationship. His admissions are honest, his emotional battles thought provoking, and the philosophy with which he girds this effort well worth rumination. I may not share all of this man's political leanings, but, nevertheless, I respect him immensely as an author. His sincere gratitude to his readers is palpable and his down-to-earth persona refreshing. Read this and Heat-Moon's two other efforts, River Horse and Prairy Erth. You'll be very happy that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a pure, spiritual slice of Americana","review":"Meaningful, and filled with metaphor, this book is a poignant look at a man standing outside of himself and coping with memory. Each person he writes about on his journey is made to stand out whether good, evil or indifferent. His love and respect for history is obvious--whether it be about the Pony Express (orphans preferred) or how Wolf Point, Montana got its name. He writes with a wry sense of humor, and with out any heavy hand. I've reread passages of this book for over a decade, and for me sums up what the true essence of being \\"on the road\\" is about. It is a journal as powerful as a Ken Burns documentary"},{"rating":"2","title":"An introspective story of discovery and redemption","review":"An introspective story of discovery and affirmation regarding the fabric of America.

Without a doubt, they're the best part of the book. If only they were the only part of the book... His nostalgic (melancholy?) brooding and dreary introspection are not what I expected from this \\"Journey into America.\\" I am not against bias; I did not take the trip-- but it would have been a lot more enjoyable without the clutter and weight of the author's personal baggage. I enjoyed reading about the folks and forgotten spots he visited along the way, but suggest that the title and publisher copy be changed to reflect his depressed inner journey if it's all part of the long, boring trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Condescending Smirk at Rural America","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did. I started to read it when it first came out, in the 80s, and again recently, and I just didn't enjoy it. It reminds me of PBS specials where some Harvard-educated musicologist ventures into the swamplands to interview old bluesmen, and tell us all the deep socio-economic underpinnings of the lyrics. Forget it. It's just the blues - it's meant to be felt in your bones, not theorized about. \\"Blue Highways\\" gave me the same feeling. W.L.H.Moon comes off as self-centered and condescending; he seems to secretly pity those he meets, even as he wants us to chuckle knowingly at them. There are plenty of American travelogues written by people who actually live there.

Though he does not mention the name, in essence he tried to find Mayberry, the mythical small town where nothing seems to change, the people are happy, and any strife is superficial enough to be resolved by the end of a half-hour TV episode.He didn't find it. Like Miniver Cheevy, he was born too late.In small town after small town, he was told that he had arrived a couple of decades too late. Half the time, the old timers would tell him that the town had grown too big, and had lost its former charm. The other half of the time, they would tell him that the town had shrunk too small, and lost its former vitality. No place had stayed the same. There was no Mayberry.We can only hope that Least Heat Moon eventually found his Mayberry, at least in his own mind, if not in some small town."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"If you like knowing about hidden towns and interesting folk in our great country, you will enjoy this book.

Heat-Moon's journey was precipitated by the double whammy of learning he'd lost both his job and his wife at just about the same time, and he figured, as he felt he'd also lost a sense of direction for his life, that perhaps travel, reflection, and writing might cure what ailed him.Some have said the book, now almost 30 years old, is dated - and of course it is. But what makes it even more interesting nowadays is, reading it, you can kind of track the process of how America got from what it was then to what it is now. It's a bit scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLUE HIGHWAYS","review":"A very enjoyable book which takes the reader along the lesser traveled roads across the US.

How appropriate as any other time I wouldn't have given it a viewing. If it wasn't for an almost fair script and acting I would have totally flipped the channel. The story revolves around a wacked out archeologist wanting to bring Ba'al back to life. Two people unite to stop his fiendish plot to become a god himself. I've certainly scene better (pun intended) but after watchingMega Shark vs Giant Octopus / 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, I'm willing to give more latitude to other SciFi movies. Afterall the intelligent dialogue and directing (Ziller) here was certainly better. Even with this, watching a giant storm and boring people arguing about how to stop it just didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.

I was surprised at how much I liked it. I'm not familiar with the Sumarian culture at all, so I can't comment on that. But I can say that it had a solid story line and even though there are places where credulity is a bit stretched, well, aren't most movies like that? The acting is surprisingly good, too.

The songs come mainly from Blue Matter and Still Warm, both seminal Scofield. Scofield himself tears up the fretboard. But don't expect mindless pyrotechnics. His phrasing is pure jazz, more idiomatic to the sax than the guitar at times. To see Dennis Chambers live is a rare treat. Hearing him drum here is a humbling experience. The double bass work alone is a clinic for aspiring drummers. The band is amazingly tight, navigating time signatures and breaks adroitly. The dynamic range of the band makes each song a much more visceral experience than the studio versions.Buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album from a Great Concert","review":"I just saw John Scofield in Colorado a week ago and that brought me back to some earlier recordings.

Sure, as other reviewers have noted, there is some good stuff in the last few chapters but it's too hard to get at to be useful. And usefulness in my lexicon is mandatory for a \\"handbook\\".

The most astounding of these is the idea to digitize music, and have it available to be transferred via high-speed phone lines to the consumer. Keep in mind that this book was written in 1988, and he explains that this proposal was prepared in 1982, before the invention and widespread popularity of the Compact Disc! He knew, twenty years before the fact, that purchasing music at a store, on media was an outdated process.Regardless of how you feel about Zappa's music, this shows his absolute genius.

I think Mr.Feigen's description of his method of dealing is accurate even though my father's german-jewish accent is slightly overdone. My father may have been a shrewd and sometimes ruthless negotiator but he always saught a good home for \\"his pictures\\" and could judge a great one from a \\"postage stamp\\".

In many of the stories Mr. Feign is critical of collectors, dealers, and administrators of art museums who are now dead and unable to defend themselves. Richard the Great emerges as the only noble and knowledgable person who always does the right thing and always barely misses the gold ring of finding and acquiring a lost art treasure. If you are interested in an egomaniac's view of his life and the shortcomings of others, written in the guise of stories about art this is the book for you. The editor should be fired for not catching the number of duplications of facts and typographical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let us not forget Secretariat's groom","review":"Raymond Wolfe's great \\"Secretariat\\" is a masterpiece, and the pictures immortal. But I would like to give credit for the one man who had more to do with the well being of the greatest horse and knew him better than any person. That was his groom, Edward \\"Shorty\\" Sweat, probably the most professional, intuitive and caring groom in the business. He was a prince of a man who knew everything possible about Secretariat. Secretariat loved him like no other human--that says it all. The groom is always forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Racing Fans","review":"This was the first biography/hagiography of Secretariat, and it was impossible to find for many years. A few years ago there was a limited edition of the book, but it was out of the price range for most Secretariat fans. Thank goodness the book is now readily available. Woolfe has wonderful photographs to back his prose and it is a fine companion to Bill Nack's book.

Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"This book is great and chock full of beautiful, rich, and colorful photos; Secretariat almost looks real in some of them. It has just as much accurate information as Bill Nack's \\"The Making of a Champion,\\" but doesn't go into the tedious detail of related bloodlines and the syndicate deal made for Secretariat. I found this book to be better than Nack's because of that, the pacing, and the gorgeous photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant Again!!","review":"I have to admit that when I bought this CD back in 1992, I did not like it.

The worst, most generic piece of junk ever put out under that name.Rik Emmitt is sorely missed, and this album drowns in mediocrity without his presence.I gave this cd away, I hated it so much. One would hope they could at least live up to a song like \\"Follow Your Heart\\" from Thunder 7 (which only used Rik a little bit), but they cannot even muster a song close to that on this dreadful waste of recording materials.If I could give it a ZERO I would.AVOID, if you liked any other Triumph album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the main talent","review":"This album proves that Rik Emmett was the driving force of Triumph and the most adept musician. Although much heavier sounding than any other Triumph work, the songwriting and musicianship is flat and uninteresting. The production values are decent and one song made it to a movie soudtrack (Hellraiser III) This work is OK if you think of it as a different band with the same name, but it can't compare to any other Triumph album and it's a good thing that they called it quits after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me very uneasy.","review":"This book is written as though the main character, Gabriel Anderson, had wrote out his experience and I (as the reader) am reading his words.

When his headaches and nose bleeds begin he ignores them and ends up in the hospital.A male figure in the shadows talks inside Gabe's head and Gabe can see evil, dead beings.

It is good exposure to America of the deaf among us, and their history. It has great short films and characteristic brief snippets of deaf relating their life, their history, their frustrations, their triumphs (loved the Gallaudet president story).Also, her noting that the latter part emphasis on Cochlear Implants was quantitatively speaking potentially misleading to the uninformed viewer. America in many cases believes and at the least hopes that technology and science will be the savior of everything, including deafness. They also love the latest, greatest attempts from this field. So, Cochlear Implants are the latest offering.The plays were highlights for me of this well done effort. As others have pointed out, it is always so difficult to compress 200 years into 2 hours, but this is good attempt. Maybe its success will inspire more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This documentary was wonderful. I want to watch it again and again. I am a college student learning ASL and Deaf Culture, and I absolutely loved this program. There is so much to learn about the history and diversities within deaf culture, and this documentary covered so much from so many different viewpoints. Each story told is different and so you can really get a sense for the complexity of this culture. It will tug at your heart. Throughout the program are not only interviews, stories, and history, but also clips from deaf filmmakers and deaf artistic expressions. It's a great program."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Overcoat","review":"I purchased this item thinking it was the English translation, probably because the title was in English and I could find no indication that it was the original Russian text.

I develop non-trivial client/server applications 10+ hours a day for a living. The concept behind the book sounded useful. I was wrong. A big listing of classes and method signatures is not useful. How is...Socket: public void setOOBInline(boolean on) throws SocketException... helpful information? It doesn't aid me in finding the method I need to do something, it doesn't aid me in figuring out what a method does... it doesn't help me to understand how to use a class or method, it is just raw information.Browsing through the on-line javadocs are far easier and more productive for me. If you want a good Java reference book, the \\"Java Class Libraries\\" books are FAR more useful (and I highly recommend them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential book for any Java Pro","review":"I use the online version of this book very often.

The book is lightweight and as dense as your average dictionary, which is great when all you're interested in is finding that certain special method. Unfortunately, it also resembles the first edition of O'Reilly's Java in a Nutshell, which means it could use some improvement. The returned-by and passed-to information (absolutely essential for finding relationships) is stuck way in the back of the book. And all the classes are alphabetized by name rather than package, which leaves a lot of completely unrelated classes next to each other. In short, get O'Reilly's Nutshell first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better and faster then browsing the online material","review":"1) See the title .. All info you ever need about API structure, classes, details .. in your hand and not in 100 IE bookmarks.2) I have to deal with class files on the bytecodes level and didn't expect this book to be much useful for me - suprise !!! It has an excellent table \\"Class File Format\\" ( I had to built one such for myself long time ago ) and some others regarding bytecodes issues - very nice and comfortable.

It is an indispensible desk reference for any serious Java programmer. My only gripe with the 2000 edition is the same gripe I and many other users have and it's the size of the book. The compactness of the 1998 edition was and is what makes it so practical. I don't know why the fonts of this new edition had to be made bigger yet when the 1998 font size and book size OBVIOUSLY had a lot of fans. Anyways, maybe two sizes would help then. Anyways, I did not buy this book because of those issues although I am still itching to get it anyways. (To Addison-Wesley: Please, please publish a compact version.)Another great thing, Patrick Chan actually sent me an email about my review of the 1999 Almanac that contained the same criticism and I thought it was a nice touch.Great book otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a funny show","review":"I grew up watching the rocky and bullwinkle show and shared their show with my daughter every chance we could.

It is the first atlas I reach for when I need to explain something quickly to someone with little knowledge of the sky. The level of detail makes it good for outdoor use (with an appropriate red light, of course) with binoculars. Good software is increasingly making tools like this obsolete, but somehow hard-copy atlases always seem to have a place, and they're handy to grab off the shelf and just casually study too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool atlas","review":"I have a 4 inch apo and if you have scope like me, buy this little gem. Sky maps are just beatiful, having exactly as much info as I need. They are beautifully rendered by a master. Maps overlap generously.Tables are above every map and they are pleasure to use. Of course there is only 912 deep sky objects, but if you have a light bucket over 10\\" you need an atlas at least as heavy as your scope:) For me it is more than enough.There are very interesting all-sky maps of various objects distribution. They give you a good feeling of our position in Galaxy and Universe.I gave only four stars because in the field it can catch dew and you have to be carefull. The Moon map is not the best and for a reflector, so not good for me.Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect size","review":"In addition to this atlas, I own Sky Atlas 2000, Uranometria, and the Millenium Star Atlas, and this is by far the one I use the most. It is a scaled down version of Sky Atlas 2000, and it's reduced size, the convienience of having more of the sky fit on each map, and the increased overlap between charts far outweigh the extra detail you get with Sky Atlas. Of course there are times when more detail is needed, but at these times it's usually best to go stright to Uranometria or MSA. There are a few annoying printing errors, but not enough to interfere with the practicality of the atlas. There are enough deep sky objects plotted to keep you busy for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable!","review":"I purchased this DVD after seeing the program on television.

With chapter titles such as \\"Reluctant Modernism, The Past a Present\\", \\"Derrick Time, Architecture, Memory and the Poetics of Ruin\\" and \\"Wright's Piano,Imagining the New Chicago\\", this book deals with the authors opinion of the societal and intellectual effects of the fire. For example, \\"...Chicagoans... indulged the apocalyptic rhetoric occasioned by the fire and to an extent were even flattered by it,...reluctant modernists who would gladly face the present as long as it was safely anchored in the past.\\" (page 57, paragragh 1) The good point about this book is that it is filled with pre and post fire pictures of Chicago.

He does not cover everything, and if you want to find out the most recent developments as far as boatbuilding, you have to subscribe to the blogs online. (such as on Ted Moores' site).

It's a well done movie despite the few corny romantic scenes, and is well written with characters loosely based on actual pilots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunters","review":"this product was delivered on time and was new as advertized.

I remember my favorite song being \\"The Sheriff\\". The title song is 10 minutes long and certainly not a second was wasted. \\"The Sheriff\\" is catchy and still is a symbol of my nostalgia. Other good songs include Hoedown, an astounding version of Copland's version and Fugue, a tune that always reminds me of this album.

From the debut to Brain Salad Surgery words are not easily assembled as to how brilliant the material was, is, and will always be.Greg's voice and the intro of From The Beginning is beauty in motion. The Sheriff makes us feel as if we are in the wild west (rather impressive since the guys grew up several thousand miles away) and ELP's cover of Hoedown may be one of the 10 best instrumental's in rock history (not that Abaddon's Bolero should be overlooked).The interplay of Keith's keyboards (always the best sounding for the moment) and Carl's drumming can be appreciated on the title track.We can't say the show will never end but the memories don't have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!","review":"It is the 2nd best ELP album(only to Brain Salad Surgery)with such notables as:From the beginning.

ELP, Rush, and Pink Floyd are my three fav bands. This very well may be my favorite album ever.

Hoedown makes for a great instrumental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Right Balance","review":"A well-balanced mix of songs and sounds makes this album one of their most approachable. As is often the case with progressive rockers, the soloing at times gets a bit too demonstrative (as on the title cut) and ELP's lyrics have always lacked something that Jethro Tull and Yes seem to pull off, but precise songs like the cult favorite \\"From the Beginning\\" and superb ensemble pieces like \\"Rodeo\\" make this CD a great buy. A good introductory CD for the uninitiated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be pulled from publication.","review":"Wait untill 5th edition comes out or try Linux Secrets by Barkakati.I am going to throw this book away and replace it with somthing else,it is not worth the space it wastes on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't go into much depth, gets confusing.

A narrator in voice-over tells most of the story; there is almost nothing remaining of Shakespeare's script. It runs about a half-hour, and the effort to abridge and tidy it up for the eyes of children resulted in the nunnery scene (for example) vanishing as mysteriously as does Ophelia. The lines it includes are mangled beyond recognition.While Hamlet isn't a story for children (so why make the adaptation?), this is just insulting.

Physics professor Parker begins with basic descriptions of life on Earth. He then devotes three chapters to Mars, including the possible existence of microfossils in a chunk of Mars that hit the Earth as a meteorite. Parker moves on to extrasolar planets and the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence. After touching on interstellar flight, he closes with a discussion of the claim that Earth has been visited by aliens. All this adds up to a broad brush overview, leaving out most of the detailed arguments associated with this question. The writing, which avoids equations and elaborate statistics, seems to be aimed at the high school level. Some of the black and white illustrations, particularly the caricatures of scientists, are surprisingly crude."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Impress Me Much!!!!","review":"This song is not the most intelligent or the best she has written.

I was able to configure it under Ubuntu Linux, then learned that the camera element is mounted UPSIDE-DOWN in the unit.Update February 2010: I did manage to find a current Vista/Windows7 compatible driver for this webcam. It is on the Trust products site, search on 14383, you will be taken to the support page for a better looking product WB-3400T that apparently is compatible with this webcam. For Rev. 2 of this product, you want the driver for 14383 (no extension, though you may want to try 14383-02 and 14383-03 if the 14383 fails, who knows?).

It gave me a good explanation on installation of all the components in general. I'm tons more confortable to build a PC now. You other readers are very biased probbably because you either don't know anything about comps before you read this book, or need everything laid out for you even though it wouldn't be possible to explain it better than in this book.

Only complaint was a couple motherboard installation illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money to buy better components","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I have to agree with other unflatering reviews. This book does not provide any of the detailed information required to build a PC. The four example systems built are redundant for the most part. There's virtually no troubleshooting information and no discussion of tradeoffs between the competing systems (price, performance, relaibility, etc.). The information that is provided is sometimes better explained in the associated product information.Again, I guess I was expecting more detail from this book, but I still don't think it's even appropriate for the beginner.Bottom line ... save your money and buy some some better parts for your PC system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I don't want to think that I'm overrating this book, but I honestly love it.

The core principles are sound, but don't follow any of the more specific advice - this book was right on the money immediately before dual-core began dominating the market, which has been several years.[Original review from 2005]This is a REALLY great book. It's not quite \\"PC Building For Dummies,\\" but it also isn't all confusing and scary. It's maybe \\"PC Building For People Who Have Used Computers A Lot And Have Brains.\\" It has lots of photos, some highly informative overview chapters, three different step-by-step builds, and a final chapter explaining how to get from hardware to software by installing Windows and the appropriate drivers, etc. Even tells you what the most commonly made mistakes by novice builders are and how to avoid them. If I hadn't found this book, I probably wouldn't have tried to build my own machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than I expected","review":"This book was easy to understand very thorough and made for the layman. I give it a definite thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempest review","review":"Extremely disappointing. I was hoping to share some scenes with my students to help them understand the play. I'm afraid I would turn them off Shakespeare entirely if I showed them even a touch of this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"wacky","review":"this movie is a recording of the play. The sound is a little off, but it is extremely accurate. I watched it for a ckass and suffered through it for the accuracy, follwing with the book. It is a weird story to begin with , but waching it in play form was slightly boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempest review","review":"Very true to the original play and without any of the fancy special effects that some directors like to rely on. Excellent actors. The characterization of Ariel was exceptionally good. Costumes tended to be a bit exaggerated, but true to the time period fashions. The director took quite a bit of liberty in the first scene between Stefano, Trinculo, and Caliban, lending it a lot of semi-awkward sexual innuendo that tends to either make the audience laugh their heads off or squirm in their seats. Other than that, there is little to nothing of the play's content that might offend an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like Peanuts, you are weird!","review":"Charlie Brown is a charming character to watch.

I was unable to save/find all the \\"slaves\\" on the first go around so I bought the book to help with the unknowns. This is not a book to be used to cheat the game or make it easier to get \\"around\\" obstacles. Even though it tells you what to do and where to go you still have to preform the moves and button combinations to succeed at the task at hand. The book is laid out well and has very colorfull and detailed pictures of the game areas. People that don't have the game would find it entertaining. And yes, after using the book I did save all the slaves and gained access to the bonus at the end of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Really Needed","review":"I bought this book to solve the seemingly impossible, how to survive the hard spots and find secret escapes or avoid things altogther. The book is good, but it has none of that in it. Instead it tells you what you already know, run here, jump there. There are no cheat codes, or insight into how to make the bad guys go away. The book just offers what I had already figured out, doing the things required is another matter entirely. If you have the reflexes of a lab rat on huge quantities of caffeine you can do as the game requires, and the book reiterates. Otherwise it won't shed any light on more than some hidden levels, but those could've been found eventually without the book. Nice book, well laid out, but not very useful ultimately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insight into an obscure period","review":"I read this book years ago, but it's stuck in my mind ever since, so it was a delight to see it available again. The book is well written and the characters are vivid, their motivations clear, their actions consistent with their stories. The book covers the marriage of William the Conqueror and his wife Matilda, from before 1066 through the later years of their marriage when their children were tearing the family and the country apart. It's a somewhat sad book but a great way to introduce yourself to the events and personalities of the era. It's also well written so the prose is a pleasure to read. If you like historical fiction, this is an excellent addition to your must-read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all interesting","review":"This book started out interesting, with her getting pregnant and having to hide the birth of her child, but it went downhill from there. The writing was so boring, or the writing style, or the subject, or all of the above, that I ended up not even caring about what happened to the character and had to force myself to finish the book to see what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a good feel for the character or for the lives of the other people in this book. It was so dull, all I remember is her having a lot of children and how her husband wasn't the nicest of people. Otherwise, I found my self reading the Wikipedia entry for Matilda, that was more interesting than this book was! I don't think I will try to read another book by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"Always on the lookout for different writers, I was excited about reading this book. Unfortunately, the story line did not fulfill the promise of being about Matilda.

(Mr. Kennedy was related to the Dandridge family.) I recommend this volume to anyone who enjoys this topic. In addition, the writing is fabulous: colorful, original, and fun. I found unique phrases and new words on almost every page (hence the highlighter); in fact, for six of the new words, this book was the only source for those words listed in the OED online. (Can you find them?) Socially, look for a northern visitor's view of early 19th-century southern perspectives on slavery; he is quite insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity the English Horn!","review":"It turns out that recordings of solos by the English Horn are very scarce. I took a chance on this one, because I needed something that would let my music-appreciation class hear what an English Horn sounds like.Unfortunately, this recording sounds like what you'd get if a rank amateur was getting the audio feed from an over-used 78-rpm recording.

Take a grinder and grind up a coup[le of cheap asprins and you'll get the same effect. Stanback is now, nothing more than powdered asprin with a little caffein thrown in a speed up the asprin.

But since books are more profitable, writers and publishers prefer them. So you wade through all those pages of a book, only to realize you've learned as much as could have been covered in a less time-consuming booklet. This is such a work. The author does offer a sensible program for getting in shape, but he cloaks it in a lame story. Is it worth the money? If it motivates you to get and keep in shape, yes. You may like it. I got awfully bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Writing","review":"I don't often take time to review a book, and I was raised on not saying anything at all if I couldn't say something good.

I'm returning my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced Advice","review":"This was an interesting and enhoyable read. The concept is to wrap an engaging story around a concept for long-term physical fitness. While the book sprinkles specifics throughout in teasing manner, all is summarized at the end into a practical program.

Visual Basic code!Furthermore, the title is totally inappropriate: none of the supplied code is \\"ready-to-run.\\" In part because it contains too many errors, but more importantly because the sample code is too academic to be really useful in a real life application.Do not waste your money on this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad song for Britney","review":"If you knew me I always have had a beef with Britney actually this has a nice beat and this might be her best song since 00Lyrics 2/10 Production 10/10 Music 9/10 Overall 8/10 top 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a 'poison'!","review":"Wow!

So when I listen to this, I have to skip 30-40 seconds into it just so I could actually listen to it.So aside from the little issue I have with that, this is a decent remix for Britney fans (and any remix fans in general)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Britney's worst singles","review":"I really hate this song; Britney's vocals are shrill and breathy, the lyrics are banal and trite (the whole \\"love or lover as a drug\\" metaphor has really gotten old), and the production is bland with the James Bond hook being incredibly obnoxious.

Does the History Channel think we all have ADD? Is it a way to grab the attention of channel surfers?But when it's a continuous episode, the repetition of content/graphics within each episode gets to be a distraction then extremely annoying. How many times do we have to be told the same scientists are out to prove the same theory! WE ALREADY KNOW THAT!Each episode is really 20 minutes of content stretched into an hour show. I can't give this collection more than 2 of 5 stars.

Either the plant simply was not in the book, or the picture quality was of poor detail. Actually, I cannot completely fault the author for this, but rather the Missouri Conservation Commission, who has been doing things sort of half way for years now. Pity. In the introduction of the book, which should be read carefully before purchase, someone has stated, if reference to the large number of flowering plants in Missouri, that \\"Even this figure should not scare the amateur because many groups (genera, have so many species that only an expert could possibly take an interest in identifying them.....\\"Now that is academic arrogance at it's best!

I also told my 90 year old grandmother to tune in and my Mom. We all really loved this movie. Pearl Fryar taught himself to do giant topiaries. He's won awards and has a huge garden that people come from everywhere to see and walk through. The movie speaks with friends, his pastor, neighbors and the many visitors that come to see his work. He does everything himself, often working late into the night. His creations are really amazing.

I liked it so much I bought The Bliss Album, then Jesus Wept. That was years ago. Finally I went back and bought this, the first album. It is just as great as the others, perhaps more musically varied, since the others have a more consistent sound. I don't know why I didn't buy it sooner. But it is great. Personally I would never have bought a religion-inspired album by anyone. But I never knew their music was such because the religious message is so low key it can apply to any relationship, romantic or otherwise. The result is a rarity- meaningful lyrics that don't overpower the music. I'd compare them to what I've heard from Creed in that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"If you want to know why Bill Gates is a rich geek and the authors of this book are only geeks, go ahead and buy it and try it. The installation instructions are incomplete and confusing. I ended up OVERWRITING AN ENTIRE HARD DRIVE, losing all the information! To subtitle this mess \\"Configuration and Installation\\" this is nothing short of false advertising. Shame on you guys! I don't know why the Linux and Unix people are unable to explain things clearly. I suspect that's they don't write code much better than they write English, and that's why so much software doesn't work too well. Of course, being lost-in-a-Jolt-Cola-buzz geeks, the author DO recommend that YOU GO OUT AND ASSEMBLE A SYSTEM JUST FOR LINUX! OK for the technoids, but not for the mere mortal. Some other reviewers give this book a 9, so decide for yourself if you want to risk your money.

And although I learned some lessons from it, I wouldn't recommend it to the absolute beginner.This book doesn't communicate with the reader well. I had to look back and forth for answers to my questions and only now(8 months later + 2 other linux books bought) begin to realize what I am doing.Slackware is designed for people that are somewhat familiar with Linux/Unix, which most people are not. Knowing that, they should have been very careful in explaining things to users, which they were not.In fairness, most Linux books emphasize what to do after Linux is installed, but the hardest part about Linux is getting past the beginning(install, kernel config, X, installing devices). Most books mention the beginning aspects so far apart that it easily confuses and discourages new users.This book may be okay if you have a companion book on it(Linux for Dummies or TY Linux in 24 Hours), but don't expect overnight success with! ! linux using this book by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of Art","review":"I could not resist writing a review of this book in order to encourage others to read it.

A rare and unusual book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound insights","review":"Found it a very new experience to read this book. It was quite fascinating to read the incredibly wide range of experiences of God, higher power or however individuals do or don't engage the divine. The opportunity to explore these very personal individual experiences was very artfully intertwined with the author's own life questions and experiences at a very deep level...it's a brave telling of deeply personal experiences that generously offered the opportunity to walk with her on this journey. It profoundly changed my perspective of how each person has a truly individual experience of the divine.

There are a huge number of web development tools out there, and a confusing variety of techniques for web page development and for web server management. After reading this book my decision was clear. I use the Web Tcl Server which I down-loaded and booted first shot. Instead of having to juggle a number of techniques I can now just stick to Tcl. It is the common glue across the company and it is also liberating. People can use their own tools to create various aspects of the web site and yet central policies can be maintained. For example, everyone can use their favorite word processors instead of being forced to use a Web management tool such as Front Page that is universally hated. Get this book.

It is very interesting to learn all about the workings of a restaurant, about Perrier and Roquefort cheese but this felt more like a reference book than a biography.

It's boring, boring, boring! Stellar cast of guitarists notwithstanding, Mr Rodgers is capable of so much more. Even The Firm and The Law were better than this. And don't even mention the travesty that was Queen + Paul Rodgers: laugh - I gave the DVD away after one watch! Thankfully, Paul has come to terms with his past and is now back to his best.

I normally adore art house flicks, but this one has the pacing of a snail. There are only a few \\"shocking\\" scenes, and it came long after this viewer had any interest left. I will say this though, over the last 25 minutes of the film the pace quickens and may be considered a \\"payoff\\", but like I said, I basically lost interest. Don't believe the hype.

Dracula's daughter was really good, and only one hour, and never boring. Yes it was tame, but creepy and fun.Listen to all of these one star reviews, don't waste your time. Daughter's of Darkness is boring and not erotic at all. No scary parts, no gore, no interesting writing. Andrea Rau is beautiful, but her character is dull. In my opinion, the antagonist needs to be twice as bad as the protagonist is good. This antagonist is boring. The character Stefan is worse than her. Just so you can gauge my taste,I like most of the classic Universal Monsters, as well as Hammer films. I have to admit, I am not a big fan of the Euro-trash movies. Technically this movie is good. The acting is decent, and the photography is good, etc. And that is the only good thing that I can say about this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying And Dissapointing...","review":"I love vampire movies and this was one of the oddest, didn't make much sense, vampire movies ever.

In fact, the sensuous lesbian scene is the only way the filmmakers could think of to keep you awake during, say, the first 45 minutes of the film. The lesbian love scenes are cheesy and obviously put in to titilate and make the film talked about, and hence presumably sell videos down the line.If you want a great 'bad' film, the misleading \\"great Vampire film\\", Daughters of Darkness, is it but there isn't a single Vampire in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped","review":"Painfully slow movie.

This is the most poorly edited book I have ever seen in print. It is rife with typos, mispellings, and other mistakes. For example, on every single page of an entire chapter, the chapter heading reads, \\"U.N. SANCITONS.\\" Pages are littered with all sorts of mistakes that an editor (or Scharf himself) should have caught on even the most preliminary skimming. As my title indicates, I would sue my editor if I were Scharf. Additionally, while Scharf provides interesting problems and scenarios for discussion at the beginning of each chapter, the ensuing materials are usually badly outdated, oftentimes from questionable sources (for instance, the Christian Science Monitor), or so haphazardly strung together that it is difficult to get a coherent picture of the topic under discussion.Surely there has to be a better text on the United Nations."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and documented and no typos","review":"I have this book in my hand and I am looking thoroughly at the citations, the bibliography, and for typos.

Written in question and answer format it makes the information accessible, if however, disjointed. There is nothing in here about the ideas of Greece or her military campaigns or why she's important to western civilization. But information on how Greeks drank wine, when they married, etc. gives the child familiarity with Greeks as people. The answer to why Greeks built temples is to provide homes for their gods. If you're looking for a painless introduction to the word \\"Greece\\", this book is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Foundation of the Dhamma","review":"I purchased this book about a year ago and it has been extremely beneficial. As a fledgling Theravadan, the earliest Pali suttas are important to me. As Bhante Punna (Pittsburgh Buddhist Center) and I discussed yesterday, this anthology of the Buddha's seminal teachings is the foundation on which all of Buddhism was built.If you are wondering what all the hype is about regarding Buddha, it's in this book. Everything from an objective account of his birth, to his incredible life as a world redeemer, to his teachings regarding meditation, to what people were discussing about him in the years after his death. You can read this book and hang in any conversation about Buddhism. If you are already a practitioner, this is your foundation right here, whether you practice Mahayana or Theravada.Enjoy this book. If you have any questions about further readings feel free to email me. I wish you happiness and well-being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"The Pali Canon takes up a LOT of space and there is just so much to read that it would take the normal person a lifetime.Bhikku Bodhi has taken all the truly relevant discoursed of the Buddha and put them into categories so that they are easy to find, easy to cross reference and really understand the dharma.The translation into English is also really well done. It is perfect for any night stand, classroom, casual reading or serious practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Buddhism","review":"The Pali Canon is the definitive guide and words of the true Buddha. The teachings in this book go back 2600 years ago and are truly a masterpiece! If you are new to Buddhism then this book if wonderful to add to your collection.

I would recommend this book to a learned sage as well as a beginner...."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than a book","review":"Thank you to Bhikku Bodhi for his tremendous effort. If you are a serious practitioner, especially a lone practitioner as I am, this book is invaluable for making available the undiluted teachings of the Buddha himself. Most of the books in my Buddhist library have been helpful to some extent or other but most are explanations of the teachings, i.e. the Buddha's words once-removed. I rank very highly What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula. This book is much more extensive. It is also more accessible than The Middle Length Discourses (trans. Bhiddhu Nanamoli and Bhiddhu Bodhi) because it is organized into general topics, such as \\"The Human Condition\\" and \\"Mastering the Mind.\\" Highly recommended as a life reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summary of Theravada Buddhist teachings","review":"Anybody interested in pursuing an understanding of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings can tell you how overwhelming it can be to try to sift through the religious texts. First of all, the Pali canon is quite huge, such that it would take a lifetime to read and absorb it all, and the printed versions of it (in Pali, there is still no complete English translation) are anywhere from 35 to 58 volumes. From this vast ocean of scripture Bhikkhu Bodhi effectively organizes it into chapters based on major points of doctrine. Each chapter has a few pages of Bhikkhu Bodhi's own interpretation and explanation, but the bulk of the book is devoted to the scripture. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to better understand Buddhism (including Mahayana Buddhism). As for those who are as intensely interested in Theravada Buddhism as I am, I would say that this book, along with a good translation of the Dhammapada, is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"A lot of Buddhist works (and most other religious works) can tend to be daunting and unpenetrable.

Many of the tips are logical, but are good reminders for everyone.One of my favorite tips is really the most practical. Keep money in its proper perspective. \\"Money has no inherent value of its own. It's a tool to help you do things that are more important than acquiring more money.\\" Another favorite is: Don't make a budget--pay yourself first.

It is useful as a high level overview, but one cannot trust the details. In some places, the author appears to simply make stuff up. For example, on p118, the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable is correctly defined but is also claimed to be related to the SOCKS network proxy. On p243, it is suggested that the reader use \\"something like Perl or a shell script\\" to generate the random number needed for setting up X authentication. I had to search the Web to find a one-line perl expression to do this, and then I had to refer to volume 8 of my O'Reilly X set to figure out how X authentication really works. Very disappointing!If I were in the market for a Secure Shell book today, I'd wait for the new one coming from O'Reilly.

I found the book confusing and irritating. The author has a tendency to make awkward statements that leave me guessing.

It would seem I'm a minority as 'Pharmacist's Mate' is a best seller, however, I am prepared to take the risk. From the beginning the book is lacking in emotional maturity. Instead the reader is drawn into an inconclusive angst that suggests the beginnings of a severe psychological disorder on the part of the author.We all have father's. Eventually they die. There is a tendencey to golorify the dead in our bereavement to levels of greatness the breaved one could never have achieved in life. Am I to feel empathy for a man who had a penchant for guns (a fixation that is never really explained) and who dies in relative peace, granted anonmity, surrounded by his loved ones? He leaves behind of course a daughter, who's sole purpose it seems is to procreate his and her own, insignificant myth.It is a little banal. The language unchallenging. I wish I could say more.

However, having lost a father and being able to know what the author is going through does not a good book make. This is boring and while there are some interesting insights she tries to be too clever, for example the numbering switch in the middle. This book defines smug, she thinks she is better read than the reader and wants to show it off. But it is an arrogant smugness, an undeserved confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unedited disappointment","review":"This book is not without its strengths. The selections from the author's father's journal are interesting. And I do not discount the personal experiences described, either the father's death, or the author's fertility treatments. The problem is that, as written, there is only enough real material for a long magazine article. The rest consists largely of references to what the author is eating, wearing, or listening to on the radio. It is difficult to imagine what, if anything, has been excised. In one excruciatingly cloying passage, the author repeatedly refers to herself in the third person as 'the possibly pregnant person.' I am an enthusiastic reader of McSweeney's, and wanted to like this, but could not.

I was very surprised to read that they were led here by their pastor, John Robinson. In fact, John Robinson stayed behind in Leiden, Holland and died there in 1625. His wife who succeeded him once made plans to travel to America but for reasons unknown canceled them. As the assembly which had met at the \\"green gate\\" dwindled, she later joined the Dutch Church.John Robinson is rememberd for having said, \\"God hath yet more truth to bring forth from His holy word.\\"Unfortunately, Rhodes doesn't seem as scholarly as others who have written about denominations, such as Mead, Hill and Atwood in the Handbook of Denominations, which is what I reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many embarrassing errors and omissions.","review":"Ron Rhodes does not seem to possess the scholarship and background knowledge needed to produce an accurate guide to the Christian denominations in North America. His accounts of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy are especially poor. A frankly embarrassing level of ignorance leads Rhodes to make numerous historical, theological, and terminological errors of fact. One despairs of an author of a \\"complete guide\\" who can write concerning the First Vatican Council (1869/70):\\"More than 800 Roman Catholic priests (sic) from around the world attended.\\" Forty years ago a Jesuit priest, the late Father John Hardon, S.J., published \\"The Protestant Churches of America\\", a work of such impartial, objective, and deep scholarship that it was set as a textbook in many Protestant seminaries.

The book also gives you the break down on the things each church does. The polity of the churches are mention, baptism modes, if the church practices foot washing etc. There views on doctrines like church goverment, Trinity, eschatology, etc. There are also \\"Fast Facts\\" on secondary issues like Freewill, rapture, infant salvation, etc. This book was perfect in what Dr. Rhodes set out to do.

In review of this book, and three others on the same topic (which includes my own yet to be published book) - Rhodes book has the least amount of information (only 105 denominations, compared to 179 in the National Council of Churches book, 193 in The Handbook of Denominations (Frank Mead/Samuel Hill) and 227 on my book (Guide to Denominations - Robert Stearns).Further - many of the denominations are mis-identified as to the family they belong to, and the Churches of God (Reformation Theology group of churches) totally omitted. Very limited in statistics. The interesting feature, however, was the lay out and the quick reference \\"bullets\\".Robert H Stearns, Reviewer"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Rhodes describes a huge variety of American denominations. In each case he gives a tiny bit of history, something about beliefs - usually taken from official statements, statistics, and contact information.The book is very useful for those who want to sort out and keep straight the various conservative \\"splinter\\" groups which have recently been established. It is less useful in describing the larger, older, \\"mainline\\" denominations which these protest denominations regard as \\"liberal.\\" Despite other reviews to the contrary, I thought the author's conservative bias was pretty evident. He cannot be expected in a very brief description to go into nuances of history, but he makes many factual errors which will be obvious to the well informed and misleading to a casual reader.Anyone interested in the subject will be better served by Mead, Hill, and Atwood's Handbook of Denominations in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is On Target..","review":"This book was never intended to be a Theology lesson on every church out there. It is a well organized topically given exercise of who the Christian Churches are. Frome whom were they spawned? What are their beliefs based on Historical and Creedal Precedents (statements) and that's all it is meant to accomplish. Perhaps if Mr. Rhodes wishes to make use of some literary criticism whereby some here have chosen to pass on him and maybe in his next version of this book he may choose to give a broader depiction with a better Prologue and Commentary area. But a book about Denominations is just that. A book that tells us as factually as can be sought out through preserved data of who, what and where these churches have come from and what do they believe. No reason for a scholarly lesson on \\"is this church' teachings this or that and why or why not\\" is needed! That is not this book's intent. It is not a Theology instructional manual of The Churches.

I read both before seeing the new movie and it did not hinder by enjoyment of the movie in any may."},{"rating":"2","title":"A action packed book","review":"I liked this book because it had many emotions and it had many action scenes.If you like books with suspense,action,and love you will like this book.This book will take you on a wild ride of many decisions of a jedi.This book will make you want to continue to the next page.Every chapter is more exciting than the last.You will want to read this book this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"even though i knew.","review":"i still didnt think it would happen. this book was great, it caught the darkness perfectly. you will probably get more out of this book than you will watching the movie. you will know what they were thinking at these moments when you read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"I could not give the unabridged audio version a higher recommendation. It is wonderfully read and the sound effects offer an incredible listen. If you are considering the unabridged version, be prepared to be entertained through eleven CDs (14 hrs)worth of non-stop action. If the movie is as good as the novel, George Lucas will have hit a grand slam."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much better :(","review":"The author spends the entire first half of the book on the battle over Coruscant and the rescue of Palpatine. This leaves little room for Anakin's fall to the dark side or other important elements such as the Battle of Kashyyk, the death of the Jedi or even the construction of Darth Vader's life support suite which he spent an entire 2 paragraphs on! The second half of the book seemed rushed and I was largely dissapointed.You can also clearly ascertain that Mr. Stover is a martial artist by his unending need to describe, in detail, the fighting styles of each of the jedi.It could have been so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good attempt (may contain spoilers)","review":"I ran out and got this book the day it came out and from what is in it there is no way other than watering the story into a \\"kid friendly\\" film that the film will be anything lower than a very high PG-13 ( not a spoiler but general grevious punches through someones head and rips them out of a chair in a very gory display) the book is good but there is one major problem, the \\"this is how it feels to be (insert charactor here)\\" parts.the way certain parts of the story (that I cant get into without spoiling the film) were written that actually bring tears to my eyes. and what would a review be without a small spoiler that has no importance to the story. here it is, the necklace that Anakin gave Padme in episode 1 will show up at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected, better than I could have ever hoped for.","review":"Having looked forward to this novel for many months (if not years), I was pleasantly surpised by the author's writing style. Mr. Stover made the book come alive. I could almost see the action in my mind.I was pleased at how well Mr. Stover was able to get inside the character's thoughts/minds. You truly feel for these characters as their lives fall apart around them.I was also glad that there were moments of deliberate humor. It helped to lighten what is a very harsh & sad tale.Having been a fan of Star Wars for most of my life, I am glad that this novel did not disappoint & left out some things for the movie.After reading this novel, I am confident that this will be the most amazing movie and will nicely wrap-up nearly 30 years of work by George Lucas."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Clap,Clap*","review":"A wonderful book! My congratulations to Matthew Stover.. I read this book in 6 days.I highly reccomend this book. It is very,very well written and has lots of emotion. It however is fairly gross. I am not just saying it is gross 'cause I am a girl.It adds in more disgusting stuff then the movie, however I don't think parents should restrict thear children to reading this book. It has no bad language whatsoever. Overall it is one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars books ever. Unlike others, it is lengthy and is more intended for young adults than children, which is a nice change. This book has 418 pages and 21 long chapters. I finished this book within 24 hrs., but only because it's long battle scenes, descriptive writing and interesting \\"This is how it feels to be [insert character]\\" extra, kept me wanting more. I was satisfied, but disappointed it was done when I reached the last page. This has to be one of the most emotional Star Wars books to date. It's non-stop action, moderate violence, and emotional mind games are a bit overwhelming, but this is all about the Eps. III experiance. I hope to see the movie in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse Into The Shadows of His Soul!","review":"A Glimpse Into The Shadows of His Soul. Matthew Stover does just that! Once again, another excellent addition in the movie based books in the Star Wars saga. This book, like the others, is chock full of insight that you may have missed while watching the movie and will focus in on every detail of the story and climatic battles. My favorite parts of the book is when Stover careful crafts in the lore and back history of the Sith and when he sneaks in some added and most helpful information that the movie left out, for example...ah read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion to the movie.","review":"I enjoyed the revenge of the sith novelization immensly. It went into the further details of the story, that may not have translated well to the screen. Stover proves himself a capable author and worthy of the fact that lucas picked him for the novilization. The only part that annoyed me after a while was the This is how it feels to be (Insert character here).. While a great way to get inside the charater's heads I felt that there might have been a better narative way of doing it without the repetative statement, as it grated after a while. But that is a relativly minor point in an otherwise excellent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book it helps.","review":"This adaptation actually has a good narrative flow unlike the book version of Attack of the Clones. I liked this book a lot because they actually explained what was left out in the movie. The book is a knockdown drag out firefight. I am of course letting my bias as a Star Wars fan slip out here but since serious fans are going to be the only ones reading the adaptation anyway I don't think that matters.Overall-Read this book darker is better"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book finally delivers","review":"As a huge Star Wars fan growing up, I greatly anticipated the release of the prequels. The movies were disappointing, with the books being better because they at least expanded on the emotions and motivations of the characters. The main question I kept asking was how Mr. Lucas was going to pull this off. How is he going to turn little Annie into Darth Vader, kill off all the Jedi and set up the the original Star Wars movie. This book delivers on all this! I actually had goosebumps reading the last page and immediately began to read my copy of the orignal Star Wars. The book amazingly makes all the other 5 movies/books better! I hope the movie is as good, but the book is an absolute must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best installment of them all","review":"The story and the characters in Revenge of the Sith are more interesting than in any other Star Wars book I have read. From cover to cover Revenge of the Sith delivered fresh insights about George Lucas's characters. Many things in this book absolutely blew me away. If the movie can come close to the book in capturing Palpatine's subtlety, the love many of the characters have for each other, the impossible choices Anakin is faced with, and the heart wrenching fall of Anakin, it will be the best of all the Star Wars movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"<Labyrinth of Evil> A fun book to read and a suitable build up to Revenge of the Sith. You start off with Obi Wan and Anakin doing what they do best by getting into a fortress undetected (oh and Obi Wan invents the eighth fighting style), all the way to a search for Darth Sidious that is interrupted by an unwelcome attack on Coruscant. If you love the Revenge of the Sith novel I recommend this for a good lead up.<Revenge of the Sith> This book was disappointing in the same way that Heath Ledgers \\"Joker performance\\" was disappointing. That is only because you know that everything else loses its beauty in comparison. Love the movie and love the novel even more.<Dark Lord: Rise of Darth Vader> An interesting look at what it was like in the early days of not only the Empire but also the Darth Sidious/Darth Vader alliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the best efforts of the author...","review":"Despite the best efforts of the author, Matthew Stover, the novelization of Episode III still shines through. Mr. Stovers style of writing is in stark contrast to the previous writers of Episodes I and II, Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore respectively, in that it is not good. Instead of adding to the book like the previous authors, Mr. Stover feels it necessary to sprinkle the book with useless and rather un-StarWars-like descriptions and asides. I still recommend that any star wars fan read this book, but be careful before you read anything else by Mr. Stover, lest you get more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for any StarWars Fan","review":"My wife and I both read this book after seeing the film.Stover does an excellent job of adapting the screenplay to book form. The novel is true to the film, adding dialogue and exposition that enhance the story without changing it. Stover's Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme all seem more 3-dimensional than the filmed characters, and Palpatine is more sinister.If you're a moderate to hardcore Star Wars fan, this book is probably a must buy item. But if, like me, you're a mild fan, this book is still a fun, adventurous read that answers a lot of questions raised by the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novelization","review":"This novelization was surprisingly well written, especially in comparison to others I have read on Luca's films. In fact, reading this novelization greatly enhances the film-viewing experience and ties up a lot of loose ends that aren't so obviously well tied up in the film. As I say, surprisingly good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally fulfilling the promise...","review":"After a campy but innocent hiccup with \\"Phantom Menace\\" (a decent adaptation by Terry Brooks) and just flat out disappointment in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" (R.A. Salvatore doing the best he could with that mess), we finally get the Star Wars we have been wanting for decades. Mr. Stover does a phenomenal job adapting what seems to be the best of the films to date, even experimenting with points of view, linear storytelling, and expanding the characterizations of previously one-dimensional characters. The downside is that the movie holds no surprises for me now, but the upside is that at least I have a movie to look forward to, instead of dread.Revenge of the Sith is shaping up to be what Return of the Jedi should have been: an action-packed, b@#%s-to-the-wall, space-operatic saga. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the movie","review":"I believe other reviewers said this as well, but I liked how the authors were able to fill in what was going on with Anakin before he became Vader. The third book wasn't quite as good, but it did explain why he never used force lightning and how he lost a significant amount of power after so much of him was replaced by machine and how he had to work to regain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I have been reading Star Wars novels on and off for about 20 years and really enjoy them Reecently we bought a series of Karen Travis's and saw thsi novel below. Sounded good but it is such a hard read and choppy and well just annoying to try and read.I have attempted a few times as I like the subject matter but just put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"4 aspect I will judge this story by, Story, Worldbuilding, Characterization and Emotional response.Story: 3 starsCharacterization:1 starWorldbuilding:3 starsEmotional response: 1 starsAdded note:I thought the book was actually weaker than the film, which as far as the prequel trilogy goes, was a first. This is partially due to Stover's irritating and rather immature style, he seems to cater to young adults in this book ( I wonder what his own, non-Starwars books are like) and partially because the movie was sublime and the best of all 6 Star Wars films."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEFT OUT TOO MUCH.NO WOOKIE BATTLE EITHER","review":"Books are supposed to have more than the movie.well thats not the case here.The writer never mentions chewbacca or anything about the wookie battle on their homeworld.Anyone who has seen the movie has seen this in the movie.If the book is supposed to be about the movie don't leave parts out from the movie.he also writes to much about the space battle at the start of the movie and doesnt go into enough detail on other things.They couldn't hire a better writer than this guy?Is it that hard to write about everything in the movie?Most movie books write about everything in the movie and then some.LUCAS SHOULD HAVE HIRED ALAN DEAN FOSTER THE ORIGINAL WRITER OF STAR WARS EPISODE IV.ALAN WROTE about the whole movie and a lot more not included in the movie.Thats why people liked brian daley or alan dean foster star wars books.they included more than the movie.but this writer falls way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so so bad","review":"This is the first movie adaptation novel I've ever read that is so much worse than the film itself. Who the heck is this guy? He's terrible. Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore both did a good job making enjoyable novels out of boring, poorly acted movies (episodes 1 and 2), yet you screw up the only watchable movie of the last three?AVOID"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero With no Fear-Oh please","review":"This book is about Anakin takin that final slide to the dark side, but it seems so straight forward for a Star Wars book. The authors style is the worst that I have personally ever seen, and I really didn't enjoy the book that I read in five hours, I would've rather read a Jedi Quest book. Mr. Stover used stupid little phrases like 'This is what its like to be Anaking Skywalker' to start entire chapters that centered on only the characters feelings, doing nothing to move the story along. His approach to everything was much too straight forward and the action was descrived horribly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds to your movie experience","review":"I like this book as a companion to the movie. You are given much more information as to what the characters are feeling and perceiving.He goes into great detail in the action scenes. And the romantic scenes between Padme & Anakin are nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I believe this book is the perfect companion to the movie, because they compliment each other very well. There were scenes that were cut from the movie that are explained here; there's scenes that are expanded here when compared to the movie.Mr. Stover stayed true to the movie, while adding very interesting insights into the different characters and situations, specially Anakin Skywalker. By the end of the book, you deffinetly get inside Anakin's head a lot deeper than the movie showed.I recommend this book enthusiastically to any Star Wars fan out there or just anyone in particular who enjoyed the movie Revenge of the Sith. I dont think you will be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and not enough new material","review":"I really enjoyed the movie. The book leaves something to be desired. Stover adds dialogue were it really isn't needed. He overindulges in drawn out conversations and innuendo and tries to explain why every little comment made by Anakin is the most important occurrence in the history of the galaxy. In many instances, especially with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he really takes away from the characters by adding to the dialogue and overdrawing on their feelings. It almost works with Anakins fall to the dark side but was really inappropriate in most of the book. There are also many unexplained references to other books (especially \\"Shatterpoint\\") that don't add to the story at all. Still, if you're looking for a vacation book and can stomach the additions, it's an ok read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I waited a very long long time!","review":"Yes, I was in high school the summer star wars came out....it was the movie of all movies....as me and my fellow classmates watch in shock all of the great visual effects, we knew this was a winner..... this is the first time that I actually read the book prior to seeing a movie...I am not going to get into the story plot, because, at this point if you don't know it then well.. you landed on the wrong planet, this earth.... what I will say is that the book will answer a lot of your unanswered questions from the movie with great detail...so read the book... and may the force be with you!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"i thought this was a great book took me a day to read fully i hope to see the movie awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wookiless","review":"There are a ton of Wookies in the movie trailer...there aren't ANY in this book...Other than that, I read this book in one week.

The tragedy is that we lost so many of our beloveds over the years, chiefly Peter Cushing and Sir Alec Guinness.Thanks to George Lucas for all the magic and the memories, and May The Force Always Be With Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try, Stover","review":"First, Stover tried, but he was stuck with Lucas's storyline.Anakin Skywalker has been nuttier than a fruitcake since the second episode. He doesn't change here either. So when he joins Palpatine there is no real surprise.He is drawn Passionless. In fact when he does the unthinkable (at least to Lucas) I didn't bat an eyelash.I wish I could say that Stover is a bad writer, but alas, a blaster was held to his head by his contract with George Lucas.George Lucas should NEVER have directed these prequels, and should have shared screen writing responsibles with a talent.I love the play (dialogue) between Leia and Hans in the Empire Strikes Back.Aside from my dissatisfaction, if you enjoy the Star Wars universe I recommend you get the book and check out the trailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a little consistency too much to ask?","review":"Leia is a super genius- she's got memories of her mother, who died immediately after she was born.

The story is about how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. The main character spends most of the movie either brooding or killing people, including children. Killing kids? Give me a break. Can't Hollywood think of anything positive for our kids to watch? My children are big fans of all the Star Wars movies but I won't let them watch this one again. The story line is also slow.

The fact is though, that most people, in order not to be bashed, simply view the film with the thought in mind that if they actually find flaws in it, then they will be ridiculed by others. I think this film is very overrated, and is not that great. I love classic films, and I have seen more than enough to know what is good and what isn't. I thought the story dragged in places, the acting was over done, and there wasn't enough going on to keep the film interesting. While it did have great color and great camera work, it was still a bad film. One of the few classic films that I did not like, but this is just my opinion.

Everything is perfect here, there is action, suspense, joy, sorrow and mighty fine acting from an all star cast.Don't make the same mistake I did if you haven't seen it, I don't have to go on about it to those who have as I'm sure they like myself already have it on DVD or Blu-Ray in their collection.You do don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With The Wind is the greatest!","review":"Gone With The Wind is the greatest movie that was ever made. Not only did it have a wonderful cast, but the costumes and sets were fantastic. Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara and she deserved her Oscar she received for her role. The fact that the story revolves around a woman who was independent and strong and who never gave up no matter how difficult things became, makes a great statement about Scarlett O'Hara. She may not have been the greatest person, but she did have courage to continue on fighting. Scarlett and her determination is what makes this movie great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of all time","review":"The writing is some of the best in all of literature and film.

Until racism is completely eradicated -- and, let's face it, we still have quite a ways to go -- let's not get too smug about the film's take on slavery. So the special effects look a little creaky in places. Well, the same can be said about Star Wars. Movies are products of their times. The very best ones survive, often to endure criticism from more \\"enlightened\\" or \\"sophisticated\\" generations. (As if we really make quantum leaps in our development every 20 years or so.)Taken on its own terms, this is still a great piece of storytelling. The acting, writing and direction are all first rate. And the film, like the book, has a timeless theme -- survival -- that is embodied in an unforgettable heroine. Read the book first. It's a first-rate piece of fiction.

Scarlett loved a man that was only living his life on dreams...She didn't realize that he had never truly loved her. Scarlett got married to Rhett, but she actually had never realized that she loved him, until Ashley's wife, Melanie had died and it was too late....When he had left her. If you are a person that loves Romantic novels, with a lot of action-Than you should consider watching this movie about a land that was once more beautiful than ever, once destroyed by a war...A land that first didn't mean nothing to Scarlett, A land that was worth living for, dying for, and setting a new life for Scarlett.

You aren't going to see battle scenes or get a history lesson of any sort. This movie isn't about the Civil War. It's a story which just happens to take place during the Civil War. Other than the time period, it has nothing to do with the Civil War.The story is actually about a young woman who marries twice for all the wrong reasons, is forced to grow up and do a man's job, and finally realizes that while she thought her happiness was just out of her grasp it was right in front of her the whole time. In other words, it's a love story.If you want something which is more about the Civil War, yet has side stories going on, I recommend the Blue and the Gray or North and South. Otherwise, go find a documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've loved this movie for as long as I could appreciate it and still believe it is one of the best movies of all time. Vivien Leigh portrays Scarlett flawlessly- just the right blend of volatility, beauty, and vulnerability. Clark Gable is dashing and perfect for the role of Rhett. The chemistry between him and Vivian is incredible. For the hopeless romantic, this is the movie to see! The only objection is the ending; it seems to leave many things unfinished and unsaid.

Wow. What an amazing book. No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time. It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW. So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie. I couldn't even finish it. It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well. I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment. But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book. Don't be scared by the size! And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told. <- and that is an understatement!!!

I do have Blu-Ray's that give a very good image butI will never part from my DVD's because in some cases the DVD is of a far better quality.

Picture Scarlett O'hara as the totally self-absorbed Fraulein who can't quite figure out what is in all those trains leaving town for central Europe because she is too busy thinking about a party dress.

But it was not worth my time of watching for 2 hours, much less 4 whole hours. It seems that everyone loves the 1939 film of Gone with the Wind, but I don't see the apparent greatness. It held my interest for a while, but the story seemed to disintegrate with each of Scarlett's marriages. I found Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammy to be the most interesting out of all the characters. Overall, I don't feel like it was a satisfying movie to watch. At least I've now watched it once, and hopefully will not ever have to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this DVD","review":"There are few films that are worth purchasing.

The picture is very sharp and the sound is pretty well done in 5.1 surround. This movie is awesome! Get it! I warn you the MGM edition has a booklet that contains a main menu shot of more bonus footage, but my copy doesn't have the features. My DVD is a \\"flipper disc\\" though.

Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, and she is the only actress that could play this part, she was one of the most gorgeous women of her time. Clark Gable is not too shabby himself, he is near perfect as Rhett Butler. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett is red hot, and when they get snippy with each other, they sizzle with hatred and smoldering intensity. This is one film everyone and I MEAN everyone must see in his or her lifetime. The score is dramatic and full of life, the acting is absolutely astounding, and the story is pure magic. They don't make films like this anymore, I highly recommend this southern dream out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"There is no need for me to explain this movie in detail, as so many others before me have done such a good job here.

I remember a time, about 20 years ago, when I wanted to buy this movie and it was so hard to find. It of course was only available on VHS and cost about $85.

A must for any movie fan!","review":"What's not to love? This movie is required viewing for any film buff. It's one of the best adaptations of a book ever brought to the screen. It manages to hold interest for almost four hours, unlike many three-plus hour [...]-numbing epics of today that could stand to lose an hour or more off their running times. This story moves, without a single lull. Standout performances by everybody involved, both in front of and behind the camera. It is truly a benchmark in filmmaking that has rarely been equaled.GWTW also remains the #1 box office champ of all time in terms of the number of people who have seen it. More recent lists of highest grossing films don't take inflation into account. A movie ticket in 1939 cost twenty-five cents.The restoration is breathtaking. The original 35mm Technicolor negatives were used and it makes the film look almost like it was produced yesterday.This is an all-time classic that shouldn't be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Your Money from Going with the Wind","review":"In my anxiousness to see this classic transformed into yet an even more special experience utilizing Blu-Ray technology, I foolishly purchased this disc.

Movies about books usually leave things out but not the main character's children! The movie tells the basic story, about Scarlett and Rhett, but skips so many things it's horrible to watch. (I think Ashley is really ugly, if you want that kind of information.) I don't think I'll be watching this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clark Gable is too mousey","review":"The movie is too long, is overkill Lesile Howard is too ugly to be Ashley Wilkes. Vivien Leigh is too British to be Scarlett O'Hara Clark Gable is too mousey and short to be Rhett Butler The whole movie about this bitchy woman whining. I give it a 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as everyone says","review":"I was expecting soooo much more. But, after 3 hours it wasnt worth the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"GONE WITH THE WIND","review":"I recently purchased Gone with the Wind in the 70th Anniversary Edition.It came as two disks in a standard plastic folding container. One disk was the movie itself, the other was the making of the movie and other special features.Unfortunately, while the second disk was fine, the fist and most important one had no sound. The video worked but nothing could be heard, so rather than watch a silent movie I returned it for credit.I will say that credit was issued immediately and with no questions asked.I will try again to buy it, perhaps this time I will get a good copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiddle-dee-dee!","review":"I hadn't seen Gone With the Wind all the way through in years, so on a whim I picked up this two-disc 70th anniversary edition on sale right before Christmas. I'm glad I did.The picture and sound are top-notch. I did notice a few visual imperfections, but they were very minimal given the age of the source material.The commentary track with historian Rudy Behlmer was a bit disappointing, but I guess we're lucky to get anything given the fact that very few people involved in making the film are still alive. It did have a few good tidbits, though, like pointing out a bit player who would go on to voice Jiminy Cricket in Disney's Pinocchio.I was also pleased to find that this edition does include English subtitles, although they vary noticeably from the script in several places.Hardcore Gone With the Wind fans would probably be better served by the four-disc edition, but for the casual fan this two-disc edition for under $10 is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With The Wind DVD","review":"I enyoyed the DVD as much as I did when I saw it in a Theater in the spring of 1970. Wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone with the Wind","review":"Good movie. A Classic that should live forever in the minds of those who viewed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With the Wind","review":"This movie is a wonderful adaption of the book. The actors and actresses showed great talent and energy. The sets were very realistic, as were the costumes. However, as elaborate and colorful as it was, no adaption of the book can be adequate. Scarlett looked a little too old for the age she was supposed to be; Ashley Wilkes was not the handsome lad he was in the book; and Melanie was much too glamorous for her frail character. I would recommend watching to the movie, to compare it with the book, but stick with the original book. No movie can do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone With the Wind - Boxed Set BOMB","review":"To All Prospective GWTW Afficionados....DO NOT BUY THIS BOXED SET at the outrageous $71+ price. The glossy prints are poor quality...the other 'STUFF' included is just 'STUFF' and the really BAD THING....is that there is only 1 DVD. All the other releases currently (the more upscale and remastered ones) include 4 YES THAT IS FOUR DVD's which have information on interviews, making of the film, screen tests...etc. But this FANCY BOXED SET....has only one....Upon opening it, we immediately closed it and sent it back...and ordered the 4 DVD set at $27.94. So...save yourself some trouble and stick with the ORDINARY and AVOID the 'EXTRA-Ordinary'...Gladys C."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is awesome but the DVD quality is BAD!!","review":"I was happy to buy this DVD at such a cheap price but it was wasn't worth it. The sound quality is really bad. I tried playing the DVD in several players thinking that the problem might be in my player. But no, blame it to the bad sound quality. Even with the full volume, the sound is low.

All of them had extraordinary documentaries, screen tests, extras. But what in the world is holding up the 5-star DVD version that all of us fans of \\"Gone With the Wind\\" are waiting impatiently for? As 2 other fans have noted, there's nothing extra on the present DVD. A two-minute preview. Wow. Thanks a lot.If studios are able to give spectacular restorations and care to all-time favorites like \\"Sound of Music\\" and \\"Spartacus\\", then we demand an even more outstanding DVD treatment of the greatest movie of all time. Say, come to think of it, where's the DVD version of \\"Doctor Zhivago\\"--another much beloved classic? Get with it Ted Turner, who owns GWTW, and all you other people in charge. We want our 5-star edition of GWTW--like yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating is for rip off price","review":"While not my usual cup of tea I've always liked this movie for it's cinematography and sets. I've never owned it on standard DVD and have been waiting for Blu Ray to do it justice. And now here it's released with a ridiculous price tag. This is just another case of a greedy studio thinking people are stupid enough to fork over 50 bucks for a 20 dollar disc because they put words like 'ultimate' and 'anniversary' on the label. I guess I'll be putting this one in my queue and forget owning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not widescreen","review":"I was disappointed that this was not in widescreen format. I will be returning it. You would expect a Blu-ray to be widescreen, so I didn't even check before I opened it when I got it for Christmas. The movie itself is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be in the minority.","review":"I must be in the minority about this movie-I don't like it. I don't like the people-in my opinion, they're shallow, ridiculous, narrow-minded and childish. I don't like the role of women in those days-all you had to do was wear pretty clothes and act like an airhead to catch a husband. If you don't do these things, you're an outcast. I especially don't like Scarlett O'Hara. I so can't believe that that woman couldn't make up her mind about what man to be with-I mean, Leslie Howard over Clark Gable? Give me a break! Casablanca is more my movie-at least Rick and Ilsa were more mature than Scarlett and Rhett. I don't like this film at all, and I don't understand what's so great about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"I finally watched this movie and I was very disappointed.

The lost beauty for the full panoramas is very disappointing. I'm sending it back and waiting for the real thing. Plus the music has lost something. I don't think they bothered to re-master it.

Mammy and Melanie are shown speaking of Rhett's refusal to bury Bonnie, but where is the scene where Melanie convinces Rhett to finally bury the dead Bonnie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone With the Wind","review":"This is by far, one of the greatest films ever told. I enjoy watching it over and over. However, the quality was terrible, because it skips to the next scene after almost after every few scenes. It's hard to enjoy it that way. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER to anyone! They didn't even leave an adequate way to get in touch with them- so returning it is tricky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"Excellent quality.

They were both SO SO SO SO GOOD! I can't understand you people who only give it one star and say it was too long and boring. What do you suggest be taken out of the movie to shorten it? Anyone who says it is too long and boring is an uneducated swine that has ADD and doesn't deserve to watch anything this good. Even if 5 minutes was removed from the movie it wouldn't be as good. I totally recommend this movie to everyone. It is definitaly one of my top 5 favorite movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $30 spent!","review":"My husband and I debated back and forth about buying this 4 disc set because it was so much more money. I bought it anyway and he has watched disc 3 & 4 and has become very excited about the whole thing - to learn how the movie was made, the screening for all the actors, their thoughts, and opinions about doing it, etc. Plus to learn about EACH of the actors and their life styles and loves of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a Comedy!","review":"To Lance who called this movie a stinker and a bore and that it was \\"not funny at all\\".

Warner?","review":"Warners may regret having raised the bar so high with their recent issues of 2-disc sets of Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood. I can't think of any film more deserving of the red carpet treatment than GWTW, at the very least including the excellent \\"making of\\" documentary, along with the old screen tests, a \\"soundtrack only\\" option, commentary, and possibly an interview with Olivia deHavilland.Let's go, Warners. This jewel needs a crown."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite movie!","review":"Since I first saw this movie at 16 it has been my all time favorite movie. I watched it every time it came on television which would be no less than 20 times. I was so excited when it came out in VHS and when I found that I could order it in DVD I did. I now have a copy in both versions. I find that no matter how many times I watch it there is always something new I learn about the characters. This movie peaked a whole new interest in this era that has yet to die. I am 52 years old and this is still my all time favorite movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true epic! A true classic!

Love.An incredibly powerful and moving work.The stars, Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Haviland, Hattie McDaniel, Butterfly McQueen... they're all fabulous and this work truly shows the best of their skills.Made at a time just before we went to war again (1939) its timeliness was incredible.If you're serious about showing something awesome in your collection, this is a must have.Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh. Cheesy Cheesy Cheesy!","review":"This movie is a real waste of film. It goes on and bleck bleck bleck.

I had an old VHS tape of it that was recorded off of CBS in 1983 and I just fast-forwarded through the movie to get to the commercials. Even at a high-speed this movie is crap.

I bought this for my mom who loves it.(God only knows why.) That is how I buy gifts, what the receiver would like, not what I would like. Personally, I think the movie stank.(Made to watch it as a kid.) When I watched it Melanie was a wilting flower, Scarlet was a ho and Rhett should have divorced her and taken the kid and the kid never would have died. Just a bunch of dumb people doing dumb stuff and a lot of whining. Ashley was a whimp and I won't even touch on the whole slavery issue which had the main characters all walking around like confused idiots and also fighting a war over. Stupid! Just don't make slaves of humans in the first place because it's wrong and immoral = no war and problems solved. Hire some people and pay them to work your stupid cotton farms at a decent wage, treat them well, blah blah blah. Just a dumb movie. Some people find this romantic? Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Language ruins it for me","review":"I think \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is about 99% of a great movie. I'd love for there to be a few more battle scenes, and perhaps a little less emphasis on the whiny Scarlett, but on the whole, it's alright.What I can't understand was the filmmakers' insistence on turning a nice period piece into an exploitation movie. I'm talking, of course, about the swearing by Clark Gable near the movie's end. Why? What was the point? Were the film's producers so dead set on pushing the envelope that they felt they had to degrade the movie in such a way? Imagine the Munchkins or Glenda from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" saying such a thing. It's unimaginable.I'm aware that new movies have much more foul language than this, but that still doesn't make this any better. This movie could have been a pinnacle of the genre, rather than a shameless exercise in exploitation. I expect more from the classics, and so should you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love or Hate","review":"\\"Gone with the Wind\\" is one of those movies that you either love or hate.

Gone With the Wind is definetly one of my favorites. I only had to see it once to fall in love with it. I read the book right after seeing the movie(which took me about a month), and fell in love with that too. Perhaps Scarlett O'Hara could do a little less whining, though :). I had bought the movie on VHS for my mother and grandma (since they both love it equally), but since I saw it, I've taken it hostage in my video collection. There's not enough you can say about this movie! It is one of the best movies of all time, you don't need to argue that point. It's excellent and I'll never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In new screen splendor, the most magnificent picture EVER!","review":"Gone With The Wind is just that.

This is an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Classic !!!","review":"This DVD set is just wonderful- For the price you are getting a 'million bucks' worth of film info, extras, etc...

The picture and sound are amazing- Don't pass this set by, you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett's Double-Edged Sword","review":"This film makes the audience nettle over Rhett Butler's true love for Scarlett against the angst of wanting to hit him for loving a selfish and arrogant woman. In the midst of the Confederacy falling apart, is a love story and Clark Gable does more than justice as a brood transforming as a Southern gentleman. This is a great film and for people who forgot that slave owners did treat their slaves with some level of decency, this is the film to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"GWTW FAN","review":"I have owned almost every copy that's ever come out. It's an all time classic for me. I have the original video cassettes. The first DVD that you had to flip for the 2nd half of the movie.

Still, a great classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keepsake","review":"This is my all-time favorite movie. The movie is shot in 1939's new Technicolor. It has amazing costumes and acurate sets. So many of the lines have become quotes that have entered the pop culture even today. When Scarlett parr with Rhett at Twelve Oaks, I was riveted to the dialogue. Other must-see scenes - the proposal scene, the fade out of Tara with the sunset, and the final \\"I don't give a damn\\" scene.

And Melanie, so kind and trustworthy.And Ashley depenible (though weak).And you cant forget Mammy strongand stoborn.The acting is wonderful with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett,Clark Gable as Rhett Butler ( and in my opinion should have wonthe best actor award).Olivia de Haviland is excellent as Melanieand Hattie McDaniel as Mammy.

At long last, Hollywood makes things right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film but enough is enough!","review":"I think \\"Gone With The Wind\\" is a great film but this 5 disc set is just another example of the studio's greed in rereleasing the same titles with a little extra. The first 4 discs in this set are identical in content to the ones from the previous \\"Special 4 DVD set\\". So if you have the earier set you will basically be paying $45+ for one disc with a few special features. Why bother.

I love it because is 1939 movie and does not reflect the values of the 21st century. I love it because my attention span is not short that I must only see movies from 90-120 minutes in length. I love it because I do not only accept or care for politically correct films. I love it because I know that widescreen movies were not made before the 1950s. I love it because is great without computerized special effects as they appear in modern films. I love it because my idea of great acting is not to be found in slasher or teen films being made these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece Masterfully presented","review":"The collector's edition of Gone with the Wind is a true gem for anyone who loves the movie. The special features are fantastic and compelling. The behind the scenes story of the making of Gone with the Wind is reason alone to buy this DVD. The movie itself is rich and beautiful. Truly one of the best films of all time presented in a collector's edition worthy of the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star Movie with 1 star DVD","review":"Love the movie, hated the special features. For a great movie and all you would think Warner Brothers could afford to throw in another disk, BUT NO! They had to be ignorant and make one bad package. But then again the DVD is only $14.95. But I would rather throw in $5 or $10 for some half good features.I will finish my thoughts by saying this: Don't I don't like the movie because frankly I love it. It's the special features that ruin the disc. Still, my final review for the film is 5 stars and my final review for the features is 1 star.

The TBS mini series \\"WHEN THE LION ROARED\\" and the documentary \\"1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year\\" was just recently been released with the WIZARD OF OZ Blu-ray Collectors Set. Do we get a GWTW wrist watch also?Why do these companies always take advantage of consumers with taste.

It is a little plainer than the regular DVD. I do not understandhow a Blu Ray movie that is 1080P is NOT widescreen. I notice this is becomingmore common place to remake a movie new and call it Blu Ray.On my DVD Blue Ray player, it is impossible to get anything in the way ofspecial features, I could not even get a scene selection.This was sold by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The grandest movie of all time","review":"Whenever I watch \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" I always try to imagine what people in 1939 watching it for the very first time must have thought of it. Sound had only been prevalent in movies for only ten years or so. Full-color was very rare (1937's \\"A Star is Born\\" and \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\" are earlier examples, as is 1939's \\"Wizard of Oz\\"). And this wasn't just color, this was absolutely magnificent. I'm more impressed with the technicolor in \\"Gone With the Wind\\" than I am by movies made today. No wonder this film has been viewed in theaters by more people over the years than any other film in history.Besides the film's technical merits and its pure spectacle, it is also a very moving drama about compelling characters. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh give wonderful performances. This film is a national treasure and cannot be recommended highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Highest Quality DVD and Greatest Movie Ever Made","review":"The dramatic engaging story of Scarlett Ohara is enough to make this classic film the best.

A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Classic That's Worth The Hype!","review":"The first time I saw Gone With The Wind, I was probably seven years old. While it was hard to grasp the entire meaning of the movie at that time, I knew this was more than just another Civil War film. A few years later, I read the original novel on which this was based. Though there are a few minor details that were changed for the movie, on the whole, this is a great film.The plot follows tragedy after tragedy on the plot of searching for love and trying to escape poverty. The fantastic costumes, unearthly beauty of Vivien Leigh and the charming handsomeness of Clark Gable, the extravagant indulgence of the scenery and brilliant camera angles (such as photographing the shadows during melancholy scenes)all adds to one great viewing pleasure.I've seen the movie well over 50 times by now, and you know what? It NEVER gets old. I can't wait to buy myself this DVD, which includes the original trailers for the film and other extras.A must-own in one format or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Special 70th DVD","review":"This review is for the new Blu-Ray 70th anniversary DVD, not the movie.

Now I have the Blu-Ray and it is amazing in quality and sound. Totally worth the price of replacing my old DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of it's time!","review":"How can anyone not say that Gone with the Wind is one of the best films ever made. Not only cinema wise was the movie ahead of its time, but it gave a true picture of what the Civil War era was about given that they could only show so much back in 1939. Just because the film betrays Margaret Mitchell's novel to the core does not make it a horrific film. It was the first film where women and blacks were actually betrayed as strong and intelligent not weak and inferior. Gone with the Wind is one of those films that will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"blu-ray blew me away ! Excellent !","review":"I bought the blu ray version of this movie and the transfer is just jaw dropping! This set comes with the blu-ray movie on one disk, hardcover book with pictures of the cast/sets/publicity photos, memos from david o'selznick,postcard photos of the sets, publicity booklet, and a cd sampler. Overall excellent presentation and I'm very pleased with the set. The picture is just beautiful and the details are amazing. When I first bought this movie I had my doubts if it would really look any better than the dvd version that I bought a few years back. Boy was I blown away ! The clarity in this movie is just excellent and the picture was sharper and clearer than the dvd release. There is a clarity and sharpness in this movie that I have not seen before. If you own the dvd and you are thinking of upgrading to blu ray don't hesitate ! You will be satisfied with the blu ray release !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone with the Wind, but not Gone for Good","review":"The timeless classic has been long overdued for a release such as this to display the magic, restoration, and behind the scenes look at the movie and personal lives of the actors/actresses. With ten Oscar wins, this film is sure a treasure and the glorious box set and features serve it companionly well.The only downside from this box set is the long overly detailed interview with Olivia De Havailan, as I began to lose interest and nearly fall asleep entirely to the documentary on the fourth disc. However, nothing can degrade the five star rating that the rest of the collection deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I thought of this Romeo And Juliet","review":"First Of all I need to say I am a Shakespeare fanatic.My all time favorite is Romeo And Juliet.When I saw this I thought \\"this isn't all\\"!I think they left out some important scenes and dialoges.The whole reson for reading or watching Skakespeare is to enjoy the beauty of the words and story.I did not get that feeling from this.I would recomend this for a person starting to read Shakepere not for someone who has read Romeo & Juliet before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy companion to Luhrmann's definitive version.","review":"This excellent animation confirms Baz Luhrmann's hunch that 'Romeo and Juliet' was a great teen movie waiting to burst out of the classroom. There is no stilted poetics here; all the rush, energy and generosity of teenage emotion spills over, making the climactic chaos of events plausible. More than Luhrmann, however, this cartoon respects Shakespeare's text in the sense that it tries to recreate the culture that produced it, the elaborate rituals and emblems - the love scene is a glorious literalising of metaphor that ennobles the relationship just as the play's verse does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design of Strap","review":"The main strap of the shoe is tightens on the bike side of the shoe.

Its a little like \\"Hidden Treasures\\" from Megadeth, another B's compilation, but this is the funniest album I've ever heard! You gotta love these guys! My favorite is \\"Startin up a Posse,\\" an anti-censorship love song. But the best is NFB, the last track. It starts up like a power ballot, but you know the guys would never do that to you.

I've mentioned this in other reviews of Anthrax...I prefer Bush era Anthrax (the singer, not the president!), but I also consider \\"Worship Music\\" one of Anthrax's best discs ever, so I'm not against Joey Belladonna. However, whether it's the production or whatever, his voice just doesn't cut it for me on this disc. It doesn't have that feeling of fullness that it had on \\"Worship Music\\" where he sounded amazing. Anyway, I've heard far better from Anthrax and hold them to a high standard, but this is still worth buying for Bring the Noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Slapdash Set of Odds and Ends","review":"Anthrax, thrash metal, fun. Yes, we know.Now, what about the material on the disc? Overall, its pretty good. \\"Milk (Ode To Billy)\\" is about a boy who wants milk for his cereal. It sounds like standard Anthrax song. Meshing the goofyness with the sonic aggression brings a smile to my face. The rest of the album proceeds in a similar tasteful fashion. For the most part...The live tracks are okay, but they throw off the momentum of the studio tracks. And the re-make of \\"I'm the Man\\" blows.But man, the rest of the material is quite good. Any fan of the band, or even just any sort of faster-than-average metal, should consider adding this to their collection at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a cool name for a band","review":"This is a good album, my favourite anthrax one.

I'm the man 91 is a rap metal song that I guess is a sequel the I'm the man. It sounds like those limp biskit fags. And the songs with the highest quality are not even that decent. Oh yeah, bring the noise is another rap metal song that anthrax failed to do well. If you want rap metal from anthrax that's acually good, get I'm the man.

You'll find page after page of detailed and practical configurations, and all the debug and show commands that'll help troubleshoot a WAN configuration gone wrong. If you're looking for an on the job reference, or as the author said, a CCIE study guide, then this is a great addition to your collection. However, I gave it four stars, because it was also toted as a good prep for the BCRAN/CTMD, and I thought it lacked the in depth conceptual explanations that so many of the test objectives cover. If you're looking for a guide to prepare for either of these tests, you'll either have to supplement this book with material from cisco.com, or get the Cisco Press book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Sure About This Book","review":"I ordered this book as I was trying to avoid taking the class. After taking the CCNP course and checking the book versus the course as well as the exam which I took, I realized that much of what is on the exam is not covered in the book or the detail you need to know, such as that of the 700 series router commands are not covered. There are two other Remote Access books which seem to match much closer. The Cisco Press book and the Sybex book. If you need a quick study guide the Coriolis Remote Access book seemed pretty good as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be Used as a Study Guide for BCRAN","review":"This book was not very usefull as a study guide for the BCRAN exam even though I passed it on the first attempt with a great score. This book does give a decent overview of some of the technologies involved in the BCRAN yet the explaination of configurations and their examples are poorly represented."},{"rating":"1","title":"BCRAN - Not an editors best job!","review":"Not really what I had hoped for. The are quite a few errors in this book. Alot of the the examples in the case studies are incorrect. One example is the configuration of the frame-relay sub-interfaces. The case study shows the incorrect command to enter sub-interface configuration mode. This should be an obvious error for the editor (if they were technical enough to understand the information). There are many other errors and mistakes throughout the book. Too many examples that you have to turn a page or two from where the text is to see what they are talking about. - Very confusing! Not the best book on Cisco I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Source of Information for anyone taking the BCRAN","review":"This book was an invaluable resource when I was studying for the BCRAN.

Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a good resource","review":"If you are trying to pass your Remote Access course without taking the actual course this is not the book for you. This book gives pieces of the puzzle but is very disorganized and not very detailed. It is also lacking in several of the objectives. I can attribute this to rushing to beat their competitors on the shelf which they did but at a cost to the buyers. I looked at several other books such as those from Cisco, Todd Lammle, and Catherine Paquet. Those to me seemed to cover the objectives much better and were layed out better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"This book has good coverage of ISDN, Frame Relay, and PPP. I find the material here is well presented, especially the step by step instructions on how to configure ISDN PRIs. The test questions are sometimes very difficult, too difficult for the BCRAN. They do make you think about the topic so that you can really understand what is going on. For those who have left negative comments, I can only guess they don't \\"get it\\" and would have difficulties with any of the books describing this topics. I also liked Cisco's BCRAN book by Catherine Paquet and Todd Lammale's book. Unlike the other BCRAN books this book describes other topics that are relevant to the topic, but not the exam, like configuring IPX over PPP. Good information, keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very in depth. But certainly Good for the Exam","review":"If you really want to know the stuff, get the cisco book. Both books are very dry. They are hard to follow mainly because the technology presented in these books/tests are 70% outdated. People are using VPNs now and yet this test does not cover that. Don't forget to download the errata for this book from osborne.com. Bottom Line: By using only this book, you will certainly pass the test.

In \\"In a Lonely Place\\" she depicts a vivid, hypnotic vision of post-WW2 LA, and she draws a scarily realistic and sometimes sympathetic portrait of \\"protagonist\\" Dix Steele. The novel is notable for its narrative twists & turns, its suspense (that most of the 'action' is not explicity show is both terrifying and brilliant, from a technical standpoint), and its tendency to turn both traditional noir structure and stock characters on their heads, so to speak. If you like noir or Cold War-era-informed fiction, give the unusual, the compelling, and the bone-chilling \\"In a Lonely Place\\" a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scary, Yet Understated Tale of a Serial Killer","review":"This 1947 thriller by Dorothy B. Hughes is a master of its type--cold, unrelenting, yet tastefully done and nicely written. It isn't filled with blood and gore. Its violence is implied, forcing the gorefest fanatic elsewhere to sate his blood lust. Miss Hughes tells her story in a gripping style, placing ill-fated characters in a setting brimming with darkness and desperation, a cold tale that leads to a sudden, jaw-dropping climax. Don't confuse this novel with the 1950 film--Hollywood transformed the main characters as well as the theme, making the story a watered-down tale of domestic violence among the Hollywood set. Don't get me wrong--I've been a Bogart fan for many years. But I have to be honest. The film did not do this superb, chilling tale a shred of justice.David BerardelliAuthor of FATAL INNOCENCE"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Christians, no matter whether you are suffering or not","review":"As there is no table of content here on Amazon, I would like to take the priviledge to type one for you here.1.

It's about a girl hating her mom and yet, trying desperately to be just like her. But most of all, it is about endurance - just holding on.The film is slow paced and fits the mood of the lazy days of a 1970s summer. Add lots of booze and marital boredom, mixed together with sexual awakening and you have a disaster just waiting to happen. Janey's flirting with the same man as her mother has dire consequences in so many ways.The whole \\"rain\\" metaphor and using it as a title struck me as too film project but since it was this director's first film, she deserves a lot of credit for making a film that strikes a hard emotional truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirteen Year Old Janey is a Victim of Sexual Abuse","review":"This is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting. And no, I'm not even slightly exaggerating. It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out. Janey is only a 13 year old teenager. She is indeed rather mature for her age. Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her. Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law. Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined. The father is being played for a fool. This dysfunctional family seems doomed. Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection. Is she capable of handling this responsibility? Will matters finally get out of control? \\"Rain\\" is morally bankrupt.

To make things worse their are no practice tests for this course. So it was with a certain lack of enthusiasm that I ordered Novell's Certified Internet Business Strategist Study Guide and began preparing for the test.When I read the book, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I actually learned a lot of interesting things about putting a business on the Internet. I made my own practice test by copying all the questions and answers at the end of the chapters to 3 X 5 index cards. After spending a week plowing through a stack of 200 index cards I passed the test with a score of 750 out of 800.While I wasn't enthusiastic about the material, the book contained everything I needed to pass the test. For that I give it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you're a fan of Benny Hill!","review":"I was so pleased to find a biography of Benny Hill. I became a fan in the 80's when his show was televised by BBC. After 150+ pages, I can hardly bear to turn another. The author had no admiration for Mr. Hill; I would go so far as to say Mr. Lewisohn holds him in total contempt. The author also spends far too much time pontificating about Variety, radio and other topics in such minutiae that it detracts from the subject and makes this book a ponderous read with little enjoyment at best - excruciating at worst.Criticism is one thing but the way this author writes of Benny Hill, his life and comedy, is just shameful. I'm willing to bet he spared all of the Beatles his poison-pen treatment. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I purchased this item as a gift for someone very special to add to their collection and when it arrived the cover of the book was torn and there were red marks all over it (it is a white cover).Very displeased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record..

These songs are very good songs.But, if you were to play this CD to someone who is familiar with YES and if they had not heard this before, they would be hard pressed to name the group.That is not necessarily a bad thing, at least the songs were good. Plenty of times groups change their sound and the sound they change it to is just horrid. This is an excellent outing and the only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is because it is sorta false advertising since you cannot hear Tony Kaye nor is there any decent smattering of Jon Anderson anywhere.. and as far as I am concerned, chris squire isn't on this cd.But, like I said, it is a YES cd in nomenclature only.

Jon Anderson is the backbone of the 'ohhhhh soooooooooo' refreshing vocals, Tony Kaye provides just the right blend of the hammond organ, Alan White's slap happy drums are nicely sprinkled all over the place, Chris Squire's bass has never sounded more thunderous, and Trevor Rabin .... well, he puts on the performance of a life time .... fantastic vocals, tasty keys, and legendary guitar work.

He played an important part in the very fine BIG GENERATOR. But this was a real mistake. Yes was clearly out of gas by this point, and went through the motions behind Rabin's lead. Steve Howe was never positive about Rabin's contributions, and this sealed it as far as Howe was concerned. He is right. Apart from the closing track, it is an OK CD by a hired gun. Production values are fine, but this should have been billed as a Trevor Rabin disc. The franchise value was diluted by this effort. It would signal a tail spin for YES that they would not pull out of until MAGNIFICATION. Not as bad as DRAMA, but certainly not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced and uninspired","review":"Although I must admit I haven't kept up with their most recent efforts, I did buy this one as an accident. And it was a mistake. The thing that I loved about early yes material was it's ability to build prog-rock on minimal chord structure flavored with french organ influences and a relatively impassioned feel. This, however, shows the continued downward spiral of a group that's forgotten it's roots and relies on massive over-the-top production rather than the dry, simple beauty of their early works. If you want a taste of old school yes as they should be, go out and buy \\"Dots and Loops\\" by Stereolab instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes worst album","review":"This is by far Yes worst album and something anyone should stay well clear of if they are not fully into mediocre AOR. People with large Foreigner, Europe and similar band record collection or heavily into hairdo cliche guitar playing, might be tempted.The record is one of the most cliche filled and trite albums ever, in addition being sterile and lifeless.

The heavier than air inert gas sinks to the bottom of the air space in a sealed bottle so you don't have to completely re-fill the bottle with the gas. It keeps oxygen off the surface of the wine, preventing oxidation (over-airing and turning to vinegar). The combination of gasses is just right to achieve this purpose without acidifying the wine any further (low CO2 content so no carbonic acidification).

And it may well be that the love is justified in this case. The mild \\"aw shucks\\" demeanor of an honest, average middle class individual thrust into crisis seen so often on the screen is reported here over and over by people who knew him during WW II. It's clear that he was no dummy, graduate of Princeton.This book though is on his wartime career. Entering the Army early in 1941 (and seeing his salary drop from $6,000 a month to $21) he was by the end of the war a seasoned bomber pilot with 20 missions behind him, including a visit to Berlin.In part this book has to concentrate on the differences a movie star has to see (the Army didn't want him killed), but most of it is on the way Jimmy Stewart handled himself in the War.

Having said that, I found the book on my hero boring, devoid of any substance for his incredible service, and lacking any in-depth research into this extraordinary person. The entire book talks more about other people than it does about Jimmy Stewart. I bought the book thinking I was going to learn more about this man during WWII than about his Hollywood career, but the entire book falls short of any reading pleasure.

There are no insights into Stewart's personality- all we find out is that he conducted excellent pre-mission briefings, and that he was a skilled pilot- which most Jimmy Stewart fans know already.Almost a third of the book deals with other irrelevancies, like the Jimmy Stewart museum and how he married and raised a family- after the war.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't learn much about Jimmy Stewart here","review":"Dispite its title you won't learn much about Jimmy Stewart here, the accounts are either very generic, or very superficial (e.g. \\"I met him and he seemed like a real nice guy, and he never mentioned Hollywood\\").

But in many ways the book is more a summary of the author's experiences with and views on the 8th Air Force's bombing campaign against Germany than a detailed account of Jimmy Stewart's actions during the war. I too would have liked more accounts of the missions he flew. Even if he was very reluctant to talk about his wartime experiences, there would have been accounts of his missions in the official records.

It is as excellent now as it was when it was written 30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most enthralling and sensual romance I've ever read.","review":"My folks have an enourmous amount of books and when I was bored I'd pluck one off the shelf at random and read it. They had a paperback version of Green Darkness. I must have been about 14 when I read it and it knocked my socks off. Ms. Seton artfully weaves the two doomed lovers Celia the beautiful, bastard child of bastard noblemen and Stephen a Benedictine monk during the fanatical protestent reign of the \\"boy King\\" Edward into a luridly beautiful web of tormented passion so intense that it must be reconciled.This is not your run of the mill time travel romance. It deals more with past life regression and karmic debt. Green Darkness is a beautifully written, historically accurate altogether wonderful book.If the powers that be are reading this. PLEASE reprint it someday soon. I have a copy that I've read more than a dozen times. The only things that holds it together now is Scotch tape and a prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memory long forgotten","review":"Suddenly, after 25 years, the recollection of this book took hold of me. I'm forever grateful for the experience. I was 16 when I read this unbelievable story and coupled with the Cronicles of Narnia, (what a contraditon!),it was this reading experience that made me love the written word and to this day, I feel fortunate. Far too many will live without knowing and appreciating a really good book; a really worthwhile escape; and real passion. They will never know the the wisdom and the knowledge brought to someone who enjoys reading; recognizing the humbleness of realizing how much they still have yet to learn. This book, if my recollection dosen't deceive me, married passion and education. I know that it profoundly impacted my life because it showed me the value & joy of reading, and I'm forever thankful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undecided","review":"I can't decide if I liked this novel or not. Was somewhat interesting, once you got to the 16th century - all the 20th century characters, including the main characters were annoying.Was confused and distracted by all the secondary characters in the 16th century as well. Would not consider this a romance, beings Stephen/Richard is hardly in the novel - this is more Celia's story in which Stephen is not around for most of the book - her interactions with many historical figures of the time were unbelievable due to her station in life - and her interaction with Thomas Wyatt (executed by Mary for starting rebellion to replace her with Elizabeth) was absolutely ridiculous, even for fiction.Bought this book and Katherine together based on recommendations and reviews, not sure I want to try Katherine now..maybe if I am between other novels.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't like it....","review":"I just thought this book was sooo ridiculously boring. I basically bought it because it was recommended on Amazon and got great reviews and thats why I had to write this review because I just didn't understand all the rave reviews. Basically this book was sooo boring I couldn't even get past page 100. So slow it dragged on and on...there was really not much of a love story, too many characters but none developed- none were likeable. I tried so hard to like it and I just couldn't get into it at all. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a favorite - and will be yours as well","review":"I read this book as a young teenager, about 17 years ago and have re-read it many times. I recommend it for anyone who loves the post- Henry the VIII period in England or anyone who is interested in reincarnation and fiction at it's best.I recommend this book highly - and wish that it wasn' out of print - my old hard cover copy fell apart years ago and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else. ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant historical novel with a tragic love story","review":"I read this for the first time when I was about twelve - I must've read it at least three more times since then and I still love it best of all Anya Seton's books. It tells the story of the forbidden love between a monk and a young woman - a sequence of events still having repercussions for their reincarnated souls four hundred years later. It's a brilliant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would have read the negative reviews...","review":"I saw so many positive reviews on this book that I just didn't bother reading the negative ones. It sounded so intriguing, but within the first 15 pages I felt like I'd been duped. I will say that the inner story that is set back in Tudor times was intriguing, but the out story was horrible. The writing was stiff and contrived, none of the characters were likable, and in all the behavior of pretty much everyone seemed unbelievable. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An oldie that shows its age","review":"I remembered this author from books my mother had around the house and decided to see if it lived up to what I thought it had been. Nope. I thought I would like the medieval parts. Nope.

It is a fun read and a great history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but....","review":"Great novel with a very good retelling of the past lives of the characters. However this Kindle edition has numerous typo errors that I found extremely annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many other great books out there, don't bother with this one","review":"OK - I confess I did read the whole book, but asked myself why more than once. This is not a romantic book nor is it good historical fiction. The heroine past and present is utterly weak. Any book where the husband rapes the wife and then they get back together is just disgusting. I recommend Sharon Kay Penman, Candace Robb, and Colleen McCollough's brilliant series on ancient Rome beginning with \\"The First Man in Rome\\", and recently followed up by the fantastic \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WEIRD...","review":"Maybe its because I don't believe in reincarnation. But I tried and tried to read this book and just could not get into it. The characters were just plain annoying! I read Katherine by the same author and just loved it...devoured it... so I was so excited to read this book. It was just weird. The good thing is it put me to sleep every night so I guess it was worth the money there. i also did not finish it soooo maybe it got better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book is very disappointing. I've read Katherine and The Wintrop Woman and cannot believe how boring Green Darkness is. The \\"introduction\\" in modern days drags on forever and I'm not interested in metaphysical fantasies. Once we get to historical times the story drags on - too many words and too many names with little progress.Enjoy the other two books but don't waste your money on Green Darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"UGH! It was a painful process to go through all the extra stuff in this book. I wanted to quit reading several times, but kept plodding through. At one point I was so frustrated with all the extra this and that, that I almost threw the book across the room. Needless to say, I didn't...no, couldn't finish this book. I got 3/4 of the way through and couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring, so disappointing!","review":"I started this book and put it down a third of the way through. I found it boring, boring, boring. I friend advised trying to finish, so I picked up where I left off and read another third of the book and found it no better. I decided not to waste any more time on a book I disliked. It was not only boring the characters didn't mesh, the plot was chaotic and confusing. This was the first book I read by Anya Seton and I doubt I will try another. It is also the first book I have ever put down without finishing. As an avid reader for over 50 years, and I especially love historical fiction, this was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"This was a well researched historical novel, but with a paranormal/reincarnation start and end, adding to the interest and somewhat preparing for the plot line.It does start out in 1968, then you're transported to the Tudor era from 1552-1559, giving accurate as possible locations, people, living conditions, attitudes and events of the period over a portion of Europe as well as England.I read it 1st in the late '70's and became a permanent fan of Anya Seton. Reading it again was just as big a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"While I had a hard time accepting the theory of reincarnation, this story is very interesting. My favorite part is the reinactment of 16th Century England and the chaos of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've lost track of how many times I've read Green Darkness.","review":"I've read most of Anya Seton's books, but this is the one I turn to again and again over the years.It is beautifully written, and the story and characters are memorable. You don't have to be a sentimental softie to be moved by Celia and Stephen's story. It grabs you almost from the start and doesn't let you go. It's easy to understand why Ms. Seton chose to tell it.I was in my early teens when I first read it (close to 30 years ago), and I love it as much today as I did back then. You might not know it by reading a lot of today's fiction, but plot, dialogue and characters still matter to a lot of readers. This book has them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful reading","review":"I loved Katherine, would rank that among the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. So when I finally read Green Darkness, I was anticipating something great. Wow, I was wrong. The book is just...weird. The reincarnation stuff is very bizarre and just doesn't fit to me. I am a history nut, and find the historical aspect of this book very unbelievable. I would give it one star, but for some reason I felt compelled to read the whole thing. Something must have kept me going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Add To The Kindle Library!","review":"Although I seldom read the same book twice, like many other reviewers, I have read & re-read Green Darkness many times since first discovering it in the 1970's. The characters, especially the ones living in Tudor times, are so realistic that I actually miss them each time I finish the book. I also love how the past & present characters mesh in the end. If you love Green Darkness, too, I encourage you to click the link above which asks the publisher to make a Kindle edition of this book. I would LOVE to have a copy to keep since I have given every other copy away to friends after reading them and I encouraged those friends to share this great book. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Text Errors","review":"There are a fair number of digital text errors. That is to say, the words didn't convert properly. Not a huge deal but it is a little irritating. In retrospect, I wouldn't pay for that shoddy work if I knew. The book is fine and actually deserves more time spent in the process of converting to digital format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely One of the Best Books I've Ever Read","review":"I bought this book when it was first released in the 70's. I still have my original hardback. This is my all-time favorite book, and I'm thrilled it's been re-released so others can enjoy it. I've read it several times. This has everything I love in a book: engaging characters, romance, reincarnation, a terrific story. I urge you to read this book. I love it, love it! If I could give it ten stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bland, overrated love story with historical interest.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who knows I enjoy historical fiction. Well, yes... I will give the author credit in period research. However, her thesis is based more in mysticism which, regardless of your religious views, does not complement the facts. (I realize astrology has played a very important role historically and this is not my point of contention.) What remains is a love story, in which the underdeveloped characters do not induce much sympathy in the reader. Added to this we have the 'guru' doctor who mends the broken hearts from the previous life, but we are never told how. All in all a tedious read."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely book","review":"This book is rich & delightful - I have read it several times, and each time I learn of a deeper thread, a nuance that whispers, & a renewed respect for the author. With her unusual and wonderfully eclectic background, the book resonated several issues surrounding the human condition all at once, like an orchestra where all the instruments are playing their separate, yet interweaving and crucial parts, leaving the listener/reader with a sense of archetypal satisfaction that can only be found with such a master at her craft. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get into","review":"Not an easy read. I found the first 100 pages of this book almost unbearable! Had I not enjoyed Anya Seton's book \\"Katherine\\" (which is one of the best books I had ever read) so much, I would have put this one down & never finished it. But since it was an Anya Seton novel, I decided to keep reading to see if it got any better. Well, it didn't. I was very disappointed in it. If you do want to read a good book by Seton, than I suggest \\"Katherine\\", a novel about Katherine Swynford, the second wife of John of Gaunt. This book is impossible to put down and one of my absolute favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Having read Katherine, and loved it, I was anxious to begin reading this one, especially after all the good reviews it's gotten. Unlike Katherine, the heroine is not the least likeable. I kept on reading thinking it had to start living up to its hype. It never did. The history was probably the best part of the book but I wasn't looking for a history lesson. Very hard to understand how so many people liked it enough to give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this novel. I found it to be extremely droll, stilted, contrived, totally unsuspenseful, and completely dry. The love story was BORING, the lovers interacting twice in the whole escapade, which utterly contradicts the claim of the author of this being a \\"gripping love story.\\" I was wondering why this did not appear on the New York Times bestseller list if it was so \\"magnificent\\", and now I know. I am really surprised to read any reviews here over two or three stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-ordered","review":"This set may have been just fine for another car, but I mis ordered and needed the four-piece set instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This is more of a class D movie for \\"Don't Buy\\".The entire movie focuses on 4 people inside of a mini van and a bear that comes out of the same bushes from time to time to attack the people.At the end of the movie,the woman says sorry and the bear lets her live.The bear finally gets in the driver seat of the mini van so that it can try and drive home.The acting and background music was very lame.The \\"Edge\\" with Anthony Hopkins is a good bear movie and worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic beginning","review":"Just plain horrible. I stopped watching - it was that bad.The only reason why I'm still typing is because Amazon requires we use at least 20 words when describing my \\"experience\\". So there you have it - don't watch this movie. There's a reason it's free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh..","review":"This movie was stupid. There's so many flaws it's rediculous. I dont even think this will ever be on TV. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because its more funny than scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"This movie simply didn't grip me. I watch a lot of Chinese movies, and I'm well aware of the drama for Chinese living and society - for all the glam that is currently hyped on it now. Yet this movie had nothing to offer, but long silences, slow sequences and an implausible - nearly non-existent! - story line. Bleak countryside, a sullen protagonist, a desperate heroine all make for 2 hours better spent doing something else. What a disappointment from the director of 'In Love We Trust'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The first clue that this translation isn't what it should be is the fact that the poems all rhyme. You can't translate Greek to English accurately and expect it to rhyme. He also chose to translate the names of the Gods either into their English words (like Heaven) or their Roman names (like Saturn) rather than leave their Greek names so you can figure out exactly who he means (Like Ouranos). He confused Hecate, Selene and Artemis, calling them all Diana at one point or another and I think there's a point where he translated Dione as Diana as well. The final result- you spend more time trying to guess who the poem is about.Further, despite the title's promise of a \\"preliminary\\" dissertation, there is more commentary throughout the book than poems, though the commentary doesn't help much in figuring out who the heck he's talking about unless it contains snippets of Greek which is sometimes helpful.In short, there is little to no value to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious flaws in the Kindle edition","review":"I do not believe the current Kindle edition of this book was ever actually reviewed by a human who understands e-books. I am planning to request a refund.Firstly there are awful character encoding issues. The first half of the book is scholarly introduction with what I assume are Greek words and phrases. I cannot tell for certain because they all show up as \\"???????\\" In the e-book. In some pages half the content appears as these question-mark words - useless!Secondly the process that produced this e-book for some unfathomable reason retained page numbers in the text content. Of course they never align with screens of text on the reader, they show up in the middle of paragraphs and verse stanzas, interrupting (and ruining) the reading.Amazon should pull the Kindle version of this book down until the publisher decides to produce a commercial-quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Bad It's Great","review":"I assume that this movie was supposed to be serious, but the acting, dialog, and fight scenes are so bad that I personally find this film to be very humorous. Not to mention the over-all low production values. 4 Stars for comedic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for fans of B action movies and Jeff Wincott","review":"Jeff Wincott is a hardcore gambler who is about to leave Vegas, but not without paying off a debt he owes. When he pays it off he ends up getting bullied into a fight. He loses the fight, his money, and his girlfriend.Ugh, this movie is pretty bad. Everything is predictable, and the acting by the girlfriend is horrible. The only good thing is Jeff Wincott. He gives a good acting performance, and like always he shows some great emotion in his fight scenes. There are a ton of fights in this movie, but none are really good. Gary Daniels gets a decent cameo fight, but the only fight I liked was the finale. Not even the finale was that good, but it picks up by the end of it. So in short, I recommend passing on this movie unless you are a really huge fan of Jeff Wincott.2/5Picture quality on the Madacy DVD is decent. Best thing about this DVD is that it has 45 minutes of trailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose Speaker Installation","review":"In renovating our house we installed 2 pair of the Bose virtually invisble speakers. There were no problems until after the painting, when the speakers went into the walls; apparently, they just hang there, inside the rough-in plate and sheetrock. There is no screw connection to hold them in place, with the result that the grilles of 2 of them are flat against the wall, and the grilles of 2 of them stick out on the top, probably because of insulation between the wall studs (which is standard, at least here in the Northeast). I am going to try to take them back out of the wall and remove some insulation, but it is annoying, to say the least -- neither the rough in plates (which are just flat stamped metal pieces, vastly overpriced) nor the speakers are exactly budget models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and well written","review":"Enjoyed the author's style and what he had to say. Good examples of adventures on the road addressing why we choose to ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time...","review":"Poorly written, silly and self indulgent and frankly, bordering on unbelievable ( mysterious naked women ) I found nothing about \\"soul\\" in this book and precious little about life.Pass on this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a light, fast paced, and highly enjoyable set of stories about one man's experiences on the road. It should strike a chord with anyone who rides, and inspire anyone who's always wanted to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant Road Kill","review":"I agree with another reveiwer that a possible redeeming quality of this book is that it is a quick read. I think I came close to skimming the last half of the book. The author seems more intent on repeating his weight, height, eating habits, and the fact that he is a Texan than on relating anything very meaningful or engaging. Self indulgence doesn't equal insightful reflection, nor do the frequent cryptic phrases add anything but confusion. And the attempts at philosophy are sophomoric.Having said that, I was able to finish the book because I too have logged several thousand miles astride a variety of bikes, most recently on a Honda Valkyrie, \\"The Dragon\\". Meyer would also have us believe \\"The Dragon\\" is his nickname for the bike, but a visit to the Valkyrieriders website can clarify some history.

Basically all that happens is 5 people die on a small bridge and then the author goes on to discuss these people's lives. What a BORE. Unless you're some philosophical nerd, you will not enjoy this book at ALL. If I was the author of this book I'd tell myself to get a grip on the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bridge of san luis rey","review":"When I began this book I thought it was going to be fairly interesting. Brother Juniper wanted to show the world than everything happens for a reason by studying five people's lives and trying to prove why they fell of of the bridge of san luis rey and died. However as I so painfully read on about these five people's lives I too wished I had fallen off of a bridge. Wilder's writing style is the kind where you have to read the sentences over and over because they are 1) so incredibly boring and 2)so incredible hard to understand. I hoped as I read on that there would be some kind of powerful ending that was all worth reading for since the original purpose of the book seemed deep and intriguing. However, I was left with another boring ten pages and paragraph about love to smooth over the rest of the book. Save yourself and read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz...","review":"Next to Great Expectations, this book was potentially the worst book I've ever read.

This novel is short and sweet, and captures more literally power than novels twice its size. I can't recommend this highly enough. The Bridge of San Luis Rey is perhaps my favorite novel of all-time. An unforgettable story written by a true literally genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting storyline rambles on pointlessly","review":"The first chapter of Thorton Wilder's \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" was very interesting and absorbing. It tells of a monk who, after the collapsing of an historic bridge hurtles five people to their deaths, researches the personal lives of the dead and tries to discover if the tragedy was a coincidence or a sheer act of God. The next three, absolutely horrendous chapters, go on to describe the lives of the deceased. After reading three chapters filled with boring, gratuitous material, I hoped for an outstanding ending that would bring all the events together. But what I got was an ending that mocked me, seeming to ask, \\"Why did you read this book?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"In this book a bridge collapses in Peru. Five people lost their lives. This is the story of their lives. Aside from that this book didn't make much sense to me. I found it dull and often uniteresting. The only decent part, was the story of the twins, Manuel and Esteban. I really don't recommend reading this book. However, if you are a Wilder fan or you want to read a classic piece of literature pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a poorly constructed jumble of useless information","review":"While I do think that the ideas of fate and divine intervention are interesting and worth investigation, this book failed to harness my curiosity on the subjects. A very basic outline of the book is this; 5 people die when a bridge collapses, and in the following chapters, their lives are picked apart and analyzed in a confusing and boring mess of nonsense. The conclusion in no way ties the book together, and leaves you wondering what the author was trying to prove. Did God play a part in this catastrophe? I'm not quite sure, but I do know that reading this book will put you to sleep in about 3.8 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bridge of San Luis Rey","review":"I read this book over summer in a matter of days. I am still trying to understand it now. I thought the book was confusing but still interesting when I did get pulled into the stories of the 5 victims. I think it is a book that should be taught and not just read. You need to have an appreciation for this book, that I obviously have not aquired yet. This book would be better for middle age adults, but kids could give it a try if they are prepared to be thoroughly lost in a novel. Who knows, some people may love this book and say it is the best ever written. But in my opinion, I do not see the point it is trying to make at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was it fate?","review":"Thorton Wilder's \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" tells of the life,times and tragic deaths of five people. The character of Brother Juniper is witness to this catastrophy and decides to find out if it is simply an accident of punishment from god. The detail of the characters and their lives are phenominal and the characters themselves will be imprinted into the back of your mind for days. I would recomend this Pulitzer Prize Novel \\"The Bridges of San Luis Rey\\" to anyone who has ever been intrested in Spanish folklore. The reading may be difficult at times due to the translations, but it is well worth the time to go back and reread the passage. Although all the book is not clear you you still get a good grasp of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quiet study of lives lived","review":"There is not much to The Bridge at San Luis Rey. In the opening chapter the entire premise is undone, telling of one Brother Juniper and his quest to prove God's motive in a terrible accident that claimed five diverse lives. The narration of this part goes on to tell us that Brother Juniper was unsuccessful in his quest and was eventually charged with heresy for this undertaking and burned at the stake. We then go back in time and learn about the distinctive lives of these five victims, both of their lives and their affect on those around them. It is a quite beautiful story, sweet and hopeful at the end, an enduring picture of lives having meaning and, regardless of the abandonment of the story's initial premise, really quite effective and engaging. Four and a half, rounded down because the book a read immediately prior to it was something held very special in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thornton Wilder's wonderful classic","review":"I, as with some of the following reviewers, am a little surprised this beautifully wrought little treasure left some readers cold. The book was amongst the '100' best of the century chosen by the Modern Library a while back, and it well deserves the honour. Don't expect a lot of sexy hijinks or melodrama. It's a simple slice of life about an arcane tragedy in Peru in 1714.

Run through with touches of the always-surprising magical realism which appears in Wilder's more fabulist works, it showcases his trademark sympathy for characters while never indulging in excessive sentiment. The story's simple retelling of five lost lives resonates with a complex appreciation for the richness of both life and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"I liked this book a lot. It was sometimes a little bit drone and sometimes it used old-fashioned language. But I've got to expect that since it was first written in 1927.

The execution on this premise is so-so. The characters he chooses are all very depressed people with calamitous lives that touch upon one another. The book is seriously depressing. In addition, the pace is at times glacially slow. It was difficult to finish. The one saving grace is that here and there Wilder writes an utterly brilliant passage. But invariably these passages are set in such dark and uninteresting contexts that you wonder if they weren't penned separately and sort of forced into the story at specific junctures.But even for these passages the dullness and moroseness of the characters' stories hardly makes reading this book worthwhile. I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"This book was way overrated. It was average at best. But it least it wasn't too long.

Astonishingly modern, it is hard to believe it was published in 1927! Ideal for any lover of historical novels (or of history itself), Wilder's beautifully crafted tale interweaves the lives and fates of diverse characters and speaks eloquently to the universal human themes of grief, loss, love, friendship, compassion, and man's quest for the secrets of eternity.

The first four tracks are fully remastered on this Shout! version, but the entire Karn Evil 9 suite sounds like it was taken directly from vinyl!

In terms of quality of remastering of the product there's simply no comparison - this release of BSS is clearly the better value for the money.This is a perfect example of what the \\"record\\" companys need to be doing with their back catalogues in order to justify all us old rock dawgs spending money on product (again!).

I own just a standard DVD player (non DVD \\"audio\\" player) and the surround sound effect is very,very good.Not overkill,tastefully done.It is very obvious a lot of time and effort was put into this remix.I just cannot believe they could get such a clean sound out of a 27 year old recording.

The style of the music in Karn Evil is perfect for a 5.1 audio system. I should add I only listed to this on a regular (non \\"Audio\\") DVD player without a sub. If you're interested in checking out DVD audio don't bother waiting to get a DVD-Audio player, the sound is still amazing on a regular DVD player with only 5 speakers.

Second, the voice is simply buried by the instruments while guitars, piano and organ volume are higher than everything else, including percussions.Track one is an abomination. The volume REALLY shift after 1m30 or something, and all the song is so damped that more than one audition is intolerable. I skip it and directly go to track 2 everytime.Just listen to the Amazon samples above and then, listen to the Rhino mix.

Greg Lake's voice was the greatest in the business.. he played all guitars; bass, acoustic and lead.. and during Karn Evil 9, he played all.. making this very hard to do live; but the best show I've ever seen. On Toccata, Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer took Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto and turned it into life and a venture into movement as it should be known. I love this piece! As a master percussionist, Carl Palmer really shows what it means to be a perfectionist.

Emerson's choice of Moog voices in Toccata is astounding and pure pleasure to listen to. Still You Turn Me On is a fabulous beautiful Lake ballad. Benny the Bouncer, like The Sheriff on the Trilogy album, is fun but not a throwaway.Karn Evil 9 is, of course, the masterpiece on this album. Critics have complained of a lack of consistency or datedness .. GET OVER IT ! This work is musical heaven.

As a whole, it holds together okay but the flaws are still there. Emerson figures himself to be some sort of Paganini of the keyboard and the lyrics, particularly of Karn Evil 9 are pretentious words strung along. I realize that this is designed to be a lot more inaccessible than your average pop music. Yet, many of the songs are just words put together and are not meaningful.

What does this old geezer know, I thought.Turns out the old geezer was sooooo right.This album is terrible. Why listening to all that massive keyboard layers in Jerusalem, when any old church choir can do a more convincing, emotional version? Or why listening to Emerson's dubious synth experiments in Toccata, when any good piano player can do it so much better? (in case you don't know, Ginastera's work is originally for piano).Many people felt really bad when the disco craze came and swept away most of the icons of dinosaur rock, like these guys. In retrospect, I guess the Bee Gees didn't look that bad in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"I don't understand why anyone would get so wound up about the mastering of this. It was terrible when it was released, now it sounds terrible & dated. If you want good prog rock, get some Can, Neu, or Faust, if you want experimental rock that has intelligent lyrics, buy some Zappa. If on the other hand, you have some terrorists locked up & need to play something to torture them with, this will do quite well, prog rock for people with no musical sensibility or intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Masterging I've Heard on a \\"Re-Mastered\\" CD","review":"I'm not going to talk about whether I like ELP or their music or this album other than I really liked this LP as a kid and was happy to bump into a \\"Re-Mastered\\" CD version of it.However, I have to say that the sound is about the worst re-mastered CD I've heard to date. Most noticable on my system is that the precussion parts have been severely obliterated - the cymbals are mostly missing and when noticable sound unreal - not at all like the LP - and most of the rest of the drum kit is noticably muted. Levels are inconsistent within single tracks and from track to track. Karn-evil 9 part 1 seems to have grossly filtered, muted, and muffled. The other reviewer's comment about low pass filtering seems accurate. This CD seems to have lost much of the realism and clarity of the LP.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ORIGINAL MIX","review":"Be warned!

To add insult to injury, this effect is not consistent from track to track, or even within the same track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went horribly wrong","review":"In general I have been enjoying the Shout! remasters a lot, but in this, arguably ELP's masterpiece, somebody really messed things up with the remastering.I have been comparing the sound of the songs with the versions from 1993's Return of the Manticore (from Victory Music) and things are strange indeed: to my ears, in the new Shout! versions the sound in general is slightly more clear, but (big, BIG BUT) in Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression the sound is a disaster - completely muddy (however, as soon as 2nd Impression begins, the sound quality is fine once again).And in Jerusalem, even though the sound quality is fine, there is a sudden 3 or 4 decibel increase at the 1:32 mark, as previous reviewers have pointed out.The album presentation and essay are excellent, but its a shame that the contents of the little shiny round thing inside somehow escaped quality control. I would recommend staying away from this one until a corrected version is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to blow your head apart","review":"How do I even admit to actually loving this, after spending 15 years in the alternative trenches with Husker Du, Sonic Youth and Nirvana. Yet there is something really majestic about this album, particularly when heard in this DVD-Audio format. Before they got rich, fat and old, Emerson Lake and Palmer, especially with this album, made quite a compelling case for symphonic rock, a trajectory in rock history that really never amounted to much (probably because actual mastery of instruments fell out of fashion). The aural definition in this issue is just stunning and I highly recommend it to those who want to give DVD-Audio a try and to those who want to discover or rediscover ELP and why they were such a monster act in the 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Top 5 Best Progressive LP's Of All Time.","review":"Yes. I mean that. This LP, now on CD, is one of the 5 best by any progressive band on either side of the Atlantic. \\"KARN EVIL 9\\" is one of the most powerful concept works of the height of the progressive movement. \\"TOCCATA\\" a truly classical work interpreted here by Keith and his screaming eagle keyboard work. Greg's \\"STILL...YOU TURN ME ON\\" is one of his best ballads since \\"Lucky Man\\". \\"BENNY THE BOUNCER\\" proves that prog rockers can throw a sense of humor in with all the pomp and imagery. Heavily keyboard driven, this LP had guitar virtuosos scratching their heads. But no one can deny that this work is a masterpiece. ELP's all time best. It's everything a progressive LP should be. Music is many things to many people, but prog rock enthusiasts love music that begs to be LISTENED TO. This LP definately falls into that catagory. It is sure to provoke some dazzling mental imagery. A Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album you should own. You do, don't you?","review":"This was another album from ELP that really defined their style of music. Turning on my player to hear the thunderous opening to Jerusalem just blew me away and I knew right there that it was good. And it will never get boring. Benny the Bouncer, Jerusalem and Karn Evil 9 are the main attractions, but no song is to be overlooked. This is pure ELP and is definitely a must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting music","review":"If you are looking for music to awaken your brain to think and listen and just kick back and enjoy the high-technology sounds of ELP in this great album. The absolute highlight track of this one is Toccata, based on a piano concerto by Argentine composer Ginastera. The rhythmic drive and intensity of the composition will take your brain on to a new dimention of life. Great tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pinnacle of Progressive Rock","review":"This album is the Tiger Woods of progressive rock. Words can hardly describe the complexity and originality of Brain Salad Surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this album","review":"Okay, where do I start?This album is 2nd all-time only to the live ELP album, \\"Welcome Back...\\". It is a synergistic anthem to a world gone mad, with reflections on the past which led to the future's demise.One day I was reading a book on the Battle of Stalingrad while Toccata was playing in the background. How could it fit so well? It is the most haunting song I have ever heard with head phones on. Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer become one in a digital blast of fury. Synthesizer percussion? Yes, and this album is from 1973.This is ELP at the studio best. If you are looking to \\"get into\\" ELP, start with this CD. If you can't stomach it after the fifth play, you will never, ever appreciate ELP and their music. Nothing, even from the band Yes, even comes close to much of what ELP did. And this album is their signature piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality pressing","review":"A fantastic band and a truly classic album but I had to return this item due to the quality of the vinyl LP pressing.

It's as plain as it gets here folks which is a little disappointing. Rhino put some good stuff into the other greatest hits package booklet, why is their nothing here?2-Any greatest hits ELP cd needs to have Toccata on it!!!!!!. The other one does and this one doesn't. Why not?As far as music goes between the two best of cd's, this one is far superior in tunage to the other. Tarkus is here in it's entirety and it rocks. The other tunes on this cd are for the most part the lighter friendly side of ELP. The radio friendly tunes we've all known and love are here. If it just had Toccata on it and maybe Touch and Go (the Emerson Lake & Powell record from a few years back) it would be perfect in my books.ELP a strange and wonderful band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars For This Collection!!","review":"I must have been a pre-teen when I first heard ELP. My brother had 8-track tapes of Tarkus and Trilogy. This collection contains the song Tarkus which is one of the better tracks.

There is NO WAY this headset will move! It does not hurt my ear either.It has great reception, but you will have to use the headset in a quiet environment, so no sunroof or windows open. It picks up the external noise and you voice very well. It is perfect for the car, but dont try to use it at the mall or a rock concert.It works with my bluetooth enabled Razor phone.

If I were to watch a 3-D movie for instance, I would most probably have a grand mal seizure.When I watched the first video on TV, the picture quality was very poor. It made me very dizzy, and after watching for ten minutes, and standing up, I felt very disoriented.

Sure, the film-makers are young, shirtless dudes enjoying their hike with their buds. But what's wrong with that? Many AT hikers hike with friends, or at least begin the journey that way, and many AT hikers are just out of college. That actually made the DVD fun. Sure you see them having a beer, joking about showers and laundry, even using language such as \\"It was balls hot today!\\" That's reality, though. Granted, some of the hikers in this video are more interesting than others, but a couple of them are very likable. No, this DVD does not provide a lot of information about the trail useful to those who know nothing about the AT; however, how many people planning to watch this DVD don't already know the basic facts about the AT? No, it's not the one I'd give to someone as their introduction to the Trail, but it's a well-done documentary that highlights a lot of the \\"small moments\\" encountered during an AT hike. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"kildaju","review":"i definitely do not recommend this movie! it was the first of all my A.T. movies that i purchased, and by far, THE WORST! i agree with the one person at the bottom of this page that gave it a 2 or 3 star. the movie did seem like it was about four 21 year old bar buddies, romping through the woods. well, actually, about three bar buddies, b/c one of them, somehow, got ran over by a car off-screen; therefore, ending his AT thru-hike. i completed the A.T. in '04 and my experience was close to what you see in this movie, but God, the film could've been a lot better with a lot more scenery and a lot less cheesiness! the interviews are pretty well done, but i just got tired of seeing these guys filming each other most of the film. in a lot of these clips, they're doing silly and stupid things for the camera, which took away from the film. if you're looking for a good A.T. film to buy, i would recommend Appalachian Impressions or Walking With Freedom. Both are far better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal. Good. But not very informational.","review":"This homemade documentary was a pleasant view into the world of the thru-hiker on the Appalachian Trail. To be honest, I expected it to be more informational, with tips, helpful hints, gear recommendations, details of trail life... but it turned out to be more just a homemade video. A lot of interviews, a lot of quirky, personal moments, a lot of scenes of the four of them just hiking along. It was good; I really enjoyed it; it gave a very realistic, personal view of life on the trail. I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portrayal of Life on the Trail","review":"I purchased this video for my son, who is planning to hike the AT this summer. It works on so many levels. If you're planning to do the hike yourself, it presents an overlook of the trail, tips on what to pack, and insight into what it takes (physically and emotionally) to go the distance. If you want to understand why someone you know would want to do this crazy thing, this movie will help you not only understand that call but will help you worry less about them while they're gone. They'll meet some pretty cool people along the way. If you just want to watch some interesting scenarios and get to know some fascinating characters, it works on that level too."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than just a trail journal","review":"TREK tells the story of 4 young men and their 2001 thru hike of the AT. TREK delves into the characters, those fellow hikers they meet along the trail, a few choice days in detail, and how their few encounters \\"back in the world\\" seem different from the perspective of a hiker. Decent production quality, considering the film was made on-trail and without support. It's a keeper in my trail library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the spirit of the Appalachian Trail","review":"I just finished a Thru-hike of the AT in October. And was excited to see this DVD for nestalgia. And I was very disapointed with it. This movie captures a very small percent of people that are on the trail. During the video they are constantly bragging about how many miles they hike day to day, and are constantly complaining about the trail. Its almost as if they have something to prove. and this video is an ego boost. I HIGHLY reccomend the other A.T. Documentary called \\"2000 Miles To Maine.\\" it captures trail life and different people and represents the trail in a much more positive aspect. If you are seriously interested in hiking the trail or getting information, or just curious about trail life, save your time and money, dont buy this video. If you want to haul down the trail and brag to all your friends that you walked 2000 miles, then this may be the video for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millie-Millie","review":"I really like this album.

We haven't had any good references on this until now.The book isn't particularly UNIX centric, just slanted towards higher performance servers running on high availabilty UNIX platforms. NT still doesn't fit the bill and the author isn't afraid to state it. It might have been nice if the author had gone into more depth on clustering, but just the sections on specific tuning for CGI and Java make this book worth the purchase price. Especially nice is the author's stress on portable solutions over proprietary lock in solutions. Since the technology in the web arena is likely to change radically in just the next few years it hardly makes sense sacrifice portability for a slight speed increase."},{"rating":"1","title":"to broad","review":"Well, I personally think that the book is too broad. It tries to conver everything which should be left to separate books. I was expecting to get good details on tuning web servers / capacity planning etc but instead just re-read stuff that is in other books. The chapter on capacity planning is decent as well as the appendicies. However these should have been the core of the book.

The Earl of Sherworth is an unconventional man of great passion, susceptible to bursts of anger. He disdains the dull pretense of prospective brides. When the two are thrown together in an attempt at matchmaking, they develop a rappour as friends and a passionate love for each other. Vescinda considers him like a \\"wild stallion\\" -- admirable for his strength and passion, but capable of using that strength to wound. He, in turn, has difficulty trusting women, and believing that Vescinda does not care for him, hurts her deeply. She decides that a marriage with no love is better than marriage to a man who will take her heart and break it. Sherworth cannot let her go -- will, in fact, do anything to keep her from going to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abstract and confusing text, difficult to follow","review":"This is a book written in a deliberately difficult style. Notation used for equations of motion and stability derivatives is non-standard. There is little in the way of solved examplesthat can illustrate the basic principles to a student.

It's no substitute for the reference documentation that comes with NTP software, but it does give a reasonable overview--the sort of thing that could be easily conveyed in a ten-page white paper, not a whole book.However, if you want a robust explanation of what NTP does to handle errors, clock drift, and communication problems, this isn't it. There are a few packet dumps, but the explanation doesn't say much about what the packets mean, and doesn't begin to touch on how the protocol actually works.I fund no outright errors in the book, just an extraordinary percentage of fluff.

Photographs and Memories is a must-have for any collection of the great singer-songwriters of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scrapbook of emotions","review":"Jim Croce's \\"Photographs and Memories\\" is a collection of work worth whatever investment it may be. You'll stroll down the street of heartache, identity crisis, and painful memories. All of the songs are well written and vintage Croce material. You have the interesting melodies of \\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\\" and \\"You Don't Mess Around with Jim\\" juxtaposed with \\"Time in A Bottle\\" and \\"Operator.\\" You will sympathize with Jim's predicaments and remember your own situations. \\"Lover's Cross\\" is one of the best on the album. 5 stars and worth the reminiscing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afgter 30 years, music still holds upand the","review":"The words touch your soul and the simple but effective music is wonderful. Croce can be sweet, he can be extremely funny (roller derby queen), ironic (working at the car music) and romantic. (Had to say I love you in a song.) There is no such thing as a bad Jim Croce song and I am surprised more artists have not recorded his albums.This has most of what you need to understand why Croce was a master.Don McNay..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Mess Around With Jim","review":"As with any greatest hits album you get someone else's idea of greatest hits. Yet if you only intend to buy one Jim Croce album you can not go wrong with this one. At least it has my favorites. In case you have not heard Jim before, the album is a mixture of fast and slow paced songs; yet all of them have his signature voice and style. These are his later recordings and were released just before he was killed in a plane crash. You may also want to pick up am album of his earlier recordings to see how he progresses through the years.Jim Croce - 50th Anniversary Collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"Wow, this is one crappy movie. I struggled through about fifteen minutes of Cherry Bomb before I turned it off. Terrible, terrible acting. I thought it might be fun, as it was supposed to be like an old-style \\"campy\\" flick.

Merlin's computer (is this a throw-back to Illuminatus) is a great help or is it? Or should I say he? If you liked the Amber series you'll enjoy this. It is different. Merlin isn't Corwin and has a lot more naivitie (may irritate some readers) but it's the hero going out into the world to find ... what? Himself? His father? Who's trying to kill him?

The heart rate monitor works for about 10 minutes and then the signal is lost. I can pause it, reposition the monitor, find the signal and then start it again but it quits again and again. I'm going to try to replace the battery in the monitor but I don't know why the battery would be weak already. I think it is more likely the battery compartment is getting wet from sweat. Why doesn't the manufacturer put the battery compartment on the front away from the body? No one sees the monitor anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run AWAY from this","review":"The watch is extremely difficult to program, one wrong button push and you are in a menu written in German...with no way back...and good luck if you don't speak it...The worst part however is that product lasted 2 days and stopped working, even replacing the band battery did not help, and this was a brand new product...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful!","review":"This heart rate system was so easy to use. You set your information and go. I do suggest setting it up using the guide, otherwise you will get lost in the menus. However, it works so great at the gym.

That worked for less then fifteen seconds and received a no signal read out on the watch. Do yourself a favor and go to consumer report let this company rate the product first before purchasing.

In comparison to 2012, the graphics are crude but this game follows along with the animated Disney movie in may ways, though it is not a storybook adventure.

But, this time around I did a little research and come accross a lot of positive reviews about the iRiver players. Even though this one is an earlier version, and only holds about 16 songs, I'm [so far] pleased with how it's working. The software loaded like butter. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I even explored the website and found it to be very informative and helpful (to date, I haven't had to troubleshoot any problems!). iRiver has restored my faith in products such as these.

I think the order was very confusing and I ended up with something I didn't want and now it is too late to order again for Christmas, and anyway I would have to spend about the same to send it back.

Cute, but tough to handle. More importantly, my toddler ripped the cover off on day two - and she is generally gentle with books. Cute but very tiny and fragile. It's also hard to know what captions go with what, so challenging to associate the text with the appropriate animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Cute Story","review":"The Dolls' House is a very lovely, but adventurous book written for little girls from ages 6 through 10. The author, Rumer Godden does a remarkable job of narrating and explaining the time period of England and uses great detail to make the young readers feel part of the story. A family of mixed matched dolls is owned by two sisters living in England in the 1940's. The children's imagination and creativity bring the dolls to life in the story, but the dolls seem to come alive by themselves, too. The dolls are unhappy with their current living arrangements and are thrilled to receive a new, but very old doll house. Many life lessons and relations are learned and tested by the dolls and the children as they try to make the house a home. The children and the dolls restore the dolls' house in the end, but not without sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still vividly remember this book...","review":"...although I last read it over 20 years ago! There is pure MAGIC in the story. When I first saw TOY STORY, this book came to mind right away. Just great descriptive writing of a make-believe world that almost seems real, set with those lovely illustrations that help tell the story beautifully! In fact, I'm getting this for my 8 year old niece - a perfect book for a doll lover her age!

It looked cute and I wondered what it was about. It was actually very twisted and disturbing. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer who wishes she could give it a zero.

And it is easy to keep around where it is easy to retrieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been using these for years; no better shop towel","review":"These rags are probably the some of the best things I've ever found for cleaning, polishing, drying, and using for about a thousand other purposes.They're extremely tough, and don't tear easily (probably 10x stronger than a standard paper towel), so they're great for wiping down rough surfaces (like metal, rubber, concrete, etc.), and for laying down under a project to make sure screws and other loose bits don't go wandering off.They absorb as much as a hand towel, so they're great for sopping up messes, drying things, and placing under leaky things to catch drips.I've used shop towels for staining, polishing, drying, cleaning, mopping, and dusting, and this box of 200 is good for at least 2-3 months in my usage. I bought a box for my garage and one for my workshop in the basement, and I use them frequently. Amazon offers a pretty good deal--it's about the same price here as it is at a local hardware store, and Prime shipping makes it a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no Idea!","review":"I bought a box of these elsewhere on an impulse.

Same thing, so the manager at Rite Aid let me try one more - it was also 20 - 25 points low every time.I am pretty disappointed as it was quick, comfortable and easy to use.
