Actually, the main attraction is Christopher Walken in the role of \\"Gabriel.\\" He's extremely entertaining with his mixture of humor and evil. He eveen admonishes people for using profanity!Of course, the theology in this movie is so preposterous it's hilarious. At least in the end, the hero of the film correctly identifies the warring angel as one doing so strictly out of jealously for God. That's Bibically accurate, but the rest of the theology here is totally bogus. A lot of people probably don't know there are such things as bad angels, so that part is true.Theology-aside, this is a very entertaining movie. The language is tame but beware there are a couple of very gory scenes that might offend. The special- effects are good. Walken is a \\"trip\\" to watch and Virginia Madsen looks beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your while movie","review":"The Prophecy plays of the Catholic Church beliefs.

Problem is that it never did. It's still under Panasonic warranty on parts, but the labor will cost $150 to start with, by Panasonic service center in Illinois.

It would then quickly go dead. Other times, it would just be fine.Also, the progressive feature sometimes turnes itself off, which can be annoying. I am also not as impressed with the image quality as I was 2 years ago. The viewfinder color quality is also very poor.Overall, without those problems, the PVDV103 is just okay.

Rick's book was a disappointment, for I do enjoy his television series on PBS. The book was very weak on any type of usable maps or directions to important sites, which is mandatory in Spain. I found his warnings on the dangers of Morocco, especially Moroccan cuisine, to be unwarranted and a detriment to our enjoyment of our day in Morocco. We tried a couple of restaurants he recommended, without success, and switched to Lonely Planet's recommendations for the remainder of the trip if we needed help. His commentary is always enjoyable but the concrete information you need to find your way around is definitely lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had an awesome Iberian vacation thanks to Rick","review":"Rick Steves' book keep you away from the overtouristed areas and encourage you to not just see the famous sites, but taste the lifestyle of Spain, Portugal, and Morocco.

Yes it does come together in the end so to speak but the end could have come sooner with the elimination of about one third of the entire novel. Although Regina's story sets the background there was just way too much of it and it could have been handled in much shorter form. I also didn't like how Daniel appeared to be a key part of the story and then he vanishes, showing up for a cameo at the end. Throw in the fact that young Daniel just happens to be able to hack in to hospital computers and what not and well, it's all a little silly.S.B. is a brilliant author but this is certaintly nowhere near his usual efforts. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Baxter's best work","review":"I'm a big Stephen Baxter fan. I've read most of his books and this one lacks the flow his other books have. He doesn't tie the story together very well. Perhaps he will do it in the other two books but rather than leaving you in a state of suspense it makes you feel about 1/3 of the book is wasted paper.Normally, I can't put his books down until I'm finished. I had to force my way through this book because I had already wasted money on it.It wasn't a great story and it seemed all rather pointless. It wasn't insightful and didn't make you think like his other books do.Also, there were parts that felt like he was trying to pull a Dan Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I have to be honest. This book sat on my bookcase for nearly 6 months before I finally decided to read it. The subject matter did not seem that interesting to me. Fortunately, the book ended up being a pleasant surprise.

Interestingly enough, this book is tied into Baxter's Xeelee universe too, especially the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not a Page-Turner","review":"I've been a big fan of Stephen Baxter's work over the years, and much admired his best novels, like Titan and Voyage and Moonseed. He has been one of the best novelists to carry on the tradition of good, solid, interesting, hard sci-fi. But I am about 300 pages into Coalescent and can find little to recommend it. The historical characters are barely two-dimensional and the modern ones little better. The two alternating stories that make up Coalescent have too little intrinsic interest to sustain the reader's attention. The only reason to slog through Coalescent is if you intend to read the two promised follow-on novels that make up the trilogy, as it doesn't generate much interest of its own. Baxter has become one of the most prolific sci-fi writers, but I think Coalescent shows he is now spreading himself too thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piano sounds horrible","review":"I bought this piano for my 2 year old she loves to sing and dance but the sound is horrible the keys don't stay up and the bench is not sturdy so when she sits down she immediately falls off.

There's a lot of chemistry between the protagonists, and the scene where Chloe seduces Hugo is really hot. I like the heroine, who is a delightful mixture of maturity and naivete. Hey, I know that she can be irritating from time to time, but just bear in mind that she's only 17 and we can't expect a 17-year-old to behave responsibly and wisely all the time. The 5-star grade doesn't mean that this book is perfect, it's rather an indication of my liking. There are of course certain things that I find problematic, such as the fact that Hugo has no qualms about sleeping with Chloe while still intending to marry her off.

I can't believe that I am the first person to review this album. They play his songs all the time here on WUMB in Boston. Check it out. it's good music. I like Holy Holy, and Little Flowers. How apt, I guess Bill Bourne is a little flower himself, stepped over and passed by often without a glance.

People asked me if I had a booty implant done and I got a gazillion compliments, especially on my behind! LOL! My stomach was pulled up and in and my derriere was not flattened out like I was wearing something, no instead it had a pouted out look and the way the firm control waistband pulls everything up, major improvement for me!!!

Unfortunately, my first impression was that the clippers were awkward to hold. For starters, once unfolded for use there was nowhere to stow the fold-out nail file. So it just flopped around and got in the way...or rubbed against the end of the lever.But that was not the biggest problem with these clippers. Notice I'm using past tense. The biggest problem was the spring action stopped working on the very first use. So I had to turn right around and send them back.On the plus side, they come with a great warranty and free sharpening.I would only recommend these as a travel item. They fold compact but they are not the most comfortable clippers to hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, stays sharp but not TSA compliant.","review":"I've had the original folding Tweezerman clipper for years until it was confiscated post 9-11. Sadly the newer versions are not as well made as the original and are not made in Germany anymore.Still, these folding nail clippers are compact, maintain their edge and cleanly cut my nails with little effort. There is even a little ring on the end with which to hang off one's keychain. In addition, Tweezerman (a subsidiary of Zwilling Henckels) has an awesome lifetime guarantee and sharpening service on all their implements.For those that would like to travel by air, Tweezerman's parent company has this version, http://www.amazon.com/Pour-Homme-Clipper-Black-Leather/dp/B002A9JPKK/ref=pd_sim_bt_1 that does not have the fold-out nail file and is therefore TSA compliant.As this is a very compact nail clipper, those with larger hands may find it awkward to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have used Henckels folding clippers without problem.

The parents are white trash who watch TV all day and curse. The worst is Headmistress Trunchbull, played by Pam Ferris. She is a sadist, physically abusing kids and making one eat chocolate cake until he nearly vomited. In fact, some of the scenes don't seem appropriate for a kids' movie at all.

This is where I clicked the movie off and told my 6yr old we're getting rid of this film. \\"What did he do mama? He killed himself?\\" Thank you SO much, Danny DeVito, for introducing suicide to the kindergarten set.Finally, Matilda tells her sweet-but-helpless teacher to \\"adopt me, Miss Honey!\\" And voila! just like that, papers are stapled together, parents quickly affix their signatures, and Matilda goes skipping off with her new mother. It takes more than that to adopt a DOG."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame that this film was made","review":"Ridiculous as it is that this movie was even made put aside, it desecrates the brilliance of the novel.

There's no bad language (as far as I know, it's been a while since I've seen it), no blood or gore (does a fat kid messily eating chocolate cake count ?) and it makes you feel good all the way through. Now, on to the dvd. The extras look interesting and worthy of a special edition. I'd give the dvd the full five stars if it were truly a special edition if it has an anamorphic WIDESCREEN transfer as all movies should have and a commentary by Devito and/or Mara Wilson.

True, she's an ogre, but whatever happened to non-violent ways of getting rid of nasty folks?Then the lead girl asks her parents to give her up for adoption, which they do with nary a hesitation. Yikes-a-doodle.As with most Hollywood flicks, this one is short on character development, semi-long on plot, and super long on technical gizmos. It appears to be \\"liberal\\" but with such small-mindedness it's not very open at all. And the main characters are exclusively white, while Black kids sit in the back of the bus.Choose \\"The Story of the Weeping Camel\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage, Matilda!","review":"Any kid would need courage to go up against parents like Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman! They are two of the most delightfully awful parents ever, and you just have to love to hate them.But, having such awful parents certainly prepared Matilda to go up against the meanest school principal of all time. All this nastiness encourages Matilda to become self-sufficient and discover a very strange talent that will ultimately bring her the happy ending that she deserves!This is a great family film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming without too much sappiness; good kids movie!","review":"Matilda finds the balance between sentimental and dark, between happy and depressing. The sadness of Matilda's childhood in a dysfunctional family full of crooks and her prison-like school experience, is made better in the end when she finds a loving home. Because the movie is based on a Raold Dahl book of the same name, there is plenty of darkness to balance out the (predicatable) happy ending.Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman were great in their roles as Matilda's slimy, ignorant parents. Mara Wilson was perfect in the title role; a real joy to watch.Matilda's a great film for kids 6 and up. It's the type of movie your kids might watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special about a 1.33:1 DVD when the film was WIDESCREEN","review":"Other reviewers are correct. MATILDA, one of Danny DeVito's underrated masterpieces of humor, was released in 2.35:1. Once again, a DVD release crops it to fit \\"conventional\\" televisions. The term \\"conventional\\" is fast become outdated, since 16:9 widescreen digital TVs are getting increasingly affordable. My humble suggestion: make clear to studios that charging us full price for only half the frame of the director's movie are charging TOO MUCH. Wait for a \\"real\\" special edition that presents the film as DeVito intended it to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Didn't We Get A Widescreen DVD?","review":"I saw the movie Matilda and I liked it and thought it was a cute movie and I have to wonder why this older region 1 DVD and also the new so called special edition region 1 DVD are pan and scan only and don't have widescreen formats! A widescreen DVD was released over in Europe so why not here too? 5 star movie but a 1 star DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get my item!!!!!","review":"Did not know where else to turn. I have not recieved this item. I waited a few extra days and still nothing!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids and adults!","review":"Matilda is a cute and wonderful story! It's funny and makes you wonder what will happen next! It is hard to turn the tv off before it is finished! Sometimes people aren't sure they want to buy it but I'm not lying. You have to get it! If you don't like it, you're crazy. Still if you are unsure, go to Blockbuster or another movie rental place and rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-watch!","review":"\\"Matilda\\" is a must-watch for anyone with a sweet-tooth for funny movies (like, for instance, myself). The adaptation, while perhaps not entirely faithful to Roald Dahl's book, works perfectly. The screenwriter(s?), whose name(s) I unfortunately cannot remember, did a superb job of turning Harry and Zinnia Wormwood from British idiots to American idiots.The acting is great from all parties. Real-life couple Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are the perfect Harry and Zinnia (which I mean as a compliment...). The title role is well portrayed by Mara Wilson, and by Sara Magdalin as the younger Matilda. Embeth Davidtz is the ideal Miss Honey, and Pam Ferris is unforgettable as The Trunchbull.I've seen several film adaptations of Roald Dahl stories - \\"The Witches\\" and \\"The BFG\\" to name a couple - but this is by far the best one, and you will more than likely want to watch it lots of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 7-year-old's review","review":"7-Year-Old's Review: I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but the form won't let me. It's a really great movie, except there's one scary part where the Trunchbull chases people. I like the movie a lot, because I read the book and you kind of know what's going to happen. It's really funny.Mom's review: The movie follows the book fairly closely. My daughter watched it three times in two days. The extras on the DVD are entertaining and even educational. Danny DeVito and his wife actively encourage kids to read and spoke of reading daily with their own children. They included an extra on a real library and focused on how reading the book to their own children inspired them to make the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"5-star Family Fun!!","review":"This is a great movie for the whole family. It is very true to the book, with only slight changes.Matilda, the ignored super-genius, was well portrayed by Mara Wilson. She looks just like how I pictured little Matilda to look. Even her voice was good for the part.Danny DeVito played her father. He illegally sells cars and is proud of it. He hates Matilda.Rhea Perlman played her mother. While her body figure is slightly different from the mom's in the movie's, she is wonderful for the part.Well, I won't ruin your surprise for much else. I just want to end saying that you could not tell it was just acting-and that is the sign of a true good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the book","review":"This is one of those very few movies which is better than the book it is based on; Probably because of the funny chase scene at the end...I'm not sure. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This movie is a wonderful look at the brilliant child of a used car dealer. Every minute of the movie was full of charm. If you have children or are a child a heart, get a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matilda DVD","review":"The DVD arrived ahead of schedule and was in great condition. The DVD had popped out of the plastic holder inside the DVD box in transit, but it didn't get scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"I am a 2nd grade teacher and of course I could not believe the comments stated by the principal. I could'nt help but laugh because we all know that if a teacher or principal were to act like that they would absolutely be thrown in jail. My daughter is also in 2nd grade and she thought the movie was hilarious because she doesn't believe that any parent or principal really acts so extremely dispicable. The dialogue coming from the principal is jaw dropping to the point of hilarity. I have watched the movie 3 times in 24 hours so I can remember the hilarious hyjinx spoken by the parents and principal. Matilda's \\"revenge\\" amuses a child's most extreme fantasy. They also find it shocking yet amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matilda","review":"Matilda is an extraordinary girl, a child of wonderous intelligence. Unfortunately, her neglectful and deeply stupid parents, Harry and Zinnia Wormwood are too wrapped up in their own little lives to care, or even to notice that their daughter is a budding genius, in love with books and with learning. When the Wormwoods finally grant Matilda's wish to attend school, they bundle her off to Crunchem Hall, a bleak brick prison where students cower before the whip-hand and fist of a hulking monster, principal Agatha Trunchbull. Amid Crunchem's darkness, Matilda finds a single light in warm-hearted Miss Honey, the first-grade teacher who recognizes the girl's remarkable skills including a very special talent that allows the spirited girl to turn the tables on the wicked grown-ups in her world. Matilda is a charming little movie that will delite both children and adults. Adorable and heartwarming movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie","review":"My daughter loves this movie. She laughs & laughs. Say ask the crazy things that go on throughout the movie. This is one the whole family can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been","review":"This cracker is similar to rye crackers in texture. has a soy-ish taste. tough to crush into soup, very dense. Needs baked taste, and needs to loose soy taste. The cracker that came close and could have been, but falls short. The \\"best\\" gluten free cracker yet, which means gluten free crackers suck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous guide!","review":"What a great guide to a group of birds that is difficult to identify. Excellent tips on field marks, maps, super photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh.","review":"I got a nice workout, but it was all too boring for me. If you're someone who needs the constant interest and new things to keep going, this just won't be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too advanced","review":"I love all kinds of pilates DVDs typically, but not this one. It's very long and you must be able to do advanced poses. Quite frankly, I found it rather dull at times, also. Plus, the directions aren't always very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a Pilates Teacher and I found the exercises were more for Yoga and whatever else you call it. Did not find any of the moves interesting. Trudie's sidekick did all the work and I didn't care too much for his voice. I thought for a video that Trudie's form would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pilates ever","review":"I own hundred's of DVD's, many in the Pilates/Yoga genre. This one is one of the very best.The entire workout is done on the floor. The instructions are flawless. After going through this a couple of times, there is no need to look up at the TV.The workout flows seamlessly and the movements work wonders for the entire body.I cannot say enough good things about this one. My only complaint- I wish it were longer with some relaxing stretches at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination of Pilates and Yoga","review":"I teach Pilates and wanted some ideas to add to my routines. This DVD provided this. I also have used some of the flows in my Yoga classes. The students seem to enjoy a different type of flow. The only reason I did not give this DVD 5 stars, is because they do not truly explain how to do the Pilates breathing techniques very well and proper alignment of the pelvis. So if you already know these things, this a great DVD. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"She writes with a style of simplicity and rhythym and ease that you can sit down and read the book in one sitting. There are few if any dry spots. It flows very well, and you can see the characters and events clearly. She must be proud to be a new author and have produced such a successful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Big Picture","review":"If you plan on buying a new or used car soon, get this book. It is the essential reference to the various elements of automobile acquisition. It is also a convenient guide to the invaluable resources of www.edmunds.com. The book helps you plan and make a rational informed decision about the various aspects of automobile ownership, including: financing, insurance, trade-in value, and getting rock bottom pricing on the actual car purchase. I saved thousands of dollars on my last car deal.

Fortunately, my brother gave it to me and I read it. This time I saved a bundle. I also used Edmunds website to find out what I should pay for my car. It was a lot better than the other sites I've used in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much","review":"Its a nice picture disc but you want to much for it. If you come down on the price you can sell . I'm biding on the some one at this store were I live for 65 bucks I still have five days to go . So good luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Violence, terror and sexy scenes at exact sense","review":"The two movies on this box are really entertaining. They are perfect for that persons who likes the sex, seduction and terror in movies.The picture quality is not the best (looks like a beta record) but its pretty good for the year on what they was made.Watch with your girlfriend (or boyfriend) if she like the same genre than you..The only negative point is that dvd dont have any subtitles (even english), what made me a lot of work to explain to my girlfriend what is happening in all the movie (she undestand the written english, but not much the spoken). In a global world it was a interesting thing that the producers may take in count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant & Captivating... Equal or Better than Whale Rider!","review":"The opening pages of Uncle's Story suggest a twist that the reader may guess.. but after the first few pages, all bets are off... as Witi Ihimaera takes the reader on a wild and action-packed ride of plot twists and character development. Similar to Whale Rider, in that it's a coming of age (coming out of the closet?) story of a young Maori fighting against the bias and proud traditions of one's tribal family. Uncle's Story has additional drama with it's backdrop being the Vietnam War.If you saw the movie Whale Rider and loved it, then you owe it to yourself to read Uncle's Story. You won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To know Jewish thought you must know this work","review":"This work is one of the pillars of Jewish thought.

It was difficult to install, requiring a call to customer service. After only a few months, it has completely stopped working. I've been on the phone with customer service for an hour and gotten nowhere. It's definitely not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this like the plague","review":"I type this from the LAN connection of the WBR-2310 because the wireless connection has coughed up and quit. Again. This router requires constant attention. I have upgraded the firmware twice and still there are bugs. One bug has even been introduced by the latest firmware. MAC filtering no longer works after the latest update. The router requires physical rebooting at least once per session. It assigns IP addresses that are not in the allowable IP string, thus disallowing the connection. When it drops my connection, it must be physically restarted before allowing me to connect again. It's a horrible waste of time and money. I will never, ever own another D-Link product. I have owned and operated Linksys, Netgear and D-Link routers. D-Link is the worst by far. Buyer, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connection is not stable, computers on Lan network not recognized","review":"The product has some problem maintaining a smooth connection. As a lot of other reviewer have complained, I have to restart it even a few times a day. Also, it does not translate the domain name of the computers on your Lan network. The connection is ok, but you just cann't find the network computers in your Network Places. Consulted custumer service. I was told that I should consult Microsoft, not them. Because right before they say so, they asked me when I bought it. I said about four month ago. I think they thought I would not be able to return the product, so they did not need to get involved. Anyway, not a decent thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than the cheapest options","review":"This thing is fifteen feet away from my PC, with very little interference, and I usually have a \\"very low\\" connection or none at all. This is less powerful than the cheapie I used to rent from my cable Internet provider, but at least it's compatible with my Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!! Don't waste your money on this.","review":"This is a piece of c***. Do not waste your money on this junk. I've had nothing but dropped connections and c-r-a-w-l-i-n-g network response times with this device. Spend your money on another company's products, Linksys for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance...for a while","review":"I've used this router for about a year and have had decent performance. Unfortunately, during those times when I did have issues the non-existent tech support was adding insult to injury. Now the router stopped working, but doesn't give any error messages or indications anything is wrong save the fact that it doesn't. I've had mixed results with D-Link in the past, but this most recent interaction has confirmed my belief that D-Link produces products (at least wireless routers) that are a good choice only when it's the only one available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works a lot, then sometimes, and then never.","review":"Like others, this worked great out of the box, but then gradually started giving me problems. If the connection works, the wireless is great, but it can take 1-hour or more of fiddling to get the connection to work (and it's not my connection, because if I connect my desktop to the LAN it works like a charm).Unfortunately, I bought this piece of c**p used, so I can't return it. Stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"My PS3 is not a fan!","review":"I bought this a while ago at a local retailer, and i'm now kicking myself in the butt for not researching on amazon first! I have to give this router 2 stars because it works fine for my laptops. The problem is that, my ps3 loses it's signal, and the worst part is that I can't play COD4 online AT ALL(My Fav Game By the way!!!) My last router had no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"Keeps dropping connections. And not just the wireless connections, it even drops wired connections. I would give it zero stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only bad review I've ever put on Amazon","review":"Once you can GET this router to work with your computer, it is fine. My husband just got a toshiba notebook and it doesn't even seem to be COMPATIBLE with the router. We have wasted over 12 hours with tech support (who are REALLY good, but who wants to waste so much time on something that shouldn't be SO complicated).My husband and I thought we were computer geeks until we got the router and had to rely on tech support for installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware D-Link Warranty Scam","review":"After 6 months, I started having problems with this unit dropping the connection and having to reboot. D-Link support did a good job troubleshooting over the phone and declared the unit faulty and said they'd replace it under the warranty. I shipped, at my expense, all the original parts to them except the CD with the installation software, which I couldn't locate, D-Link sent me a replacement unit and held my credit card pending their receipt of my faulty unit. When they got it, they sent me an email saying they're charging me $20 for the missing driver CD. That's 34 percent of the unit's current sales price-- for not returning 7-month-old software that is updated and downloadable from their site. You do the math. D-Link wants to make it as painful as possible for you to exercise your warranty, so that you won't. If you buy D-Link, save your packing peanuts -- they might charge you a dollar a peanut if you return something without the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"It need power reset every 2 or 3 days....","review":"very bad product, very bad tech support, useless.Never buy D-link again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing blows!!","review":"I guess this is what I get for buying a cheap wireless router. The box said it was a 10 minute set-up but 2 days later I could not get the thing to work. I kept getting stuck at the ISP username/password screen. Perhaps it just wasn't capatible with my system or my cable modem. I tried calling customer service but I get annoyed when I'm on hold for too long. I'm sure this is a great product if you know how to get it to work, but this thing was advertised as a kind of plug n' play type device and I'm just not that technically savvy nor do I have the time to trouble shoot this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delay in delivery","review":"This item bought in 34/30/2007, was supposely sent twice to delivery address in Miami Fl., but still hasn't arrived.

Routers are the one item I try to keep in stock to help prevent viruses on customer computers. I purchased 10 WBR-2310's earlier in the year and another 10 WBR-1310s back in August.Of the 2310's, about 5 had issues and were returned to me for configuration. I had to contact D-Link for instructions on how to reset the device so that it would accept a new configuration (This is not the normal reset button on the back). Of the 5 that were returned, one was defective and had to be returned.The 1310's also have issues. When you attempt to connect to the login screen to setup the configuration, the router resets the Ethernet port. Again, this makes configuring the router impossible.The failure / problem rate on D-Link has escalated and I for one hope D-Link works out the problem with their quality control.Until that time I would look at the Linksys or another brand of router."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-Link has shoddy products supported by the worst customer service","review":"I've been dealing with this Dlink 1310 and 2310 for almost 2 years now...and it was dropping connections within the first week (didn't matter too much b/c my neighbor didn't mind me freeloading off of her wireless, so I would only need the dlink for secure info like credit card payments etc).Don't waste your time or money on this. Dlink customer service is quite possibly the worst I've seen (and I spent countless hours on the phone with the now defunct MCI Worldcomm, cable providers, etc). I finally complained so much they sent me another one (outside of the warranty). But of course they shipped me a refurbished one that would drop WIRED and wireless connections. When I talked to them they wouldn't take it back saying it was a one time courtesy to authorize a return without a receipt...it didn't matter they shipped me a dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for a mediocre access point or doorstop, little else","review":"I am wishing I could give this product \\"negative\\" stars.I bought 4 of these for an installation I was doing that requires port forwarding.

Buy something else it will suck your time and eventually you will give up anyway.Also as mentioned earlier - D-Link's support is a hideous joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good router that have little flaws.","review":"I got this router mainly because of its price. I upgraded from a DI-524 D-Link router. I didn't even use the CD that came with it. I just plugged the ethernet cables and power cable in, go to 192.168.0.1 and it worked. I checked for updates for this router from time to time. Sadly, sometimes there are glitches and the wireless would not show up on other devices, but a simple reboot usually does the trick. Overall, this router is great for its performance and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in less than a week","review":"I'll keep it simple. This router failed after just six days of use. D-Link support technicians failed to resolve the problem and refused to act on the warranty to have it replaced.

I got a bit frustrated, but if you keep your calm and go thru the steps with them, they'll get it done with you.As it turns out, it was that one of my laptop's wireless controls was disabled since I had always had it hardwired at my old place. Since the setup, it's all good.I've found that my service provider has a tendency to reset connections. It was like that when it was hardwired at the old place. They utilize dynamic IP addresses instead of static IP addresses, and perhaps that's a factor for the resetting every night, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working good","review":"I had purchased this router then read some unfavorable reviews.I had good luck with D-link in the past.

It was defective. However Amazon shipped off areplacement by one-day air before I had even taken thebad one to the post office. Also they provided free shippingfor the bad router.

I decided it would be better just to exchange it for a new one. Now I am on my second router and having similar issues (not quite as bad but still rebooting quite often).

I cannot maintain a connection long enough to even try changing the settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last D-Link product, a former D-Link fan","review":"I've always had D-Link routers, and until this one, had always been very happy with them. Previous D-Link products I owned were easy to set up, this one is not. Previous products were reliable, this one is VERY MUCH not reliable. Like so many others, I have constant problems with wireless clients dropping connection. It would seem that D-Link may have gone from being a manufacturer of good products for low prices to one who makes inferior products. Alas, no more D-Link products for me after this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really Bad, Avoid D-Link","review":"This one is a turkey. I am highly advanced as far as computers and I couldn't get this one to work. This router is NOT for novices. If you are a beginner this will be a living nightmare for you. I am a pro and I wasted 3 hours of my life on this junk. No matter what settings I used I couldn't get the router to connect to anything. I even upgraded the firmware with no luck. I bought a Netgear and I connected immediately within 15 minutes. ON TOP OF ALL THAT there is this awful software it forces you to install and they are CONSTANTLY asking you to pay for an upgrade. D-Link needs to be ashamed of themselves. D-Link was once great but it looks like they fell into the junk category. I would HIGHLY recommend avoiding this router at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Disconnects.","review":"I've had this router for about 6 months, it worked fine for about the first two and then it started disconnecting for no known reason.

Dlink used to sell quality equipment.","review":"I have owned 3 Dlink routers in my time, each new one dying sooner than the old. The best router ever, I don't even remember the model number of, it was strictly wired. Then I got a DI-624, it lasted about 2 years, but for the last 6 months of it's life it would gripe or completely disconnect on large file transfers. Now I have this, the WBR-2310. It has lasted about 6 months. I opted to use wired connections when possible thinking that the ethernet part would be as robust as the first Dlink router I purchased, but alas this one was even weaker than the last. Is this planned obsolescence? Incidentally, the first router is still up and running after 8 years at my parents' house. I don't know what is so hard about designing a router to last? I can only assume it's either shoddy parts or workmanship, because when the router did work, it was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this junk","review":"It doesn't even deserve a rating of 1, but the ratings don't go to zero.

The dopey tech support people will take you on a wild goose chase having you set up the router to the exact same settings that you had before calling tech support, or change some random setting just to get you off the phone. Since power cycling the router fixes the problem, and any change that is made during your tech support call resets the router as well, they assume the problem is fixed since you get a connection again anyway. When all else fails, the tech support people will try to blame your computer as the source of the problem even if it works fine everywhere else.

Quite frankly it would have been fine with me if it simply didn't work at all, because then I would have known what to do with it.The real problem is that the 2310 gave me no trouble 50% of the time, but then out of the blue my network would disappear, either entirely... or sometimes machine by machine. And because these network problems happened only intermittently at the same time that I was dealing with a couple of new Vista machines, it took me longer than it should have to figure out that this crappy router was the problem.So, happy (but not cheap) ending: rather than fighting with the 2310 any more I just chucked it and got a Linksys N (wrt150n)... and now everything works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Tech Support","review":"I've discovered the D-Link tech support department is clueless about residential gateway terminology.

Unfortnately, this has become daily routine! Customer service took long time to respond, insisted that new firmware would fix, which it didn't, and was generally not knowledgeable. It's not worth even trying to go through RMA process - I will throw my router in trash. I previously had a Linksys 4 port wireless router from Feb 2000 until Oct 2006 and only was replacing becausing wanted to upgrade from 802.11B to G - it worked flawlessly for several years without ever touching the firmware.

The stupid thing won't work at all now, please save yourself the money and do not purchase this. I gave it a 2 because when it does work, it does a good job.

This one, however, is the worst piece of hardware I have ever had the displeasure of owning. Connections drop every couple minutes or so over the wireless, and the router itself somehow resets every couple of hours, so a wired connection is a ticking bomb as well.

They told me to restore to default, which obviously didn't help before. This router shouldn't even be priced as high as it is. I would pay 5 bucks for it and no more.

I've seen problems with both the WBR-2310 and WBR-1310 when updating firmware.

I could not get Extended Range Mode to work with Hidden Wireless SSID. Whenever I selected both and saved the settings, it would return with the hidden SSID turned off. Since security is paramount, I had to forego using extended range mode. It's not fixed in the firmware 1.02.I've had too many problems overall with the WBR series, the DWL-2100, and even some DI-524s of which I used to have a high opinion.

I would call the help support go through the same hacking of configurations with them time and time again but to no avail. I finally lost it when yesterday evening I spoke with another \\"help support\\" technician going through the same help script that every other DLink technician took me through. She refused to allow me to speak with a senior tech, instead she simply suggested I exchange it for another one. You gotta be kidding me?

Shouldn't it have been designed to work in the first place? Anyway. Disabling these features helped for about 3 hours and then it started rebooting itself again.

Next day I decided to purchase all other Luciana Souza albums, starting by ordering An Answer To Your Silence, since i had been her debut album. Oh, I felt very very disappointed with this pseudo-fusion journey. Souza's own compositions are really mediocre, and she murders Gershwin's Embraceable You, a classic from the GAS (Great American Songbook). Her motionless treatments for two Brazilian standards by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Bonita and Retrato em Blanco E Preto, are gelid.

And of course, Kevin J. Anderson, who went on to butcher another epic (Dune), manages to take characters I used to like and turn them into two-dimensional cliches. This is the series that turned me off to Star Wars novels, when I realized that no one was screening these authors.As to the novel itself. Poor plot, poor dialogue, terrible villains, and don't even ask about the protaganists... Working with characters such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Anderson somehow manages to make me hate them. I absolutely can't say enough about this novel and series as a whole. If you have any respect for the Star Wars legacy at all, please pass on this one. Pick up a copy of Zahn's trilogy and try to forget that any other Star Wars books were written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing to salvage the previous two books...","review":"I'll get right to it: the problem here, is that Anderson writes novels with plots worthy of comic books. Depth, complexity, introspection, dimension are all foreign to him. This would be OK, if, at least, the action scenes were interesting. Unfortunately they're not. It's not exactly a spoiler here, but the good guys win. Every engagement. Every battle. Sure, we want the Republic to win in the end, but someone ought to tell KJA that there's nothing terribly gripping about reading the Empire lose time and time again.

Champions of the Force is interesting to a point. There are some space battles that seem to be ok, but the major problems haunting all of Anderson's Star Wars books persist. Another superweapon enters the picture: Death Star prototype, run by beings who are so inept its supposed to be funny but comes off just annoying. Kyp Durron returns to the light side, and Exar Khun is defeated but by the end of the story, Durron is treated like buddy not a mass murderer. It's simply not realistic. Admiral Daala comes back to provide Imperial presence but it's not really needed. Anderson tries but the book is to predictable and simply not all that good. Useless characters and plot lines abound.

So far, the only author who ever had Luke as a a true Jedi was Tom Veitch in Dark Empire.Also, it's understandable to have a few unplausible events but with Anderson there's no limits. A Sun Crusher? It can fly through star destroyers? I could've understood a weapon that causes stars to super nova, but an invincible ship as well?A third thing is, how can a bunch of jedi APPRENTICES defeat a Sith lord. Do you not recall from The Empire Strikes Back, that Luke, as an APPRENTICE lost severly to Darth Vader?

I'm asking myself why I didn't stop after \\"Jedi Search.\\"Perhaps one of my biggest complaints about this book and the whole Jedi Academy Trilogy, is why in the heck is this thing called a TRILOGY???

Oh yeah, I should throw in an all-powerful super-villan who defeats Skywalker but then gets beat by a bunch of untrained rookies. Yeah that rocks.\\" NOT.)

Getting the Heart and SOul boxset over the other material.When the book makes me curious about an Artist or an Album, then the box is at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stone is no longer relevant","review":"Rolling Stone has long been the laughing stock of the music industry when it comes to music reviews. Many classic rock bulletin boards routinely post old Rolling Stone reviews bashing albums that are now considered classics.For instance, it's hilarious to read scathing critiques of big-name artists like Queen and Pink Floyd, nullified by Rolling Stone's glaring errors (saying something like the high point of Pink Floyd's ECHOES compliation is the \\"entire\\" 16-minute title track, though it's been edited by 8 minutes). Artists like Vanilla Ice get better reviews, and legends like Emerson, Lake & Palmer are nowhere to be found.More reputable histories of music are available elsewhere for free, and one wonders what Rolling Stone's purpose is in even existing at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"something smells bad!","review":"This latest version has really dropped the ball big time. There seems like a musical propaganda going on with this poorly written musical guide. Any \\"reference book\\" that doesn't include a legendary band like DEEP PURPLE who have sold over 130 million albums, seems very odd indeed.The whole book lacks any real helpful insights to many of the artists I did know about. I bet the folks behind this book are the same ones who help run that Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It seems they want to shape the way \\"the public\\" thinks about music.A much, much better reference book is the AMG music guide. Their book contains every band and gives honest reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"You were expecting otherwise?","review":"Of course its garbage, its from Rolling Stone arguably the worst music magazine ever.Ok, RS may have been relevant once upon a time, but it really hasn't held merit or been in touch in any meaningful way since 1969 or so, save the writings Hunter Thompson published in his glory days.In fact, save the odd niche publication, there haven't been any US music magazines worth a nickel since the days of Trouser Press and Creem.That being the case, how can a rag with all the depth of US magazine, which was featuring Huey Lewis covers in the days of Husker Du and Brittany/Backstreet/JLO covers in the days of White Stripes/Wilco/Sleater Kinney, to credibly know anything about good music.Answer: You can'tSkip this nonsense and subscribe to Mojo and Uncut instead. Rolling Stone and Jan Wenner are as much the enemy as Clearchannel, major labels, emptyTV and the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Reject the lot of 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to like this book, the original that is","review":"No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Omissions","review":"I bought this book right away, as I have the 92 guide and had been waiting for an updated version to come out. I immediatley noticed the omissions other people have mentioned that seem inexcusable, like George Harrison, Metallica, even Nine Inch Nails. It's also riddled with typos and sloppy writing. In the entry for Ry Cooder, it says to see the review for \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" in the soundtracks section. Good luck, as it's not there! It seems like thay rushed this out way too fast without checking for mistakes. I probably won't be buying any more of these guides if Rolling Stone continues to do such a crappy job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaving George out had to be an oversight???","review":"First of all, millions of people still listen to All Things Must Pass (answer to a putz's questions further down). Seriously though, how can Rolling Stone leave out George Harrison? It makes no sense whatsoever. Leaving out Deep Purple is also a shock. Rolling Stone should have been a bit nicer to Queen. It's funny. I like greatest hits collections like anybody else but these are always the best rated albums. I just find that interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I understand that omissions have troubled a lot of people.

And we can all quibble about which albums deserve 4 stars and which deserve 5, etc. That's part of the fun of the book....but omitting Metallica, Interpol, Townsend, Free, Deep Purple, Faces (they just put out a great box set), etc is not fun. Did RS rush this to press for Christmas? I don't remember as many screw-ups in past editions. Maybe I didn't notice? Doubt it.I've always had problems with RS ratings - and the uniformative (supposedly witty) comments - again AMG is much better -- but I'm willing to let that slide.

But I like what I've seen of this book so far. It treats rock and roll as something that should be fun, not homework, and there's a good mix of key artist plus fun, more frivolous entries. The Madonna entry is excellent, as is the U2 writeup, and the soundtracks and compilations section is cool. I'm happy that RS tried something different with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Garbage","review":"This is typical RS elitist, pompous garbage. Don't waste your time. Every review I read downplays the significance of the artist's contributions in a most condescending way. I don't know if this is their sad attempt at humor but I found it irritating. It's as if the reviewers were jealous that they never made it as an an artist so they deem themselves fit to sit in judgement of others. Go to the Allmusic guide instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing ...","review":"I was curious about this book, so I flipped to the Queen section. After about a page of scathing reviews, there was a paragraph which stated that the decline of the band occurred after Jazz, which included \\"Bicycle RaceS\\" and was followed by the game, which included \\"Another One Bites the Dust,\\" credited to bassist Roger Deacon (it's John ... ). After the absolute ignorant condescention which characterized the Queen article, the most offensive thing about the book was that it actually seemed to like The Who. In The Who's defense, though, Tommy, Quadrophenia, and A Quick One were rated lower than many of their other albums. Perplexing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of $30.00","review":"Once upon a time I would look to Rolling Stone for the best in popular music record reviews. No more!

Rolling Stone doesn't have the best taste in music and they try to please everyone, its too shallow, there's no depth in the coverage, and any album you could discover hear, you'd discover by reading the other two guides as well, regardless of your taste in music.

Don't waste your time and money with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing...","review":"I plunked down $20 for this expecting a major upgrade. What I got instead:1. The quality in writing seems to have nose-dived. Rolling Stone seems to want to attract a younger audience so a lot of the reviews are just plain juvenile, written by what seems like high school kids. Compare the feature written on the Stones vs the one in the 1992 edition - no comparison. Note to the editors - good writing never goes out of style.2. Omissions galore! Some I've noticed:- Metallica (huh???)- Pete Townsend- Deep Purple- Queensryche- George Harrison- Scorpions (to be fair they weren't in the 92 edition)I'm sure there's more...either this was a monumental screw-up or they meant to leave these artists out. Either way, it doesn't bode well for the editors there!But that's ok, we got those bastions of rock, 98 degrees and Justin Timberlake!!! Whew!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"The previous Rolling Stone Album Guides are two of the most frequently read books I own. This one leaves out several important artists. The artists it does include often have imcomplete discographies. The reviewers skip over complete albums and the ones they do mention leads one to believe that they are unfamiliar with the album or are just plagiarizing a review from a former edition. The whole book has an incomplete feeling to it as if they put it out to meet a deadline without really listening to the albums they were supposed to review. Very weak effort. Buy one of the earlier editions instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amber's guide is truly inspirational","review":"Thanks to Amber's guide, I've overcome many faults to be the person I am today.

I have a daughter, and I believe this book will be an indispensible guide for her to reference when she doesn't feel comfortable speaking to someone about questions she may have.

Girltalk really makes sense to teenage girls. It talksabout everything: sex, drugs, money, families, and more. Atthe end of every chapter, there's a letter section, whereCarol answers girls' letters and gives them advice.Girltalk isn't a really nerdy book the way some teenageadvice books are. It doesn't tell you to do stuff nobodywho's actually a teenager would ever do, andit's written in an upbeat, interesting way. It's funny a lot of times.If you're a teenager, reading this book will make you feelnormal. I think the best part is that Carol Weston includeslittle bits from her diaries when she was a teenager, andit's cool to see what she wrote. There's not really a worstpart of this book, except that sometimes it gives advicethat's a little too old lady-ish. Mostly, though, I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop talking","review":"Everyone is always raving about how great this book is. All it did was make me feel uneasy and awkward.

Different health books say different things.

Weston's advice is levelheaded and never condescending; I disagree that it is the \\"advice found in most teen magazines\\"; it most certainly is not! If it were, I would never have read the entire book! Regardless, I would just like to caution readers that her section on how-to-survive-high-school offers few realistic solutions. Read _Girltalk_ for everything else, but for advice on the boredom and frustration of high school, please, *please*, PLEASE read _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_. Just my two and a half cents, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"Ask yourself this: Do you really want your 8 year old daughter reading about sex, rape, drugs, suicide, incest, and abuse?

Kirkby's 'Heute noch'is delightful. David Thomas is perfect as the exasperated father attempting to stop his wilful child from drinking her daily 'three bowls of coffee'. The Peasant Cantata is as fresh and zesty as the Coffee Cantata and performed with the usual precision and charm one comes to expect from these two artists. It is refreshing to hear the transparency and clarity of the small ensemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, quirky music","review":"A lot of fun.

It's comforting to have the nice blue glow - soothing and not too bright. We charge it up by day (I love that it doesn't have batteries that need forever-changed!!), and it lasts all night. I'm ordering one for my 1 1/2 year old for Christmas this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Nighttime Friend","review":"I ordered this for my daughter after the Candeloo we had malfunctioned. What I love about this nightlight is that it stays on for up to ten hours (the Candeloo was only good for three) and there are two levels of brightness. I picked the light blue color and it adds a very bright glow to an otherwise dark room. You can also turn it off by pressing the button on the bottom, or return it to the charger. The friendly shape makes it seems like a friend is watching over you. Lightweight and very easy to pick up and carry from room to room without turning on the lights. The charger base can sit on top of a dresser with the plug hidden from view and out of reach of little fingers. A very cool product at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading Description","review":"While I love the Moby light, the description under product features is misleading. This is NOT the light with the rechargable base. It has the cord in back -- the older version. I returned mine because I already have this model and wanted to upgrade and get the base.

Finally, I stumbled upon this little light on amazon one day, and ordered it for her. It worked like a charm, although the first night she insisted on sleeping with \\"my little blue friend\\" in bed with her, and it rolled out of bed in the middle of the night.

It's a good video, and gives me a good workout.

This necklace/pearls is well made - 13\\" is nice since she can barely get it onto her chin, but won't, and it's sturdy - while she's broken the necklace, she intentionally pulled on it to break it, and it took quite the effort. It's beautiful, not cheap and plastic looking, and we've received a lot of compliments.

Dogfights, submarines, aircraft carriers, antisubmarine warfare, infantry tactics, the ROK army, the US Marine Corps, politics and politicians... are realistically and accurately portrayed. Many of the actions which occurred are reminiscent of those which marked the first Korean Conflict including not only the tactical war but also the operational state of the military. The one thing which I didn't care for was the plot involving Tony and Anne. It was superfluous. Its deletion would not have affected the story at all. Otherwise and interesting book worthy of reading! This book should be of special interest to military personnel on assignment to Korea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Good story line. Really enjoyed the story line in this book. Well thought out and it held my interest nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!!","review":"Having read and enjoyed two other novels by Bond, I decided to go back and give Red Phoenix a try. I'm glad that I did. Red Phoenix was truly outstanding -- a high-tech military thriller presenting an extremely realistic portrayal of a new Korean war. From the build-up preceding the action through to the exciting conclusion, the action is fast, furious, gut-wrenching, and intense. Character development is solid, diverse and believable. The reader truly understands the emotional turmoil impacting senior officers plotting strategy and soldiers on the battlefield. Pick up and enjoy Red Phoenix. Once started, it will be difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, slow start.","review":"The book starts out slowly, building a background. Once you finally get to the start of hostilities, the pace picks up and the book is hard to put down. The reader will bounce around between several sub plots and once or twice I found myself wanting to skip ahead to find out what happened to a specific character. I do not see the story line as plausible in today's global environment, although I could definately see North Korea being a real threat to world security."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond is GREAT!","review":"I enjoyed reading Red Phoenix.

Bond really manages to pull you into the action and makes it a whole new experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the early best...","review":"One of the early books in the genre, I liked it particularly at the beginning, but the ending seemed oddly shortened to me. The description of the flight of F-16, jibes so well with Falcon 3.0 which I played incessantly when I first was reading this. The description of Kevin the infantry lieutenant was the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEEPING! Bond covers all bases in this mega techno fest!","review":"This novel is scarry in that its premise is among the most probable (not just believable but PROBABLE) of any techno thriller! Brilliantly researched, credible. It almost seems like I'm reading a transcript of CNN. Actually, in some cases in the novel, Bond want's you to think that.What else can be said? Action sequences in the air, sea and on land are fast-paced and gripping.The only shot that misses is the pointless love interest that Bond introduces between two of the story's characters - and there are many in this tale. It was unnecessary, and gummed up a large portion of the novel's considerable pages. But don't let that distract you. Red Phoenix is a classic of the techno thriller genre. It hasn't been topped since (and it was published NINE years ago!).Read it, then watch that 38th parallel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband Highly Recommends","review":"My husband has just found Larry Bond's books and he loves them.

One needs to remember this is purely fiction when the novel winds down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true story of Laura Ingalls Wilder's life!","review":"I grew up with the Little House books and still read them today. Zochert's book gives the historical facts beyond the children's books Laura wrote, and explores the times in her life that she left out of her books. It completes the picture of Laura's life for true fans. Those who have only watched the television series should read this book for a true account of pioneer life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the prairie anymore...","review":"So you plowed through the Little House anthology and want more? This is a very well-written overview of what really happened to Laura Ingalls Wilder, most of it pretty depressing.I enjoyed learning more about her, and it would make a great read for a young teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sucker Born Every Minute","review":"This is so poorly written that I hate admitting I own it. From the back cover to the very end, Zochert creates a fantastic and shoddily researched book that's only redeemable feature is the pictures. It might go over well with the legions of Little House TV freaks (the picture on the cover looks like Little Joe Cartwright), but it is a definite dud for anyone who wants a literate biography.The more one reads about Laura and Rose, the darker the picture of Laura becomes. I love her and the fantasy she's created, but when you start digging deeper, you find that Mama Bess was far from perfect. You really do feel sorry for Manly, and as he told his daughter, he had been a failure at most things in his life. I wonder who let him feel that way.Willow"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the first Biographies of an amazing author","review":"I was interested to read through several of the reviews of this book. This was the first biography of Laura Wilder that I'd read (other than Anderson's booklet \\"The Story of the Ingalls\\") and I was fascinated to learn all the little details that Donald Zochert had found. As I understand it, he took a lot of his stories straight from Laura's unpublished first manuscript, Pioneer Girl, which makes it doubly interesting. Although the book has several inaccuracies, it was the first biography done on LIW, and has several bits of information that aren't easily found elsewhere. It's a must read for Laura fans, IMO (although I could do without the cheesy cover art, especially the ridiculous pictures on the back cover!). It's very enjoyable and easy to read. It fits in nicely between the geared for children \\"Laura Ingalls Wilder\\" by Anderson, and the more scholarly \\"Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder\\" by Miller (both also excellent reads)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A viewing","review":"Lots of fun and chemistry here; my favorite doctor, companion, and stories.

This is the worst episode of Doctor Who I have seen and added nothing to the overall plot. The Doctor is in it for maybe 5 minutes.

I found Doctor Who episodes here, and I was overjoyed. One episode that some people have been complaining about, however, is the one that comes after the one where the Doctor battles Satan. I can understand some of the complaints, but if you don't think it was a good episode, think about it this way.

You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Lovely","review":"While music critics the world over continue to slag poor ol' Ian Hunter, the fans can still rejoice in the glory that was \\"Mott the Hoople\\" This release is probably Mott's highlight. \\"Marionette\\" remains one of the great visionary song lyrics of all time. \\"Roll Away the Stone\\", \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" and of course \\"Pearl & Roy\\" are still Mott classics. This CD is a MUST for any serious music collector. Critics be damned, Long live Mott !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I got this as a present from my sister. I think it came in a set, I don't remember. I got the red one, and I had expected it to be red as lipstick; thank goodness it wasn't. It gives a nice pink color to your lips. I was surprised it smelled a bit like an orange (or maybe that's the smell of a kiwi?), but the lip gloss is pretty nice. Thicker than most one I have come across, but it smoothes everything nicely. I prefer the other flavors better, but this product does the trick for dry, chapped lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Te Kanawa Shines as Arabella","review":"Arabella is one of Te Kanawa's best roles and this recording finds her near her peak, the voice effortlessly produced over a wide range, the tone full and creamy. Some find her interpretation of Arabella somewhat understated, but I think she perfectly captures Arabella's outwardly sophisticated, reserved nature, with the passion held at bay. The closing scene is quite wonderful - a real tear jerker! Fontana is not as glamourous vocally, but seems to inhabit Zdenka and make her live. She blends well with Te Kanawa in the duets. Grunheber is quite excellent in all respects - a Mandryka to fall in love with. Seiffert is the only tenor I know that really makes something of Matteo. A fine performance both vocally and dramatically. Tate leads a somewhat broad performance, which works well in this opera, emphasizing the romantic aspects nicely. The recorded sound is virtually perfect. A must have for Straussians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"I bought the book and feel cheated. The title of the book is misleading. The first 48 pages of text are very poor.

I didn't want to return the whole product, because it's usable. I woudln't want to buy the same brand anymore, and can't really recommend this product, since it doesn't have quality of inspection, hence the problems with the tips!

His \\"New World\\" with the Vienna Phil. is superior in orchestral playing and also in sonics to the London version, which wasn't one of the high points in Kertesz's cycle. Here he is rougher, tending toward sudden contrasts, and moodier. The music emerges as less genial than usual, an approach that Kertesz can't quite make convincing. Dvorak's specialty was joyous music that any listener can assimilate on first hearing, and I don't find unexplored depths in it. If you do, Kertesz's sterner reading may appeal to you. The Moldau provided as a filler is unexpectedly fiery--a maverick apaproach that works--and the playing of the Israel Phil. follows Kertesz's impassioned lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purcase ever!!!!","review":"This grill is super easy to mount, works as good as the best standing grills, saves space in the car and sets up in seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is great","review":"I love this grill.

Instead of pop songs, they create longer, more ambient tracks. \\"High Time,\\" for example, is an extended track at drifts along at its own leisure, like smoke on the wind. There's also, on the whole, much less singing by Jake Harries and more use of his voice as texture instead. \\"What's the Number\\" drifts off into the atmosphere and \\"Olive Branching\\" gets back to earth with a house beat. \\"E.V.A.\\" is about as blissful as you can get, and \\"Make Love\\" casts an ambient glow before it chugs into business. Even if Electric Hush is not as immediately engaging as Humidity, it's worthwhile in its own regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected-Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed when receiving this book.

The most appealing thing about the story lines, was the fact that Dark Skies' explanation of the events were usually about as plausible as any other explaination of what happened. It left you wondering \\"if there is any truth in it\\". Since the whole concept was a period piece, I never had a problem with special effects, as I am sure the idea was to make it in the form of a 50's-60's Sci-Fi piece. There are numerous scientists and investigators, who believe that there is a lot of truth to some of the stories.

I saw this DVD in Target and was happy to see that it came with a workout band and didn't require a step (I find I'm getting a little scared of using a step now that I'm getting older and my balance is not all that great). What really sold me was that there were 4 workouts on one DVD. I've tried all 4 of the workouts. They are all great, but I wish there were a little more arm and chest work included. The moves in Cardio Party were really difficult to learn, and I sometimes still mess up with them, but I just keep on moving. I'm not into jumpy aerobics, so when they do anything that requires both feet off the floor at the same time, I just modify it with a similar move with both of my feet on the ground. They really do make you sweat in just a short amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"I have viewed all of the workouts on the video, but have only exercised using the first one on the tape.

I thought this DVD was a great value for you get several workouts on one DVD. All are about 30 minutes long. The only negative I would add is that it would be helpful to have the weight set that is paired with these workouts. I have other free weights and had to take a little longer to switch out between sets. The band that comes with it is a little short for me (I'm 5'8\\") and I couldn't do some of the pilates moves either. All in all, it is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"No makeover for me","review":"I bought this DVD thinking it'd lead me towards a total body makeover, as the title suggested. Unfortunately, all the workouts were too light for me. So I did two workouts one after the other and still nary broke a sweat. There was not much exertion, and whatever exertion there was wasn't long enough. The DVD with workouts of about half an hour each that did give me a total body makeover was Jillian Michaels' Ripped in 30.I had a lot more mileage from The Firm's Calorie Explosion, it's fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepyourteeth","review":"This is perfect for me, I work full time and there are 4 25-35 minute work outs that I can manage.

The routines are easy to follow and are well-scripted, so the excellent cues and coaching really help you learn the sequences. You will always get a great workout. These routines are about 30 minutes each which I add to my own set of yoga and exercises. Because I am doing more strength training now, I like Hardcore Fusion the best. The Cardio Party is a little redundant, but it's easy and you can throw in some variations of your own if you want. Overall, I am a big fan of The Firm. They are the best for beginners because of the combination moves and scripting. I'm not in their \\"Firm Believer\\" program, but I still use the VHS tapes from the early 90's (Low-Impact Aerobics with Janet Jones).

I'm normally a fan of Hammer films, but this movie goes on and on forever, repeating itself, retelling (seemingly endlessly) the background of the mummy. You see very little of the mummy himself, and when you do, he is about as stimulating as a bowl of oatmeal. I found Universal's 1940's series of mummy movies much more entertaining. It was a real disappointment to see a Hammer film that was so slow paced and dull. If I had seen this movie first, I would have never purchased it. I bought it based on my enjoyment of other Hammer films. I recommend you pass on this one, unless you just have a burning desire to either own all of the Hammer films, or all of the mummy films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an award winner","review":"I would only give this book 2 stars becase I thought it would be about finding a way into a pyramid and having 10 men going in and 8 men coming out.

The badger hairs mix up a very good lather with either shaving soap or regular soap. I prefer \\"Octogon Soap.\\" Why? Because it deep cleans your skin as it smoothens your beard for shaving.

This brush is a very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, a great value!","review":"I'm very happy with this brush and I've been using it daily now for a month. It whips up a great lather and I've tried it with Taylor's Eton College cream, and a concoction of regular old soap mixed with Kiss My Face shaving cream and a couple drops of glycerin which both work wonderfully with it. All that said, it isn't the softest badger brush around, comparing it to one I bought for my father a few years back (although that one cost over 3 times as much) and it is pretty small too, so don't expect miracles out of it. For the price, it's tough to beat and so far seems pretty well made although it has lost a hair here and there. Not really a big deal to me. It holds a good amount of water within the hair after soaking in a hot bowl full for making a great warm lather after a shake or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good brush","review":"I bought this item after being \\"treated\\" by my family to a more expensive line of \\"art\\"-istic shaving gear (their cheapest brush, the one I have, is $55, and you can spend up to $1200). I got hooked on the experience of using a brush after years of foams that left me with razor bumps and irritated skin. The brush isn't the singular answer to this problem, but it helps. I got the \\"Tweezerman\\" based pretty much on price, and that is was a badger hair brush (there is a difference between badger hair and synthetic, for sure). I wanted to have a brush I could take with me on trips, and leave the other one at home. This brush is at least as good as the original brush I have. It holds water well and makes great lather.

First, the brush I received is not the brush pictured. Mine came with a shiny chrome handle (?) -- though upon reading some of the one-star reviews describing the wood cracking after only a short period, maybe that is a blessing. The bristles also started falling out with the first use. And continued with the second. I haven't yet used it a third time.All that said, it is cheap for a shaving brush.

It smells really bad when you first get it. It will go away after a while. The bristles fall out easily. It doesn't lather very well at all. I would highly recommend against this brush and just stick to getting a silver tip badger brush. Don't waste your time with the low quality unless you have fine hair, then it may be ok.

The bristles did not feel so great on my face, they were actually fairly painful rubbing on my face. The brush must have lost about 10 bristles the first time I used it. While this one is on its way back to amazon I may try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"great economy shave brush!","review":"The Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush is a great quality brush for the money. The knot is full and the handle is a nicely finished piece of wood. I would recommend this brush for a great quality starter brush. Being that Badger brushes have a wide range of quality bristles, this one has a great feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor craftmenship","review":"loved the brush for the first month i had it, then it fell apart. the brush fibers came unglued from the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I had a badger brush from the local big box store, thought this one looked a little better. I was really dissapointed. Doesn't look much like the nice rounded brush in the picture, more like one that got a bad haircut. It was jagged, much smaller brush in proportion to the handle. And the darn thing is uncomfortable to use - a green scrubby from the kitchen is softer. It is probably the last Tweezerman's product I will try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush came apart after three shaves","review":"During the third or so shave the bristles came out of the handle in one hairy bundle. I tried re-attaching bristles with wood glue and that worked for a couple months, but it has fallen apart again. Now I am looking for a new, more reliable brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shave brush","review":"This is an ok shave brush. It is very rough for a badger haired brush and feels no different than a boar hair brush. I think it probably is a boar hair with just a couple of badger hairs. Company's can legally do that as long as they use 3 percent of what they are claiming it to be and that goes for everything even food products! It feels like an old school straw broom on your face. I dropped the brush and it broke where the bristles meet the handle so the sturdiness is somewhat questionable but for 10 bucks what can you expect? I just bought the Van Der Hagen's kit for men and it should be here tomorrow (1/11/13). I just opened the Van Der Hagen kit I ordered and the brush is SO soft compared to the Tweezerman's. I cant even describe how soft this brush really is. I would never buy another Tweezerman's brush EVER. Spend the extra 20 bucks and get the Van Der Hagen's Luxury Shave Kit. Take it from someone who has VERY sensitive facial skin. You will not regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shaving brush for beginners","review":"The brush is pretty good for beginners.

This brush is nice and soft, and lathers well but do to its small size I had trouble using my shave mug to get a good lather.

Makes applying creams and shaving a breeze. Thanks for your great product!! Recommend this brush for first time shavers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not truly from improper use","review":"A few reviews state that the failure of this brush is due to improper handling, use, drying, etc. This may be the cause in many cases, however I believe there is a serious lack of quality control on these brushes. I have posted pictures showing the separation of my brush from the handle after only 2 uses. The pictures clearly show that the adhesive used was insufficient and did not contact both the handle and the brush. If it would stay together, I imagine this would be a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat for the price.","review":"This is a must have for anyone getting in to proper shaving.

I got the first close shave in decades without paying someone for it. As they say smooth as a baby's butt. I got this with a new safety razor and all. I forgot how the feeling of that hot brush and soap/cream feels. I hadn't received my oil yet or made any so I had a very small amount irritation also I haven't used a safety razor in over 20 years. There is a tendency to press too hard. It was just right for my face and shave soap.This is a hell of a good bang for the buck. I will have to get a razor and brush stand so they will dry correctly but I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great economical brush","review":"For the price range, this is a great brush. It appears that others have had issues with the hairs falling out. I haven't had any of those problems, and I've been using it daily for several weeks now. It would shed occasionally in the first few uses, but after about 5 shaves it stopped shedding. My only reason I gave 4 stars is that it is not THAT comfortable of a brush, compared to others that I have used. But for the price, it is still a great deal for the wet shaver on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses hair","review":"I read the reviews about this brush and was hesitant to buy it because it's so cheap. Several of the other reviews talked about how it loses hair. I saw a few reply to those saying that if you take proper care of it then it won't. Well, I assure you it still does. It started losing hair the first time I used it and has continued several shaves later. I won't be buying this again. I guess you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money !!","review":"DO NOT BUY !!!

It's comfortable enough to use and sure beats using shaving cream from a can. Highly recommended if you're on a budget, or if you're looking for a \\"starter\\" or travel brush that might get a little beaten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality?","review":"I followed the \\"experts\\" advice but this brush continues to lose bristles from shave one. I just started \\"real shaving\\" after years of cartridges and $$$ and canned foam. Despite extra care while whipping up lather, I found my soap, my mug, and my \\"mug\\" covered in badger bristles. Tried gently rinsing the brush, light shaking it, and being very gentle but still ended up covered in bristles. After using the brush and following the expert's advice on rinsing and shaking, and hanging it up to dry, handle end up, the brush now looks like a rounded shrub, with stray bristles sticking out the sides at odd angles. Despite the brush, though, I had a very enjoyable experience shaving with my new DE razor, getting a nice, smooth, close shave. My better half noticed the difference immediately! I am hooked! Now, on to find a good quality brush for my next shave....and I never ever thought I would look forward to shaving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds more than my dog.","review":"Is that my hair in the drain or from the brush?

For $15, I guess it did the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lather Hog!","review":"My first brush and I cannot recommend it. It builds a good lather, but won't release soap to your face.

THE PRICE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, LOOSES HAIR RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, AND WHEN SHAVING IT LEAVES HAIR ON YOUR FACE, IT ALSO STUNCK LIKE A RUBBER OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE FIRST- SECOND USE (BUT I DOUBT IT).

But its ok after it sheds the loose hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an upgrade from a long hair boar brush","review":"I'm fairly new to wet shaving. I asked my wife if she could get me this as an upgrade to my existing long hair boar brush thinking that this would be softer and more absorbent. This brush the bristles are cut into a pleasing round shape but what that does is make them really prickly. I feel like this thing is stabbing the heck out of my face when I use it. I tried my boar brush and its soft and makes a nice rich lather just like this one without the skin irritation. I'm kind of bummed because I thought that this would improve my shaving experience but it just makes my skin feel irritated. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I think the only reason this brush rates so highly is because its cheap, and people don't know any better. Before I knew what I was doing, I thought well of this brush. After upgrading to a quality brush, I realize just how poorly it performs. This brush smelled terrible for the first few months. It had that terrible badger smell linger even after soaking and washing and daily use. It sheds constantly. I have owned it for almost 2 years and now only use it as a travel brush. The bristles are very hard nd don't lather nearly as well as others. They don't hold heat or water well. The paint began chipping off and the wood began to discolor after only a couple months. I always hung it to dry, so there is no excuse for that. If you are reluctanto spend the money, it is better than nothing, but I recommend simply starting with a quality brush instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds Bristles Consistently","review":"Even with a shaving brush stand and gentle use (both in the cup and on my face), this brush has lost bristles every time I've used it. I will be returning it.

I'll probably by a better one later on if I don't go back to Barbisol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stiff bristle","review":"Not a stiff enough brush for my taste. The bristle flattens out as soon as you start working in the lather and end up working the soap in with the stump of the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweezerman badger brush","review":"No great disappointment, just a nice brush for a very good price. I've used it twice since buying and a few bristles have shed, as to be expected, but on the whole... not too bad considering. The handle is fairly well finished with no areas untouched by the protective coating. The natural bristles do have a fairly distinct odour, but I'm sure this will pass with continued use.... I hope so anyway.EDIT: 21st Aug.That natural bristle odour, from the brush I spoke of, has dissipated quickly. A few more hairs have shed/broken but have been slight. For it's cost and performance, I recommend that you buy this one. I really should've bought two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweezerman should stick to tweezers","review":"Lost about 2 dozen bristles on the first shave and I found the brush extremely hard. I only used this once and went back to my Van Der Hagen that I bought as part of a $7 shave kit at Walmart. Shown here:Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)Soap in Van Der Hagen kit is great as well. Bowl is small but gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the value and performance 5/5","review":"This was my first shaving brush and I would recommend this as a starter brush for any beginner looking into getting into wet shaving. For the price you can't beat it. I have used mine daily for the past five months and it has held up well. Expect to lose a few bristles during the first week but it won't be anything dramatic. The pictures of this brush don't really do it justice. After regular use the bristles seem fuller and it takes on a much wider look than what you will see here. The bristles also become much softer over time so stick with it. When it comes to lathering, as long as you soak it for a few minutes beforehand you will have an easy time with it. I have used it with soaps and creams and it does an equally good job. I've since upgraded to an Edwin Jagger brush to try out a higher quality hair grade but this brush will still be used when I'm traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and going strong!!!!! Best bang for the buck!","review":"Amazing brush for $12. It shed like a mofo when I first bought it, but mainly because it's OVER-PACKED with badger bristle. Is it annoying? Not to me.. I payed $12.... and I received a brush with almost 2x bristles of brushes I saw at Art of Shaving for 3x the price and same quality hair... so no I have NO complaints. After a few months the shedding stopped, I still get maybe 1 loose bristle every once in a while but nothing serious. After 3 years of constant use and abuse, my brush is beautiful. No mold, no excessive bristle loss, creates a beautiful and full lather on a drop of a proraso shaving cream, and still fuller than the brushes sold as new from shaving stores I hit up to window shop. SO, will I tell you to buy this?? HELL YES!!!!! For the price it can't be beat. Don't worry about the shedding it stops and your brush still works and looks great after."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get wat you pay for","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of other reviewers. I have to say I am really disappointed. I have been using the brush for two weeks solid and it leaves hairs/bristles on my face every time. It isn't how I am storing or using this brush that is causing this either. I have a proper stand and clean it after each use. I have been shaving old school for years now and am no novice. Save your money and buy a better quality brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great, really.","review":"I bought this brush when I first began DE shaving about 6 months ago and used it for the first 3.5 months. I never had any problems with the handle. It's still fine. There was some moderate shedding at the beginning, which is to be expected. Lathers up ok. Water retention isn't bad either.The thing I don't like is that it's too scratchy, even after having broken in, which didn't take long (a few uses). It's not horribly scratchy, but it is enough to where I never use it anymore now that I have a couple of brushes that are better quality (and more expensive - Semogue 1305 boar and Parker Silvertip badger). Granted, the Tweezerman's a cheap badger brush, and if you just have NO money, I suppose it's ok... maybe. I wouldn't recommend it, though. It might be kind of difficult to get better quality than this at its low price, but I think spending a little more on a better brush, even for a beginner, is definitely the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"After reading all these awesome reviews of this Brush I decided to buy it. It is hands down the worst purchase I made on Amazon. This Brush absolutely STINKS! Not only that it doesn't lather properly it has a foul smell that you cannot get rid of. I used it for 3 weeks and tried every trick in the book to get rid of the smell but nothing helped. I ended up throwing it away. My Omega brush that I picked up in a convenience store for $8 bucks does a way better job.I would not recommend this brush to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Brush","review":"Based on the price, I have to admit that I was not expecting a premium quality brush .

I had to use my nails to try to pick out the badger hairs so that I could shave. It made it a lengthy and annoying process. I wish I had purchased this locally rather than on Amazon; I would have headed straight back to the store to return it. (It's not worth returning it now because I'd only get 50% back.) I have kabuki and powder makeup brushes that work better than this. I've only used it once, but I'm not looking forward to my next attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price, not top of the line, but a value buy","review":"This is an excellent value, and quite usable. I bought it as my first badger hair brush, and haven't been disappointed. I would recommend it as a first brush for those becoming acquainted with wet shaving, or as a travel brush. It shed for the first several uses, but the last five or so shaves, it has preformed wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made a difference","review":"I was not sure what to expect when I got this as stocking stuffer.

Second there were a few loose badger hairs when I opened up the packaging. However after several uses I have not seen any other hairs out of place.It worked like a charm just a little bit of shave cream and the next thing you know my face has the look of a frothing maniac. It also gets the whiskers to stand up which makes shaving easier.The Tweezerman worked fine for me and for now I dont know why anyone would want to buy a brush at double the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It attacks my face like a badger!!","review":"This brush pokes my face with stiff bristles no matter how much hot water and shave cream I use with it.

I understand new brushes and break-in periods and all that, but this thing isn't going to last long enough to be broken in.

Good thing the brush was inexpensive.That said, it's not \\"cheap\\" but very good value. The bristles may or may not be badger but they work well and are well adhered to the handle. It whips up a good head of soap and doesn't get too bogged down or stiff with soap residue nor does it shed much after a day or so. The handle itself fits well in your hand and has decent weight.Given the rather ridiculous price of many other brushes, this one is great.

I used it to lather up, and as soon as it was under my nose I started smelling something. Like another reviewer said, it was exactly like a dead animal in the hot summer sun. Considering the fact that many reviewers love this thing, I think I must have gotten a terrible one that is out of the ordinary, and I truly wonder if there is a bit of badger flesh packed into the handle of this thing - it smelled that bad right out of the package.

It sheds a bristle every now and then, or I'd give it 5-starts.Well, it's still going strong 8/2012. I'm bumping it to 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affordable and disposable","review":"My experience with this brush has been terrible. Well, the first two or three days were wonderful. By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor. By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again. I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results.***Update, a few months later: I didn't replace the brush. I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle. It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then. The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off. Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad!","review":"The brush is not the most comfortable I've used; but I lived with it.

I used it for a little while and liked it but I will stick with my boar brush.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad little brush for the price, I just prefer a boar brush because I find them more comfortable. Badger hair is way too soft and it feels more like a mop and less like a brush.All in all I'd say badger brushes are over rated. I'd recommend this product if you want to see what badger brushes are all about but don't want to spend a fortune on a fancy one or if you already like badger brushes but want a cheap one for traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell fresh as a badger!","review":"I previously had another brand of badger-hair brush that I liked, which never smelled like a badger. Imagine spreading \\"wet zoo-smell\\" over your face before you shave each day. That lather is right there under your nose, tainted with the oily smell of badger. I've rinsed and squeezed multiple times and the initial smell has dropped off, but I don't think it ever will completely.This product was only $10, so it's not even worth the effort to return it, but I won't buy this brand again. My previous brush was from Lehmans.com for about $24 and never had a bad smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after ~2 months","review":"After ~2 months of daily use, the brush detached from the handle and could not be reattached.

It got to the point that when I would shake the water out of the brush that a few hairs would fall out. I took excellent care of the brush making sure to dry it in a brush holder and to never leave any soap in it.

The brush shed at least 20 hairs, if not more, the first time I used it. Since then the amount has gone down with each shaving, but it is at about 2-3 per shaving. It's like a cheap paintbrush that is constantly losing its bristles, which end up on the soap cake or plastered to the side of my face.

A few hairs came loose during the first use, but nothing too bad. The second time I used this, after a couple strokes of whipping up the lather, the brush separated from the handle.

I will say that this way of shaving is the best I've ever had, though it took me just a little time to \\"unlearn\\" the old habits.Anyway, about this brush. I sent it back today and good riddance to it. It STUNK. I had to put it back in the box it smelled so badly- it stunk up my appartment.

Yes some of the bristles fall out; it's not a $100 brush so don't expect it to be. If you want a brush that is never going to lose one bristle then buy one that costs alot more money. I get one or two bristles falling out some days and some days none. I think it will probably stop soon. I have had no issues with them detaching from the handle but if I do, I will post it.

In fact, I passed over this brush several times BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, thinking that it COULDN'T POSSIBLY be a badger brush for that price... and yet, it seems to be, as far as I can tell, based on my lather and wear so far. I finally ordered it figuring \\"what have I got to lose for the price?\\"-- and I'm glad I did.As others have mentioned, I've also had an issue with a few bristles falling out during my first few shaves. They work their way out of the cluster and get washed away during my rinse. Honestly, I can't even tell they're gone-- the brush has only gotten better for me the more I use it.

Even the finish on this brush's handle wears better than the more expensive ones'. It gets a rinse & couple of shakes after each use to free the water & soap; that's all it needs.

To get the best shave ever, shave with the grain with the gel, then go back and shave with some shave secret in the other direction.

I had been using an excellent Boar bristle brush given to me by a fellow wet shaver. This brush is hands down softer and more comfortable than my old brush. The quality and volume of the lather is wonderful. The only down side I find is, I have to work at building the lather a bit longer (I use a hard milled shaving soap) but that's just whining. I only gave this brush four stars because, being my first Badger brush I have nothing in its class to compare it too. I do think it is a great brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked until it didn't","review":"I had no problems with this brush for about 2 months. The quality of the hair seemed to be sufficient and provided a great lather. Unfortunately, after 2 months the whole wad of bristles fell out of the base :/Because of this, I can't recommend it. I'll pay the extra couple bucks for a higher quality one I suppose.EDIT: I just received the brush I ordered as a replacement:100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Blue Wood Handle & Free Stand - From Parker Safety Razor, and it is leagues above my old Tweezerman brush. The bristles are much softer and hold water/lather so much more effectively. The difference is so distinct that I wonder if the Tweezerman brush might actually be boar's hair instead the fair superior badger hair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell Apart but Company Replaced it","review":"I bought this Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush in June 2011. During the first week of use after a couple of shaves it fell apart although I was placing it upside down for it to dry. I still use it without the handle but it is a bit uncomfortable. The bristles are great but the glue was not strong enough. I just emailed Tweezerman at their website to see what they say.Tweezerman emailed me back and stated that I should include a note and ship the item back to them at an address they provided me (NY). I went to the post office and for $3.00 I got a box and shipped the shaving brush with a copy of the email that they had sent me. Shortly thereafter Tweezerman delivered a brand new brush in the box to my home. I am very satisfied with their warranty.The badger hair is very nice and soft. And sure is a lot easier and better than using your hands to lather your face with shaving cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Difference","review":"After all the 609 customer reviews, I doubt if anyone is going to pay any attention to this one. However, I can truly say that, I purchased abrush that costs around 45 dollars, by the time that I received it. This brush Tweezerman, I can tell do difference. The high price brush, issmaller and has a ivory colored plastic handle.This brush Tweezerman, does have a solid wood handle. I had rather have two of these, for one of the high priced one. This new brush holds lathervery well and is completly soft. It appears to be very well constructed, and made of the highest quality of materials. I believe that this brush isthree times the quality and feels better on your face than, the high priced NAME BRAND, which costs a third of the other.

I think it was boar hair.The badger hair in this brush seems a little prickly at first, but it works up a lather ten times better and spreads it on quite well. My main reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it does seem like the hairs come out rather quickly. My last brush did not last very long (maybe 9 or 10 months) and I suspect this one will be replaced a little earlier than I'd like, as well. But, for near $10, you get what you pay for, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO bad! Don't buy it!","review":"Honestly, this product is worse than the synthetic counterparties.

It worked really well while it lasted, but it didn't even last one shave so... yeah. You really weren't very careful with this one, Tweezerman. Everyone should be aware of this possibility when you buy one of these, because I'm not the only one who's reported this. For such an integral part of my kit, I'll pay another 10 bucks for something that will last longer than one shave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice travel brush","review":"I bought this to use as a travel brush. It is nice sized for the kit, applies lather well (much nicer than the el-cheapo I bought at Wal-Mart) and dries quickly. I also like the appearance.

As I like to alternate days, I thought thia Tweezerman would be a good middle of the road brush. As it turns out, I find it to be the least comfortable brush I have ever owned. The brissles/hair in the center of the brush actually feel prickly when attempting to lather my face. It appears to be well constructed but sheds heavily. I was very disappointed with this brush overall and could not, in good conscience, recommend it at any price point. Rather than retruning the brush, I will throw it in with my guncleaning gear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the money","review":"The brush has great water retention, and lathers wonderfully.

Along with my Merkur razor, I purchased the Tweezerman Brush, and I'm impressed with its quality. Badger hair brushes can, apparently, cost well into the hundreds of dollars, so I wasn't expecting much for 15 bucks, but this is a good little brush. I get a good lather for my shaves and the badger hairs stay in place, for the most part. The only thing missing is a stand, which would really come in handy for drying, but for $15, you couldn't really ask for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"The brush size is good and I can live with the fact that it stank like a badger out of the package.But the fact that the brush's hair is constantly falling out is rather annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk - sheds, smells, cracked handle, poorly finished","review":"You get what you pay for. Brand new, my Tweezerman brush shed like a sick cat, smelled bad when wet, had a small crack on each side of the handle, and even had a small piece of paper embedded in the lacquer. I wish I could return it, but I tossed the packaging and didn't get around to using it for a month. I think the shedding has finally stopped and the smell is gone (probably from the glue) but I'm going to sand and refinish the handle. It works, but it's definitely the bottom of the barrel for a badger hair brush. Get something better if you have the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too good to be true","review":"this brush has great bristles, comparable to brushes 3 or 4 times the price, but after 6 weeks of use the handle fell off.

I'm shaving more hair from this brush than on my body. It literally will not stop shedding on me. I'm submitting it for a refund or at least a replacement. And buyer beware.

It's a great first product for somebody that's starting out with shaving.My only gripe about it is that some of the hairs have fallen out. It is not even close to a point of concern, but in the shaving soap cup where you swish the brush around, there's a few hairs in it.

And it does the job for providing a quality shave lather but I don't see this Tweezerman lasting long. When the brush arrived it already had hairs falling out inside the box and the lettering was faded almost off. A subpar product but you get what you pay for. This was on sale for $8 which is the only reason I got it, I'll gladly end up paying 3 times that to get a better brush. The hairs are dyed or mixed in some solution, when I soaked my brush in hot water to clean it the first time a residue/dye of some sort came out.

For example, in addition to learn about the numerous ways Napoleon's two decade rule transformed Europe, we learn that his wife and Empress Josephine's wardrobe contained 666 winter dresses, 230 summer ones and only two pair of knickers. If one wishes for a direct introduction to Napoleon and his influence, The Age of Napoleon is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on the France of Napoleon","review":"Alistair Horne's book on the Age of Napoleon is a great book if you want to know more about France itself under Napoleonic rule. Horne goes into all the different affairs of France including domestic problems dealing with finance and war. He describes the popularity of Napoleon within the Empire as well as how he stocked that popularity to his advantage. Perhaps most interesting is how he talked about the lesser known parts of Napoleon. He talked for instance about the famine in 1810 and the financial crisis in 1804. He also talks about how the war itself affected the people of France. The book is not too long, under 200 pages, but is a good overview of the France of Napoleon and the emperor's rise to power. This book however is NOT a military history so do NOT order this book for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an enjoyable read","review":"I don't recommend this book unless you're already familiar with the entire history of Napoleon. It's filled with vague references, assumes the reader lives in the writer's world with the references he doesn't explain, and uses many French sentences without any translation.I bought this small book, hoping it would be a quick, interesting read. I found it was neither.On the other hand, if you enjoy French arrogance, you might enjoy working through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"All my friends told me that I absoloutly HAD to read this book and that it was sooooo great.

I was the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bland, but the Pictures are Grand","review":"This mild, but event-filled re-telling of the Pecos Bill story lacks the incorrigible air of tongue-in-cheek humour and bold-faced lies of the typical tall tale. However, and especially if your young\`uns never heard a tall tale, the wonderful illustrations will partially make up for this. When we started to read this book, we thought those sweet-faced, round-eyed, snub-nosed cowboys looked a little familiar: this guy is the same feller who illustrated HOW MUCH IS A MILLION? which we like alot. My boys love the snake lasso, and we return many times to the fantastic \\"critter\\" that Bill wrassles into submission. But breaking-in \\"Widder-maker\\" is an let-down after that adventure, I am afraid. I recommend Adrien Stoutenburg\`s AMERICAN TALL TALES for older children (9-12yrs) which has few illustrations but whose style is far better suited to the dramatic and poetic nature of the tall tale genre. My seven-year old loves to hear me read those aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and funny version of a great tall tale!","review":"I grew up reading Kellogg's books and loved everyone of them from Pinkerton to the Tall Tales.

Part of what made the Pecos Bill story appealing when I was a child was the danger involved and the rough and ready lifestyle. This is just too \\"white bread\\" - boring, bland, yawn inducing. They completely domesticated Widowmaker (his horse), referring to him as \\"Lightening\\" for the majority of the story. On the plus side, the story retains a few more elements than Kellogg's abyssmal rendering of Paul Bunyan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pecos Bill","review":"Pecos Bill is a good witten fantasy childrens book.

Pecos finds a white stallion that is the fastest ever and helps heard the cattle so the town can do things without them in the way.Pecos Bill takes place in Texas after he falls off the wagon. One thing I liked that the author did was make it a fast pace book and not run on. The problem was mainly that the texans were looking to get the cattle out of the way of their town.

Here and there it is a bit difficult who the subject is of a sentence, as the relative pronoun sometimes doesn't come after the immediately preceding subject of a sentence, but that happens rarely. Mr Moseley's reads like a thriller, but at the same time is a thoroughly researched, critical reading of a tragic, through fascinating period of history. I cannot recommend this book more highly for anyone interested obviously in history, but also for those interested in human behviour and our ability to deceive and contradict ourselves. Do read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A even-handed analysis of a most contradictory man","review":"Mr. Moseley provides an even-handed review of Ciano; a most complex individual who was a bundle of contradictions.

I resold the Anakin figure and put Dengar in the seat of the swoop bike and it looks great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Academic Drivel","review":"The author engages in loose, impressionistic musing about problems in the highly politicized field of social science. On page 56, for instance, during a discussion of the use of the term \\"gendered,\\" Sayer writes, \\"On the whole, I find it hard to think of much that is good about masculinity.\\" Sayer is arguing, however, that we shouldn't assume that everything masculine is bad, as some in the field tend to do. And why not? Well, it's difficult to say what is masculine and what is not (56-58); these are rather general rubrics. Why, then, does Sayer express disdain for most things that are masculine? Probably to avoid getting into trouble by appearing to be pro-masculine in spite of his attempt to argue that masculinity is not always bad. Books like this will occupy the landfills of the near future, and rightly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"shimmer scarf....","review":"I was disappointed by the size of the scarf.

They are pretty but a little short and the white one is quite grayish. I guess they are okay for the money but feel that calling them silk is a deception!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True beach read.","review":"Three girls with three completely different backgrounds become au pairs and travel to the Hamptons for a summer of work and play. By day, they are nannies to the Perry children but by night, they party and hang with the rich and famous. Sounds like a good plot right? I thought so until I read the first few pages. The plot is quite similar to the \\"Sunset Island\\" series and \\"The Nannies\\" series but it doesn't have much innocence. Instead, it is about the latest fashion trends, drinking, partying, boys, and sex. Not to mention the stereotypical characters. This is a true beach read but if you want some advice, once you're done throw the book into the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This book was wonderful...the chapters were very short which led for a delightful fast-paced book. I am in love with this book. There are so many twists & turns...although not very realistic. The only thing I didn't like was that the girls were 16 and acted as if they were like 19 or 20! But besides that awesome book..can't wait to read the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Au Pairs","review":"The Au Pairs by Melissa de la Cruz was an amazing novel with drama on every page. Jacqui, Eliza, and Mara are three girls from three very different worlds who all answer the same classified ad to be au pairs over the entire summer for the Perry family. Acccording to the ad, the job pays 10,000 dollars and promised to be the best summer of their lives. The Perrys live on a huge estate in the Hamptons and have four kids. All the girls have taken the job for different reasons. In the end, all three of them experience loss, happiness, disappointment, sadness, love, some amazing parties, and the true bonds of friendship. Each girl emerges from the summer a little bit different than when they arrived. Overall, I would recommend this book to all female adolescents who are looking for a juicy, summer beach read. If you liked The Au Pairs, then you will definitely love the sequel Skinny-Dipping, also by Melissa de la Cruz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Well Written!","review":"I am not a \\"chick\\" and I haven't been \\"thirty-something\\" for twenty-something years, but I found this book to be exceptionally clever and engaging. Melissa DeLaCruz is obviously a brilliant young talent who will be a best-selling author in a very short time.This book was so much fun I could not put it down until I finished it. Yes, I live close the beach but nowhere near the Hamptons.The entire book was magnificent. The \\"rules for Hamptons travel\\" alone is more than worth the price of admission. I could not stop laughing! Anyone who shares my loathing of cretins who broadcast their cell phone conversations in public venues will revel in this chapter, and anyone who enjoys an exhilirating and delightful read will be captivated by this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Au Pairs","review":"I've read The Au Pairs four times now.

I have reccomended this book to lots of friends who have also loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING & SIMPLISTIC--DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I was an au pair last summer, and wanted to like this book. But it's as if publishers now think that anyone they throw in front of a computer can write teen chick lit and girls will buy it. I adored the A LIST which is smart and well-written as well as smarmy and fun. GOSSIP GIRLS was fun for one book and then it got old. This didn't hold me for 30 pages and if you have a functioning brain it won't hold you, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The Au Pairs was a decent book, not bad but not good.

If you are, then stray far, far away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time!","review":"This book follows 3 teens on their summer as au pairs in the Hamptons.

Spent hours out there on the beach flying it. Took a few hours to get a hold of it, but it's an easy kite to fly. It held up well in my times of crash landings, hard or soft. This kite is a blast to fly and is a great way to spark up conversation on the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to stunt kiting & love it!!","review":"Brand new to stunt kiting and read some reviews online before jumping in. Prism kept coming up as the best stunt kite to introduce the beginner to the sport. I could'nt agree more!! This is a great kite! Well constructed, easy to put together, looks awesome and really easy to fly. Twenty minutes into my first outing I was definitely getting the hang of it and the crash landings at the start seemed to have no effect on the kite at all!(and some of those were pretty hard!)Great construction. If you're looking to get into the sport and don't want to spend a fortune, get this kite!! You won't be disappointed! I will definitely be looking to upgrade to higher end model before long...it's addicting for sure! By the way, check out some videos on YouTube by Chris Maxa for instructions on controlling/maneuvering. Very helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty fun flyer if you cand handle it","review":"This isn't a kite, it's a sports car. A really, really fast, well-handling car. Like a car, you better be able to handle it, because it's going to wreck while you learn.First time you hit a strong wind, you'll see what I mean. It's brilliantly engineered. If you're really good, you could chase birds with it - it's that agile.Highly recommended, but you need to be able to handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Prism changed contract manufacturer","review":"Got an older Nexus from 2008 (with the rectangular product tag), it flies great and pretty durable too.

Instead this corporate made band, which was put together by Island Records, is nothing more than a Avril Lavigne clone for tweens who think it's rebellious to be goth. I have actually listened to this song and it is pure pop with some 'spooky' lyrics thrown in. Maybe I could forgive this song if the lyrics were delivered in an original manner, but instead they are sung blandly, and not too well.All in all this is just a pure pop song, so don't be fooled by the promo hype on this page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book, poorly edited","review":"This book is poorly written, lacking in information, and what information it does contain is roughly edited; there are errors throughout.

I've been using Amazon for the last 7 years and they are great. But for this purchase it was supposed to be a NEW product when I bought it but apparently they sent me a used \\"returned\\" item. The product's box was all messed up when I got it and it was missing the locking hitch pin as well. Fortunately I had ordered a key locking pin as well so I didn't bother the missing pin that didn't come with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Des the job.","review":"Purchased this for a step up to my camper on my 03 Tundra. Fairly well built but it fits loose in the receiver. I wrapped Rhino tape around it which took some of the slack out of it. The included clamp that is supposed to keep the step from from feeling wobbly as you step on it is useless. The hand bolt to secure it is too short to get the threads started. The other issue is the tube fills up with water when it rains. The black anti-slip plastic piece you see pictured allows sitting water to enter the holes beneath it where it is held in place. I wouldn't think water is a good thing to have inside a metal tube. Besides that, when you take the step off be careful where you store it as the {rusty) water will leak out. I'm tempted to pop the plastic piece off to silicone seal it in place but I'm afraid of breaking whatever tabs are there to hold it in place. Hard to recommend this product. It works but was it worth the price?? Don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few things to consider for GM 2500HD/Class V 2-1/2\\" receiver","review":"This is a great hitch step. Very lightweight and easy to put on of course.The contraption to keep the step tight and rattle-free in the receiver doesn't fit too well in a class V receiver with an adapter that takes it from 2-1/2\\"-2\\" but it does work. You can tighten up by adding a nut.The backup sensors on my 2012 GMC Denali HD are blocked by the step so they are automatically disabled by default. I cannot enable/turn them back on. I did not consider this before purchase. In my case it's ok with the backup camera but you should look into this.I'd recommend this, there's not a lot of similar products on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I loved the product , it fitted snug into the hitch receiver , the only regret is that go rhino should should catalogue their products in order of type/ quality like chrome, stainless steel, etc .

Great product for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Fiction","review":"Where I have tolerated and even enjoyed the previous books in this series, I have had enough. Really? Dar Roberts is too fictional to even tolerate. There's not even 25% of her personality that is believable enough to be enjoyable in this book. I am also sick and tired of Kerry going on and on about how conservative is okay. Look she's a smart lesbian, couldn't her personality have evolved better than her still holding on to this ridiculous Republican view of the world. She clearly has not met enough non white, right and rich people in the world; which by the way makes NO SENSE....she lives in Miami...Seriously?? I hope young lesbians do not read this series...they will be very disappointed in the poor depiction of non rich white people. I wish I could get my money back from this entire series. The ONLY reason this book gets two stars is because I appreciate the special emotional and physical bond that Kerry and Dar have as a couple and as best friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scholarship source for performing arts students","review":"The sad fact is that not all schools offer scholarships for students in the arts. On the other hand, almost all schools offer scholarships for athletics. This is one of the few books that brings attention to schools that appreciates those of us in the performing arts. I would choose my school based on this book alone, just because someone in my field is getting money. It's nice to be appreciated. You could simply contact the schools directly, but this is easier and worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-usable information for me too!","review":"I was IMMENSELY disappointed with this book, as I was expecting more versatile information. ALL the scholarships in this book are exclusively limited to schools. But what about the national scholarships that seem to appear throughout the country no matter what school you go to? This book ignores those, and truth be told, you could save yourself the money and just ask the schools that you find in your search what scholarships they offer yourself. I would recommend this book as a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE Not Blue's Room","review":"I purchased this product because my son LOVES the puppet Blue.

I am a Blues Clues fan and my little boy loves the DVDs; but I wish I could return this one.Nick Jr. should have stuck with its original format for Blue Clues. Blue Talks is lame (especially when you compare it to the other episodes). The dialogues for the characters are cheesy and not as exciting as the other DVDs.Blue Talks did not hold my 18 month old's interest like the others do. If you're looking for Blues Clues DVDs, I suggest making this one the last on your list, if you buy it at all. Instead, get Shapes and Colors, Blues Big Band, Blue Takes you to School, Classic Blues, or Blue's Big Musical Movie. All of them are ten times better than Blue Talks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Preschooler movie","review":"I saw this on Nick Jr Television recently.So I wished I had this on DVD.The bonus features sound nice.I might like this becaue I loved that Blue Talks episode of Blue's Clues which has been airing from 1996 or 1997 and has never been a rerun.The show has still been worth watching after the past 7 or 8 years.Blue's Clues was a very lucky show for Nick Jr because it was educational,it was fun,it was money-making and it was the very first show to premeire on Nick jr.If you like the show,buy this DigatalVideoDisk or DigitalVersatileDisk or DVD ,whatever you want to call it.Plus I found out there was an episode called Love Day which I also aw on TV.I like that one too.It ws also has Cinderella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"The case protects well from things from the outside, however, the stitches around the plastic covering over the screen scratch and scuff the player on the inside.

If the Allman Brothers Band had put out this album, you would think \\"Wow, this is a really hip, modern sound\\". Unfortunately, this is a North Mississippi Allstars album.Polaris heralds a new direction for this band - a smoother, quieter direction. This is far from the raw, blues-rock of Shake Hands With Shorty or 51 Phantom. This is a more pacified Allstars. Gone is the Marshall stack cranked up to 11; in are layered harmonies and strings.Again, it depends on what you like. Shorty and Phantom will continue to get loud plays on my CD player; Polaris will not. What can I say? I like my Allstars loud and raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction To The NMAS","review":"Polaris is my first introduction to the North Mississippi Allstars.

A talented and good band. I look forward to more from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"NMA meets Oasis","review":"Beatlesque power pop is a bit of a stretch for these Delta disiples and I can see why it pains those who invested in the Allstars that produced Shake Hands, A legit 5 star rootsy effort. Having said that, I like it, but then again I liked Wilco's last release. I can't get many of the tunes on Polaris out of my head, like Otay. If you like the Allstars and you're good with power pop too, you're going to like this. If, on the other hand, you're looking for another Shake Hands, look elsewhere, Joe Bonnamassa's Blues Deluxe is highly recommended. I thought that some of the other reviews for this were a bit heavy handed, the songwriting here is no where near a bad as Phish's Round Room, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fewer Stars for the All-Stars","review":"Another step backwards for a band that had already stepped back with their sophmore offering.

It's not that they're branching out, it's not that they aim at pop success....it's just that there's not one good song on this CD and also no direction or concept. They're trying to sound like Big Star, they got Noel Gallagher sitting in...it doesn't matter, things ain't happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this! You can have mine!","review":"I really really wanted to like this album. I read other online reviews for months and each time decided not to buy it. But then I heard samples of the good tracks and finally broke down and bought it. Mistake.Though about 3 of the tracks are excellent, and another 4 are acceptable, the others are painful. So painful I don't think I can ever listen to this again. I'm not sure who sings Otay, One to Grow On (it will never grow on me that's for sure), Polaris, and Time for the Sun to Shine, but they need to stop singing for this band.Even though NMA's live shows still rule don't buy this. Just let it go, never think of this album again, unless you like MTV hot tracks and you like canned rap rock with bubbly lyrics.What happened? Why did I buy this? Refund please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as you've heard!","review":"I suppose you cant blame a band for trying to branch out but there has to be some decent tunes to branch out with. There are three tracks here which are without doubt among the worst i've heard and much of the remainder is fairly flimsy. Theres a distinct lack of slide guitar which seems peverse when you have on board the most talented slide player in years. I dont know where they go from here as they rightly seem to be reluctant to simply rehash the brilliant 'shake hands with shorty' but this is a shocker. I bet they're still fabulous live though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked their raw blues sound ..save your money","review":"This album could not be further from that.What used to be a very live sound reminiscent of early Allmans and Cream is replaced by an overproduced pop slickness that will leave you cold.Maybe they are trying to get more radio airplay or find a new fanbase, who knows? I believe they will lose many early fans with this effort.The first two NMAS releases are the types of discs that I like to listen to on the road, POLARIS is the type of disc that I would pitch out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick studio -pop sounding","review":"I was extremly disapointed in this 3rd release from the NMAS. I have been a huge fan up until now. If this is the direction that the band is going, then I'm going the other way. Gone are the jams, the Les Pauls through cranked Marshalls that dominate 51 Phantom. Gone is the great blues of Shake Hands with Shorty. This sounds like they're trying to break onto the Top 40 airwaves. I don't know what happened. Did the record company say that they wanted more mainstream/pop-sounding stuff? Was the band stupid enough to listen to them. If so, then I along with many NMAS fans have lost a lot of respect for them. These guys are great musicians but Polaris is terrible. Save your money. Shake Hands with Shorty and 51 Phantom are great CD's. Personally I'm using my copy of Polaris as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Got To Be Kidding?","review":"What were they thinking?

Okay, the animation is decent, but the story is horrible, the screenplay atrocious, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlovable. Just because they're animals doesn't make them funny or cute or even at all interesting. The plot is predictable in most places, and completely bizarre in the others. The movie can't decide whether it's trying to be funny or a heart-touching relationship story, and in the end it's neither.

Yeah it does have a striking resemblence to madagascar but who cares. It is also unique aswell. First off it is a lot more serious than madagascar was which right away makes it more directed at a younger crowd but still had its very funny moments. The squirrel and the koala were a riot and I laughed throughout the whole movie. These movies take years to make and came out too close together for disney to see madagascar then try to rip it off. That fact alone is the only reason this movie got negative reviews but this was a great movie and me and my wife extremely enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff","review":"This movie is nothing but a big rip off of Madagascar, and a VERY lame one at best.

I really hope I bought this during the holiday sales because if I paid anything more than half off, I would be very upset. Don't get me wrong. It's not a \\"bad\\" movie. There's just nothing original in it. Even forgetting Madagascar, it's a rehash of other animated films and TV episodes of the past 50 years.

The only thing is that the movies mention were both excellent movies. I like disney movies very much but if you have to choose between The Wild and Madagascar, Madagascar is a movie that have all the things that make a movie real good. The Wild is boring most of the time, my children didn't laugh and the bad guys are really ugly they even mention The Omen ??? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PARENTS BE WARNED","review":"Aside from the brilliance of Eddie Izzard as Nigel, The Wild is a clear attempt from Disney to rip off several other adventures and doesn't even do that well. Too many characters trying to be the center of things and a plot that really couldn't be more droll.BUT HERE IS MY ISSUE. A \\"G\\" RATING?!? WERE THEY SERIOUS? IN WHAT ROOM DID SOMEONE FEEL THIS WAS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGES. A GOOD 2/3 OF THE FILM IS ABOUT FEAR, PANIC, ATTACKS BY VARIOUS CREATURES, HITTING, RUNINNG INTO WALLS, FALLING OFF CLIFFS AND THE AGONY THAT IS A LOST CHILD AND TERRIFIED PARENT. AS I SAT WATCHING THIS, I COULDN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT MY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WOULD THINK ALL ALL THE CHAOS AND PERIL.DISNEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND PARENTS SHOULD BY NO MEANS SHOW THIS TO ANY YOUNG CHILD...And because it's actually pretty bad, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie has nothing to it!","review":"This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters!

I am used to having movie night after a busy week on Friday. Last Friday was a bit different because we began watching the movie and after about a half an hour my son got up to play with his toys. I know what you may be thinking, after all he is 3, but let me tell you when I put on Madagascar he sits through the whole movie and we have watched that movie about 15 times and he still sits through it all. For my money Disney kind of fell short on this one. I had hoped that it would at least have different kinds of animals for the stars but it was just too similar to Madagascar for our liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure this is Disney?","review":"I expect QUALITY from Disney, and I didn't see quality with this film. It felt like a runner-up knockoff, and not something that anyone actually invested time or effort in. Ok, the animation was interesting, but not interesting enough to hold me for the entire length. It had a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part, I was bored. And the sound mix on the DVD is awful -- the music swamps the dialogue through much of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Wish I had saved my money and popped popcorn and entertained my 3 and 5 year old granddaughters with a double header of Finding Nemo and Madagascar at home. Disney needs a major overhaul if this is the best they can do. The girls hated it and were ready to leave within the first half hour. I thought surely since this was a Disney production it was going to get better. Instead, it continued to spiral downhill. Everyone associated with this production should be on the unemployment line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super quality","review":"This is the best Bluray picture quality I have seen for an animation film. Also the 1.85:1 format makes it even better by filling up the screen. The movie it self isn't the best but it sure is entertaining. The quality of the 3d motions remind me of the great quality like in Disney's Dinosaur (not as cartoony as Madagascar). This disc also makes a great Home theatre demo disc (see the special features menu).The only thing that dissapoints me is that there is no \\"making of\\" or other extra technical data."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"verry nice movie,we like it and love to have more of these movies,p.s. we like to see more dancing of the animals and have some more songs in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is not just eye candy as computer animation is just gettingbetter and better, but this movie also has a good story...greatcharacters and yes...it is very funny.

I have a 4 year old son and his eyes were very wide at certain points in the movie. He even said that it was scary.

As another review so clearly points out, I too think there are only so many subjects one can make a movie about and maintain some level of appeal to the masses.This movie was mainly purchased for the viewing and enjoyment of my two young nieces and I was delighted that it kept them entertained.

They really dragged out the \\"human interest\\" aspect by focusing on the individuals receiving treatment. That part went on and on. They also included interviews with \\"experts\\" from the film The Secret who didn't really seem to have a lot to contribute regarding tapping. Frankly, I think they were stuck in to try and capitalize on the popularity of The Secret and try to sell this video.The interviews with the actual tapping practitioners were more helpful, but again, if your main interest is learning how to tap, or finding out how it all works, this was a bit of a slog. I certainly won't watch it again, and wouldn't give it to a friend to watch. I'll probably try to sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I learned nothing new or exciting. It was originally called \\"Try It on Everything\\" & I didn't think they tried it on anything different than what is shown on the originals DVDs by Gary Craig.It felt like a commercial for all the experts interviewed on the DVD.

Perhaps the conflict of cultures provided an unusual twist of interest, but I also found very satisfying the way the author slowly developed the passionate love story. She also accomplished this in \\"Hearts of the West\\", but in \\"Outsider\\" the characters didn't have a brother \\"in the way\\", just their own code of ethics. Like all of Ms. Williamson's characters, they are well drawn and interesting. As a woman, I find her men particularly compelling and fascinating. Her attention to detail and authenticity makes her stories even harder to put down.

But still a very good book. I plan to watch the showtime movie in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outsider","review":"There's no comparing a Penelope Williamson novel to anyone else so I have to compare her to herself. She's awesome! Her writing is rich and transports you to another time and place. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is my personal preference for just a little more steam in my romance. Normally this author knows how to give a wonderful, beautifully rich story that literally can put an ache in your heart but still give a little steam. However, there is still no one with whom I can compare to the lushness of her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy, Intense Version of \\"Witness\\"","review":"This story is an edgier, intense version of \\"Witness\\".

In my opinion, the only Penelope that should get a nod is Penelope Worth; she was the original name of the Quaker girl Gail Russell played in \\"Angel and the Badman\\", of which this is an unabashed copy. The story setup is the same: near-death gunslinger nursed back to health by the beautiful Quaker girl. Gunslinger has epiphany regarding peace and the \\"plain folk\\" and fights internally with the conflict till the end. Both play give-and-take.At least \\"Witness\\" tried to spin it differently, not the case here.I think Penelope Williamson ought to thank James Edward Grant for being the original author on this one.Or at least add his name to the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great, leaked each time","review":"These diapers are extremely thin, therefore the absorbency is very poor.

One definition of self-publishing includes the use of a subsidy or a print-on-demand publisher to launch your book instead of turning your manuscript over to a traditional, commercial publisher. However, Thomas uses the term to mean a situation in which the writer does absolutely everything including typesetting, cover design, book design, acquiring ISBN, bar code, all promotion and publicity, etc.This only makes it that much more amazing that these individuals were able to succeed and earn varying amounts of profit from their venture. A writer who wishes to go this route could glean many points---both dos and don'ts by reading these accounts. However, the book is not essentially a how-to volume for self-publishing authors. A good and inspiring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"pep talk by a self-publisher","review":"This book lacks the details of publishing.

Well, it didn't quite do that. I didn'tfeel that there was anything to the book except thatthey saw some Elvis stuff along the way.

Anyway, that is what I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to hear from Jim","review":"I know Wingardner, and I know his road trip buddy, Jim. Trust me, Jim would have written a MUCH better story. Wingardner's prose is flat, his tone is at once snide and \\"gosh golly gee whiz,\\" and he scripts himself as the hero in nearlly every chapter. I agree with the first reviewer that \\"Elvis Presley Boulevard\\" is more \\"Me, Glorious Me,\\" which is a shame, given the potential richness of the material. Jim sent me a postcard of a fur-bearing trout from this trip, and the message on the back had more drama, wit and affection for the subject than this whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me, Glorious Me!!!","review":"From a man who makes his classes on Great American Fiction at John Carroll University read his own novel what can one expect? Not much. It constantly surprises me that Wingardner has not already written a novel entitled \\"Let Me tell you About Me,\\" with a follow up novel entitled \\"More about Me.\\" Wingardner fancies himself a great writer, I supposes there's no harm in letting him go on in his dillusional ways. \\"Elvis Presley Blvd\\" is just another road trip novel. I'd rather read the Atals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim? Hell, I wanted to hear from Akers.","review":"I guess all the refugee's of Miami U./ Oxford's \\"Monday Night Smoking and Drinking\\" from the early 80's are commenting here.I knew Mark, I knew Jim, I knew Akers. I forget who's idea the trip was, but Akers was supposed to go before she had something come up. Some sort of poetry emergency. Anyway, Jim was/is a better writer than Mark, Akers was better than both, and doing a book about it was her idea.

Bille August did all he could to make \\"Les Miserables\\" a good movie, but, alas, the director did not achieve this.

It was not faithful in its retelling of the original novel and left out major characters and large portions of the story (the entire second half of it to be exact) Even the characters that were left in the story were not depicted in a manner close to Hugo's writing. However, I felt the actors did a wonderful job with the lines they were given. Anything with Liam Nissan is worth seeing.

If you like this book, don't watch this movie, it will drive you nuts when you saw Valjean beat up the bishop when stealing the lamp; you will be upset to find out Marius turns out a street rat; and many many more. I would suggest you to find the French version of this novel, both the old version (which is the best) and the Jean-Paul Belmondo's new \\"Les Miserable\\": I would rate the former 5 stars and later 4.5 stars.The later one use World War II France as the background of the story to demonstrate the universal truth of Hugo's \\"Les Miserable\\".

The book has an intricate connection between many of the characters that the movie doesn't have, and also focuses on much more than Jean Valjean, whom the movie mostly focuses on.I would suggest reading the book first, and then watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Les Miz fans beware","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this adaptation of the book. Having read the book and seen the musical, I was unable to watch the movie as a uninfluenced obserever and so I was very upset by what they chose to include and leave out from the book. I have yet to see an adaptation of this book that is worthy of what Victor Hugo wrote. They turn a story full of intricate connections and wonderful character development into what Hollywood is famous for, romance and a little action. Marius bares little resemblance to the character that Hugo formed, neither does Cosette. And where was Eponine? As a book and as a musical, this story moves me, as a movie, it was a giant flop.If you are a fan of the book, stay away from the movie. If you watched this movie as though it was the book, you are far off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the musical instead!","review":"I definitely DO NOT recommend this video. It makes a mockery of one of the best stories of all time. The characters were okay, but they didn't seem like they knew what the story was about. Valjean is meant to be a caring person, if someone's just thrown himself into the River Seine, would you laugh. One of the most important thing was, where was Eponine and Enjolras. Eponine is one of the best characters in the story and Enjolras is one of the most courageous characters there is. The Thenardiers were in it for about 2 minutes and they didn't just give Cosette away that quickly. Another complaint is the barricade scene, that could have been one of the best moments in movie history, but it was boring. If you want something decent, SEE THE MUSICAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable Les Miserables","review":"I guess I would have thought of this movie as fair enough had I not both read the book and seen the musical in advance. Having done both, however, I was very disapointed with this version of Victor Hugo's great tale of the French Revolution.Although Bille August is a great director, this movie is much too typical of Hollywood to be very interesting. Eponine is written out of the story(!). The whole political message (of quite a historical importance) has had to give way for a clishé love-story.Compared to the Marius in the book and in the musical, this Marius seems stupid and superficial.My advice is: Do not buy/rent this movie if you have read the book or seen the musical. It will bore and disapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but different","review":"Les Miserables is an extremely long book and it is very hard to make it accurate to the true story. I've seen a lot of movie versions of the story and this has to be one of my favorite adaptations. It obvousily doesn't hold a candle to the muscical, but what does?Liam Neeson does a superb job as Valjean. He by far was the best Valjean I've seen on screen. Goeffery Rush was equally good as police inspector Javert And Uma Thurman played a very good Fantine. Claire Danes did a good job as Cossette, but she often annoyed me. I was pretty upset that they completely forgot about Eponnine(who is one of my fav characters) because she puts a little more intrest in Cosette and Mauris's relationship.one of the biggest reasons i liked this was cause not everything was like the book and it had a couple of changes that i liked.

However, I was surprised I found very little joy or relief at the end; I felt more numb than anything. I believe my lack of joy was due to empathizing through the whole movie for the main character who experienced so much sorrow for so many years of unjust trials and tribulations. That one instance of relief at the end didn't seem to make up for all the horrendous experiences he had to endure through his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story of Redemption and Love","review":"This movie was a wonderful story of true love, which always means sacrifice.

My wife and I saw this film several times and we dont normally see many movies and never one more than once. The actors did a magnificiet job bringing the characters to life. I believe the writer did a wonderful job with the story by deciding which parts he would make the focus. The ending was very moving, driving home the point that striving to obey the law without seeking mercy leads to destruction. I would strongly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a shame movies like the titanic with weak story lines would do better at the box office than this classic piece of literature. The story is very moving and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a movie","review":"If you have read the book then you will probably be disappointed in this film due to how they change the plot to git in the time allotted for the film.

The acting by Geoffrey Rush and Liam Nesson is totally bad, If the academy had awards for worst actor and supporting actor they would both deserve them. The writers of this waste of time have given Les Miserables, a classic story, a bad name. This is probably the worst film of 1998. It is over long and still not finished. I urge people who have seen the great musical to not see this film if they want to to have mostly good thoughts of the name Les Miserables. This should be one of the worst films youll ever see. It is a waste of movie technology and ink. The writers bring shame to Victor Hugo, the author. If I could I'd give it NO STARS, but don't think that I think the story isn't great, because it is, and I definitely recommend the great musical, it was just made into a bad movie. A TERRIBLE MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1935's \\"Les Miserables\\" still remains unbettered!","review":"It may seem ridiculous to review a movie that you haven't seen; but actually, I'm not reviewing this one at all. I'm writing this to direct the people who were disappointed with this allegedly lukewarm adaptation to the version that still trumps all others, Darryl Zanuck's 1935 triumph \\"Les Miserables\\". Three things above all, make this the one to see: 1.) Frederic March and Charles Laughton can act rings around Neeson and Rush; 2.) You get more for your money--1 hr and 49 mins. of impeccably distilled Hugo, rather than 2-and-a-half hours of Hollywood rigmarole; 3.) The shattering ending is filmed full power, instead of the infuriatingly compromised denouement seen here (if the other reviews here do not lie!).

I like all these actors.But Jean Valjean punching Monseignior Bienvenu? Unbuttoning Fantine's corsette?I feel dirty. And not in a good way. These alterations are worse than just gratuitous and titillating. They misrepresent the era. And they are contrary to the spirit and intention of the original.Victor Hugo wrote a different story altogether. It was about redemption through self-abnegation. If the screenwriters didn't like what Hugo wrote, they would have been welcome to write their own story, and call it something other than Les Miserables."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't cover it all","review":"I have read the book, seen the play and seen an older version of Les Mirerables. The Stage production by far conveys the total of emotion that Hugo writes. The problem with the book is that Hugo really is very long winded. This latest version of Les Mis, I thought, took the core of the novel ( the relationship of Javert and Val Jean) and treats it with great care. The rest of the story, the innkeeper, the revolutionaries are very important but can't be covered in the short time of a production release movie. I really enjoyed the film, the book, and the staged musical. All bring to life a great peice of literature. See the movie, see the play but by all means read the book you will really see the genius of Victor Hugo."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Films Ever Made","review":"This movie was one of the most powerful ones I have ever seen. Even though Jesus Christ [unfortunately] wasn't specifically mentioned in Valjean's conversion, his life displayed one of complete humility and love. On top of that, the film is dramatic and intense. This one will keep you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is superb as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"The movie was well done. Was it the same as the novel? No. How can you expect a movie to include all of a 1000 page plus book? Many themes will be dropped, characters combined or not included at all. There were many things I thought important that were not included: the development of Jean ValJean's character; Marius background; the history of the Thenardiers; and on and on.

Victor Hugo wrote an incredibe book that was overwriten by some one who THOUGHT they could do a better job. It was a disgrace and Victor Hugo would be really upset if he saw it.

Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush are very well cast in their roles as Valjean and Javert. Uma Thurman makes a heart wrenching Fantine and Claire Danes is a beautiful Cosette.

I kept putting off seeing this, for some reason believing that because it was Les Mis it would be somehow trite. Boy was I TOTALLY mistaken. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush put on stunning performances, the storyline (Victor Hugo) has been adapted to the silver screen masterfully- even better than the Broadway version, and the music, setting, etc. are all brilliantly composed for this incredible saga. If you rent any one film in the upcoming days or weeks, please- do yourself a favour- rent or buy this film on video or DVD- you will not be disappointed.

The first half of the movie was very nice and he was a wonderful Valjean. Then, in the 2nd part of the movie, everything crashed. Cosette was spoiled and disobedient -- unlike sweet, loving, unselfish Cosette from the book. And Marius was completely and utterly NOT Marius -- they made him some sort of unattractive wimpy pop-star who tried to inspire and impress the audience, but really didn't.As a fan of the book and the musical, I'm quite disappointed. I'm looking into other versions of Les Mis and hope to be more impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr.August, please read the book first","review":"Did you know the guy who directed this had never read the book, seen the musical or any of the other movie versions?

The actors would have been wonderful in a movie that was more like the book. The truest character was Javert. The begining showed promise but the climax was disappointing. What happened to Enjolras? He was watered down to a little nothing role while Marius led the revolution! And Eponine? She was mentioned in the credits but i saw nothing of the love she had for Marius! Her absence robbed Marius of a vital subplot! What happened to the Thenardiers? They are the stories only other main villains besides Javert! And what of this romantic fling Valjean had for Fantine? He liked her sure, but in this film Valjean is almost having an affair! And Valjean's revalation to Cossette came way too soon not to mention that Valjean would NEVER have beaten Cossette!!! In short, the acting was very good, but the actors needed the entire story to act in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie....... but......","review":"I've read most of the reviews here and most say it doesn't potray Hugo's themes because Enjolras or Eponine aren't in it. The main themes are there. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey rush are great. Would also be good in a lengthened version. But the one who should be recognized is Uma Thurman as Fantine. You really pitty her and she knows how to bring her character across (and it lets you forget that she played Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin.). For those of you who haven't seen the play or read the book, you'll enjoy it alot. But for you others you won't find it that good (except the first half). As a movie it is good. As an adaption.... well..... get it out from the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't read the book -- THIS IS AN EXCELLENT FILM","review":"I rented this film when there wasn't anything else left -- and It has become one of my favorites.[now purchased] Although a classic, it sounded dreadfully boring...

So much self sacrifice, the true meaning of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, well done verson of the classic","review":"I am responding to Amazon.com's review of the movie, which I almost think you didn't watch. Fantine wasn't pregnant when Valjean took her in, her daughter was six. And it didn't end in teen-age angst--there were legitimate reasons for a loving daughter to finally insist on some explanation from her father. I missed the selfless Epononine myself, but felt that her absense in the film version was for the sake of clarity and length--she and her family are a complicated sub-plot, really. Instead the movie focused (brilliantly) on the relationships between Valjean, Javert, Cossette, and secondarily, Marius. While the musical version is a kind of trage-comedy, the movie version is dramatic, and as such interpretations of characters vary somewhat from the musical, and I thought this was done with insight and integrity. Also, the ommission of the Thenadiers makes this version suitable for wider audiences. The acting was superb, Geoffrey Rush is unmatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Viewing","review":"I very much wanted to see this movie when it first came out and so I did, but was very disapointed.After watching the Dream Cast musical on several occasions.

This was clearly a poor slapping-together of charicatures. Rush's Javert comes across as a cardboard villain, with utterly no nobility or honor. This isn't the Javert Hugo created. Neeson's Valjean is better crafted, but still lacks the greatness of the character in the book. This movie also ignores the social messages of the novel and seems to lack a clear focus. And where are Enjorlas, Eponine, the Thenardiers? For a much better-acted and better conceived version that covers the same ground as this one, see the Frederic March/Charles Laughton 1935 version. The 1998 version should be forgotten"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if you haven't read the book.","review":"This video is great for those who have not read the book or are not familiar with the entire story line.

The video would be good to see before reading the book in order to visualize better the various parts of the story that are covered in the video.To those of you who have read the book I would suggest that you rent the video if you can but don't waste the money on buying it.If you have not read the book or a synopsis of the book, then buy the video but follow it up with the book or an audio version of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie, but a terrible adaptation!","review":"Well, I am an ardent fan of Les Miserables. I love the book and the musical. I was prepared for it to be different, but it was horrible! I've seen it twice- once I rented it, and once in English class. They left out two of the best characters (Eponine and Enjolras). They also left out all the Amis! The only characters that weren't warped at all were Javert, the bishop and Fantine. Cosette was just a snivelling crybaby. There was no mention of the Thénardiers after Montfermeil. Gavroche looked too young, so it sounded weird to hear about his \\"babies\\". The third act was totally stupid. Marius is too much of a lovesick moron to lead a revolution. And there wasn't even a proper ending! Can't a misaholic get at least a little bit of sympathy? The movie made Victor Hugo spin in his grave, and the Mizzies spin in fictional character land."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best adaptation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece!","review":"If you have read Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, you will find that this version is the best screen adaptation of the currently available four: the 1935 version with Frederic March & Charles Laughton; the 1952 one with Michael Rennie & Robert Newton; the 1978 one with Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins and the current one(1998) with Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman. The acting is superb and Uma Thurman gives a stellar portrayal of Fantine that is the most convincing of all four Fantines. If you don't have the time to read Victor Hugo's book, this movie is the best substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful story of hope, love and determanation!","review":"Les Miserables is one of the best movies I've seen.It is on my top 10 list and after you review this movie it soon will be. The actors in this movie put a lot of hard work as you can see on the screen in their performences.They put their hearts and souls in becoming these characters. I have to say Geoffrey Rush did an outstanding job as Javert.He has been the only villian in which touched my heart, and made me reflect on his character. He deserves 5 stars.It's a movie you need to rent if you haven't seen it yet!So go rent it tonight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Memorable Film","review":"Superb acting all round! Liam Neeson was very convincing as Valjean, the tortured soul. Uma Thurman also gave a memorable performance as Fantine, whom Valjean fell in love with. Even the relatively unknown actor, Hans Matheson (as Marius, the student revolutionary leader) was very good. I haven't read the book, but I intend to pick it up soon because after watching the movie, the storyline really appealed to me. It's sad, beautiful, meaningful, exciting, dramatic and the cinematography and costumes were absolutely beautiful and enchanting. The story makes you think about life and people and what people are capable of doing and feeling. Victor Hugo is a splendid writer to have been able to weave such a wonderful story. Now I know why this is a timeless classic. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Highly recommended. I'm waiting eagerly for the video release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Les Miserables","review":"Expected it to be a musical and it was not.

I can forgive rearranging things a bit to make it easier to film, but this changed fundamentals of the original moral message and of the basic natures of the characters.Sadly, I don't think the Richard Jordan-Anthony Perkins version is available in its entirety. It looks campy, but the screenplay was far more faithful to the spirit of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story about ours lives.","review":"I love this story of life itself, our lives as people here on earth.

I hardly recognized Victor Hugo's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"This movie is a wonderful depiction of grace and redemption. From the very start where Jean Valjean stole silver from the bishop and when he was returned by the police the bishop said it was a gift and asked why he didn't take the candlesticks as they were worth more. And then the bishop told him that he ransomed Valjean from evil and bought his soul which he now is giving to God.From that time forward, we see the life of Valjean is transformed and how it affects the lives of the people around him to the very memorable end where the policeman who has hunted Valjean for 20 years has to make a decision what to do with him.I was very impressed by the movie. I thought it was well done and well worth the time to watch. And the undertone message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, and compassion are very tastefully acted out and enjoyable to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"would recommend this movie...captivating...excellent acting...couldn't get up once I started watching itgreat cast of actors...lieean Neisen was great...love all his moveis..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough singing!","review":"Actually, there is no singing, which for me was very enjoyable.

That is the one you want if you don't have any of Ray Anthony's albums. I could have done without the radio type announcer on this CD and just have had plain cuts of music. But for those before my generation (and I'm a senior!) this may bring back good memories. I, however, found it annoying. Ray Anthony is great as usual and I would never slight his talent. Just him please, no vocals or announce overs! The male vocalist, Tommy Mercer, in particular is sub par (he's better when he's singing with the Skyliners. His appeal must have been for his looks and not his voice). The female voacalist, Marcie Miller is quite good. As I said, unless you are a Ray Anthony super fan and enjoy all his work, get the \\"Dream Dancing II\\" to start your collection and let this one go to the folks who actually danced to his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, true, beautifully rendered . . .","review":"The best book in Alzheimer's that I read during the time I was both caring for my own mother, and writing about it.

As they travel together across the southern United States, their conversations let us in on the dark secrets that brought them together and why they are on the run. Then Cal, Truly's ex-husband, finds them, kidnaps her and steals their RV. What happens next, no one could have foreseen.

When I read the book I found how important he was to the football association. It gave a better understanding of his disease that attacked his liver. It told the story of a once unstoppable football player to someone only a fraction his normal size and weigt, but he never lost his faith and continued fighting until his last days in his home with his family. I had no idea how hard it is to find a donor for a liver. Also the medications he had to take and how sick they made him, and also having to have a cathiter placed in his chest to draw blood and for IVs since his veins were so weak. This man touched the lives of millions and even though he was sick he never asked why and made it a vow to never die easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great football player, and even greater person","review":"This a touching, heatfelt \\"autobiography\\".

This CD is very well done and I can honestly say there isn't a bad song in the bunch. (and we all know how rare THAT is these days!)The first song to get airplay is \\"C'est La Vie\\", so look for that one. My personal faves are \\"Castles in the Sand\\" and \\"Forward Motion\\". Cole Coleman's voice is featured on \\"One More Day\\" and that one is very poignant and relevant to the world today. His voice is a wonderful compliment to Lynn's.

When the stooges show up their scenes as janitors, they are great. Even with Ted Healy. There only in the movie 20 minutes. Gold Raiders, I wasn't all that familiar with. But it is pretty good. The stooges are in it 90% of the time. This can be considered as good as their shorts. It was made in 1951 with shemp. So they had their act down pat.

If the Priscilla footage is the only reason you want to see \\"Erotique,\\" you will be disappointed.The movie is four sex-related short films spliced together. The first one is about a phone-sex worker, and it's kind of dumb; the next is longer and set in Latin America on board a train, and it's even worse.

Yikes, was I mistaken.This is a waste of time for anyone who has any kind of life.

I was very disappointed to find that the bulk of them are repeats of the same thing with minor variations. The biggest turn off for me in this book was the lack of explanation of the positions and techniques. Almost all of them were one or two generalized sentences. There were many large pictures in the book which I also did not like. Having pictures is fine, but I would much rather have seen many small pictures with a simple explanation. Then if I spotted a technique I liked, there should have been an in depth explanation that followed.Overall, they just tried to cram too much into this book so they could claim \\"101 positions\\".

I know that scents combine with different people's skin differently, and this one doesn't do much for me.

What is our relationship to things greater than ourselves? Big questions, and this novel makes you think about them, feel them, in a profound way. An alien race forces man to unite, and question our place in the universe, and in the end forces us to question the meaning of love for our children, and the meaning of ultimate sacrifice. Man becomes a Christ figure to higher intelligence. I wasn't surprised to see C.S. Lewis praise this book, although it is not really religious, or meant to be any sort of Christian allegory. I've read 20 sci-fi books, and love PKD, but this one has true staying power. But it was also easy to read, and engrossing -- and in the end profound.

I think part of the problem is that I do not care for mysteries that much and I do not really like murder mysteries much better. It is much too dark what with all the suicide and drinking and I thought that much was left unsaid. For one thing, Sweeney alludes to herself as a drinker when Jack asks to begin a relationship with her. I did not really get that she was that much of a drinker in the novel so that threw me. I needed a better explanation for her referring to herself as a drinker. Also I do not like suicides - Sweeney's father and Quinn's wife. The suicides and the characters in the book are just too serious for me. Also I am still trying to determine how Brad has Charles Putnam's DNA when Belinda had an illegitimate child. There was just not enough rationale or answers for me and it was just too dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-stepper","review":"I received my mini-stepper promptly, which was nice.

The amount of research that must have gone into compiling insightful commentaries on leading organizations in different industries amazed me, and interesting conclusions drawn from these observations kept me reading on till the very end.I am currently doing research in these areas and find this book full of new ideas that stimulate rethinking of traditional truisms on innovation prediction and management.

While Tokyo Fist still contains the brilliant, over the top visuals of the Tetsuo series(used to great effect in the boxing ring), he allows the camera and film to be calm, allowing story, thought and emotion to enter. There is strong character development in this one as the protagonists try to understand how one can feel and be alive in a cold city. Definetly not recommended for the squeamish as Tsukamoto has to no issue with placing the grotesque in your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"tsukamoto does it again","review":"If you thought tetsuo 1 and 2 were great , then tokyo fist will blow you away .

I usually like most movies and never turn off a movie no matter how bad it is but this movie I almost stoped it several times and stuck in something better (which would not have been hard to find) so in conclusion I HATED THIS MOVIE I mean when the characters have whole conversations and there's no subtitling telling you what there saying there's something wrong also the subtitling was full of mistakes.

And W55 is quite similar, even better, I should say.This one meets all the above-average expectations. Nice pictures, on all sizes and resolutions. You will have a hard time to find a small camera that records such good movies, too.So the pros would be good picture quality, easy to handle, great macro shots, self-explaining menu...Cons: noisy picture when taken on the ISO (1000) option... better do a manual adjustment rather than using this ISO. Picture quality experiments a disappointing decrease when digital zoom is used.Having the coloured options just makes it sweet!

The menu is great too, when you scroll thru things, it tells you what it does so you don't have to memorize it all. Takes fast pictures, but not one after another, like I was hoping. But it does open fast. Don't be fooled by the big memory, you will still need a larger card. Depending on the size pic you want, you can take about 30 to 50 pics on the memory alone.

It will turn on occassionally and even after changing the batteries it will only turn on sometimes. That's not okay when you are trying to get candid shots. Short battery life and they do not recharge well. I plan on contacting Kodak for advice. There's nothing in the manual about power problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 DIFFERENT MECHANICAL PROBLEMS","review":"I actually have a different model, the 6.0 MP version purchased 2 1/2 years ago. But it looks exactly the same, so the mechanicals are probably the same. It was a great little camera while it lasted. Great pictures and great battery life. And as far I'm concerned, 6 MP is all I (and probably most people) really need.After exactly 12 mos the rotary function switch started to act up, switching between adjacent modes unless I kept pressure on it with my finger. It got worse with time. Then I had the apparently common \\"stuck lens problem\\"; the fix is to bang it on the table, which worked. Then, last week, the shutter button broke off while it was in my wifes purse.So I'm in the market for a new camera; it won't be another Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this camera!!!","review":"I bought this cammera almost a year ago and it has been awesome...one of my favorite things about the camera is the beach setting. Since i live near the beach i spend alot of time there and the pictures really show the rich blue color of the water and there is rarely any blur. The one thing that this camera lacks is capturing in dark situations. When it is dark the pictures often become blurry with wierd streaks of light. Besides that I love this camera...it is tiny so it fits anywhere...it is durable (trust me i have dropped it several times)...and the battery stays charged for long periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony is trash!","review":"Six months after purchasing this camera the lens fails to open leaving me with a $200.00 (more when you consider memory stick and case) piece of junk. Google \\"How to fix a stuck lens on a Sony DSC-W55\\" and you will see what a common problem this is. My advice is to steer clear of all Sony products as they appear to care little about quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for a great price","review":"I brought this camera 2.5 years ago. It's still in great shape and the quality of my photos are great. I'm not a fancy, advanced user. I just needed a camera that I could carry with me on trips or special occasions to caught moments. The battery life is still wonderful. I use it several times before I have to recharge my battery, which doesn't take long. My only complaint about this camera is that when it takes a picture, it seems to take awhile for the shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of BANG for your buck","review":"Prior to owning this camera, I didn't have a digital camera. I was a little worried about how well I was going to be able to use it, and whether or not it would take as good of a picture as I was hoping. I was BLOWN away with how simple it is to use it, and how beautiful the picture turns out. This camera gets my vote for Best Bang for your buck!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"I've taken several hundred pics already and love it. Its pretty sinmple to use and switching from auto to the multiple preset modes is easy. I love the fact that you can see the speed and f.stop when the shutter button is partially depressed. This tells me what sort of focusing (f.stop function) I can expect and I can decide if the f.stop need to be adjusted a little. The battery life is great too. It survived several road trips. I haven't taken very many flash pics, so not sure what to expect here, but so far, great camera. Big screen is nice too, pics are sharp on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No as cool as it looks","review":"I enjoy taking pictures. I had a Cannon Elph for years and it recently started to go so I went with the cybershot from Sony. I lved how small and sleek it was alot lighter than the elph, but after using it at a close friends wedding I wasn't happy. Alot of \\"ghosts\\" in pictures, everyone had redeye, the zoom wasn't good at all. If you didn't hold the camera completley still the image didn't come out well at all and after a few cocktails at a wedding it's hard to do, the delay between pressing the button and the picture taking is alot longer than any camera I have ever used, I missed alot of the events at the wedding due to this, walking down the isle, cutting the cake. Needless to say I'm sending this camera back and ordering another Cannon."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfaction and usage","review":"I purchased this item for a friend as a gift.

In fact, as the go-to-guy for my friends when buying tech gear, I've told them to stay away from Sony cameras from introductory to professional.I'm sticking with my Nikon from now on. This is possibly the worst camera I've ever used (and that says a lot)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked it was made by Sony","review":"I recently purchased this camera because I had dropped my last one by accident. Yes the price was fair and it was a Sony so I said why not. I went on vacation and every picture that I took came out blurry and I thought when I would develop them it was going to be ok . Wll it wasn't I was shocked that the slightest move or wind would make my pictures come out so horrible. The camera is very sensitive so I say be wary of this purchase but I know that I will not purchase another sony camera ever . Ohg by the way I returned it as soon as I got back from vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last.....","review":"Well even though my first cyber-shot broke within the first year, I have bought three more with no problems--until this one. My 14 year old daughter got this one for Christmas and it lasted about two weeks.

Hopefully Sony will warrant it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Later model is garbage! This one is excellent.","review":"I have this camera from a couple of years ago, was much cheaper than the current price ($200 less). Unfortunately, I smashed the view screen, must have put something on top of it in my handbag. I bought the later model (w530) which is such garbage I'm about to give it away; the pics come out badly no matter what.I use this model still by hooking up the av cords to my flat screen and taking pictures (small items to list online) I will buy another one of these cameras, waiting for the price to drop but apparently everyone is hip to it, the price keeps rising! I might just break down and ask hubby to buy it again for the holidays for me; he had bought the original for my birthday. If I had known what I had I'd have never put it in my bag without its case :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have always been a big fame of Sony products. My aunt has a pick camera like this and I just loved it. The color and size are excellent! It does exactly what I want and takes great pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It for the Price","review":"Having enjoyed the camera for about a year, I learned after turning it on that the telescopic lenses started to actuate back and forth several times before being prompted to turn the camera off. This repeated itself numerous times. It turns out the lenses rings became out of tolerance and the pressure on each individual lenses triggers this action. It is not worth sending in for repair. From here on out it will be Nikon or Panasonic. The camera is well cared for and looks new. Anyone want it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement","review":"I bought this to replace my original cybershot that was the same, but with 6MP, that was broken by a child in malaysia. So, I'm pleased with it and it was cheaper than my original one though new and better. =D One thing that some might not like is that it doesn't have the option to pick a color and then only produce that color in whatever the shot is. I heard that's only in canons? The flash flashes a few times (to get a good shot I imagine) and it only really bothers me when I'm trying to get a shot of something that won't stay still for very long and if I turn the flash off, then it's dark and blurry but, I make do. Over all, I really my cybershot and I think it's quite simple to figure out if you play around with it. Nice small compact size, bigger screen than the 6MP one, and the hole to hang a wrist strap or other things is at the corner and does not portrude out of the rectangular shape as the 6MP does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted..","review":"I purchased this camera in May and it worked great at first, other than the videos being a little fuzzy, and not taking very good low-light pictures. But around the end of June the shutter started not opening and closing correctly, and the battery power didn't last. Now it isn't working at all. It won't even turn on with a charged battery. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out ok","review":"At first i was happy with this camera, perhaps lulled by it's good looks and small size, then I woke up and realized that half of my pictures were out of focus, even when i allowed for the beep supposedly telling me it is focused, achieved by holding the button half way momentarily before taking the picture. Now it seems there is a glitch in the menus. the other day i watched as it scrolled through all the menu settings as if I were turning the menu knob atop the camera. I wasn't.I don't think it's worth my time to send it in for repair. I'll just save for a cannon, I've read good things."},{"rating":"2","title":"camera","review":"it is a good camera overall, but the wheel changes to easily and you end up taking pictures on the wrong mode. also the mdoes are somewhat confusing but overall it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"V.

Great price.Nice availables colors.. i took the blue one.. it should b called baby blue; )Nothing much to say but its highly recommended.. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"To say I despise this camera is an understatement. What a waste of money. Sometimes it takes great pictures. Key word - sometimes. Most of the time, however, the pictures are dark & fuzzy. I don't mean blurry - FUZZY, as if it just can't focus. The lens is clean, I've turned on every light possible, and I try taking a picture on every setting, hoping to find one that's somewhat better. It's maddening. After a YEAR of this, and hardly having any decent pictures of my baby's first year of life, enough is enough. This thing is going in the trash, and I won't be buying a Sony as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Absolutely magnificent camera.was bought as a Christmas present and is probably the best camera anyone can find for the money.I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a digital camera and actually taking great pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for teens =)","review":"As a teen, its cool when i can easily take pics of my friends and quickly upload them. This camera gives good pics of you even when you think u don't look so great that day. When I first got the Sony Cybershot, I was sooo excited because I researched about a lot and it took awhile before I could order it so it is definitely worth the wait. With the specific features that enhance snowy pictures, nightfall pictures, landscapes, and beach pictures, it is easy to look like a photographer without that much work in creating the perfect shot. Also, the black & white feature is great for an elegant pic. I absolutely reccommend this camera to teens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good picture, terrible construction and warranty","review":"I bought this late last year for use on the road and really liked the pictures it took. I didn't use it terribly often, but always kept it in a protective case and never once dropped or otherwise harmed it. Earlier this month the unit that holds the liquid crystals inside the screen somehow started leaking. As I said this camera was not put into any situation where this should happen, therefore it is probably a manufacturing defect of some sort.Anyways, I contact Sony and turns out the screen is not covered by the warranty and to get it fixed I will need to pay $111... on a $175 camera I bought a few months ago. No thanks. Crappy camera, crappy warranty I think I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for Money","review":"This camera is an excellent value for money. The issues are1. The USB cable Sony preparatory, really a bad idea another bulky cable to walk around with.2. The Internal memory is not accessible when the memory card are inserted3. The Zoom does not work when the using the Video mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great point and shoot","review":"I own several digital cameras including two SLR's.

Highly recommend this camera!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my cute pink camera","review":"I have used the Kodak line before getting this sony camera, and I will never go back! Sony is the way to go. My pictures are almost always clear and bright, even indoor shots turn out well.This camera is lightweight, easy to use, and the manual that comes with it is excellent. Love the self timer (can be put on 2 second or 10 second delay, and flashes a convenient red light when ready to take picture), easy to use options and menu buttons, review screen is very clear, and the zoom is fantastic!!One year later update:Still LOVE love love this camera. The video quality is also great, as I've found many occasions that videos are necessary. I still highly recommend this camera for the gal on the go, this camera is worth every cent in my opinion for ease, convenience, and crystal clear pictures nearly every time! I also recommend buying the little mini tri-pod stand for low-light pictures or a group shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony is a waste of money","review":"I purchased this camera 6 months ago. After 5 months of use, at my daughters birthday party no less, the screen broke. I sent it back for repair and was told my warranty was void because the damage was caused by \\"impact\\". I know for a fact that indeed there was no misuse or impact. I believe it was faulty manufacturing and a weak screen. So here I am after only 6 months of use, without a camera. I could pay $111.00 to have it fixed, but instead I am going to purchase a good camera. A Canon. I had my Canon Powershot Elph for 7 years. That camera had been flung around, dropped, and drooled on and it still works. So, if you want a camera that lasts, and a company with good customer service, DONT BUY A SONY. Thank you for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems...","review":"I carefully researched and compared before I bought this camera - my 1st digital. I thought it would be a good camera for the price, but boy have I been wrong. I have only had it a little over a year. 6 months after I bought it the flash stopped working properly. Sometimes the flash would be so bright you cannot see the pictures and sometimes it would be too dark. Darker than taking a picture without the flash. Sometimes it would work, but very rarely. Now, 13 months after I've had the camera the zoom function has completely stopped working. In fact, if I even try to move it - it prompts me to turn off power and turn on again.I'm just going to have to buy a new camera. What a waste of $200+!!I would not recommend this model to anyone. This is my first Sony camera and I will definitely not be buying this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoops, not what I thought","review":"I must admit that after first purchasing this camera I thought it was a fairly good purchase, however after a recent trip to Disney World with the kids I have to express my new opinion and its not good. After our return home I attempted to print out some of our memories and found that the pictures, which looked wonderful on the viewfinder and on the computer, were of the poorest quality. We bought this camera to replace a cheap 3 mp Kodak easy shot, I wish I still had that camera. The kodak's printed shots far surpassed the Sony (both from the same printer). Needless to say we are in the market again for a new camera. Unfortunately one area you dont want to go wrong, especially with the kids, is with a camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its very testy","review":"I got this camera in March. It's my second digital camera, I lost my first one, but had been thinking about getting a new one for awhile. I have been very disappointed with the testiness of this camera. First off, I had it as a bar and someone dropped about 5 drops of a drink on it and the zoom function refused to work. Eventually that cleared up. Then, I brought the camera to the beach and the lens would not stay open-- the camera would read \\"access, please power on and power off\\". Apparently you are not supposed to expose the camera to sand. My old camera was at the beach 6 times a summer and never had an issue. I took the camera to the repair shop and after a $25 estimate was told that it would take $125 to fix a $175 camera. Frustrated, I took a can of forced air and managed to clear the sand out of the lens. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this camera. I have had nothing but problems. The picture quality is a bit better, but its not the pain it has caused me."},{"rating":"2","title":"dsc-w55","review":"have been using this camera for a few months now and it is one of the best i have ever used. easy of use is the best feature. i have dropped it a few times and it still works like new. i also like the fact it has a viewfinder for use in sunlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!

I got it for a trip and it worked out great. The optics are amazing and the price is really worth it.Though it doesn't work to perfection when it comes to shooting movement, still it has settings for pretty much every situation. The only thing is that these settings are not intuitive, and it took me some trial-and-error to figure in which situation I should use some of them. Having done that, it was really easy.The \\"P\\" setting is especially nice, since you can use it to set the camera anyway you want, even the flash (which has three levels of strength).The videos it makes aren't the best quality ever, but they're good enough.

This is what I got! I love this little camera. The menus and functions are easy to use and the LCD screen is huge compared to other cameras. When I was comparing other slim cameras with comparable mega bytes I decided to go to the store to see them all for myself before I bought them online. Once I could see, touch, and feel them I was immediately sold on the SONY. The other brands felt like they were made of very cheap materials and the buttons wiggled around too much. The Sony is a solid camera and appears to be manufactured well. The pictures I have taken have had great lighting and quality. I am very happy with this purchase. I have been surprised how long the battery lasts and with a 1Gig card I can take an endless amount of pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I am very unhappy with this camera.

It turns out, this camera takes terrible pictures. If anyone moves a muscle in the photo, it'll come out blurred. I might take 20 pictures at an event, and I'll be lucky if 2 come out at all.

Even if the reader does not know Hebrew, every English word used in the King James Bible is listed in the back of the book with the page number on which the corresponding Hebrew word can be found in the body of the book. Also, this book is about 1/3 the price of similar concordances."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most comprehensive concordances out there","review":"For the serious Bible student, this book is an invaluable resource. It is so comprehensive that you probably wouldn't need any other concordances.This book has a few imperfections, though, viz.:1. the print is relatively small. This is a small problem, though, for many people who can read small print. Not a problem for me.2. since each entry relies on Strong's numbering, you will need a copy of Strong's concordance, assuming you are like most of us without a prior knowledge of Hebrews. This, too may not be a bad idea; I have Strong's. However, it would have been better to provide a list of Strong's entries in a couple of pages.But for the above, the book deserves five stars.

To start with all you hear is the women who workout with Billy counting from 1 to 8 over and over and over and over again. Then, to top that off, Billy goes through the entire routine expecting you to know the moves right off the bat. This DVD was very discouraging to me. I ended popping in the Kenpo X DVD from my P90X series so I could get the same type of workout. In short, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone.

Thanks Billy Blanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense cardio workout with weight lifting segment","review":"I have a lot of Tae Bo tapes and this is one of my favorites. The first 30 minutes is a cardio workout that's intense. Admittedly, the first part of the cardio section is tedious. It's a lot of knee lift and punch combo. After that, it picks up and makes you sweat a lot. It goes seamlessly into a 30 minute weight lifting part that has a mix of cardio moves without weights at the end. I sometimes do the weights section by itself. Either way you do this workout, you will sweat a lot and feel so good afterwards. Also, it's fun watching the people who are doing the workout on the tape. You'll notice funny things they do. Watch the woman in the red - she's got some sassy looks when Billy is telling you to amp it up and squeeze your biceps. Her face is probably showing exactly what you're feeling. In conclusion, this is a fun workout.

Eventually my VCR ate my tape and I was never able to find it again. Now you can buy the tape on Amazon at a ridiculously high price , but where does one buy a VCR now days and even if you do its not worth it for one tape. I wish that Billy Blanks would put that workout on a dvd format. I bought this dvd because some of the reviews were impressive. However, I found the same with this one as with all the others I've tried . He simply dances around, his moves are uncoordinated and it seems like he is grasping to create something that resembles a workout.

Did they really need the money that badly?There is a thin plot (a bunch of survivors of the title malady have to fight their way to a human refuge that may or may not exist off the cost of California), but it's not worth going into any detail over.

Eminem was obviously at hand when writing this song, because Banks' monotone low-key delivery sounds a lot like Eminem's, and the catchy hook is so simple, it'll have you singing along in no time, but it sounds just a tad clichéd. This is a well-done mainstream rap hit, but the song loses marks for having a very uninspired and generic video. This single itself is good value, giving you the hit \\"On Fire\\", as well as \\"Smile\\" and \\"Warrior\\", two more solid tracks, and the videos for \\"On Fire\\" and \\"Smile\\".

Every day I DREADED dealing with my hair, which has gotten curlier and curlier over the years. And if you don't have curly hair, you probably can't relate to my story. I decided to search on the internet for help, and up popped 'Curly Girl' by Lorraine Massey. The little I read online gave me hope, so I ordered the book. As soon as my copy arrived, I read it from start to finish and immediately began my new hair regime. It has now been over 2 months and I can't thank Lorraine enough. Not only did she make me feel like I now belong to a society of fortunate 'Curly Headed Women', but my hair is now the easiest thing I deal with in my life.

For anyone out there thinking of trying the 'Flaking It' recipe for \\"dry, flaking scalp\\", don't. That is, unless you want your hair to smell like vomit.The recipe calls for massaging whipped heavy cream into the scalp. Not only does it create a total mess and is difficult to wash out of your hair (even after shampooing and conditioning), it makes your hair smell like vomit. I'm not kidding. I should have known better--there's a reason you don't let cream get warm, it goes rancid. When you apply heavy whipping cream to your scalp, it warms up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My curls, myself","review":"I wish this had been around in the 1970s and early '80s, when I was the only one in my class who couldn't force her hair into a Farrah Fawcett feathered 'do.

YUK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited in its usefulness","review":"If you must maintain an authoritative, professional, or conservative appearance for work, this is not the book for you. The resulting hair styles are frequently described in it as \\"wild\\" and \\"sexy\\" -- not words normally associated with a successful climb up the corporate ladder. Indeed, almost all the women featured are in creative or independent jobs.I know somepoeple are going to say \\"but the corporate world is changing\\" and I can only respond by saying, \\"not really, not yet.\\"Anyway, for many of us, following the advice in this book would be tantamount to professional suicide.

Turns out, I've got some natural wave to my hair.

It's an easy read, I was able to get through the book in less than 2 hours.I found the book has a lot of great advice and has made it much easier for me to take care of my curls. I'm too curly for straightening my hair and besides, I don't want to straighten it.I think the best thing about this book is what to look for in the ingredients of products you purchase. Looking for the bad stuff is great, it makes it so much easier to know what products I shouldn't buy!The only thing I disagree with on this book, is that I think she left out a critical step for curly girls that have been using silicone based products for a long time. I felt it was necessary to use an anti-residue shampoo to remove all the build up I had on my hair. Once the buildup was removed I noticed that my curls sprang to life more quickly and the conditioner I was using started making a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Quintessential.","review":"The best book for the care, treatment, cutting, cleaning and anything else pertaining to curly hair. Excellent. Quitting shampoo has been so very good for my hair (I haven't used it for a whole year). Frizz is now a rare occurance. The recipes are wonderful: Lemon-aid is a great clarifier, the lavender mist is a perfect curl reviver.Between my mother, sister and I, we have every curl texture possible and Massey's methods have worked wonders for all of us. I lend this book to everyone I know with even the slightest natural wave and it's become worn and dog-eared accordingly; I may need another copy.Really awesome book.

A book for us gals with curly, kinky, heavily wavy hair. This book has it all - treatments, ways to wash and when to not wash. It covers the types of cuts we should get to bring our curls out. It has a chapter on products and home remedies for curls. It also has a chapter for curly kids. There's a great question and answer section. Basically this book is about being proud of your curls, learning how to make the most of them - and keep them. I always thought that washing frequently was the answer for my hair but Lorraine Massey says that I should be washing my hair more infrequently and using products instead. I just came from my hairdresser who recommended this book and I am enthralled. I plan on following her advice and am looking forward to more curls and less frizz. Wish me luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curly Girl book","review":"I really liked this book. It had some great curly hair stories by women who spent their youth fighting their curls.

I read many of the reviews and thought it would have lots of information for women of color with curly hair. It does not.The short, short chapter she dedicated to kinky hair speaks of texturizers. Anyone who is natural knows that a texturizer is a weak relaxer. Why would we want to relax our natural hair?? I expected more, and I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful, fun, and helpful!","review":"This book not only had lots of great tips for wavy and curly hair, but it is colorful and very fun to read.

I've always either fought my curls, been unhappy with my hair or ended up with breakage and dullness. I had serious doubts about the \\"no shampoo\\" rule but it really works. My hair doesn't look, smell or feel dirty. In fact,my husband can't seem to stop touching it. I especially enjoyed Lorraine's treatment of the political and historical role of curly hair.

This is the first book I have ever discovered that glorifies the pluses of having curls -- and gives reasonable recommendations and suggestions for hair care especially for those of us whom nature blessed this way. I discovered this book while trying a \\"new\\" hairstylist at a salon new to me. What a delight to find someone who actually knows how to work with curly hair and bring out its best!

I am a most happy lady!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Curly Girl in Michigan Loves This Book!","review":"I loved this book! I have Botecelli curls, and I find using mousse instead of gel works better for me (mousse really controls frizz for me). I followed all of Lorraine's suggestions, but switched back to mousse instead of gel after a few weeks. Now I'm a very happy Curly Girl!I use Pantene products, always have, and have had great results. After reading Curly Girl I stopped using shampoo and I REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE! I use Pantene Hydrating Curls conditioner to wash my hair, not rinsing all of it out. Remember, hydrating your curls is the key to great looking curly hair. I squeeze my hair with a towel, then spray my hair with the Lavender Mist (recipe is in the book - very easy to make), then scrunch with Pantene Hydrating Curls Mousse. I use small butterly clips to clip my hair up along the top and upper sides to give some lift.

Now I only have shampoo, conditioner, and lavender water in a spray bottle.My 24 year old daughter is also following the book with her long slightly wavy hair. Now she has the curls of her dreams.This book is life changing but the advice is not for everybody.

The CG method suggests coating hair with conditioner prior to shampooing if you feel you want to shampoo to protect the hair and keep it's moisture or simply using conditioner to wash.This method WORKS and I have tried it myself, and there are countless curlies on naturallycurly.com that are using this method and it works for them. Even straight hair can benefit from the CG method it's not just for curly/wavy girls but the book encourages you to find your \\"inner curl\\" and embrace your natural waves rather than subjecting your hair to the abuse of SULPHATE SHAMPOO, hair products containing things that end in \\"CONE\\" and SD Alcohol as well as excessive heat styling that is very harmful to our locks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opening experience","review":"I have always had a hard time caring for my curly & coarse hair.This book was such an eye opening experience.

Loie was not only a movement artist and an inventor but a businesswoman, who promoted other artists (i.e. Rodin) in addition to herself.Loie was successful because she was experimental, resourceful, and persistent. As this book describes in detail events in all areas of her life, we can come to appreciate this woman who capitalized on her ideas and opportunities, to know her personal pathos as well as her enthusiasm for her art.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Rodgers and Friends","review":"After so many years of the original release, I bought this CD mainly because of the singer (Paul Rodgers is always brilliant, since the Free days) and his special friends, a list of guests that everyone would love to have on a tribute CD like this. For blues fans, it is a good way to experiment different versions of songs made famous by lots of other artists and/or guitar players. I got a 2002 version, which I believe is remastered from the original tapes. The sound is fantastic and I will play it a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Tribute","review":"A very worthy tribute to a blues musician whose influence cannot be underestimated.

The songs go nowhere.One plus is that the songs do present a good message. But that's about it.Fueled By Ramen usually signs some great artists but I think they may have missed on these guys.

When you throw in Dark Harbor Cottage's secret, a hot lesbian romance with one (or both?) of the twins next door (one of whom is psychic and who becomes mixed up with the government in a huge way), you have a rollicking good read.Rick R.

First off, the instructions contradicted themselves more than once making it hard to put the car together correctly. Secondly, a number of the screws did not fit properly and as a result the driving gears did not connect well and would just strip instead of driving the car forward. Lastly, the car's steerng mechinism did not work at all. So bacically i was left with a car that would only drive backwards in a straight line. Overall the kit is just very cheaply made, and in the end is more frustrating to build than fun (which is one of the main attractions to this product). I would avoid this product at all costs, there is simply nothing good about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Kids must have patience to put this together, as it can take up to 1-2 hours. The plastic molded parts do not fit well together causing the car to not drive straight, even after adjustment.

No 12 year old without extensive electrical experience can work with the very tiny wires - my adept 13 year old broke two wires and I broke one of those twice trying to correct his mistake. One of the circuit boards was dead out of the box. Most frustratingly, you CANNOT use this with your friends as advertised because the cars all broadcast on the same frequency. The value of putting this together was lost when one boy had no car at the end and the other two had to run their cars in different areas. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":":( Car kit w/ r/c","review":"I got this for my 10 year old for Christmas.We tried to put it together.

Listening to it now on CD I can say that it stands the test of time pretty well. The tracks Heart, Boy scouts, Fay Wray and Doris Dreams are absolute art-rock classics. 4 out of 9 ain't bad.And now the shocking revelation...In late 1975 a certain art-rock single got to number 1 in the charts - and stayed there for weeks. It was hailed as genius. It has subsequently been named (and still frequently is) as one of the greatest singles ever. Me, I can't understand why no-one has ever pointed out what I can see quite clearly. Namely, that the structure, dynamics and many of the ideas seem to have been lifted totally from Orchestra Luna's \\"Doris Dreams.\\" If you don't believe me, buy this album and listen for yourself.Oh - and the guilty single?

Not 8 months later, even though I'd treated the lens with all the respect it deserved, it became contaminated with fungus and could no longer be used. I took it to my German camera maker in Los Angeles when I returned there last month who, after attempting to disassemble same, pronounced it \\"Kaput\\" as, because the lens groups are spot-tack-welded, they cannot be separated and cleaned, thus rendering the lens quite useless. Nothing of value could be salvaged from it so I chucked it in the bin. I suggest you buy a metal or carbon fibre lens instead...anything but this plastic job which cannot be repaired when trouble with the lens groups arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens!","review":"Since I am not super-professional making money from taking pictures, I was looking for a reasonably priced wide angle lens for my Nikon D700 camera. This Tamron lens is exactly what I needed. It focuses very fast and I take great quality pictures with it.NOTE!!! If you use the same (or similar in functionality) camera as I do (D700), don't forget to move the lens's aperture ring to the locked position! Otherwise you will get an error message on your camera. With the locked ring on the lens you control the lens's aperture by the CAMERA dial (in manual M or A modes). Another word, the aperture ring should stay at locked (at 22) in any mode, but the actual aperture will depend on the camera setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"OEM can't go wrong.

Joe and Dulcie are wonderful characters, imbued with such human characteristics, that you almost forget they are cats. Joe's repartee with his human, Clyde, is delightful, and the way they play the informants to hapless Det. Harper is lots of fun.The addition of the Tortoiseshell kit is a nice touch, too.As in all of these mysteries, the plot is not the main thing, but the way these cats go about solving the murders. This one has a tightly woven plot, and even though the identity of the culprits is revealed earlier than usual, the way they are captured and the resultant aftermath are delightful.A great entry in this series, can't wait for her next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat to the Dogs","review":"I have not read this particular book as of yet,just trying to find the time to do so, but if it is anything like her other books, I will certainly find it intreging and delightful!

In fact I know look at my own cats and wonder if they too can talk with the human language, but do not by choice. They certainly do talk with their eyes and body movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"More stars for the whole series","review":"I love this series. It is pure, enjoyable escapism. So what if you don't think cats should talk - it is a fascinating concept and a lot of fun. The characters are richly drawn and the interaction between Joe Grey and Clyde are hilarious. There are very few series I have read that can bring so many chuckles and smiles - this one definitely delivers them. I am so glad I found this series and look forward to future books by this author. The only thing though - after reading these books - I do find myself wondering what my tortie is really thinking when I catch her watching me....."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only they acted like cats","review":"This is the first mystery series with cats I didn't like. Cats that speak English???? File it in fantasy, not mystery. I like my cats to act like normal cats, with the humans requiring *some* intelligence or curiosity.

The software is a nightmare, I figured out how to program the mini-stick through trial and error and never understood the process.I owned mine for about 45 days and and the \\"E\\" key broke causing the button to be actuated all the time.

The illumination of the blue light is harder to see the keys, the green lighting is the best, and the red is in between. Green is the default setting for FPS,First Person Shooters and Red for RTS,Real Time Strategy games. The blue indicates custom programmingThe thumb controls are adjustable with a slider bar.Since I am female and my hands are smaller I will note that I wished the pad had more adjustments to accomodate a smaller hand.

It worked nicely except the thumbpad thing breaks very easily. I sent it back to saitek with an RMA but they never sent me a new one back and I didn't even try to pursue it because I was just so disheartened with it. It does look great though!Bottom line is, if you're going to use the side thumbstick to move around, don't get this one. If you use the keys on top to move around then it should be no problem.The Nostromo thumbpad is an actual pad and so can take a huge beating. It's lasted me through everything.

The games I play, WoW BF2 WC3 SC are less enjoyable playing with this game pad. Yeah, it can be set to do alot of stuff on one key but you can never type directly on it, WoW has a key binding feature making this game pad completely useless, WC3 and SC along with other RTS not only need typability but keys like A S D F G etc to build units fast, BF2 just does way too much to be held in such a small gamepad (though I did manage to make a workable config for BF2, it didn't contain everything you might use).

You will have to sit down and take your time and experiment to get the game pad to work exactly how you want but I think that it was worth it.

The bits are distributed evenly throughout the finished product when they are added near the conclusion of the of the process.It would be nice if the machine had a variable speed beater to control the air in the final product, but that is probably expecting too much from a machine designed for home use.The machine seems to be very well made and arrived well before promised delivery date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine stopped working!","review":"I bought this unit about 18 months ago and was initially pleased with it.

The compressor must be broken and I was told by the company when I called to have it fixed that it would be almost as expensive to fix as it would be to replace.

I have no trouble with movies like this, but this movie did not move very fast. blood and gore were more than enough with a homage to FARGO in a dream. cast very non-discript and I hope they got paid well. one nice special effect with CGI probably burst the budget(it was nice few seconds). while I can't recommend this movie, I am just going to tell you--YOU COULD DO ALOT WORSE!!. bigger budget and better pacing would have helped and I hope they learn from this, so maybe their next movie will be worth me making popcorn for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad!!!","review":"I started to watch this movie and after the first 30 minutes into it, I realized that it had no story and I had started to fall asleep.

As with her novel Villette, it takes place in Belgium, but here the protagonist is male.It is based on Bronte's own experiences in Belgium. It is a short novel about half as big as Jane Eyre, and it does not have the emotional highs and lows of her most popular book.This is a light read that centers on an English teacher who has moved to Belgium, and his relationship with the managers of a girls school. Also, it involves his interest in a female student.It has a good ending and most will enjoy the read.

In fact they even outnumber printed books on my bookshelf. As with any audio book, the choice of narrator can \\"Make or Break\\" the listening experience.

For example, Hardy is best narrated by the likes of Tony Britton and John Rowe, the Brontes by Michael Kitchen, Dickens by Martin Jarvis, etc. Oscar Wilde is best narrated by actors with posh accents like Edward Petherbridge and Simon Callow. On this rendition of \\"The Professor\\", Frederick Davidson makes Simon Callow sound positively working class! His accent is over-the-top and even sounds like a parody of London Society.

She depicts human nature, thought, and emotion brilliantly utilizing the English language to highten the reader's experience of the situation at hand. The Professor was, however, Bronte's first novel and, although controversial at the time, now seems to illustrate how much Bronte had grown as a writer throughout the years. In my opinion, Jane Eyre and Villete were her finest works, but The Professor is still a must read for any Bronte fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"Just what I have been looking for to fill out my library for Heraldry.

As richly written as most of FPW's books, Nightworld delivers on plot, characters, dialogue, and imagery. The climax is just long enough to be suspenseful, not too long as to want to make you merely skim through it.

The film, although based on a book with more substance, glossed over the things that may have given it depth and over-played the erotic to the point of humor. Perception of counter-cultural life in the time of World War II France, artistic expression as a component of revolution, or self-awareness through sexuality were covered in a haze of intense meaningful gazes (with the usual suspects),romantic French music and scenes of the Eiffel Tower. If there's a movie cliche to make a romantic scene romantic, you will find it in this movie.

This book gives some of the occurances in Confucious' life... and some good quotations... but it seems a lot is missing considering what Confucious is famous for. The illustrations by Tseng Yu-Ho are terrible. They look like childrens finger paintings on a fence! There is ONE good illustration before the title page of a charcoal drawing of Confucious.. but it is not drawn by Yu-Ho.

It's thorough without being wordy, detailed without being overwhelming, covers all aspects of the software without losing you in the process. The color illustrations are incredibly helpful, and each topic covered progresses logically through the software. The paper quality is first-class, and the ability to download the exact image files that are illustrated in the book is extremely helpful.

I can step on and off as many times as I want and my weight stays the same! I debated whether to pay the roughly $200 dollars extra for the stainless steel version, but decided I'd have it a long time so I splurged. I'm not sure that it looks that much nicer - it's still a scale and scales really aren't attractive. I know there are two other manufacturers and they are all probably good.

I have had numerous Cuisinart appliances, including the grinder I was replacing and was up to this point satisfied with their performance, albeit they never lasted as long as I thought they should.

It's not too big and clumsy and is very easy to clean. The ease of storing the beans in the unit and just hitting start for an accurate measure and grind is incredible. Have only tried the medium grind in my drip pot so far and the flavor is definitely superior to the blade ground coffee. I should also mention that I use an Amazon Visa card that earns Amazon points $25 at a time so this grinder only cost $9.99 and the shipping was free.

I find prevalent among history writers who write about America's Indians without examining the inhumane practices of these varrious tribes. To be fair I also want to know about the slavery, torture, killing and kidnapping these Congolese tribes perpetrated on each other. The constant condemnation the author intones gainst Leopold looses its flavor for me and actually has the opposite effect. This author is a guy with a singular point of view out to get those who created our modern societies. I condemn all torture, rape, killing and slavery..surely these Congolese were not living in the garden of Eden! They too, because they were human, had to be just like the Europeans. I despise politically motivated history writing... This book is such an example."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottom line","review":"These are of course very difficult subjects to sleuth out, but.....His analysis of estimated people killed in Congo (5-8 million) is less than rigorous.Likewise, rigorous analysis of what ($) Leopold put into the Congo vs. what he took out is lacking. Was this a successful venture for Leopold financially (on a return-on-investment basis)? Maybe or maybe not, but Hockschild does not prove it by pointing out that Leopold put up a few statues and built a wing on his chateau.......Leo was't exactly poor to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of trash","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book, hoping to gain additional insight into a fascinating period of history. Instead I was dismayed to find myself reading what amounts to a politically correct fable. This book is shot through with \\"it's a possibility that so-and-so did this\\" and \\"It's reasonable to assume that such-and-such could have happened\\". Is this what passes for historical scholarship? Not only that but incredibly there is no evidence given to support the book's central thesis, that millions of Africans were killed during the time of Leopold's control of the Congo. As far as I'm concerned the author accomplished his primary purpose, to grind his politically correct axe at the expense of people no longer alive to defend themselves. If you want to find out about this period and place in history look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"For such a large subject and the amount of research that supposedly went into this book I was expecting a larger book and more detail. Furthermore, on page 139 there is a song transcribedby a missionary which refers to an animal which has never been found in Africa and is highly unlikely to have even been heard of by the Africans at this time.

The fascinating array of personalities and historical forces makes this book a page turner from beginning to end. Leopold's disgusting avarice and the greed of his minions brought horror on a scale unimaginable in those times and created the first modern \\"human rights\\" campaign.

In fact the author's holier-than-thou attitude and his un-nuanced view of foreign affairs in the late Nineteenth Century, makes his book an irritating read. Irritating because the Congo deserves better: with so much horror and so much bloodshed, the author really did not have to pepper his literature with his own chewed out opinions. He should have let the facts and the stories speak for themselves. Additionally, he should have taken more time to fit the Congo into its historical perspective. Narrative history should show some balance, this book doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealized potential","review":"This could have been a very good book -- an historical exploration of a little-known era and series of events in Africa. The author certainly did enough research to craft such a tale, and in spots the narrative is quite interesting. However, the author simply cannot stop trying to wedge this story into a politically correct fable without any real justification for doing so and keeps dragging in irrelevant things he admires -- Amnesty International, pacificists in WWI, etc. Well, it doesn't work and all this does is gradually undercut the author's credibility and make the reader suspicious of the other parts...Too bad, it could have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the truth","review":"Finally a book that tells the truth about the forgotten Congo. For anyone planning to travel or live in Congo, this book will help you understand it's tragic history and therefore it's present day people.

What fascinated me was the description of Leopold II's cunning manipulation of his own image. He bamboozled diplomats, most journalists, and the public in Europe and the U.S. His downfall (not that he really had much of one) or rather the downfall of his reputation came from a few journalists some Protestant missionaries. Hochschild bluntly points out that the Belgians in WW I managed to generate stories of German atrocities commited against them that largely never happened but were precisely what they had inflicted on the Congolese. Do I have a complaint? Yes , I would like more photographs (and the ones in the poorl bound edition I have are falling out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author's wonderful style make this horror story read lik","review":"This detailed, well researched history took me back, in fulfilling detail, to an era I knew nothing about and into the dark hearts of some of history's worst monsters.The writer deserves every praise and award he gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countering Conservative Political Correctness","review":"What a book! Although they would never admit it, this book surely shoots down the right's long held belief that evil oppression took place before the creation of Marxist Communist regimes. The treatment of native Africans by royal European colonialists was so attrocious and reprehensible that even William F. Buckley should be moved to condemn it. This book also reinforces the thought that a European in Africa with a Bible in one hand and a gun in the other is a threat to the life and property of the native population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author with an ax to grind","review":"This book starts out okay, but then lapses into the author lecturing the reader about how horrible Europeans are.

The interesting history of colonial Africa was totally unknown to me. My only prior knowledge of the Congo was that at one point it was a Belgian possession that had been troubled by some human rights problems. I can't believe that the story of the Congo and its atrocities had escaped my education to this point in my life. King Leopold's Ghost has been an inspiring book, driving me to read more about colonial Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading","review":"This book should be required reading for world history education. Adam Hochschild has performed a service to humanity by presenting the gruesome facts about the extermination of a people through greed, corruption and ritual murder in such a way as to present a fair report championing the rights of the oppressed, while explaining the motivations of the oppressors within the beliefs of the times. This book was impossible not to finish, mainly because to deny the enormity of the slaughter and the secrets exposed felt like a personal rejection of the innocents. Months later I'm still thinking about it. What is so soulshattering is that the Congo again, starting in 1959, has experienced yet another unbelievable decimation of its population through (admittedly well-intentioned) polio vaccination and misguided food sources resulting in the crossover of SIV to AIDS. Who is writing their story today?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I recently read this book for a World History course and was surprised when I actually found the book interesting. The book reads like a novel but a novel with historically accurate information. For someone with little to no background information on the subject matter explored in the book, I have no hesitation when I say it was thoroughly enjoyable and (gasp!) informative at the same time. This book is a testament to the fact that not all books that contain historically accurate information have to be like a typical boring history textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history repeated in all ex-colonies around the world.","review":"This very well written book open the doors of a segment of the African history unknown for most of the people. This is a shocking research that show us how a huge area in Africa became an ivory and rubber hell where the brutality, cruelty and ambition of the Belgium king and his employees reduce the native population to a slave condition by force but also shocked me the doble morale of those people who denounced the crimes and exposed the reality of the colony and the other face of King Leopold so strongly but said nothing or almost nothing against the British, French, German and Dutch Empires that were committing the same or worst crimes in their colonies at the same time applying the same policy of robbery and cruelty as King Leopold in his Free State of Congo later known as the Belgium Congo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Desperately Needed","review":"While Hochschild does an excellent job shining a light on the happenings in the Congo from its initial colonial conquest until the downfall of its imperial master (the eponymous Leopold) perhaps his greater contribution is to remind us how little of actual history we are taught in our classes in school.Nearly everyone of my friends who read this book was shocked and saddened and not a little astounded as to how this colossal genocide has been erased from our collective memory. The book is best seen as an exhortation to scholars and historians in general to delve deeper into those obscure lacunae of history and tell us more about what really happened on the path here"},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched and informative, great sense of narrative","review":"The book is well written, really lets you understand the sequence of events that surrounded both the colonization of the Congo and the efforts of the many people who had worked against the regime. One of the most shocking revelations of the book is that this wasn't an isolated freakish series of events, but that the same kind of horrors were to be found elsewhere in colonial Africa, perhaps to a lesser degree, but that the Congo was simply the most publicized and well-known of them. The fact that it's almost put in as an afterthought is the one flaw of the book, but I don't think it could have the same pacing and sense of narrative if it were a real survey of 19th C colonization in Africa. It's a reminder that we need to be paranoid about people claiming good intentions for reforming a supposedly \\"backwards\\" place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hot air brush","review":"I have medium length hair that gets frizzy.

She is a perfect match for Florez and I look forward to seeing her go mad in Act three of Lucia.I tend to shy away from \\"LIVE\\" reordings due to stage noise, audience coughing etc.; But I fear that this audience was bound and gagged with duct tape. Not a sound until the end of the first act which is the end of the second disc. Only then applause. Decca did an amazing job of editing these performances together.

And as if to add to it, Annick Massis also gave a florid display of her coloratura skills. Well, if you are not into this style of bel canto singing, forget it. If you are into it, it is a must to own.If you are hunting for showcase solo arias, there is just one - for Massis. Florez fans may be a bit disappointed here.That said, for this rarely recorded and performed work, this recording will most likely remain the benchmark for many many more years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is worth every penny.","review":"I was competely blown away by Juan Diego Florez and Annick Massis's singing, and of course, the rest of the cast (including conductor, Ricardo Frizza) are wonderful.

A surprising thread of hope throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"After a recomendation to read this book, I purchased it and quickly read it. I found this book to have been a major disappointment. The plot is too convuluted to be realistic is my major complaint. How all of the main characters are enabled to meet in San Francisco, at the end of the novel, is so incredible, it boggles the mind. I am very surprised that a major publisher saw fit to print it; I am also surprised that it won a minor book prize. This book was to unrealistic to be enjoyed. It failed as a Viet Nam war novel and failed as a mystery. This was one terrible read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"This book was required reading for my Adv. English class and I have no regrets having to read it. It is an excellent book that adult readers will enjoy. The protagonist in the novel is Jesse Pasadoble, who is a Vietnam veteran working as a criminal defense attorney in San Francisco. He takes on a case that brings him face to face with the demons of his painful past...Alfredo Vea's book makes full use of wonderfully written prose passages and lots of detailed imagery that pulls the reader in. He takes us from the nameless hill in Vietnam to the gritty ghetto in San Francisco with a sense of realism that is superb. The depth and richness of his characters in his fully developed world shows the reader the true struggle to regain hope and humanity after the brutality of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest recent war novels","review":"Without a doubt, Vea has emersed us in a what will someday be a timeless classic of the Vietnam War.

Give it to friends.","review":"I first heard of Vea and his new novel on the Marc Cooper show on Pacifica Radio KPFK (90.7). The show inspired me to seek out his new novel. I finished it last weekend and am still carrying its power with me. To describe \\"gods go begging\\" as an example of a war novel or a Vietnam novel or a Chicano novel or a magic realist novel does not do full justice to the book. It is all of those and much, much more. Vea has succeeded in telling a story that I have never heard before and telling it in such a way that, to quote the last line of Frank O'Connor's classic short story, \\"Guests of the Nation\\": \\"And anything that ever happened me after that I never felt the same about again.\\"Buy it.

She has it all - beauty, intelligence, and the acting chops to go along with them. This is a fairly standard mystery drama, but it's elevated by its intense love scenes, which are quite realistic and erotic. And Dash even sings in the film, to good effect. She is a true beauty and a good director and writer would give her the opportunity to show her skills. Think of how good she was in \\"Clueless\\" (and not used enough in that film either). She's just as good here. Maybe she needs her own TV series for more people to see her talent. If you're a fan, you will enjoy this film. It's fast-paced, well produced, with some of the best love scenes I've seen in a film in quite some time. There's real chemistry between the stars.

However, those points are lost on me because I could not manage to finish this book; The organization and layout were confusing and the argument was incoherent. Add to this 92 pages of often irrelevant and digressing endnotes, and the process of reading became a chore I was unwilling to perform.

I did not find any of these things in Losing the Moon. The author is a fine writer, but it takes more than good writing to make a good story. Some may enjoy how she handled the return of the old college boy friend some twenty years later and how that upset the life of the main female character. Did she not mature any during that period of time? Also I found the meeting unbelievable--not likely to happen in the close setting of the story. I didn't like the characters, nor the plot, not the way it dragged so heavily in the middle.

He does not walk by himself yet, but he can stand up & walk around holding unto things, he tries to walk holding unto the wagon but the wagon goes real fast and he'd lose his balance so I have to help him.

The wagon is big enough for her to get in and stretch her legs. We also push her around in it inside the house..and she loves that.

It is hard to turn, so someone has to be around to help them make corners and avoid obstacles. It's been a favorite toy for months. The blocks are nothing special - just small foam blocks. They are good for teething, and as of yet they haven't taken a chunk out of any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Push Toy for Toddlers!","review":"We bought this for my grandson's 1st birthday, and he loves pushing it around as well as getting in and going for a ride in it.

Weil is sort of amazing about getting us down to the desert, where the rocket is coming into being [everyone hopes] and all of these devoted workers are slaving away on it. And she's great at presenting the kind of contrast American life _always_ presents -- between the suggestion of infinite possibility, on the one hand, and, on the other, the dusty, brambly conditions of our actual lives. It's a very American story, and Weil tells it without vicarious shame for failure.

I would highly recommend NOT waisting money on this book, if you must read this I would suggest waiting till its available in thrift stores or libraries.It seems to me the book is more about the area and the companies employees, not the company and its venture.

Aczon presents complex material in a way that is practical and easy to understand. Anyone interested in gaining more knowledge about their legal rights in the music industry will want to start here and refer to it throughout their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industry Advice For Today's Musicians","review":"Michael Aczon is one of the best legal minds of our times and he proves it with this well written guide for musicians. His book could very well become the new standard for musicians, vocalists, and recording artists. It is definitely a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource for musicians","review":"Item shipped fast & the product itself is great. It's not necessarily a cover-all, but it's definitely a great resource that you can reference at various points throughout your career. It also helps spark ideas & provide inspiration if you are a creative type.Definitely a good book to have on the shelf if you are a working musician of ANY kind. Not too cheap, but for a textbook the price is reasonable.Recommended.4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable book!","review":"Upon my relentless pursuit of finding my life's passion and feeling fulfilled in my career, I came across Michael Aczon. I can not tell you how blessed I am to have crossed paths with him. Between thought provoking inserts in his book and intellectual conversations with him, I have been inspired to push forward and never doubt what I am capable of. He is truly passionate about what he does and it comes through in his writings.I am a paralegal and contacted Michael for advice on how to make the transition from current specialty and into Entertainment Law. He was extremely responsive and motivational. One of his philosophies is that the more you push to surround yourself with talented people who inspire you, the more they will be attracted to you...until one day you are only surrounded by people of great passion and integrity.Bottom line is I highly recommend this book if you want to learn from an author who is truly sincere in his teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and academic","review":"The two stars are because the author DOES prove his point. However, I had hoped for an interesting read as well, and didn't get it. It reads like a scientific study by a graduate student. What a pity it wasn't written for the general public, because we all need his messsage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag for old glass-lined thermoses","review":"I don't drink wine, but was looking for a bag to protect my antique Landers, Frary & Clark glass-lined thermos bottles and this bag is just what I was looking for. It's nicely padded and the carry strap and carry handle both serve my purposes well. I hook the strap over the passenger-side head rest and my thermos sits upright on the passenger seat so I can get my thermos out easily enough to pour a cup of coffee at a red light and get my thermos nestled back in the bag before the light turns green. I imagine its great for keeping two bottles of wine cool too. It's very well made and I expect years of happy use. I've bought two of them because I liked the first one so well and an all-day trip to town is a two-thermos day for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual purpose for me","review":"I bought this to carry two glass VOSS water bottles to work with me each day. The water at work is chlorinated so I refill the glass bottles every day. The case is nice. It is perfectly sized for these water bottles. It is not top-shelf in terms of quality - the faux leather is a little cheesy and the zipper is a bit awkward to close - but it was reasonably priced and it is insulated. The strap is nice and long and can be shortened if needed. I also like the carry handle on top. If you don't need the top of the line, this is a very nice bag to carry wine or water bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle","review":"This product was not what I expected. It had a cheap plastic insulation instead of the sturdy thermo aluminum color insulation as pictured (the kind of lining in cooler bags you get at clubs like Sams or Costcos or BJ's to keep food cold). Also no wine stopper included as described. Not happy at all with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overdue for a proper DVD release...","review":"If this title should EVER see the light of day on DVD, it should include as one of its supplemental materials thehour-long 16mm documentary, \\"Filmmaker\\" shot by George Lucas (now a standard instructional film in most major film programs.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rained out people","review":"I had seen this when it was released and thought I'd get it to see it again (not available on Netflix - now I know why).

Deversify. This is a doable way of making a self timed firing device."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dramatic, dark variant on the Second Coming","review":"Whether intended or not, this book gives a dramatic rewrite of the Christian tale of the return of Jesus. Only in this there is to be no true Heaven for believers but only an orgiastic Hell that threatens the destruction of all concerned with it. Little's graphic descriptions of wanton violence, sex, and licentiousness are breathtaking to say the least. He does not stsint the reader in any way with this tale of mounting terror up to its curious climax. Interestingly, Little also evokes some measure of sympathy for the villain with his portrayal of latent softer emotions that maintain in him some measure of humanity even while they serve to make his viler acts more depraved and appalling. In short, Domion is a great read any true horror fan would do well to read, if not purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"At first I was hooked to this book. Then less than halfway through something went wrong... Little lost it. The storyline is interesting- Greek mythology woven into a modern-day \\"what if\\" scenario, although I think it could have been written better.The way it's written felt almost amateurish; very choppy and not well thought out. Little definitely has a way for creating a scene, I will give him that, but a story needs to encompass much more than simply setting up an image, and that's where he lost it.One of the main things I really did not like, which made me lose interest VERY fast, was that the characters lose their realness and the dialogue between all of them becomes ridiculous and not believable. As the plot progresses the changes within their psyches are not well documented and it made me wonder whom I was suddenly reading about.My suggestion? If you can find a library that carries this book, borrow it before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wanted an introduction to Little's work, read the wonderful reviews here, and bought the book.If I were still a teenager and cutting my teeth on horror, I might have said it was kind of cool but I was raised on King, Rice, Matheson, Clive, and later, Poppy Z.I couldn't finish this story. I just didn't care.I have another book by Little and I will give it a go to see if he can change my mind, but if you're looking to be swept up, away, and into another world that is more exciting than your own ... keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, I have become less and less of a Little fan, and Dominion helped to seal my opinion. While only a couple of Little's characters have any redeeming qualities, the others are depraved and act reprehensibly. I will not purchase another of Little's novels or short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Graphics'","review":"If you like to read graphic-sexual novel then read it. The over all idea is good and kind of new but too much of graphic discription ruined the book. It become like thse Straight to VDO C grade horror flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays well into a sick, valueless society...","review":"I am appalled at how many people raved about this book and called it awesome. It's scary to think about how Godless many in our society have become. I like thrillers, and I've liked many of Bentley Little's books, but I couldn't stand to read this book in its entirety. If you have no moral values and glory in plotless sex and violence, then this is the book for you. Link it to mythology if you want to, but does that give it legitimacy or literary merit? Crude is crude; gross is gross; and disgusting is disgusting no matter what else you call it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty!","review":"This book was too nasty for my taste... A little to much detail of things I'd rather not read in a so-called \\"horror novel\\"...

The character development is awesome and the storyline in enthralling. Be forwarned though.....this book is extremely graphic and horrifying, if this was made into movie it would have to be rated XXX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bentley's best book, get this first!","review":"Mr. Little hit a home run of horror with this one, but most of his others are either grounders or just plain fouls. This has an original story of Greek gods coming back to life in Napa valley.Wine, blood, sex, murder, sex, wine, blood, ect...you get the point. With a decient love story put in the mix for good measure, fast plot, and for once a good ending, you can't miss with Dominion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely unforgiving and shocking as hell!","review":"I dare you not to be affected by the visuals in this book. An absolute masterpiece of chaos. At times brings to mind Shirley jackson meets the mind boggling images set forth in the underrated horror flick, event horizon. A gorgeous read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOMINION IS AMAZING!","review":"Dominion is not Bentley Little's best book, but it'shis most hardcore. It's also a whole lot better than mostof the other horror out there. A very literary book thattakes those Greek myths we learned about in college andplayfully stands them on their head. Little here outBarkers Barker. One hellacious book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INSANE","review":"Little really goes to the extreme in this book of gods and witches.The sex in this book is crazily graphic and outlandish.

I ordered this CD, thinking that it was by the Cuban dance music (timba) Bamboleo that is led by Lazaro Valdez. It turns out that it is collection of songs by different performers. Only one song is listed as performed by Bamboleo. I did not open the CD. So I do not know if the Bamboleo listed there is really the aforementioned Cuban band. But looking at the CD and names of the performers, I think that the CD is not even about Cuban dance music. None of the performers listed on the CD is known at all. Their names do not even look Cuban. None of the top Cuban dance bands is listed there. I returned the CD and asked Amazon to show an image of the CD and post the list of songs and performers on the CD, so customers can make an informed decision. I hope that they follow my suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the earlier stuff","review":"Anyone who may want to get a taste of Sammmy's earlier stuff should check into this CD. The problem with Sammy's CD's is they lack consistency. One would have to shell out $20 or more and get a album with too many weak tunes and not enough juicy ones like \\"Cruisin' & Boozin'\\", \\"Red\\", \\"Rock 'N' Roll Weekend\\" and \\"Turn Up The Music\\".For a few bucks you can pick up this CD and get the best of his early stuff without spending $20 per CD.If you don't believe me, take a listen to some of the sample songs on Amazon and make up your own mind. Personally I rather save the $$ and get this one.While I'm at it... I would strongly recommend the CD Montose by Montose. One of the best early 70's hard rock CD's! Just a notch below Machine Head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"It's Sammy \\"The Red Rocker\\" Hagar, so for me, enough said, right there. I have never heard a Sammy Hagar song, when he was solo, with \\"Monitors\\" and as \\"Chickenfoot\\", now, that I don't like. Not so much the Van Halen years, as I have never cared much for Van Halen, after their first two albums, regardless of who was in the group, at any particular time. Sammy was still great, but as said, I just don't care much for the Van Halen style. But, that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise!","review":"I bought this book on a whim. Being from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania I was surprised to learn there was an epic poem about the 1790s Wyoming Massacre written in the early 19th century called Getrude of Wyoming. I looked on Amazon for it and found this book which was a classic reprint of the poem. It was a little expensive but I thought I would donate it to my public library. When I received the book I was impressed at the crisp clean binding and then I opened the book. The pages were blank. Well not completely blank some had printing them and some had partial printing on them but mainly blank. I contacted Amazon which gave me a full refund, so I'm statisfied. Just beware of the classic reprints in this series which touts it careful and faithful digital reproduction of classic work because it is obvious there is a real lack of quality control. How many Gertrude of Wyoming books could you possibly be producing that a blank copy slips through the cracks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deal on a great scent","review":"Vetiver is such a great scent.

You'd be better off spraying yourself with some Repel bug spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try before you buy!","review":"This has great reviews in the fashion circles that cover fragrance, but to me, it smells like an ashtray. There are multiple layers to the scent, but it's mostly bad tobacco, and that's the one that just won't wear off.It's also very strong, so even if you love the smell, go really light with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic? Yes. Timeless? No.","review":"I bought this because of all the great reviews on a fragrance site, and a sniff at the local Sephora. Unfortunately, the sexy fresh carrot-smelling top quickly disappears. The smell becomes very disturbing - stale cinnamon, stale tobacco, and fresh Raid bug spray.My people give me honest feedback about all of my fragrances. Here are five comments I received on this one:1. Dull.2. Smells like weed.3. Smells like trees. It's like sniffing the bark of a tree.4. Smells really old.5. I don't like it.I sold the bottle on eBay for 33 bucks. I've never been happier to lose 7 dollars.It is a classic, just like classical music - it's been around for years, and most people prefer something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Hair Spary","review":"I really wanted to like this cologne after reading so many great reviews on it.

Something that transcends times and/or trends/fads; it is the man's version of Channel #5. It is a simple but classic scent that women just love and will want to wear your shirt the next day, just because it reminds them of the previous day or evening. It is a classic like 18 year old single malt or a Cuban cigar and to a woman having a platinum or white gold diamond ring. Some things are classic and cannot be compromise.Things worth noting:Vetiver was/is previously listed and probably currently one of the top five men fragrances in the world.Also the King of Spain, Juan Carlos prefers Vetiver over any other fragrances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vetiver is a gem find.","review":"I agree with the reviewer Encee, that Vetiver is a great smelling cologne but it does not last long on the body but has a long lasting cling on clothing.

When my grandkids came for Easter, we mixed up some sugar cookie dough, and they were so excited to make the shapes. I filled the tube, clicked the trigger til the dough got to the end, then tried to dispense a cookie. The dough came out through the patterned circle, but did not let go of the form as we pressed it on the cookie sheet. We tried over & over. Tried numerous patterns, and not one cookie would come out and detach from the dispenser. We were all very disappointed. It is the same cookie recipe that I used in my Pillsbury press, so I know it wasn't the dough. Not worth the price, and I don't know what to do with it, cause returns cost money, so you can't get a full refund. =-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find---Worth the search!!!!","review":"I think this was the follow up to Trace.

It was truly a great biography of what life became for a girl that could not stay long unless she loved it there for it was her coice and a destiny to make it within her. It was a spectaculur book of what Jewish life was like for I have never lived in such a difficult life and it was a masterpiece of what seemed like a lifetime ago in a world that nobody has ever lived in before and a young girl told everyone her life that she had lived in her world of privacy where nothing was to be told to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile, Well-Designed Pack","review":"This Fishpond pack fully met my expectations.

The pan was dented in on one side and not acceptable. I had to immediately send it back for a refund.

I'll never order a product like that again, if they can't do better.

It is large enough to cook for a big family and non-stick coating works like a charm.

As soon as you are finished you can chuck it in the sink/dishwasher and thats it...the non-stick coating is very durable. Expensive products, while good, require a lot of care and maintenance, and I just don't have the patience for that. The only minor issue is lack of a second (opposing) handle. This pan can get heavy when cooking large quantities of food, and without the second handle can be hard to lift. Also it lacks a cover, but I found a cheap one at Walmart. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the purchase and could not hope for a better all-round non-stick pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of two we reach for first","review":"We went shopping for a sturdy, brand-name, durable 12\\" saute/fry non-stick pan for multi-purpose daily use.

It seems to heat evenly and quickly on a glass-top electric range, on either the inner (lower heat) or outer (higher heat) rings. We also regularly use a 12\\" non-stick with a wider base, but this one is usually the first pick. We like the color, and the handle stays cool. We use only wooden or nylon tools for stirring, and always hand-wash the pan. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Wok!","review":"This is our second non-stick wok and I use it for everything.

There are two design problems with this tape measure, however:1) The ratchet makes it difficult to turn and what parent wants another toy that makes annoying noise. It is not as if real tape measures make clicking noises. You can, however, open this toy up with the five screws and completely remove the ratchet. That solves this problem entirely and makes the tape reel very easy to pull in.2) Unfortunately, as other parents have noted, the tape often gets lodged between the two plastic shells that form the housing. Sometimes I can get it unstuck quickly, often I have to open the tape measure up again.This would be a great, budget toy if it were designed properly. Unfortunately it is harder to use than a real tape measure. This one is fun until it fails, and then it lies around with its tape all unwound waiting for parental attention.

Unfortunately, although the casing and tape themselves are sturdy, this toy is poorly designed. There is a edge on the plastic piece (not broken, just the way it was designed) where the tape comes out, and unless the tape is pulled out completely straight, the tape \\"catches\\" on this extra piece, gets twisted, and then neither pulls or retracts. A patient adult can feed it in, untwist it, and make it work again, but this is happening over and over (no matter which kid is playing with it). Too bad, because if not for this design flaw, it would have been perfect for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the granddaddy of plastic chess sets!","review":"The pieces: These have a good finish, with a weight at the bottom, so they feel nicely heavy in the hand.

Normally I don't care for the rock as an actor but he did a surprisingly good job playing as the coach of the deliquent kids. The story is good but it isn't too different from any other sports/reform movie. So at times the story can be predictable. But the acting and the fact that it is a true story makes it a movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Real","review":"I really enjoyed this movie and I have watched it several times.

The Iliad takes place the ninth year of the Trojan War. This book is very descriptive there is a lot of fighting, arguing, revenge and blah blah blah. However don't be afraid to read this book. There are other better versions of this book that are much easier to read. I even bought another version and it's much easier to follow. I think the Iliad is a great story but make sure to find the right version for you; otherwise you will be confused about what's happing and bored out of your skull.P.S.

It motivates young readers and basketball players to never stop believing in themselves. It helped me to realize that no matter what the situation is I should never give up. The characters in the story are very realistic and so are the situations. I have never seen the movie of Coach Carter so I would really like to go see it soon and see all the characters come to life. I give this book 5 star because it kept me reading the whole time wanting to see what was going to happen next. This is a really good book and I recommend it to anyone that could have a dream in life. If you've never read Coach Carter before you should diffidently go read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Preview to View","review":"To be honest I didn't have much interest in the movie.

However, if you want to save money and re-cycle and re-use, I suggest holding onto thin weight cardboard that comes with various packaging and simply use one of these collars as a pattern and make your own. If you don't have the time or the inclination to do this, then these collars are not too expensive and work well.

I was very pleased to get 50 collars in the packet - I do not re-use these collars after one use and wax once/twice a month. I contemplated making them at home and then decided it was not worth it.

This pan, however, is an exception. I am a frequent (and pretty good!) cook, and I have a wide selection of top-quality cookware in my kitchen: All-Clad, Le Creuset, 100 year-old cast iron. I am more than familiar with all different cooking surfaces and how food should respond to each of them.I can honestly say this pan - at least the one shipped to me - has no more nonstick qualities than my favorite stainless steel All-Clad. While fine for sauteed veggies (and why would one need nonstick for that?), eggs and other delicate proteins stuck without gobs of oil - and, again, what is the point of buying nonstick if the food is still floating on a sea of oil?I am really disappointed, and am returning my pan today. Perhaps it is defective (I don't know), but I certainly won't be buying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Little Crepe Pan","review":"I cook mostly in regular stainless steel pans, but when you're doing crepes, it is really nice to have a nice reliable friend like this KitchenAid non-stick to help you out!

A bargain for the dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eggs don't stick","review":"I had bought myself a set of the calphonized (sp) cookware and the smaller pan wasn't working at all-everything stuck to it.

One of her characters lives into her 90's, but her depth of personality, sense of history as lived, and experience never passes that of your average college student.Clee's grasp of recorded history is sound, but historic figures are painted with a casual brush, and fictional characters are two dimensional. I never did figure out what Daria was doing there, except to serve as a place holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal screed","review":"This book could have been a genuinely enjoyable escapist novel, but unfortunatlely, comrade Clee's obvious left-wing Democrat leanings color the whole thing. In her work, the biggest heroes in world history are JFK, RFK, and the poor misunderstood Russians. She even gives us an adoring encounter with a teenage Bill Clinton (God save us all!) In her world, war is ALWAYS wrong, and is nearly always caused be neanderthalistic conservatives. In fact, she hates the United States in its current form so much that her ultimate solution is to literally split it in two and give half to the Russians. All hale mother Russia, comrade Clee! Now why don't you move there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book. I especially liked Clee's keen grasp of recent history. I even learned a couple of things. Without giving anything away, I can say that the history courses I took (during the height of the cold war) never mentioned those particular Russian forts. If you are interested in recent social history or alternate history/time travel this book should interest you.

Hostage is about a girl named Kasey who walked in on her house being robbbed. She hid, but they soon found her. Scared of what to do they dragged her out of the house and took her with them. I believe this book's theme is to never give up, be brave, strong and patient durning rough times. Willo Davis Roberts wrote many other stories along with Hostage. She writes many books with alot of suspense just like this story. I figure this is just another book to add to her collection, althouh each book is different and unique in it's own way. Many things have been said about Willo's books such as \\"her suspense keeps me always intrested!\\" Willlo Davis Roberts books are open to a wide varity of audiences. Mostly for those who like to read books with alot of suspense and sometimes needing to come up with your own endings for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Book","review":"Memories of this book have been haunting me since I read it in the third grade.

I have finally found this creative book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awesome, by far the best book I ever read","review":"This book is really boring, the only reason I read this book is because my teacher made us do a book report. The first three pages were somewhat interesting then the fourth page made me sleepy. The one part that was exciting was where the main character was kidnapped by two robbers. If you want to read the most retarded book of your life, BUY THIS BOOK!!!The main character gets kidnapped because she was a naughty girl and snooping around while two robbers were trying steal precious values from her family and her snooping around in the middle of the night.

There's been about no character development. Even if its a book aimed at a younger crowd, thats still important. But mainly I dont like being preached at. That's fine I suppose if this book was on the shelf at my old catholic school library, or in a section of christian children's books, but not on the SciFi/Fantasy shelf at the bookstore.

And from a person nearly obsessed with dragons, well... the best part of the book for me was the birth of that one little dragon; it nearly made me cry. But the rest was lame. So lame.

Some themes began to pop up and I began to suspect that the author was Christian. About two-thirds of the way through when I read the part about ersatz I couldn't read any more. \\"...His truth, the only truth...\\" is a terrible concept to teach people, particularly the young and impressionable.

Not only that but I personally felt that the author was preaching at me the whole time. To be honest I didn't read the whole thing. I stopped at 38%. The reason *SPOILER* was because 2 of the main characters had just risked their lives saving a dragon that had been captured and tortured daily. They were going to use this dragon to help save another member of their party which had been kidnapped. Upon being set free the dragon killed the people who had killed her friends and tortured her.

For entire passages the main character (and therefore the reader) is lectured in the greatness of \\"wulder\\" - it made me skip entire pages. Many chapters became empty, suspenseless shells for the religious message. The space would have been better spent giving the characters some depth and keeping the story coherent.

But as it got into the whole Christian aspect, I really got bored. Although a Catholic, I felt that it was a bible lesson shoved into a poorly written story. Theres nothing wrong with that, although the plot lines could have been better, I did like Paul's descriptions of things. I felt as if the story was just thrown together at the last minute, and didn't enjoy this book. The characters could have used more description, and its quite pointless to have a map unless the characters travel across the whole area. I wouldn't recommend this book, only to those who wish to be bored out of their minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed christian overkill","review":"I SOOOOO wish I had read the reviews first. I had no idea this was christian propaganda disguised as a fantasy story. As I read it, I felt like the author was beating me over the head with a great big ol' christian stick. I understand allegory. This lame tale was tedious, preachy, overwrought and silly. It was allegory on steriods. And boring. Ditched it half way through and and plan to stay as far away as possible from the author's other \\"wholesome\\" pablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for children!","review":"My 11 year old son and I both enjoyed reading this book. It is the first of the series that we have read , but it will not be the last. My son wants to read more of them as soon as possible. It has very good moral lessons and christian meaning in it as well as enough adventure and action to keep you entertained. I would say this is for the age group of about 10-15 years old and no worries from parents about their children reading it. It does not have anything in it to be concerned about, actually quite the opposite. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting New Christian Fantasy","review":"Finally!! Some good Christian fantasy on the shelves. I was beginning to worry. :) In \\"Dragonspell,\\" Donita K. Paul combines her own creative world with real life truths that are touching and extremely relevant. It has a little more substance than a parable, but goes well along those lines. It took me a while to get into the book and start to see the parallel, but I soon caught on.I do hope there is a sequel. The pictures of baby dragons that pop into my head are adorable! And of Paul's own inventions, I think the kimen's were my favorite, especially Seezle. And Wizard Fenworth is very amusing. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":".....W-O-W.....just wow","review":"this was an AMAZING book full of adventures. by the end of the book i just instantly started to search if there is a series and i found it. i didnt buy the book but i checked it out from thelibrary. i have to hope that my library has the rest of the series:]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"I absolutely love this book and this series and this book!

Mrs. Paul has created an enchanting world with unique creatures and describes it well. The book follows the journey of former slave, Kale Allerion. Unbeknownst to her, she possesses many magcal abilities that qualify her to be the Dragon Keeper. Being the Dragon Keeper though, requires her to travel with various comrades to an evil wizard's castle and find a special dragon egg that could be used to destroy entire races. But after being attacked by countless times by several different monsters, causing problems by her lack of experience, traveling through dark tunnels and swamps, rescuing her friends, meeting an evil wizard and jumping from a cliff onto the back of a dragon, Kale decides that she hates questing. But her journey will not be over until she and her friends find and rescue the dragon egg from Risto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Spellbinding!","review":"What a delightful surprise!

It's an allegory and obviously contains symbolism which may or may not be missed by the younger reader, depending on their maturity. It is the story of Kale, an ordinary girl with unique gifts and her quest to her goal which simultaneously leads her to a better understanding of herself and her relationship with God.In the same vein as C.S. Lewis, the author weaves an interesting story with Divine symbolism which is an extension of the child's (and adult's) personal spiritual journey. Very well written. Clean read. No swearing.

The project was never built and the author explores the reasons why the original concept was never developed. The line was originally intended to extend north of the Missouri River, but there is little information about this in the document. Also, the document lacks maps which could have been used to illustrate the builder's concepts, and the existence of rival or competing rail lines. Also largely unmentioned is the political atmosphere in Missouri at the time of the 1870's and 1880's, including passage of a statewide Constitution the forbade governmental entities from getting directly involved in the financing of railroads.This document is also a monograph, similar to the type of document a college student would turn in as a research paper for an upper level history class.

Reading this tale one is transported back to what seems to us nostalgically as a simpler time. For a golf nut it is so much fun to relive those dramatic events. I would have given this book 5 stars except John Feinstein has demonstrated what a 5-star golf book is really like (The Majors, A Good Walk Spoiled). Sampson does not quite write with the same level of detail and insight as Feinstein, and lapses a bit more into the rehashing of familiar stories, but he is still quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some bad","review":"First the good - nice and heavy, heats evenly, good quality \\"feel\\".

Musical salvation for my starving soul!","review":"I don't know if words exist to describe the awesome power that is Robin Coomer's voice. She sings with such passion and intensity that even if she sung the ABC's it would become a deep and meaningful rock song. But she and the boys of Birdsaw go the extra mile and write songs that are often times haunting to me. I often think of Tori Amos when listening to their songs because they have that same beauty, simplicity and thought-provoking imagery in their lyrics. However, unlike Amos, they have a tougher edge to them and are much more rock than Amos is. They remind me of Pearl Jam. They are fantastic musicians. I love every song on this album. That is a huge rarity for me.

There is no sense a fulfillment, nor predestination. Just sadness.It is not easy to create a novel out of these ideas. The author managed it in Fortress in the Eye of time, but this time unfortunately there is no plot. Nothing really happens in this book. Absolutely nothing. Characters do not come to life. You never connect with them. The atmosphere is fascinating but the final effect is boring.A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very unusuall fairy book","review":"Remeber fairies? little girl like creatures with butterfly wings fluttering around ? Well, this book has fairies but they are nothing like the usuall way fairies are depicted.This book is the story of a family, a hero and a fairy who visits the families over the span of several decades. It is very interesting to see the mundane world of humans through the eyes of a fairy who watches them born, live, grow and die in what for is moments and for them is entire lifespans.A book written with a huge amount of a talent, the only thing i didn't like about this book was its pace. Only towards the end real \\"things\\", ie. a conflict arose. You couldn't help wandering when the action in the book started.If you don't mind a slow paced book, than this book merits a five star rating. For me, I prefer a little speedier actions, hence the four star rating I gave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming Tree Review","review":"I read these two stories originally in their separate volumes before DAW collected them together in one volume.As I rightly recalled, I still enjoyed this story and it does deserve to be a classic. The story takes place over a few generations, with the first couple passing by quickly so you don't get a chance to really know the characters.But in the second book, the last generation followed in this story, you do get to know the characters better.The reading can be slow, but the story is good. So you'll be disappointed if you're expecting a fast read and lots descriptions of action.And as another reviewer pointed out, there is a song written by Heather Alexander called \\"Arafel's Lament\\" that's based on this book.

The characters were not very convincing and I simply did not care about them or thier plight.Cherryh has a respectable reputation; however, I felt the book did not live up to the reputation and I was very disappointed in this book. This was the first book by Cherryh that I read, but I will try some of her other books.Don't judge this book by its cover--the cover is great, but the words inside are far less than that (IMHO)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece","review":"David Grossman's \\"Yellow Wind\\" is superb with a richness and texture to his writing that is honesta nd sincere.

In the book, he interviews Palestinians and Israelis whose voices had never been heard before in such a pure and ideologically-uncensored way. They speak of suffering, hopelessness, hate, hurt, revenge, pride and prejudice.

This series has proved me gratefully mistaken.We recieved four of the Wubbulous World DVDs as a gift; I had never seen the television show, so I had no idea what to expect. I was delighted that the shows provide thoughtful, educational themes while still maintaining the silly Seussian aesthetic. The visuals, the language, the plots and the pacing are all engaging for ages 4-8 (though my 3-yr-old, who knows the books, loves these videos too).I could provide more series details, but the quality of the four videos we have is remarkably even; I presume that all the discs in this series will be high-quality entertainment for your little Seuss fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current issues and enduring questions","review":"The book is just what I needed for class.

It went from being this charming, fun romantic comedy to a horror story. If you took the book and chopped off the last three fifths and burned it, then you could enjoy the first part and then make up the rest of the story yourself.Perhaps, if you like horror in your romance this sudden slide into horror would appeal, but in that case you might be impatient with the first part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"The premise has fantastic comedic potential. A goody-goody Tooth Fairy and a Bogey Man who's convinced he's dying as he begins to transform into all his darkest desires? An Easter Bunny uncle? Fairies living in such mundane places as farms and ranches in Texas and Oklahoma and losing money in the stock market? Such are the things that cracktastic gold is made from. I expected a truly zany romantic comedy based on the cover. Sadly, the romance read like nothing so much as Stockholm Syndrome (perhaps appropriate for a female lead named Belle; Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairy tale but it has its issues) while our intrepid heroine plays happy homemaker in her abductor's shack. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something","review":"It starts out as a fun, light fantasy-romance with a lot of promise. However, it turns into a confusing, twisted story of Good vs. Evil winding up in Hell. Way too many explanations are left out...how did he finally lose the wings??? Was an entire chapter accidently cut? Is the reader supposed to fill in the blanks? The ending just doesn't live up to the fun of the beginning. I think the author just has to pick a genre and stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll look back with Wonder too!","review":"You can't help but interject yourself Kevin's life. He is so relatable. Also with the narration it makes us think of our own glory days of youth and the important people in our lives. The first kiss. First experience with someone dying. The intrigue of sex ed. Our best friend and knowing everything about that person. Nagging brother or sister. Fighting parents who loved each other and us. The popular music that defined the era we grew up in. I'm sure there are special songs that conjure up powerful images from your past just as the special songs from the Wonder Years does the same for each episode.With the narration of the young Kevin and the 60s setting it reminds me of the movie Christmas Story. The Messy Marvin actor and the narration of his thoughts/dreams of the Red Ryder bb gun. Another classic! But I digres . . .You have to see this first volume of Wonder Years! It will tug at your heart strings again! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"12 OF MORTON'S BEST SOLOS, ALBEIT SHORT ON TIME","review":"Morton recorded these piano solos in December 1939, and ten sides were issued, on the General, Commodore and Vogue label. This compilation presents those ten sides, plus Sporting House Rag (which unaccountably was rejected originally) and an earlier alternate take of The Naked Dance which varies considerably from the issued version. Morton sings on five of the later sides, and his voice is as instantly recognisable as his piano style. This is of course the CD equivalent of the Commodore LP, and at just over half-an-hour playing time, falls well short of what a CD should offer. Nevertheless, these are some of Morton's best recorded solos, and his playing fully justifies 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...","review":"While it doesn't dishonestly advertise being a documentary, it offers little. The soundtrack, of course, is great. Keep some Dramamine handy, though...the effects, such as they are, are both dizzying and superfluous.If it is actual footage of Django you seek, as little as there is, all known footage can be found on the \\"Swing Guitar\\" DVD, a far superior endeavor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute waste of money","review":"this has ZERO footage of Django and is a lousy montage of rubbish. I wish i could get my money back.Better off buying Julian Bream's \\" My Life in Music \\" to see not only the great maestro Bream but it also contains a nice segment of ACTUAL Django footage, a huge inspiration in Julian's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this first","review":"Once played you will not keep going back.This is a reasonable documentary spoiled by graphic effects. The DVD has no chapters to go to and you can't even jump to a specific time. All you can do is fast forward it, just like a video tape, and this DVD runs for almost two hours! There is no film footage of Django, but you do get a C.D. as a bonus. The DVD to get is \\"Django Reinhardt - Swing Guitar [DVD] [2006] \\", this is the one with all the known film footage of Django."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"I have not finished reading it yet,but it does hold my interest and believe this is at least as possible as any of the world religion's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Projections of Astral Travel","review":"This book is well developed and follows a nice sequence of events to help explain the material. When reading this book, I was unsure at times if I was reading a fiction, Sci-fi or a manual. Many of the events that supposedly took place in Mr. Buhlam's Astral Projections seem at best unreasonable and stemmed together as a fitting conclusion to whichever dreams or projections that he may have encountered. Obviously, I cannot attest to whether Mr. Buhlman actually had the projections or if he pieced thoughts together in order to make a better book, but either way, this book is entertaining and follows interesting concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book!","review":"I came across this book in late 1996. Before that, I had an interest in OBE's, but did not have any (consciously), for about 10 years. I started having conscious OBE's within days of finishing this book, and have had hundreds since. This was my first book on OBE's, and I've read several since. This one is still my favorite. One piece of advice for those who may read this book: if you don't have a keen interest in science (or the TV show 'Sliders'), you may wish to skip Chapter 3 :-)Thank you, Mr. Buhlman, for an excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Journal","review":"I liked how the author kept a journal and added it in the book, so the readers know how long between each time he had the experiences. It gives the idea of where you are at and know that their are times when it does not happen. But their are places on the web that teach these things for free if you search Google. The audios that some use do not work for me and I had more questions about it at first. Like, Do I go to sleep first or stay awake while laying down totaly relaxed before I move out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"I throughly enjoyed Buhlmans stories of his outer body experience. How true? Dont know havent had an out of body yet. But stay focused any hopefully it will come. But back to the book. Like I said very interesting stuff. But part two \\"Solving our greatest mysteries\\". All I can say is WOW! Now there is two ways you can think of this,Buhlman is out in the twlight zone or Buhlman did some studying and really knows what the heck he's talking about.I believe it is the latter. He got diagrams,pictures definitions,Scientific evidence including findings from the great scholars of the past and has put together one of the best reads of the seven dimensions and what comes after death and,.. well its just alot of info. Almost overwhelming.The conclusion gives you some advice and tips on how to begin your astral projections. How to focus when to do it what to do. If you can get past part two without losing touch and focus,it is a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book puts into words, what I could not.","review":"I had questions in regards to physics, spirituality, and dreams. I find these topics combined in this book. The beautiful descriptions of dimensions are areas wonderfully written. I know it is extremely accurate, because I have been there. William Buhlman is a true teacher who has brought light and wisdom upon this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening, Eye-Opening, Easy to Understand","review":"I found this book while doing a research project on Out-of-Body travel/astral projection. Out of all the material I went through, Buhlman definately was the most down to Earth and the most interested in helping people acheive their own personal enlightenment. I found Monroe's books to be a little self-absorbed (however interesting) and I found that they didn't provide much guidance. Buhlman presents several techniques which, I think, aim to accomodate a wide variety of different approaches to the subject. *applause* I recommend this book to any open-minded individual. I especially liked how Buhlman did not verify or deny any religious view but left the experience open to whoever was willing to try--no matter of their spiritual beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of all on the subject of OBE's","review":"I've read several books on the subject,and have been having OBE's now for a year.I started reading about them,in order to induce them with more regularity,and more control during.I found Mr Buhlmans book superior to every other book I've read,but the D Scott Rogo comes close.Buhlmans advice on how to control the experience by asking for clarity,and even asking for help never occured to me,before.My OBE's have taken a sharp improvement in their frequency and duration. I strongly reccomend this book and the D.Scott Rogo book.(to a lesser extent).You dont need to read any other books,than the 2 of them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven sent","review":"This book was written for me and it came at a time when I needed it the most.I had been suffering from OBE attacks (I called them) since 1994 and didn't even know what it was. I went to see everybody, from the doctor, to the priest, to the spiritual healer etc., they couldn't understand me. I prayed to God for any other human problem - but please, stop these spontaneous OBE's from happening....! Because I had no knowledge about it, it was frightening. Most night's were like Freddy Kruger's Nightmare on Elm St. (Fall asleep and it's BOUND to happen). I was desperate. Until I found this book....., IN AN OBE!So much has happened since then and now that I understand it, I pray that it never stops.I've bought 3 copies for friends, and my sister whom I live with also has her own copy.It is definitely the book of all OBE books, easy to understand and very well guided. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetitive But Highly Recommended","review":"The bad: (1) very repetitive. (2) puts journal entries in there that are NO WAY actual entries... it's as if he just needed a way to mix up the otherwise rather dull text. (3) states things as fact a bit much... no discussion about, say, maybe these experiences are just lucid dreams with excellent recall? (For me that would be useful discussion, perhaps not for others).The good: if you want to have an OBE or lucid dream, he gives a zillion different things to try: more suggestions of techniques than I've seen in any other single book... (not that I've read them all, mind you). For this reason, it's highly recommended: let's face it: you're probably looking for a book that will help you have an OBE... I think this book will help you in that pursuit more than probably just about any other single book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special Favorite","review":"In my library are a great number of obe books I've read over the years. The top tier are the writings of Robert Monroe, Robert Bruce, William Buhlman and perhaps Robert Peterson.This title by Buhlman is a very worthy read and for some reason I enjoyed it even more than his second. It's one of those books that causes you to return for another reading at a later date or to cross check something you read by another author. My best to Mr. Buhlman for sharing with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures Beyond the Body","review":"I was having spontaneous Out-of-Body Experiences and I didn't know what to think of them. Buhlman's work provided a guide map for me. This book taught me what the experiences were, how to navigate while out of body, and how to increase the frequency of self initiated OBEs. I've also attended a workshop by Mr. Buhlman and his hands on teaching was extremely beneficial. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had an OBE or who is curious about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read on OBEs","review":"This is the best book I've ever read on OBE's. Clear, straightforward, informative, thorough. Bar none, this is a must read. The only thing I take issue with is William Buhlman's wanting to account for almost everything in religion and spirituality as having to do with OBEs. He almost makes a religion out of OBEs--albeit a do it yourself one. That attitude aside, his approach is, like many others in the OBE field, \\"find out for yourself.\\" And he gives clear instructions on how to do so. Read it. Keep it for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"How real are heaven and hell?","review":"Buhlman gives great advice to anyone wanting to experience an OBE. The techniques he uses are more useful and less tedious than ones described in some How-To books. And believe me, if you are interested in making your own decisions about life after death, read this book and Robert Monroe's 'Ultimate Journey'. Evaluating and comparing the journeys of these two men will undoubtedly give a seeker of truth something to think about. Though their experiences were not identical (which one wouldn't expect), the similarities are amazing. Both books definitely make the point that thought is powerful and what you think does manifest into form. Be careful what you wish for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"This book is the best. I also like his lecture on astral projection; out of body experiences on video cassett. You could go to the world wide web and look up astral projection and look for it. I forgot what web page it was on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenlightening, misleading and misguided","review":"This awful and pretentious little book combines a rehash of methods taken from more knowledgeable authors along with a plethora of shallow pontifications about spiritual development and the meaning of life. (We are all put on this planet to learn something. What a strikingly original idea!) The methods are as unoriginal as the claims are unbelievable. More than simply being a waste of time and money, this piece of junk demeans a serious subject and turns it into a profitable joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would call it a Novel","review":"I was out of my mind, not out of my body, after reading this book because it just don't deliver what it promises, even after i tried the techniques repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrost astral projection book, misleading!","review":"First of all, author is a amateur in astral projection. Full of self-proclaim experience and tended to mislead readers. When I got my out of body experience, do I claim myself expert in this? Second of all, the real out of body experience, not necessary involves vibrations. Most of out of body, you just exit naturally with no vibrations. Totally wrong information about out of body and astral projection. I do suggest author to read more other out of body books before claiming himself expert in this field, would be a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The irresponsible Mr. Buhlman has taken a complex, controversial subject matter, in a manifestly misguided attempt to enlighten his reader, and illogically renders it the pathway to elevated consciousness and experience. This clearly is a misdeed. No matter how skilled the reader may be, dangerous results await. It's clear that guidance to OBE's is best undertaken with thoughtful, well-reasoned knowledge provided by skilled practitioners. Clearly, this author should not be the first choice, or even second. One wonders if the author's real intent was to guide his reader into profound ways of thinking or just to manufacture a little cottage industry to line his own pockets. I know I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total wrong information about astral projection.","review":"Oh, my god. I do not even know where to begin, the author has no idea about astral projection. All these misleading information about this subject, author think astral projection is not possible in reality but in your dream stage, and author think you can total astral project while you are awake in your physical body. The book is a joke, don't buy it, you will be fooled just like me, this book end up in trash can.A TOTAL DISASTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working.","review":"Bought this book because its fame,regret it every minute. It is the same book like the \\"Astral Dynamic\\" total waste of time and money. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Astral Travel Bible!","review":"Being interested in the occult, life after death and related matters for years, and after wasting much time (and money) on at least a dozen other books about OOBE's, I finally found this brilliant work. Buhlman's descriptions are so easy to read....I felt as if one of my friends was sitting there teaching the subject to me, totally unlike many of the other pretentious, self-absorbed works that are available.You don't have to read the entire book to know that Buhlman is correct. Many of the initial phases of an OOBE will be so familiar to experiences that most people have already had that your doubts will be quickly dispelled.I cannot speak too highly of this book, and I can guarantee you that, if you follow the methods listed, this book will have a more profound effect upon you than anything else you've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"This is a practical book for the aspirant out-of-body adventurer. William Buhlmanlists clearly and precisely the exercises which are a prelude to taking off on other-dimensionaltravel. Even his illustrative diagrams are easily understood. Many people give affirmationsbut Buhlman takes the prize for clarity, succinctness and relevance. He writes for an audience as intelligent and practical as (I imagine) he is.Ann Grocott"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW.","review":"Yes, WOW. This is definitely one of the best books (top 3 for sure) out there for people wanting to learn about OBEs. It's not too long, relatively simple, and very easy to read.It's an extremely good mix of personal experience and techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read on the subject","review":"I have read many books on the subject of OBE's and I have been practicing for 12 years. Bill Buhlman's book is the most practical and useful book I have read on the subject. New comers and experienced individuals will find a wealth of practical information and very specific exercises. I keep this book on my bedside and reread frequently some of the chapters to get my mind focused on my night travels. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first book into out of body","review":"Short and sweet! This was my first book concerning this subject. By simply opening one's mind to the subject it usually induces itself. For instance, I have spoken about my experiences to personal friends and family, and they have had an OBE shortly there after. This book definitely calmed many of my fears, and helped me become better at OBE's. This book is a must for anyone interested in OBE's. If you are a skeptic, simply experiment for yourself, this book yields a wealth of info for your experimenting pleasure. I would highly recommend an open mind and Robert Monroe's 3 books on the subject. Also check out the Robert Monroe institute. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This book is perhaps the best on the subject.

It definitely takes the \\"hooey\\" out of Astral Travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting read","review":"Had me remembering the \\"Seth Material\\" books, put together by Jane Roberts and her husband in the 70's. Life changing reads... Mr. Buhman's book was very interesting and I look foward to trying some of his excersises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures Beyond the body:How to Experience Out-of-Body Travel","review":"So far I've enjoyed the book. I find the technical science tedium, but supppose it serves its purpose and imagine many left brained persons would find it useful. I like reading about the author's experiences, which provide perspectives I had not considered. This is my first astral projection book, and believe that as for educating myself on the topic, this book is providing as much as I had hoped for, though its not so comprehensive that I won't look elsewhere for further informtaion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird","review":"I actually don't even remember purchasing this book....Wish I could leave a review, but I haven't read it.Therefore, I will give it a review based on the cover and title... the cover is a bit cheesy and seems too new age for my taste, but I am always interested in personal accounts of happenings science can't explain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make you think about far away.","review":"Of all the OOBE books, this has got to be up with the best. Mr. Monroe's book plus this one will make all libraries first class in OOBE. You will learn something about which way the universe opens up. It is inward, a long long way inward. I will make you question and expect a lot of poopooing from others. He has a nice web page too. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I was already disappointed with the manual that comes with the game: They tell you that the technical reference is too extensive and plug you to buy the Prima Strategy book which I unfortunately did. It is partly a strategy guide and partly a technical supplement. More strategy guide than otherwise. I was hoping there would be a good description with tips on how to use the various functions in the game. What was most disappointing was that the icons in the building screen (one of the most important features in the game) are not described either in the manual or the strategy book. The book does give a description of each technical advancement and there is a chart at the end of the book. If you do think about getting this book look at it first. One thing to mention: The documentation might be lacking but the game is FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book keeps my patients sober.","review":"I have been using these exercises for years and they keep my patients sober. The patients take the book home and go over the material they learned in treatment. This keeps them sober. Most treatment centers use a collection of poor exercies they gathered over the years.

Only 3 smelled at all (brown, black, and the darker red. Only the black (licorice) smelled enough that you could smell without touching to your nose and sniffing so hard it hurt. So, they are markers, not scented. It is probably not possible to make a good set of scented washable markers. I needed markers anyway and wasn't willing to get non-washables yet, so I gave these a try. I'm not really too disappointed since I kinda thought the smell wouldn't be too great. They were worse than I expected though and I though I would write a review so the rest of you would know they are essentially regular, non-scented markers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fainted scent","review":"The markers work fine for markers, but I was specifically looking for scented markers. My son was thrilled to get these, but very disappointed that they barely smelled when you put it to your nose, and not at all when on paper. He was very disappointed because the scented markers at our children's church are very smelly! Thought these were the same ones, but it is obviously a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"engaging performers with so-so material","review":"As a fan of British comedy, I was looking forward to watching this series. Having done so, I come away disappointed. The engaging young performers here are hamstrung with some mediocre material. You'll find scene after scene of comic actors not playing the top of their intelligence, and consequently reacting the way no person would ever react. This is comedy writing which would believe that contradiction is the ultimate comedic feat. It is not, and Man Stroke Woman suffers from a dearth of truly funny sketches. Sometimes the situation is nominally funny, but we're asked to watch the characters dealing with it and each other with minimal amounts of insight. Not particularly funny. I would recommend Mr. Show over this. Too bad, because the performers themselves are quite likeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC !!!","review":"I ordered this DVD 2 months ago, mainly because I am such a fan of the show and particularly of \\"Trainer Bob.\\" Having him \\"in my living room\\" on a daily basis is the best gift I could've given myself. He is very inspirational and is with you step-by-step. I also like the fact that \\"real\\" people are working out along with you instead of Barbie cutouts.I like the pace of the workout; he gets your heart rate up and keeps it there. But it's not so challenging that you want to turn it off. YOU WILL SWEAT - make no mistake! But I feel SO good after it's over, that I carry that pride with me for the rest of the day. The warmup is simple and to the point, and the cool down is relaxing. Good job, Biggest Loser DVD! I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as any","review":"The show is great, this video is not.

My two teenage, fit daughters did it with me. I am age 50 and 35 pounds overweight. We all HATED IT!! The \\"music\\" was terrible, what you could hear of it. The exercisers were doing the repetitive motions at all different speeds, while the \\"trainer\\" Bob sometimes modeled the actions for you. The rest of the time he harangued the other exercisers and the audience. If you would like to have at least a little fun while working out GO ELSEWHERE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring","review":"I found the workouts to be really repetitive. There are very few kinds of movements, you just do the same things over and over again. I found it boring, and not very challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Keeper","review":"This DVD has 5 different programs. You get 2 cardio segments 20 minutes a piece, a weights segment also 20 minutes, a bootcamp segment also 20 minutes, and a stretch segment which is only 10 minutes. The workouts are actually pretty challenging. The quality of the workouts are good, but there are a couple of reasons why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. This is very high impact. If you have joint problems this is not the DVD for you. There is ALOT of jumping. Also, this must have been recorded before the finale because the cast of former contestants were visibly unable to keep up on some of the exercises. Also, sometimes they would be going at a different pace, or be on a different foot, than Bob the trainer. These things can be pretty distracting. The versatility of this DVD is a big selling point. You can choose just one segment, or you can mix & match. Its really very user friendly. So, for the intensity of the workouts & the versatility of this DVD I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never watched the show","review":"Somebody gave me this workout, and it is really working, I ve lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks. 5x a week. I am 60 years young and this workout definetly makes you work. All the people whom are whining in the reviews are people who will never lose their weight, I ve seen it over and over,, They whine about this,whine about that, something is not perfect, so they stay 50 lbs overweight because they can never find the \\"perfect workout\\" Then, you have the exercise freaks who have been working out for years and are in great shape, whining that the workout is too easy.. Remember who this DVD is made for \\"Average, overweight, couch potatoes. In sum, a great exercise workout that will get you where you want to go, if you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended!","review":"I love this DVD and am currently working through the 6 week program. I love that there are real people doing the workouts and not these gorgeous super-humans on other DVD's who seem like robots. The contestants struggle, joke around and talk during the workouts, which encourages me to keep going.The only problem I have with this DVD is the amount of time it takes! With the six week program, one session can take almost an hour because of the warm up and cool down sessions. Sometimes I just do not feel like I have an hour to devote to exercising, so I get discouraged for that day and end up not doing any physical activity. I think you can get a great workout in 10 or 15 minutes, and sometimes that's all I can do! If you are one of those people, this DVD probably isn't for you. But if you want to devote some extra time, check it out! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough workout-- just awkward at times","review":"My husband and I did this workout for the first time and we were begging for mercy! It definitely makes you sweat and keeps that heart rate up. The biggest negative is that it's really hard to stay on beat. I have a sense of rhythm from years of dance class and I had to count out loud in order to follow the moves. The music doesn't have a steady beat and Bob's moves are on the off beat, so it's a bit tricky. But, besides looking like a fool every once in a while, it's a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a start, then....","review":"Nice workout if your are new or have not been into fitness for a while. Then my weight loss group moved on to the book:Weight Training Workouts and Diet Plan that Work.In 7 weeks everybody(14 people) has seen major improvements in our body compositions. Weight loss and muscle definitionGet started people! They work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, but somewhat hard to follow","review":"This is a HARD workout. Both in a good way and in a bad way. First of all, since you are watching the participants from the TV Show along with the trainer, it can sometimes be difficult to follow along (because everyone is going at his or her own pace). Be aware that there will be jumping jacks and/or running in place, so if you have trouble with your knees or do not want to be jumping, keep this in mind before you purchase this DVD.On the positive side, though, I love that you can \\"customize\\" what order you would like to do your workouts (you get to choose from the 6 or 7 options at the beginning of the DVD and then you don't have to worry about anything once you press Play). Also, these are difficult workouts...so if you stick with it, you will definitely see results!I would recommend it to anyone who loves the show and really wants a good workout. If you are not easily distracted by everyone working out at a different speed, you will enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Workout!","review":"I purchased this workout DVD on the recommendation of my sister. She was right on when she told me it was a good workout. I sweat big time and yet find it uncomplicated and easy to follow. I am not the most coordinated person in the world so doing lots of fancy combos on aerobic workouts doesn't work for me. This was straightforward, got my heart rate up, and as I said, I sweat.The only thing I wish they would improve is the music. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. Its practically non-existent and mostly you just hear Bob talking. I like Bob, he's goofy, but I really like music when I work out. So I just turn down the sound on my TV and put on my own music mix sometimes.Oh, the other thing I like about this video is that they are real people exercising and they haven't all reached their goal weight. They struggle with the workout just like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I like this DVD because it lets you select which workout you want to do. I exercise regularly and still think the tape is quite challenging. Not for those just starting out but it is a great workout that is fun to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEEL THE BURN!","review":"I just received this DVD and have done the first workout- warmup, low-intensity, cool down. I was in the military for three years and got out just over a year ago and began to lose my svelte figure. I am very athletic and thought the forst workout would be \\"easy\\". Well, two days later I'm still sore! It was great fun, really got my heart rate up and made me sweat! Bob is soo encouraging, albeit a little cheesy. My only complaint is that the demonstrators can't stay in time with the music, Bob, or eachother, so it's easy to get distracted and mess up. Other than that they're great! I highly reccomend this to exercisers of all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.. .But what is UP with the \\"6 Week\\" workout that only covers 4 weeks?!","review":"I really like this dvd overall.

My BMI has gone from 28+ to 26.9 in those three weeks--thanks in large part to the dvd and the show.My only question is a big one: what is up with the 6 week plan with the 4 different workouts? Am I the only one who doesn't see how this is a six week workout? It says \\"Weeks 1-3 alternate workouts #1 +# 3\\" and \\"Weeks 2-4\\" alternate workouts #2 + #4.\\"Seriously, can anyone make sense of this?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!!!","review":"this is an absolutely great tape. it's perfect for people like me who are just starting. i prefer the high intensity than the low because you start to burn fast. the body sculpt section not only tones your body, but makes the water pour out of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD for on the road","review":"Bought this video at the same time as the Biggest Winner exercise set. This video has four workouts on a single DVD so one can do the Cardio workouts while on the road and save the weights for at home. The workouts include warmups and cooldowns and get the heart rate up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SWEATFUL WORKOUT!!!","review":"I FOUND THIS WORKOUT EJOYABLE, HELPFUL, AND EASY TO USE.

By far the best workout I have ever had..I have tried a lot of workout videos. The first week I had the video, I did the beginner workout 3x that week and lost 4 lbs. I highly recommend this video!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for anyone!","review":"Ever get tired of watching the super buff do a video that is supposed to be for beginners? Then this is the video for you! Your favorite \\"Biggest Losers\\" from Season 1 & 2 are the people you are exercising with. Along with Bob, the trainer, you go through the exercises. They sweat, they grunt, and they even complain. That is real life and that is why this is both powerful and effective. I know I enjoyed working out to this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout DVD","review":"The Biggest Loser Workout DVD is awesome. I could not believe the workout that I received. It is real easy to follow, and lets you customize your own workouts. I felt like I was on the Biggest Loser Ranch, even though I was at home in my Living Room. I have started to shape up as well because of this DVD.Thank you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Loser Workout DVD","review":"I love this workout video. Bob Harper is the best, he makes all the workouts seem so easy. I wish I could afford him one on one. But I have the DVD and the way it was shot it is like he is in the room with you. So you can say I LOVE THIS DVD and Bob Harper.Thank youJulia C. Anderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for starters!","review":"The 6 week custom workout program is the best thing about this DVD. It really makes you feel like you are getting a personal trainer at your finger tips and you have no doubt what you need to do for 6 weeks. Bob Harper is great on the eyes and makes an excellent cheerleader to keep someone motivated. This exericse DVD is not stiff or uptight but very informal and yet challenging. Great to do when you don't have enough time for a gym workout. Highly recommend it for beginner's and intermediate level exercisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Loser Workout","review":"It was hard to follow. The music didn't follow the workout at all. It just wasn't what I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Jillian is Better","review":"After working out for 3 weeks to Jillian's 30 Day Shred; I found this video in my local library and thought I'd give it a try. As much as the show was touted it would be a good change....RIGHT. I was disappointed, thankfully I rented this DVD.I only made it as far as the Sculpting Workout. What a laugh. There are no compound moves....nothing. It is so easy. I never even broke a sweat. After that I didn't pursue it any further; I returned the DVD. Jillian's 30 Day Shred it so much better: you will break a sweat, you will feel the burn and start to see the difference. Thank god I only rented this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I only tried the warm-up and the Low Cardio workout. You could hardly hear the background music, but it didn't matter because there is no rhythm at all to the exercises they are doing. I consider myself to be seasoned at working out to aerobics, and I have to have a beat, and a rhythm. Everyone was doing their own thing, and I thought I'd be able to follow Bob, but he just mainly walked around and did not lead. I was extremely disappointed and will most likely return the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard On The Knees!!!!","review":"I bought this workout for my husband. He said that he doesn't like it because its too much stress on his knees (lunges, jumping). I'm glad I'm able to return it. Beware if you have bad knees, even if you don't, be careful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob's boot camp workout is my favorite","review":"I have had this dvd for a while now and have done every workout at least once. At present, I use this dvd for one purpose only: Bob's boot camp workout. I love the intense workout he leads--the exercises are fantastic and he is very likable and very motivating. If I can complete Bob's boot camp, I know that I am in shape. I do not like the long warm-up and cool down portions of this dvd and thus just do those on my own (I use Jillian's warm-up from 30 Day Shred and Jackie's cool down from Power Circuit Training)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the biggest loser","review":"while this is a good excercise, it is very hard on old knees. I had to quit after 6 days as my knees were so sore that they wolud barely bend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all levels","review":"I love this workout video! It isn't for those who want the perfectly fit models in the background smiling and not sweating one drop! These are real people who stop when you feel like stopping, they don't do the workout perfectly but that is alright! It motivates you as you get stronger and better to see how much you've improved. It doesn't intimidate you. Bob is personable and fun and seems to see right through the screen! I enjoy this video because its real. There have been videos with better music, moves and the like, but this one has something that keeps me motivated and that is the key!If you're looking for something that will encourage you to continue, this is the workout video for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would have thought?","review":"Although I usually work out at a gym, I still buy work out DVDs for the days I cant make it.With that said, at the gym, I lift about 20 pounds. So, when Bob was working with the free weights, I only had 5 pounds available. I thought, there is no way I am going to get a good work out with 5 pound weight! Boy, was I WRONG! After I was finished, I was more sore using the 5 pound weights than the 20 I am used to lifting at the gym!This is an awesome work out! Yes, it does get confusing at times, but it was well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is byfar the best workout DVD I have purchased. It includes 6 workouts:warm-up (5 minutes), low intensity cardio (20 min.), high intensity cardio (20 min.), strenght & sculpt (20 min.), boot camp (20 min.), and a cool down (20 min.). You only need weights for the strength & sculpt workout, and you can choose to use them in the bootcamp workout if you want to challenge yourself. You can choose to follow a 6 week workout plan or you can customize your workout!The contestants are actually overweight & have a hard time keeping up at times which is a great difference from other workout dvds where they are already slim & don't struggle during the workout routine. Overall a great DVD!!Will definately recommend!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GONNA BURN","review":"THIS WAS THE BEST WORKOUT I'VE EVER HAD IT REALLY MAKES YOU WANT TO GET UP AND MOVE. AND IT DOSENT HURT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WATCHING AND WORKING OUT WITH ARE ALSO OVER WEIGHT AND STRUGGLING JUST AS HARD AS YOU ARE. I RECOMMEND THIS WORKOUT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GET INTO SHAPE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Inspiring Video","review":"I purchased this last week and have viewed the entire DVD. It is amazing. Simply put..the best workout video I have ever owned. The routines are simple, yet challenging. You will feel that you have accomplished something when your done. Unlike most workout DVDs this one does not have complicated steps to follow, it is very straight forward. I will throw away all of my other workout videos. Bob makes you feel that you can accomplish anything. I cannot wait to see the results after trying the 6 week challenge. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who needs inspiration and wants to see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for your buck!","review":"This video is a great way to fit a fairly intense and beneficial workout into your busy day. The option of choosing a custom workout along with the fact that they are each in 20 minute increments is such a plus. I choose the high intensity cardio along with either the strength & sculpt or the boot camp. This gives me 40 minutes of what the experts recommend that we as humans should be taking on in our daily schedules for a healthy heart, body and mind. Bob Harper is a joy and the past \\"Losers\\" are an example of the greater realm of this country who are not perfect looking, but perfectly heatlthy.This video is a must. Just look at the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best DVD out of them all","review":"I bought this DVD years ago and continue to use it at leat twice a week. Both the cardio and the bootcamp workouts are solid. Also, there is extra care given to stretching before and after workouts. Sadly, this isn't often found in workout DVDs and is a blessing when you find a workout that has great warmups and cooldowns.I have no idea why all the other Biggest Loser workouts weren't done with the same high quality this one was. I really wish they had been."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I have tried many different exercise videos in the over 20 years I have been fighting my weight. I love this one. The moves are simple but put in the right perspective to get your heart rate up and get you moving. Anyone of any weight could do these and succeed. My 9 year old son fights with his weight and he comes and gets me every morning asking if we can do the Mr. Bob tape. Thank you for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Loser Workout, Vol. 1","review":"I really like the workout, but the audio portion doesn't seem quite right. The music on mine is just a small loop of a few bars of music and when I increase the volume on my TV the volume stays the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out","review":"Great work out for anyone. It took me a while, but i built up the strength to finish the work out, in about a week of taking it slow, i could keep up.Many levels. Easy to use and pick the work outs.Don't give up. If u can only do 5 min., be glad.You will be able to finish it when your body is ready too.I was a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Workout","review":"First, I have to say the actual exercises are good and should be done about 4-5 times a week for results. Other than that, it's not the best I've seen, but I knew what to expect so I did get quite a lot of use out of this. I've done many workout dvds, and this falls short of some of the other workouts out there. The warm up is choppy with no real flow, and the low intensity aerobics is a hodge podge and not a whole lot of fun.I have recently started doing Kundalini Yoga (Fat Free Yoga with Ana & Ravi along with Soul Sweat with Chantal and Dance the Chakras Yoga workout with Ana & Ravi) I recommend you also add some Kundalini Yoga for its effects on the metabolism and it feels like less hard work as well. I am actually getting faster results in terms of weight loss and fun!As far as this Biggest Loser Workout I recommend you keep your eyes on Gary. Gary works out the best. He's lost so much weight - I think it's because he looks and is more physical than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my new years resolution","review":"I have several workout video's/DVD's, etc. But this one is really different and fun. It's nice to workout with \\"real people\\" and not skinny mini professionals. It's fun to watch when Matt screws up in the routine and laughs about it. Some reviewers on this site said it was confusing, but I feel its easy to follow the verbal instructions of Bob Harper and you can go at your own pace. I have mainly put my own packages together with cardio and strenth training combos, which is great to be able to mix it up. Its probably most fun for those who are fans of the show (like me), but if you don't like typical workout videos this would be good to try as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Loser Workout DVD","review":"Great workout.

I hope there will be more volumes coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Workout","review":"The dvd is an awesome way to get started or continue to work out. You can choose the pace and intensity, which is great. Plus the trainer is so encouraging - it's like he is in the room with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for Everyone!!","review":"I received my Biggest Loser Workout two weeks ago, and it is FABULOUS. I am 36 and weigh more than most of the women on the show, but I have been able to complete the warm up, low intensity cardio, strength and sculpt, and cool-down every day. I have lost 10 pounds, and every day I feel stronger and more alive. And if the lunges hurt your knees, just don't go so deep. Bob is a great motivator, and seeing the fat contestants do this is proof that I can too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Loser Workout, Vol, 1","review":"I would reccommend this for anyone serious about getting in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"There are 4 workouts on this DVD that you can choose from- low impact, high impact, weight training, and Boot camp. There is also a warm up and a cool down segment. Since I am over 100 pounds overweight, I thought I should try the low impact, first. I was so exhausted from this workout that I could not do the cool down segment. However, because of all the squats and lunges in this segment, my knees are bothering me. So, if you have bad knees, beware. I really enjoy the weight training segment. It's short, yet effective. This DVD, also, has a segment with some of the contestants on it talking about their struggles and progress. They are always inspiring. I recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Loser Workout Video -- NOT A LOSER!!!!","review":"This is a great video. I purchased it for my extremely overweight husband and he loves it, though even the beginning workout is very difficult. I want you to know that the beginning workout was even hard on ME! I am not overweight at all, just out of shape from not much physical activity. I highly recommend this video, not only for overweight people but for anyone who wants to start getting into shape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Workout for Beginners","review":"I have been using the DVD and referencing the book for about three weeks now.

This is the first time that i have been able to finish a video and still be able to breath when we were done."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only","review":"This video is for beginners and was definitely not worth my money. I was bored out of my mind and I didn't even break a sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"This workout rocks!","review":"I was a bit nervous on buying this particular workout DVD at first. Like many other workout DVDs, I tried them a few times and they are now in the cabinet never to come out again. This workout on the other hand is exactly what I was looking for all along.Bob Harper is a natural and it is great to see the actual participants from the show in the workout DVD. What an inspiration they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Loser CD Easy to Use","review":"I love the Biggest Loser Exercise CD. It is easy to use no matter what my exercise goal for the day, week or month is. I like being able to customize workouts. Lets face it we don't always have 45 minutes to workout. The workouts are taylored to my needs and allow for changes in my strength and flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"The Biggest Loser workout DVD is a good one. It has several workouts to choose from, although I've only done the warm-up and low-impact workout with trainer, Bob. I find it a little hard to stay with the music, because it's hard to hear the music over Bob talking. I think there's an option to use music only, though. I would caution, however, to think twice about buying this if you have knee problems. Bob includes LOTS of lunges and some squats and I am having some knee pain. Maybe my form is just wrong, I'm not sure. I am happy with my purchase, though. It's a good way to get your cardio in on a cold winter day when you can't get outdoors to exercise. I'm sure my heart is thanking me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout","review":"I'm glad that I downloaded this inexpensive workout. It's fun. I fastforward through the beginning and ending stretching since it is too long and a bit boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a great 20 minute workout this dvd is for you!","review":"This is one of the better dvds from the Biggest Loser workout series. There are 4 to 5 different workouts on the dvd and you can do 1 or add on more... My favorite of the workouts is the second one titled: Advanced... It's really a great little workout! Bob has you warm up and then takes you into an incredible circuit workout incorporating lower and upper body moves and a great aerobic workout too! The contestants that work out with him are a riot! You actually feel like your working out with Bob and the contestants as you huff and puff and laugh along... If you're trying to get back into exercising or if you're looking for a new dvd to add to your collection, I highly recommend this workout! Fast, fun and effective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout for Beginners!","review":"In the last fifteen years, I haven't done much in the way of exercise, so when I decided to buy this DVD, I was a bit worried that it might be more than I could handle.But it's been great. There's a nice variety of workouts; the cardio really gets me sweating and the strength workouts have my muscles hollering at me for a couple days. I like Bob (the trainer) and he provides just enough motivation to make me want to keep at it. I like the fact that the participants on the video are former Biggest Loser contestants and you can see that they sometimes struggle with the workouts, just like I do! Makes them a little more relatable, I think!I'm only in my second week with this DVD, but I'm definitely glad that I bought it and will continue using it to further my weightloss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I just started this today. I'm not really a beginner to working out but it's been awhile since my last good workout so I did the low cardio option. Let me tell you, that had me sweating rather well by the end. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"This has become one of my staple workout videos. I love the fact that you can mix and match your workouts to make them right for you. I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser, though I had never really bothered with weight training before using this DVD. That said, I found that all segments of the workout provided enough challenge (sometimes more than enough!) for me. I also liked Bob, the trainer's style. He was upbeat without being completely annoying. On the downside, since they used 'real people' to do the workouts, not everyone is doing the exercises at the same time, which sometimes threw my timing off as well. Still, it is kind of nice to see that it isn't just me who messes up at times. Gotta keep it real! I also thought the inspirational stories were a nice touch. It helps to see those kind of things to stay motivated. All in all, well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Remember","review":"I really like this product, but if you plan on loosing weight on it alone i would check another route. After all on the TV show they didn't juct workout in front of a tv, they ran, walked, tredmilled, elipticaled, and so on along with it. just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is going to be great!!!!","review":"I just received the DVD yesterday and did the first workout last night. Wow! I felt the burn but enjoyed every minute of it. Bob was inspiring and the rest of the contestants on the DVD were great!I really feel as if this is going to get me out of my exercise slump. I was so excited that I got up this morning and did some more.I have more than 50 pounds to lose and I'm hopeful that this DVD will help me reach my goal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!!!","review":"I have many of the Biggest Loser DVD's and this is by far my fave. I completed all six weeks of the Weight Loss Yoga and The Bootcamp. I decided to give this a try based on the other reviews I read. Bob definitely come through on this as with all the others. Right off you are working up a sweat, and ready to fall out by the end! I love the kickboxing feel to this one, and being a single mom with a very busy schedule, the flexibility is a great bonus. You can choose to work out as long and hard as you want! I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to get in shape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"It's a filter. Simple as that. I purchased this item on amazon because it was 5 or 6 bucks cheaper than the auto parts store. Prime made it better.

The sides of the filter could be a little firmer, but all in all it was still a good fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have two toddlers (2 & 3), this book provided practical advice that really impacted the way my husband and I parent.

Then I'm annoyed at how the hero Alex Plumtree acts around his secret love, Sarah. He's pathetic. Then I'm annoyed by the slow tempo, again.

I appreciated being let in to his world even though it's through his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flair is the man!","review":"There seems to be a pattern to wrestler autobiographies. They slightly deal into the bad side of their lives and then point to their changed ways and how they want to give back. This book follows some of that pattern. Ric dabbles into his growing up and lessons early on that he didn't learn from. He seemingly makes the same mistakes in his teens and early twenties as he did into his thirties and beyond. He goes into great details of his early wrestling career. I just wish there was more road stories. I often wondered what being out with the Horsemen would be like. I admire Mr Flair for all he did in the ring.I couldn't put this book down. I am not a reader but this book hooked me in and I couldn't stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ric Flair is the Man","review":"Ric Flair's book starts off great. He candidly discusses the details of his birth and family. He proceeds to relate the story of his pre-pro wrestling life with just about the right amount of detail to keep the reader interested.The story really gets interesting as Flair enters pro wrestling. Flair is perhaps the greatest pro wrestler ever. His combination of ring skills, interview skills and charisma is unsurpassed. Flair has seen it all and he tells us all about it in colorful detail.Flair gave everything to the sport and fans. He seemingly gives everything in this book. Flair reveals the good and bad of his career and life.It is unfortunate that events after this book cast some doubt on his family life, but that does not negate the value of this book. Flair is human and has his problems, but in the world of wrestling, Flair is the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK HAS FLAIR","review":"THIS IS ABOUT THE LIFE AND CAREER OF PRO WRESTLING GREAT RIC FLAIR. FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW RIC PERFORM ON TV, I KNEW HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST. I ALWAYS ENJOYED HIS COLORFUL AND FUNNY INTERVIEWS, BUT HE ALSO PUT ON A GREAT SHOW IN THE RING. HIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING, FUNNY, SCARY AND VERY ENJOYABLE. HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH STING, RODDY PIPER, VINCE MCMAHON AND HULK HOGAN ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS WELL WRITTEN BOOK. I CONSIDER RIC FLAIR AS ONE OF THE TOP 5 PERFORMERS OF ALL TIME IN THE WORLD OF PRO WRESTLING. ALSO ENJOYED SOME OF THE RIDICULOUS BUT FUNNY STORYLINES HE WAS INVOLVED IN OVER THE YEARS. I HOPE RIC DOES SOMETHING ABOUT HIS VERY OBVIOUS PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL. HE STILL IS THE MAN AND WILL BE FOREVER. A MUST READ FOR ALL WRESTLING FANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good Read","review":"I am not a big Ric Flair fan. Or I wasn't a big Flair fan back in his WCW days. I never tuned into WCW and have only caught up on Flair's history in wrestling through this book, his dvd set and WWE 24/7. I have grown to like the Nature Boy. Even though his book did create some controversy with his harsh words about Mick Foley and others, it gives you insight into the man and wrestler. If I could I would rate this as a 4 and a half stars out of five. The only wrestling book I think is a 5 star is Mick Foley's Have A Nice Day. This is close to being perfect (about on the same level as Mick's sequel Foley Is Good). You might not agree with everything the man says, but this book does what it intends to : entertain and inform. Highly recommended more for Flair/WCW fans or those who want to learn about the history of the business and one of the biggest stars to come along in the wrestling industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna know how to be \\"The Man\\"? Read his book!","review":"I have been a Ric Flair fan as far back as I can remember. I recall vividly watching him when I was 8 wrestling Dusty Rhodes and dominating the business. Through the years, I've followed Ric religiously, watching him wrestle and learning what I could about him personally. I thought I knew most of the story, but I was wrong. This is one of the best wrestler autobiographies (and books about wrestling in general) that I could recommend. As others have said, it is very honest and insightful. If you're a Ric Flair fan, this will be a book you'll treasure greatly. If you're a wrestling fan, you'll like the insight Flair gives on the industry. I recommend the book in the strongest possible terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of bashing and ass-kissing","review":"He bashes people like bret, mick, sid, ddp, savage, hogan, scott hall. He kisses vince, hbk, hhh's ass a lot. Notice something? People he bashes are no longer in the WWE and people he \\"likes\\" or \\"respects\\" are top guys in the WWE. He also speaks a lot about Arn like he's one of the best wrestlers of all time which he clearly is not, I watch tons of wrestling but never see him appear on wresting videos or even if he does appear once or twice I fail to recognize who he is. I understand he is your buddy but come on nobody really wants to know about him but you keep repeating he is great, blah, blah, blah. And yes we know you are a womanizer so spare your stoires of how many women you have they are just disgusting, believe it or not he really takes pride in his womanizing which makes me sick. Don't read the book, he just writes to kiss some ass but hardly the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man","review":"If you have watched wrestling over the years as i have then you should enjoy this book by Slick Ric. To Be the man in the wrestling business as long as he has is amazing.Very enjoyable stories. I loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies!!!!!!!!","review":"this book is full of lies and nothing but to promote the current WWE further. Flair sees mcmahon's favorite wrestlers like hbk and triple h as great wrestlers and those who opposed vince are bad wrestlers. Attacking wrestlers such as foley, hart, and savage are just plain wrong. He's NOT better than any of those three. Any wrestling fans knows what those 3 have done for the business. Mick, Bret, and Savage sacrificed a lot just to entertain people. Bret even cared for the well fare of his fellow wrestlers. The only entertaining thing flair can do is his \\"WOO!\\" chant which gets boring after hearing it a few times. As of now, Flair is still in the WWE and I must admit that I am bored everytime I watch him fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is about as entertaining as a Ric Flair match","review":"Ric Flair is a terrible repedative boring wrestler. For him to bad mouth great entertainers(wrestlers) like Mick Foley and Bret Hart in this book is a joke. They have done more for the business then Flair ever will no matter how long he stays, and he has over stayed his welcome by about 10-15 years.Flairs move list OFFENCE 1. Chest slap 2. Punch 3. Figure Four Leglock 4. No wait thats it, just 3 moves .DEFENCE 4.Bump of the top rope(atleast 3 times a match) 5. Back body drop.

In all, the book is not a bad read, there were just some parts that baffled me to death.The nerve of Flair to bash the likes of Savage, Bret Hart, and Foley to name a few is puzzling. He could of stated he didn't like neither style, but he went on to trash their accomplishments in the business, that's classless and unlike the Flair I watched and read about. It gets better, the talk of veterans needing to put younger guys over, but then praising long time politicians like Undertaker, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels, guys who would rather pass kidney stones and cancer tumors, than put anyone else over. That's when you can tell, it's the WWE spin machine.In conclusion, it's up to you if you want to purchase, but beware, alot of wacky WWE spin is on display. The stories of the old days are worth the buy, I will admit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ric fare","review":"my mommy read me this book last night and i had nightmares.

Lift-the-flaps are so enticing for little ones, I wish they made them more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a book of a series by the same author.

Just long enough for her short attention span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying Twice","review":"My son loves this book. He is very into belly buttons, which is why I bought this book for him. The book goes through several different parts (i.e. eyes, toes) and isn't just about belly buttons. My son is also a big fan of the lift-the-flap books. He will often laugh out loud like he's playing peek-a-boo with the book. The flaps on our copy haven't fared so well. In his excitement, my son his ripped a few of the flaps off of the page. They are made out of a lighter-weight material (it feels like a thin cardboard) than the sturdier pages are made of, but my son loves this book so much that I will be ordering another copy of it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying our 3rd book!","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was an infant and it was her favorite book! It was instant smiles as soon as we started reading it to her (with animation, of course!). As she got old enough to hold the book she started ripping the flaps off. So I bought her another one, and over time she ripped the flaps off again. She is now almost 2 and I am ordering her her 3rd copy of the book! It is still one of her favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...flimsy pages!","review":"My 7 month old loves this book! When I show it to him he smiles andsqueals with delight. As most of of know, 7 month olds not only delight in the words and the pictures, but they like to feel and taste the story as well! This book is not holding up. The \\"lift flaps\\" are very thin and seem like they are going to tear off of when my baby lifts them. I guess I'm just used to his other favorite book, \\"What Does Baby Do\\" another lift the flap book by Begin Smart. That (like all of their books) is VERY durable! I suppose we'll just have to be very gentle with \\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button?\\" It is a great book, however I wish it was more durable so it could last for our next child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good peek a boo book","review":"I've read this to my kid since he was small.

My kid enjoyed the peek a boo aspect of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for baby and parents!","review":"This is a nice sturdy book with colorful drawings of babies with some part of their body hidden. Each page asks, \\"Where is baby's ...?\\" Toddlers delight in lifting the flaps to find the hidden pictures. The pictures are bright and cute with eye-catching fabric and wallpaper patterns. A very attractive book, and perfect for that stage when toddlers become fascinated with their belly buttons! My 17 month old has really enjoyed this book. It can be very helpful in getting kids to name body parts, and it's fun for both the baby and the parents to read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very durable","review":"I bought this for my 11-month-old granddaughter after reading high ratings and it lasted all of 10 minutes before a flap was torn off.

It was a big hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peek-a-boo book encourages kids to identify body parts","review":"When I first got this for my son (~1 yr), he wasn't super interested in it. He loves lift a flap books, but he would quickly skim through it and toss it aside.However, now at 17 months he can identify all his body parts and loves to look through and do the same with the babies in the book. When we get to the belly button page, he basically falls over trying to get a good look at his own belly button.While this isn't my favorite book, he seems to enjoy it very much so I would recommend it for children ~1 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I think the illustrations in this book are a little creepy. My baby is not so nuts about it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book left me hollow","review":"Where is baby's belly button? Around the location of the navel.I read this book. It didnt take me long. I found that it left me empty inside. There was no coherent structure to be found, and it is never really explained where the baby came from or why it should feel the need to locate various anatomical features.Aside from that, the flaps were fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird science - an odd version of anatomy!","review":"Anatomical correctness has been completely ignored in these illustrations, which is a serious problem for a book that addresses anatomy as this one does. Even if an illustrator wants to do cutesy or cartoony, an educational background in anatomy will only enhance the drawings.The figures are blob-like and fleshy. Generic and deformed facial features float in vast expanses of circular heads. Arms are grotesquesly short, and NO ONE seems to have a neck in these books.Also, the author should have considered using correct anatomical names for body parts rather than cutesy nicknames."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of time to Interact","review":"Great book my G'daughter loves it!

It's soooo adorable, and a great learning book for babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my ten month old's favorite books","review":"We got this for my baby at around 6 months and she loved it then but constantly wanted to eat the flaps. This is not a board book so we didn't pull it out for her much until around 8 months when she stopped teething on the flaps. Even at about 8 months she was really good at lifting the flaps herself and now at 10 months she is starting to associate the body parts in the book with her body parts. We always touch her foot, hand, etc when we find that part in the book. The other day she lifted her own shirt to find her belly button which was cute but also shows us that she is learning. We used clear packaging tape to mend a tear from an excited baby lifting a flap too hard and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to do that to all of the flaps to make this book last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peek-a-boo on Paper","review":"My child loves this book. It's peek-a-boo with excitement for little ones. Multiple ethnicities enhance this gem. The words are in large print for visual stimulation and are good for visually impared readers. Children may want to grab at the flaps inside. My copy is worn already with loving attention. Children will learn the words \\"behind\\" and \\"under\\" relating to this book. I'm hoping for more hide and seek books from Ms. Katz in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute book","review":"My son (18 mos) really likes this book. It soon became one of his favorites. The pictures are bright and colorful, and the text simple. I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was so short. Also my little one can't lift the flaps by himself, there is no cut-outs or flanges that stick out enabling little fingers to grab easily. I'm sure in time though as this book gets \\"broken in\\" that it will be easier for him to do it by himself. Overall a cute book that little ones like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for under 2.","review":"This book is worn out. It a great book to read along with kids. They love to lift the flaps and easily relate to its simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Little Readers","review":"I've been reading Karen Katz' Lift-the-Flap books to my daughter since she was 10 months old, and I wish I would have known about them sooner! They are the perfect book for babies! They are sturdy enough to withstand baby teeth and drool. The pictures are always bright and captivating, they definitely keep little one's attention. Out of all the Lift-the-Flap books my daughter has, her favorite might be Where is Baby's Belly Button? Every time it gets to the part to \\"life the flap\\" my daughter squeals in delight or starts trying to talk! The only thing I'd suggest is to watch out for little hands trying to rip the \\"flap\\" off. The pages are thick and nearly impossible to tear, but the \\"flap\\" can be torn off by a determined Little One. However, it's nothing a little double-sided tape can't fix. (Amanda)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book has been a favorite of my daughter's from about 12 months to now, when she is 18 months. She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again. This book is better than some other lift-the-flap books where it is hard for the infant to see where the flap is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book - holds attention - very cute","review":"I really enjoy this book. The wording is simple, the drawings are bright and colorful. This holds a 7 month old's attention just fine! My only negative is about the flaps. While the book itself is made of sturdy board, the flaps are very thin & slick. They can be difficult to lift (even for adult fingers) and when a 7 month old wants to \\"help\\" it is tough to have hands on without the flaps tearing.All in all - a great book with simple lessons about where the eyes, hands, feet, belly button, etc...are on a child. The ending is the best one - we always have a mini-game of peek-a-boo with the last 'baby' in the book.Would recommend to all, but also recommend keeping the flaps just out of reach."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my!","review":"this book is very colorful... the illistrations are very bright.... my two year old loves books and i purchased this one becuase it came recomended by his speech theropist, however, the flaps are easily torn becasue they are paper... cardbaord books are better for smaller children.

My daughter loves to lift the flaps and gives us big smiles when the picture below is revealed. Sure, she's pulled off some of the flaps, but it's nothing that a little clear, shipping tape can't handle. Seriously, LOVE these books - my daughter wants them read to her several times a day and will lift the flaps when she \\"reads\\" them by herself.

Either way, I love the bright, beaming smiles she gives me knowing her accomplishment when she lifts the flap and sees the picture below."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"My 18 mos old granddaughter loves this book.

They like the interaction of lifting flaps, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my daughter's favorites","review":"This book is very cute and my daughter loves it. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that, like any flap book, the flaps are difficult for little fingers to lift and are not very sturdy. Since my daughter likes it so much, it is coated with packaging tape to keep it together. She is 1.5 yo now, and points to the baby's eyes and mouth, etc. She also plays boo-boo (peek-a-boo) with the baby on the last page.

Even if there were no flaps, the drawings are a hit - so I've just ordered \\"Counting Kisses\\", as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this book, you can SEE the ending right on the cover!","review":"This book is completely misleading. The entire plot revolves around finding Baby's belly button; the title makes this much clear from the beginning. However, there is no mystery. There is no twist. Baby's belly button is right where it's suppose to be, on Baby's stomach. Right where it clearly SHOWS you it is on the COVER OF THE BOOK.This plot is a complete mess as a result of it's reliance on the mystery of where the belly button is; everything falls apart the second you realize that the belly button was in plain sight all along. There is no conflict, there is no character development, and there is scarcely any plot. Whoever wrote this book must have a serious error in judgement, because you would have to be an infant to not immediately understand where Baby's belly button is. This is one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite book","review":"I bought this book for my son when he was only 4 months old. He loved it then and it's still his favorite book a year later. Each page only has a few words - perfect for little one's who just want to turn the pages. He loves looking under the flaps. The flaps are starting to get a little worn, but when I ask my son if he wants me to read him a book this is the first one he grabs. Only warning - when I first bought it for him he would have me read it 10+ times a sitting until I finally distracted him with another toy, he loved it that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"lift-the-flap books are generally a huge hit with my 21-month old and this book is among his favourites ('Where is Spot?' being his absolute favourite).

It's the number 1 book she brings to us when she wants to be read to. The pictures are bright and enjoyable for baby to look at.

She sits with me while I read the whole book, unlike other books that don't quite hold her attention.

It's actually VERY sturdy for being a lift the flap book the flaps are sealed across the entire top or bottom of the page in about a half inch strip and are made out of a heavy cardstock type paper not quite board thick but still rather thick.We let her play with all her books whenever she wants even if it means possibly eventually destroying them and this book has stood up very very well. It's over ten months old and has lost only ONE flap and only very recently. She still loves it regardless.The drawings are cute the words are big and clear (we're starting to try to get her to follow along with the words we say by pointing them out). It's a bit short, but right now it doesn't seem to matter she'll read it twice through if she wants more and sometimes it's just the right length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for tiny hands","review":"This book along with other Karen Katz' books are great books for little kids.

But still, they were great fun for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"My 16 month old and I like this book with the flaps and we actually have another one by the same company called Daddy and me, but my complaint with both books is that the flaps that make this book so fun and interesting for my toddler are also the biggest problem. The flaps are so big, that they get bent really easily. The story is very simple indicating it is meant for young children, but making the flaps so big indicates the publisher does not really understand the behavior of young children. Both of our books have bent flaps and I keep these books on a high shelf where he can't get the books on his own. Imagine if these books were with his others that he has complete access to!

Its the story of a young girl who aspired to be a ballerina. Instead, the Nazis came to power, spreading hate and distrust of the Jewish community.

I ached for this fragile girl who lived under the shadow of Hitler but survived under the greater hand of God.The Daughter of Faith series has captivated this reader and Shadow of His Hand will inspire you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for kids","review":"This is a great book for children.

I saw this film on CBC / CTV almost 25 years ago. My chemistry professor (I believe his name was Arthur Grosser) at McGill University had a small roll as the Anthropology or history professor in this film. Also, it was filmed in Montreal, I believe. I did, at the time, have some interest in astral projection and the film, at first, did try to introduce this practice and its appeal.This movie otherwise has nothing of value - strange plot resolution, poor production quality, and poor acting.

Make sure everyone is too guilty to consider how wrong you are with common sense.5. Write a book.Isn't lying about things easy?

You get a much better visual from listening on your home stereo.Secondly, I don't think Wallach will ever change his lecture. I've heard Wallach speak on several different occasions, and he uses the same jokes and same stories each time for the most part. Not to say his message isn't a good one. It is, but change it up a little for Pete's sake. How boring must that be for him to say the same speech 200+ times a year?If you're new to the world of alternative medicine, this video can be valuable, but I just can't see how anyone would feel confidence about Wallach's message when you're looking directly at a visual of him.

The only really good part of the game is you earn podracers and money to upgrade your podracers by winning the races, but in time you start losing all the races and stop earning money.

Only downside is you can't open the door from the outside if it is locked on the inside and I locked myself out because of that. My oldest daughter can easily open it, but the younger two can't. Another plus is I didn't have to drill any new holes in the door which is nice since we are renting, I just removed the existing lock plate and put this one on instead. Would recommend, just remember to unlock it if you go out the garage and shut the garage door after you or you too will get locked out. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"magnet does not work!!!!!","review":"i had this case before.. but for some lame reason this one does not stay magnatized to my fridge!!! thats extremly inconvinient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This is my first time buying a Denise Austin video, and I had read other reviews, but I really just wanted to try it out for myself. I only did half of the warm-up and I was lost, she moves into her next step so fast, and doesn't tell you what to do next. So you're always a step behind. She is awful. When I have more time and patience I'll finish the video, but I wouldn't buy another one of her videos again. And here's a tip: buy from the \\"new and used\\". Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous!","review":"This buy was a MISTAKE. The dancers are often off beat and Denise doesn't explain the moves before she does them. I would sell the DVD if I thought people would buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Cardio workout....","review":"I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an \\"indoor walk\\" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"I usually like Denise's workouts, but I am so dissapointed. If you are looking for a \\"dance\\" workout, this is NOT it. There were dance moves included in the cardio workout, but I believe you could really injure yourself by doing them. This was basically any of her other workouts with a few dance moves inserted here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Na-a! Not good!","review":"This is like the worst exercise dvd I own. I bought it about 4 years ago at a Walmart. I couldn't use it then, still can't use it now even after so many years. 4 years is a long time and I just thought by now my views might have changed. Needless to say there is absolutely no change in my opinion about the dvd. Perhaps if you've got a dance background of some sort you might enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the blood flowing.","review":"I work out at the gym on an elliptical and lift light weights.

She is inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"I like Denise Austin workouts. The fit is perfect for me, as she's easy to follow, encouraging, motivating and the workouts are a good variety. I have other Denise Austin DVDs as well and they're all challenging enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio Dance for Dancers","review":"I own several Denise Austin tapes and DVDs. I do not like this one. The routines in the cardio segment change too quickly and too often to keep up unless you happen to be an experienced dancer. By the time I have figured out what Denise is doing she has moved on to the next set of steps or the ones after that. I've played the DVD numerous times and I still cannot do the steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I was using this workout a few times a week with great results. Have since switched to other Denise Austin workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but fun","review":"The cardio and the strength routines are a little complicated, but I hope to master them with some practice. I had trouble with keeping weights nestled behind my knees during the strength part, but maybe I just need different weights. Denise moves between steps pretty quickly, so it can be a challenge for the uncoordinated. But I don't think you're meant to do it perfectly--just do the best you can.The best part: You can create a nice 30-minute workout by doing the warmup, the cardio OR strenght, and then the cooldown. And you do break a real sweat! Also, I felt like my whole body was worked out, not just a few muscles. This video is great for those cold, rainy days when biking or walking are not an appealing option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"I sooo wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this video...I though it was ME...and that it was my problem, but I see now that many others think this is a lousy video. Denise Austin gives very poor instruction, if any, for the dance moves and yes, they are very ackward and I think bad for you. I had knee pain three times after doing this video before I realized which move was the culprit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love","review":"I absolutley love this workout. I only gave it 4 stars though becuase I didnt like the strength training portion. The Cardio portion on the other hand is just great. I have never worked before and 2006 was going to be the year for me. So decided to try this dvd, and it was a god send. I do this dvd 6 times a week. That combined with proper eating, I have lost about 10 pounds and so many inches in a month, and I have never been happier. The cardio is one of the best workouts, really get the heart up and the sweat going, just great, highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this dvd!!!!","review":"I like this DVD!The cardio section is high energy and fun. The cueing is not wonderful but it helps you pay attention and you feel like you get a workout.The toning/sculpting section makes you hurt and sore so I feel it's effective. I've been exercising every day for years now and I still feel it the next day.As for naysayers about her personality I personally don't agree. I like to exercise and I personally like to watch people who seem enthused about the exercise they're trying to get you to do. In my book they certainly beat those who look like hostile leaders trying to punish you or people who don't look like they're enjoying what they're trying to get you to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely GREAT","review":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I've been using this for almost 2 years. I mostly use the weight segment, and it really is an efficient way to get toned all over. I switch between various hand weighs (5lbs-12lbs) during the segment, depending on the particular exercise. I don't get bored at all by it; Denise is very encouraging and pleasant, and it's like having a personal trainer. The cardio segment is good too, but I don't use it that much because I prefer to walk instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love this DVD. It really get's your heart rate going and is SO much fun. I have other videos from Denise and this one is my favorite at least right now. I used to take dance classes when I was younger but haven't for a long time but really wanted to try something new exercise wise and this hit the spot. It's so much fun and you can practically feel your body getting into shape especially the next day when you first start the program. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strength (weights) routine","review":"The \\"strength\\" section of this video is one of the best exercise dvd routine's I've tried so far. You work so many different muscles in just a short amount of time; no crazy jumping or dancing in this part. It's worth getting the video just for that part, I don't even bother with the \\"Cardio\\" or \\"Stretch\\" section."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in One","review":"I have been following Denise for 15 years, and this is the best all in one routine of hers yet. It was a little hard to keep up with at first, but I find that with any high-energy workout. If you watch her legs, instead of her face, you learn much quicker. The cardio segment is fun and lively, the strength segment makes you use every part of your body at once, and the stretching segment is your ultimate reward after REALLY working up a sweat. If you are moderate to advanced, want to save time, lose weight, and be fit all over, this Denise routine does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was not very impressed with this DVD. Denise Austin is incredibly cheesy, a little too much for me to take. I would say this video is for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"I bought this under the impression it was a DANCE workout video, hence the name...However I was disappointed in more ways than one. The music in the background was so low you can barely hear it..And you aren't so much dancing, than doing dance moves at a slower pace. This not a video I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the back of my shelf","review":"Denise is too perky, too chirpy and she fails to give guidance with her moves. If you haven't been working out for very long, or if you have never had good instruction, it would be easy to injure yourself with all the flailing around Denise does. I'll stick with Kathy Smith or Karen Voight or Lisa Hart."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm sorry, but....","review":"...i have Denise Austin's \\"Shrink Your Female Fat Zones\\" DVD and I LOVE LOVE it, so I decided to pick this one up. I am SO sorry that I did. I work out with my friend and we could barely get through 10 minutes - the moves are ridiculous and, although it did get our heart rates up, it's mostly because we were laughing hysterically at the moves. Honestly, they just made us feel ridiculous. I recommend getting the other DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Club-NO and Cardio-NO","review":"If you are in good shape, work out regularly and were looking for a good cardiovascular workout on your days off, this is going to seem like child's play and a little silly. The dance step workout section is also short, rushed and confusing. No doubt, however, some will consider this a very fun workout and I admire Ms. Austin's enthusiastic teaching style, so I gave it two stars. Otherwise, it's a waste of $10.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst workout EVER!!","review":"over the past 20 years i have worked out to over 100 different videos. this is the worst one i have ever come across. the music is not loud enough, denise has HORRIBLE cuing, the workout is boring and the girls working out with her look plastic. please please do not buy this dvd. you can just dig mine out of the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I don't use this DVD. Its kind of corny and I feel like an idiot doing the exercises. I think its the lame music and those background women exercising - they look too happy (hahaha). No but the truth is that although I like Denise Austin's \\"Female Fat Zones\\" DVD, I don't see this \\"Burn FAT Fast\\" does much good. The movements are too ridiculous and too confusing if you're not into the aerobics scene of doing the \\"grapevine\\". Overall, this DVD is probably good for people that are into aerobics classes. If you've got a left foot, then don't get this. Its just not very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin is the FITNESS QUEEN, hands down!","review":"Love this DVD I use it all the time, it's fun and fast paced and she keeps you motivated without being overly annoying. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is an excellent exercise DVD. The dance cardio is not difficult to learn and really gets your heart rate up. The strength training with weights is a challenge. Well, it was for me because up until I started this DVD I was only working out lightly with weights........ I have been working out to this DVD for almost three weeks and it still makes me sweat and my muscles burn. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn Fat Fast-- but only if you insist","review":"I recently purchased Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast Cardio Dance and Sculpt video. As with The Dance It Off video, I found the moves too complicated, too stressful upon my joints and too annoying to follow. In addition, the cameraman/woman seemed to have a peculiar fixation with the jiggly breasts of one of the dancers. Top if off with the fact that my body refused to cooperate with my mid-life brain and you won't be surprised that this video ended up in the same place as the Dance It Off video. The Landfill. Why? Because it didn't deserve the honor of being recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this dvd. I expected this workout to really get me moving as well as be fun. I was very disappointed. Denise gives little to no instruction on the steps before expecting you to do them \\"with her\\" and I thought the moves were more goofy aerobics than dancing. She also needs to work on her counting, on several occasions she says \\"ok one more time!\\" and goes through the pattern 6 more times. It did get me out of breath, but because I couldnt stop laughing, not because I was breaking a sweat. All in all, I wish I hadnt bought it, it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Baby","review":"10 Months ago, I had a son. And the baby fat is so hard to get rid of. I work out to this dvd everyday since I bought it. It is so fun!And it works great.I even got my husband to do it to! I have tried Many- MANY work outs, walking, dieting , even stacker pills. This is the only thing working for me. I highly recommend this DvD workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Buying this","review":"To all those who are looking for a break from the mundane aerobics exercise....don't buy this...this is not a dance video. Denise tries to dance but it does not work. The only part that is enjoyable and makes much sense is the strength training exercises.If you want a good work out buy Denise Austin 'Bounce Back After Baby\\" video. The exercises are pretty much the same as is offered in this DVD, however, they are much better choreographed and overall does a better job.If you don't remember anything else...do remember buy \\"Bounce Back After Baby\\" it is good for anyone, whether you have had a baby 10 years ago or never have...if you are have just delivered and want to start..you might want to wait a little longer to try this..then again that depends on you and how fast your body is ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"...very disappointing","review":"I really like Denise Austin and it's obvious she knows the ways to achieve a healthy body, but this dance tape is the silliest thing I've ever seen. You're better off putting on your headphones and dancing around the house for an hour.The dance moves are corny and somewhat awkward. Not to mention, she talks to the camera like she's talking to a 2 year old. It's almost embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers remorse!!!","review":"This is the worst exercise DVD I have ever purchased. Denise is over the top sappy and gives poor instruction, moves are stupid and simplistic, music is boring and uninspiring. I felt like I gained absolutely no benefits from exercising to this DVD. I really like Denise's Blast Away 10 Pounds DVD it gives a quick and good workout. I thought this would be a good DVD for a different twist, boy was I wrong. Kathy Smith and Tami Lee Webb are a better bet, I won't buy another Denise tape unless I preview it first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn fat fast","review":"It's ok. The tape is a common exercises.

I am not bored with its variety nor am I irritated by the movements. They move at a pace that is perfect for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as fun as the title sounds, but...","review":"the dance moves are so dorky, even denise's backup ladies seem a little embarrassed. and some of the add-two-exercises-together parts of the sculpting portion seem like denise is inventing them on the spot, so you're just flailing randomly with weights. and denise's voice is about the most annoying thing ever... all that said, however, i do get a pretty seirously good workout from doing this whole program all at once, so i will still pull it out on days when i'm feeling fairly tolerant."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"I purchased this dvd & another dance/sculpt one from Prevention Magazine. The Prevention one sits on a shelf w/ moves and routines that I just couldn't follow. I got this one the first time and actually see a difference in how I look after 2 months of doing it.

It sounds like your listening to a radio station that you're about to loose the signal on (kinda like on a roadtrip). Another thing they told me that was wrong, is that you just plug in and use the volume level on your radio. NOT TRUE. The volume level and EQ settings on the Fuse affect the levels on your radio as well. It's hard to find a good medium because some songs will distort and other you can barely hear.

The fact that it's a cord allows you to easily hide and stow your ipod and the transmitter. It charges your ipod or iphone as well as allows you to play it in your car.

It's a breeze to use, so easy even iPod owners could use it correctly without instruction. It is a bit unwieldy though. I don't know why the transmitter is in the middle of the line--it seems like it would have been a better design to have the transmitter attached to the DC jack.UPDATE: This thing broke for no reason in less than a year.

I found this CD very bland, not easy to listen to by any means even if you previously enjoyed the music of River City Rebels, and quite frankly there are no standout tracks. The horns are virtually non-existent, even more so than the last album, and the melody seems to have all but disappeared.

I read this book for two reasons, one, it was one of the few books of his I hadn't read, and two, the ratings were high and reviews very good. After reading this book I'm dumbfounded by the reviews and ratings. This is a horrible book, one of the worst books I've ever read. Period. Only reason I finished it (and I finish all the books I start - a personality flaw) is because I couldn't believe it was actually that bad, and kept expecting it to turn around - story and writing - at some point. Never did. Overall, a meandering purposeless story with way too many undeveloped or underdeveloped characters and a nauseating level of unnecessary detail. Oh, my, what a horrible book. 480 pages of writer imposed pain and suffering, on the reader. Be very afraid and stay far away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"suttree","review":"Incomprehensible..Boring, A waste of money..I you want to spend time trying to unravel what the heck this man is trying to say, then do so..I gave it my best shot and in disgust tossed it into the waste basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suttree","review":"This book toyed with my emotions in ways others had only fleeting success at doing. Just an absolutely marvelous depiction of rueful poverty in the South in the 1950s. Everyone knows McCarthy's good; Suttree, which is supposedly one of his most autobiographical, and its sincerity suggest that McCarthy's so good at riffling through the more morose aspects of human nature because he himself has lived through many of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book","review":"I assume that only fans of Cormac McCarthy have gotten this far. To read what other fans think of Suttree. Read this book. McCarthy is like no other, and if you like his other books you'll love this one too. Though this is my favorite of his. It seems his most personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long stare into a dead eye.","review":"The first thing any review of a novel by Cormac MacCarthy mentions is always the language. So to get it out of the way: Suttree is a dizzying verbal adventure. Even if the subject were dull as dirt, McCarthy's prose would make this novel worth reading. He's one of the finest American writers, with a diction somewhere between Faulkner and God. If you've read him, you know what I mean.But the story of Suttree is also a damned fine one. McCarthy's eyes are wide open, and in this novel, his perceptions are focussed unblinkingly on a man, in all his failings, and a river, in all its crazed ugliness. At times, the novel is grotesque, at times startlingly lyrical. Usually, both.Read this book. Then read _Blood Meridian_. You'll be glad you did. --Steve Marsden"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words oozed from the muddy river","review":"Perhaps not the first CMcC title one should look at. But I strongly recommend this book to the dedicated reader. I feel it is full of rewards for those who can persevere. The stoic Suttree, almost unknowable, inhabits a world of depressive sludge where the dank sky brings forth very little hope. The characters and scenes are painted meticulously, all crying out from their painful existence. Yet there is very little complaint but a great deal of ingenuity, although mostly fraught with failure. Like a bitter jar of moonshine whiskey this story must be suffered to be savored. The overall effect, a numbing dreamscape depicted so thoroughly that falling into its murky reality finally made sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"I am a fan of Cormac McCarthy, The Road is my favorite but this second best. Suttree is a great character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautifully written book about revolting people","review":"5 stars for an outstanding book, but just one star for being a pleasant read. The characters were convincing but totally unlikeable -- self-indulgent, self-destructive, sordid, and degenerate.The setting -- 1950s Knoxville -- was also very well-done, but again unappealing.I read about halfway through this book mainly to get a feel for my hometown in the 50s. Finally I gave up -- I just didn't want to be around any of the characters any more.If you like this sort of thing, you'll love this book -- it is very well-written. It's just not my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long murky road to ?","review":"I'm a Cormac McCarthy fan. I have read most of his books and recommend them all to friends and family. While this book was disappointing, CM is a master of language - you feel the cold, the hunger, the addictions and the poverty in this novel. The imagery brings you to live the scenes. However, this story has no plot - it meanders and wanders. While the Suttree character is developed nicely - you never understand why he's walked out on his family or why he comes and goes as he does. CM uses heavy doses of \\"dictionary look-up\\" words. The novel is dense and thick with descriptions of the surroundings and environment - as a result the book is long (very), unsatisfying and unfulfilling. If you are new to Cormac McCarthy's work - try any one of his other works including The Road, The Border Trilogy, No Country for Old Men or Blood Meridian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I've been a fan for a long time. Having read the 'Border Trilogy', All the Pretty Horses, No Country For Old Men, and the Road. When I read Suttree I was really disappointed. It seemed it was more of an literary exercise for the author to use obscure, and archaic words, that even my Kindle dictionary couldn't find. Pointless, with a story line story line that left characters undeveloped and the reader wondering what happened to them. I'm glad this wasn't the first Mccarthy book I read because I wouldn't have read anymore if I had read this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too wordy got in way of story","review":"This novel was heavy with description and exaggeration. l tried to skip it to get to the meat of the story which is what every writer's role is from the Bronte's to Danielle Steel. l do not think l will read his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why such good reviews?","review":"This is probably the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I can not for the life of me figure out how or why it got such good reviews. The character development is non existent and the athor's continual use of archaic words is distracting and adds nothing to the story.

Here\`s hoping my review will save someone else from shelling out hard earned money on pretentious drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Mr. McCarthy?","review":"Woe is me. I hate this book and I have been an avid reader of his previous work. I believe my freshman English teacher would have marked this work, \\"pretentious, self-indulgent, and overwritten with little redeeming value.\\" The story is lost somewhere in his thesaurus. Did he just find this tool on his menu bar? I am so disappointed by the leaden pace, the overdone adjectives taken from the prose thesaurus and the plethora of 18th century obscure references. I found some rhythm in the first few pages and some beautiful descriptions, but it soon degenerated into tedious, boring, depressing and maudlin accounts that contribute nothing to these characters in a pointless story. I can't force my way through and I am giving up. I so wish I had never picked it up. It has diminished my view of McCarthy's talent. Why, Mr. McCarthy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is an amazing book. I finished it in 4 days and started all over again. Not for children though."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I read one more line about the filthy river...","review":"While I take into account that I read this book for my Fiction Writing class and not for my own pleasure, it was difficult to slog through. I found the titular character to be wholly unlikable, wandering aimlessly up and down the riverbank. His interactions with other characters range from bland to uninspiring, and left this reader wondering what on earth the author hoped for us to learn.My particular pet peeve with this novel, however, was the grindingly repetitive description of the central river. I really did not need to hear how it was a filthy yellow watered stretch, littered with condoms. Over. And over. And over.Two stars instead of one because I concede that the prose itself was not absolutely horrible. It was readable, just not enjoyable in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated to see it end.","review":"This is a classic written by a master.

I recommend anything by McCarthy, but especially Suttree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savored Second Time","review":"I knew I would read this again--I raced through it the first time--and it certainly holds up to a more deliberate perusal. The detailed, poetic descriptions of Knoxville in the 1950s are worth slowing down for and savoring. How can bleakness be made so beautiful?We know there have been comparisons to Faulkner--my edition's cover reminds us so--but I would add Thomas Wolfe as well. Who else could write so rapturously about everyday things?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Work of Art","review":"It's hard to imagine how someone could write such a superb book as \\"Suttree\\", but Cormac McCarthy is a whole order of magnitude above most writers. This fascinating book tells the tale of Cornelius Suttree as he lives his hardscrabble life along the Tennessee River near Knoxville in the '50s. The book is filled with some of the most memorable characters in modern literature, not the least of them Suttree himself. This picaresque book hurls humor and sadness at the reader and dialog that is so real, your head will spin. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on -- if you're a McCarthy reader you know what I'm talking about -- but the story sorts itself out and the reader moves along. By the end of the book you will have become quite attached to Suttree, Harrogate and the denizens of the flats along the river and you know you will miss them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Music","review":"I love this cd just like I love cook food.

All the activities are tried and true since the author began teaching in 1968 and had extensive experience from which to draw. I would think that any classroom teacher of children on the autism spectrum would find this book useful but as a homeschooling mom it got us through many days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not userful","review":"Very disappointed when this book arrived.

Unfortunately this non stick pan did not measure up. The first time I fried an egg, which is one of the main things I use non stick pans for, it stuck. I use cast iron for most things, except eggs. This pan was not nearly as good as my old Circulon, which has worn out after 3 years.

Not a family favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Story of Retail Nightmares...","review":"Working nearly 23 Christmas seasons I can still reflect on those dag-burn Cabbage Patch Dolls. It was a nightmare. From that year on toy makers had to come up with \\"The Christmas Toy.\\" A toy to end all toys. A blockbuster! This movie celebrates such nonsense of the season and it does it with glee. Its being touted as a family film, but look deeper. Its a dark comedy about lies, greed, and broken promises. This film works on two levels. Sinbad's best performance is in this film. He is suprisingly more menacing than the governator himself, Ah-nuld. I really enjoyed this movie, and I won't watch it every Christmas like \\"Elf,\\" or \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" it still will make my holiday rounds every 2 or 3 years. Make sure you brush your teeth though after the ending. It is a little overly sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, it our family's Holiday Tradition","review":"We had it on VHS, so we had to updgrade to DVD.

Makes me not want to have kids though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and underrated Christmas movie","review":"I always had the impression that this was a run-of-the-mill Christmas movie. Then, one night I was flipping through the channels and this movie was on. Arnold played a good part - it wasn't his best comedy role (probably Kindergarten Cop in my book), but he was good. Sinbad, on the other hand, was great. Sinbad played a postal worker that wasn't all there (about 42 cards in his deck) and made the movie. There are several parts that made me laugh out loud (and still do).In the end, the movie attempts to be a feel-good movie and comes close. The ride getting there is worth watching the movie though. Overall, not the best Christmas movie, but definitely underrated and worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor all the way","review":"Poor acting, lame humour. Everything you need for a complete money and time waster. After seeing this film, I felt I had lost something - it was not worth the time I spent watching it.Very young audiences might get some kicks out of this film - however, they will get exposed to the morally questionable events in it. The (low) humour is akin to that found in the Home Alone movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Morally, Creatively and Intellectually Brain Dead Cash-In","review":"Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way fun..","review":"I was pleasantly amused by this christmas folley. My kids loved it. There are those who are prepared for Christmas and those who are not. I've been both. This movie takes them to the extreme in an entertaining way. Hope you enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but not a classic","review":"This is a fun but uneven holiday flick. I guess Arnold holds his own, but the pre-packaged script leaves little room for anything but going through the motions. Sinbad comes off awfully whiny and obnoxious. As a vehicle to contemplate the over-commercialization of Christmas, it might be a conversation starter, but do you want to waste 90 minutes of your life again? The true meaning of Christmas? Perhaps Jamie will look to real people in his life rather than fantasy figures -- not a bad message in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"spoiled little boy","review":"all this movie is about is this boy wants an action figure and the dad drives all over kingdom come just to got this stupid action figure. as if they can not just say we are getting you something else. he ends up in the parade just to give his son what he want because he gets to give it to any kid. really what parent will waist there weekend or day just to get there kid what they want even though every where you go out of order. he ends up stealing from his neighbor's son to give to his son. at a certain point i think it you got to call it quits. no matter it they want it or not. this movie is still funny but come on now honestly. the whole way through the movie he is just trying to get an action figure and that is about the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arnolds Worst","review":"I saw this movie around Christmas Time and I was not very happy it wasnt that funny or touching at all I recomend to buy another Christmas movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"Not what Christmas is all about truthfully.

Unfortunately for Howard, his son wants an immensely popular \\"Turbo Man\\" action figure. Howard forgets to get it, and since it's Christmas Eve, it's sold out everywhere.

I'm sorry, Arnold just can't play comedic roles. The ending is especially horrible, because Arnold is trying to hide his true identity from his son by dressing up as a superhero. The retard was wearing a see-through mask with his costume. Like an 8 year old kid can't distinguish his dad from Blasto-Man. And it's not like Arnold has an Austrian accent or anything.

This odious, mean-spirited tribute to commercial greed and action-hero worship will sour any Christmas spirit.

Of course, the charm is only increased by having the neighbor hit on Arnold's wife; but what's a Christmas story without a little sexual tension.

I read a review or two that said this book was confusing, perhaps they did not read the whole thing or understand that it was written chronologically from several points of view? There are a number of characters to keep track of, but they are all tied together through friendships and family relationships.

After a particularly devastating break-up for Natalie, Tom proposes a game where each weekend the two of them engage in an activity revolving around a letter of the alphabet. In this book, while we watch Tom attempt to \\"woo\\" Natalie into a new romance, we also get view of romantic life at 2 other stages: that of Patrick and Lucy (Tom's brother and sister-in-law) who are frustrated and stagnant and that of Nicholas and Anna (Natalie's parents) who are long-time loves dealing with aging. I loved this story and found myself disappointed for it to come to an end, wanting to know...\\"what happens now?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING . . .

I got it home and broke it open in bed that night . . . I gave it 30 pages and was done. I wanted to know much more about Tom and Natalie's past . . .not all the rest of the characters (which should have been involved but not in 1st person also!)So it will be going back and I will not be finishing it.

She has been one of my favorite authors for years. I've eagerly awaited each of her new novels. This story-line was weak, stretched beyond belief, & actually very silly. The characters were not as interesting as Noble's previous novels. The characters of e Natalie's father & mother was well-drawn, but the author failed to develop them with any great depth. The parents were much more interesting than Tom & Natalie & their escapades. It seems like a \\"hasty-write\\" or a \\"potboiler\\" to me--maybe the author was too overwhelmed by her upcoming move to NYC to do justice to this book. Completely forgettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light indulgence","review":"I agree that this book is a great weekend read. While the primary characters are Natalie and Tom, they are related to the parties in the other storylines. This book was entertaining and somewhat thought-provoking.

While mainly a guilty pleasure, this novel did remind me that life goes on and that we all approach change in our own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read!!","review":"I can't believe so many people felt this book was confusing. There are title pages to explain which characters you are reading about. I thought this book was just pure escape fun. I don't expect deep reads when I pick up a book like this.

I was absolutely floored! I would have assumed, and obviously was wrong for doing so, that cooking tools would be made of food grade stainless steel or, baring that, a metal with a rust-proof coating.I'd recommend staying away from these. Perhaps look for a silicon version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda cheap, but they still work","review":"These rings are thin aluminum, so they are a bit cheap. They can bend and become mis-shapen quite easily. But you can get them back into shape quickly too. They work great, but do keep in mind that they will get very hot on your griddle or in your pan. Most dough is forgiving enough that you won't notice any slight imperfections in shape caused by bent rings.You can get more durable stainless steel tart rings or English muffin rings, but I'm not sure it's worth the added expense. I would just stick with these and if they get knocked out of shape, just bend them back. (And speaking of tart rings, these will work just as well for that, though they might be a bit large.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect English Muffins","review":"These are a little flimsy but seem like they will hold up over time decently. I do think they need extra care in storage because they seem to warp easily. Other than that, they are exactly what I need; the diameter and height are perfect. They do stick but I found the remedy to this is to first grease the rings and then \\"flour\\" them slightly with cornmeal; just don't do the cornmeal too heavily or they slip out when flipping.Overall, these are a great value since English Muffins are a little pricey in the grocery store but can be made at home for pennies.

Nevertheless, after using the skillet for a few months, it warped in the middle, which caused uneven cooking. Then a few months later it lost its non-stick quality, and had to be oiled before every use. This was hard to understand because the skillet was always hand washed, never scoured, never used metal tools (even though the literature said this was okay) or put in the dishwasher.

All would agree with that. However, after just a few pages of reading I had to put the book down. Many words are present which one is not accustomed to seeing in a Doctor Who book. Words such as bi-ch, G-d d--n, and sh-t. One reads/watches Dr. Who to escape into other worlds and wonderful stories. Reading such foul language to me is not entertaining.

He is a self serving person who is allways promoting his books. He constantly posts pseudo-history, but then fails to back it up under challenge. He refers to whites as crackers and claims native americans don't have claims in the Americas because Blacks have prior claims.

These books are so tremendously exciting and so very well witten that I've almost convinced myself that the fictional characters really were alive. This series, set against the most frightening time in history,WWII, will take you on a remarkable journey into the lives of many lovable characters like the Lindheims, J. Murphy ,W. Churchill.

Some of the twists in the book had my mouth dropping open. In the world of espionage, you don't know who to trust and who not to--these books brought that alive. They are written about a time before even my parents were born, and it's mouth-droolingly interesting to see what could have happened in this totally foreign world. I've never read anything like these and am in the process of buying all of Thoene's books. I'm even buying for my mother and telling everyone else about them.

And after so many claims, i waited a month until i bought the blu ray, hoping it would be fixed. I have watched every episode in awe, the picture quality is absolutely perfect. I think that its safe to buy this blu ray now, since funimation must've fixed whatever was producing the low quality episodes before. Not only are the episodes amazing quality, the font of the subtitles has a fresh new feel, that for some reason, makes reading them feel a lot more in touch with the episode. (I guess you have to see it yourself to get what I mean)The boxing case is just incredible,the holographic cover is the biz! It even comes with 4 high quality poster cards.This is a must buy, and make sure you buy the second box set in august, as it holds some of FMA's greatest moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"English version?","review":"I know most of you out there don't like the English dubbed versions of most anime, but I, personally, thought the original series voices in English were great.

The animation is beautiful, and it follows the manga storyline very closely. The story goes worlds beyond the first anime so if you've seen the other, you won't be getting a full double dose. The first part DVD set of this 5 part series follows everything from the manga that is covered in the first anime. The comparison is rather unreal as it goes so much faster. The laboratory incident, for example, takes approx 2 episodes in this series, where it made up 4-5 in the first series. It really is an incredible animation job, a must have for any anime collection. I can't wait for the rest of it to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Part 1","review":"This is a really good season but the part that got me to dislike it most of the time is that it is pretty much exactly as the \\"original\\" Fullmetal Alchemist.

The begining will feel the same only different then it will go way off into left feeld and have you completly captivated. If you liked the first one then the second one is going to anser all of your questions. Yes all of them...how do i know because its ansering all of mine and i hade alot. Everyone that i have shown this anime to loves it even if they are not an anime person. Do your self a favor. IF you like anime or not this ia a great anime the brother hood version is a little more adult but they are both no worst then the stuff on tv for kids and it teaches them good morals and righ from wrong. But dont get me wrong its buy no means a childrens anime....IM 23 and my husbands 27 and my mom well she is just old and we all love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bottom Line","review":"This review is for those who are wondering if they should buy this series or not. If this series is for you, is it funny, is it exciting, is it all just hype and childish, etc.. Yes, yes, yes, and no. Sure. There are slightly less episodes than what would be nice, but face it. FMA is a legend. FMA Brotherhood (this series) is a legend. For very good reason. This is the first DVD release for FMA Brotherhood, so a low amount of episodes is a given. Please, do yourself a favour and buy this. You won't regret it. If you enjoy Anime, hell, if you enjoy anything good and exciting in life, you owe yourself to own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"FMA Gets MUCH MUCH Better","review":"This version of FMA is much better than the original series because this version follows the manga more closely. The only problem is that this first set is familiar with the original series as to make you fell like you're not getting MUCH new. There is quite a few new pieces to this set - and is well worth the purchase for fans. BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Minus the first 12 episodes","review":"First off FMA: Brotherhood is an absolutely fantastic series. That being said the first 12 episodes of this series are just a very poor rehashing of what was significantly more episodes in the original anime. Once you are past the first twelve episodes of this series it's better than the original in almost every way. However since this set is episodes 1-15, if you have seen the first anime you may be better off skipping the first round of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip volume 1","review":"While the first FMA anime was untrue to the manga, it weaved its own story and found a way or what I felt at the time had become better then the manga. The first 13 episodes of FMA: Brotherhood are trash and just a retelling of the first part of the original anime. They fail to keep the same sense of wonder and suffer from horrible pacing. I recommend just getting volume 2-5 as they are completely well paced and amazing and now looking back on the experiences showed that both series had their ups and downs while showing us two of the greatest stories ever told and theybshould be considered equals instead of trying to compare one another."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff may work, but...","review":"I bought this because it is said that it helps the body absorb certain supplement better.However I found that when using it, it gives me heartburn or discomfort in my digestive tract.This may not be true for you, and I encourage you to try for yourself because if you can tolerate it, it seems to be a good thing to take along with certain supplements to help your body utilize them better.For me it gives me too much discomfort, even when I cut the tabs in half. Sometimes I can tolerate it, but sometimes not. YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this version of \\"low carb\\"","review":"I was surprised at how much cooking with fast-acting carbohydrate flours this book required. It was meatless as the title promises but the sheer number of carbs in each recipe forced me to give it up before I had the opportunity to cook with it.

I do not even understand why the mixers felt compelled to speak louder than Miles in the music?

On the Corner and SHH were pretty good, they demonstrate a better accomplishment in mixing the music of Miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"may I puke now?","review":"the problem with the 20 something generation these days is thatthey've got short attention spans. they want everything fast without having to listen. they just want their STOOPID techno beat. if miles were alive today, its likely he would be turned on by the new things in music. but it would be done his way. and would never sound anything like this. dj spams (cam)version of \\"in a silent way\\" is a disgracei hope my rating shows ( - )(it doesn't (...)). its sad that some people will actually believe this IS miles. WE WANT MILES, not spew from a turntable ."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is ACID JAZZ NOT JAZZ!!!","review":"I would like to preface this review by saying that the reviews panning this album here are totally unfair. They are written by jazz fans, fans of Miles Davis. They have no exposure nor do they have an interest in Acid Jazz. Acid Jazz is only related to \\"traditional jazz\\" because it uses jazz samples over its \\"Trip-Hop\\" beats. This is a pretty d&&& good Acid Jazz album and certainly warrants a look for fans of the genre. I myself am a big fan of Acid Jazz, but I'm also a jazz musician and can understand how foreign this album would sound to the jazz listening mainstream. However, Miles was always up for a radical change and you can rest assured that if he was around he would full-heartedly endorse this work and probably would be in the works of putting together Acid Jazz recordings himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"It's hard to imagine that an album featuring Miles Davis can be this bad. The re-mixers have taken some tremendous Davis music and added amateurish drum machine rhythms that have little or no relationship to the music. The drum patterns sound like the old, el-cheapo boxes and have no originality or interest. They only serve to obscure the trumpet. The remix of In a Silent Way is ridiculous -- the sublime beauty of the original is turned into a bad techno song.I don't dislike the effort to blend Davis and modern beats (I even like Doo-Bop), but this album is awful. The Laswell version on Panthalassa is light years better."},{"rating":"1","title":"some sorry sh*t","review":"I'm absolutely astounded. OK, the one listenable track is Bill Laswell's mix of the 'Helen Butte' from On the Corner. The outstanding insult of the set is DJ Cam's both unintentionally hilarious and tragic remix of the gorgeous 'In a Silent Way,' which is now reworked with a lame-ass hip-hop thing dominating and what sounds like a dog barking or whatever. Gag. It's a friggin' shame, really is. avoid Doc scott's 'remix' of 'Rated X' which is such a boneheaded ego trip just as is the rest of the album that I have to fight off the strong desire to regret spending even a cent or a second on this steaming turd of an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"miles plays keyboard on 'rated x'...","review":"this is more of a comment on the slip-shod reviewing on the part of the amazon reviewer. miles does not play trumpet on 'rated x'. i would think that a reviewer would have to be familiar with the original material before he/she is able to write a decent review. obviously, this feeling is not universally shared."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal with the price?","review":"I bought a pair of these on here for 2/14.99 and I thought they were great. Then, I went to buy two more and the price was $99 for a single bowl. I figured it had to be a mistake so I emailed the seller. I never got a reply from them but two days later the price was 14.99 for a single bowl. These are cool bowls but they are not $15 dollars cool.

This album conjures up ideas of Nico running into Berry Gordy at a Phillip Glass concert, circa 1971. Moody, catchy, at times funky and/or dissonant, \\"Afterglow\\" is a prime example of what the 90's have given to 'pop'. Outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooring","review":"I had heard so much hype about Dot Allison, I ran straight out and bought the single \\"Colour Me\\" when it was released. I loved it...it was absolutely fantastic. Terrific slow but sexy bass groove, breathy vocals, and very soundscape-y. When Afterglow was released, I rushed out and bought it on the strength of the debut single. I quickly realized that Colour Me was easily the best song on the album and the rest of it was boring, sleep-inducing pabulum. I like to call it \\"album filler,\\" the filling you stuff in around the few good songs. It's far too shoegazey and not interesting enough for me. It appeals to some people, but I like for my music to actually have a pulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was so displeased with this CD. I don't like Dot's breathy, barely-there vocals & the only song that caught my attention was \\"I Wanna Feel the Chill\\", & that was only because of the Tim Buckley sample used, which pretty much made the song.

Wrong! Here are my issues with them:1) They do not absorb liquid, so if something wet is placed on them the liquid is going to simply roll off the agate and onto the coffee table. Example: a typical cup from a fast food joint when the ice melts and condenses on the outside of the cup. That made its way to my coffee table pretty quick.2) They are too small. I wouldn't put anything bigger on them than a shot glass or a wine glass. Yes, they can handle a pint glass (or equivalent) but that's cutting it pretty close.3) No rubber feet at the bottom to protect a glass coffee table, which I assume many people have.

So his thought is that a man who was perhaps wounded and captured in battle is unworthy of honor. I find that to be appalling. My father sign up to fight as soon as he turned 18. He was shot and subsequently captured during the Battle of the Bulge. He endured beatings, interrogation, and starvation for his country.

I love blur and i have seen them live in nyc, philly, seatle (on this new tour) and winston salem. i have preached the gospel of blur to anyone who would listen. let me implore to damon---------take your risks, but never forget how to write a good song. that is your greatest gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Blur was one of my favorite bands of the 90s. I particularly liked their Britpop phase but also enjoyed Blur and 13. (Leisure never really did it for me, though it had a couple of catchy songs on it). This new album is far from Blur's best. It's mushy, buzzy, and dull. I've listened to it twice now and none of the songs stick with me. Some of them already positively annoy me. If you are a real Blur fan, you will probably want to check it out yourself anyway, but if you are looking to start somewhere with this band, start elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, upon a listen of 13, I take back my initial 3 stars...","review":"Originally 3 stars, I have now, in a moment of musical sanity, demoted this ablum to 2 stars. This is due to the listening of Blur's album \\"13\\". I just couldn't take this new one again, so I pulled 13 from my cd collection and realized - again - what a gem it is. Deep, textured, progressive. Everything Think Tank isn't. I'd of rather waited years longer to hear something worthy of Blur, even without Coxon. Granted...Granted, Alex James bass on Think Tank has never been better. I'll give em that. But nothing more.Instead of buying this album, if you don't own a Blur album, purchase 13. Caramel and Trim Trab are two of the better rock songs recorded in the last decade. They stand strong and able next to anything Radiohead has done.With the departure of Graham Coxon - and I hate to say it - Blur should've broken up. This album is testament to why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blur ever","review":"This is without doubt the best blur record ever.

I've been listening to them since their first CD came out, and have always been impressed with their ability to change with every album... until I heard Think Tank for the first time. When I first popped this one into the CD player, I was practically humming with excitement, at least until I started listening to it. As a fan of their more acoustic stuff (my favorite song is \\"This is a Low\\"), I must say that I was disappointed, but as I listened to the CD the second time through, it really started to grow on me. After the third, it hasn't left my CD player. For all those out there who aren't too fond of the \\"new\\" sound of Blur - try it, you might be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Graham = No Go","review":"I am a Blur fan, have been for a long time.

Not up to the standard of the magnificent \\"13\\", but pleasing all the same. Tracks like 'Ambulance', 'Sweet Song' and 'Out of Time' are all worthy additions to the Blur songlist.However, this album still only gets 1 star because of EMI's stunningly stupid copy protection system. I tried playing this on no less than four CD players, and I had trouble with all of them. Either I got a strange clicking in the left stereo channel, the first track would refuse to play, or the entire CD would refuse to play. I guess that the guys at EMI were too busy (doing what?) to actually try playing this CD in a couple of CD players before they went and soiled it with their Copy Control scheme.In summary, EMI has gone and ruined a perfectly good record. I can't honestly recommend this, because everyone I know who got it has had serious problems playing it. I know I'll be taking my copy back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"I didn't really like Blur's greatest hits, but thought I'd borrow this disc anyway. Bad idea. Experimental is a good way of saying \\"really bad\\". This is a perfect example of that satirical line. They don't even bother having proper melodies. I guess one could say that they \\"over-thought\\" this album. The irony is that it was their best selling album in the US according to the album's Wikipedia article - I guess an unique/interesting cover can sell sometimes. This album makes me want to try writing music again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I bought this album hoping for a continuation of the type of music to be found on their best-of CD. Instead, I ended up with a disjointed, boring collection of very similar sounding tracks. I think they could've tried harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I am just haunted by this CD. Damon Albarn et al have taken various musical influences, notably African/Middle Eastern, and concocted a beautifully textured set of music that somehow all comes together in the end. All of the tracks end up bouncing around in your head at some point, and you can't get them to leave, you just end up listening again. The band's experimentation with different sounds to make up for Graham's departure, if that is what happened, has resulted in a fascinatingly diverse CD that simply mesmerizes you from beginning to end. Stunningly beautiful and brilliant, this CD surpasses anything this accomplished band has done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it becuase it makes me feel good.","review":"The songs on this cd are so different from one and another but come together so good. So little bands take the time to make such a fluid listening experience anymore. I know all musicians want to make more money, but the great musicians just have a different ratio from Love of music/Love of money. This Album has funk, soul, rock, but unmistakingly is rock. With blur's lead singers vocals that stretch on for miles and draw you in to it just that much more, but with versatility to make you want to move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blur Album","review":"So many have said that Blur is not the same with Graham Coxon, which is true.

What a great surprise!","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this CD since I had only heard one of the songs \\"Out of Time\\".

Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Tank","review":"They may have lost their lead guitarist but they haven't lost soul. Blur's latest LP, Think Tank refreshes old tricks and brings new hooks to create a great Brit-Pop album. The tracks range from mellow melodical tunes like \\"Out of Time\\" to white knuckle rock riffed tracks like \\"Crazy Beat\\" to beat ridden, effects laiden songs like \\"On My Way To The Club.\\" It's obvious that singer Damon Albarn quite enjoyed his work on his side project \\"The Gorillaz.\\" It shows on Think Tank. It spans from rock to pop to hip hop to eastern style Arabic-like music. With the absence of their lead guitarist they make-up for it with driving bass-lines (like in the nearly instrumental pounding \\"Jets\\") and bizzare sound effects (like in the Song 2ish \\"Crazy Beat\\"). Blur is back and ready to rock the house, or club, or whatever. 8/10 Highlights: \\"Crazy Beat\\" \\"Out of Time\\" \\"On My Way To The Club\\" \\"Battery in Your Leg\\" \\"Jets\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Blur is Back.. woohooo!","review":"What's going on here? All of a sudden there's plenty of good, deep music coming out. We probably won't hear any of it on the radio, but thank God the music exists. My favorite track at the moment is \\"On The Way To The Club\\", but there's plenty of textural echoey guitars and percolating synths on a lot of the songs, and they all cradle Damon's voice so nicely. Other cds I've gotten recently ...include Coldplay, Travis, Pat Ortman's The Wow Signal, Peter Gabriel's Up, and Billy Corgin's new band."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need Quicktime player to view the 4 bonus tracks.","review":"In order to view the 4 bonus tracks, you need to play the cd on the computer, either a PC or a Mac.

Psychedelic, textured, space rock is not out of place in Franklin's past catalog with Swervedriver. With Toshack Highway Franklin fine tunes his gift for writing melodic space sculptures that bloom. Needless to say there is more going on here that you first hear. With repeated listens the finely crafted layers emerge to create amazing soundscapes of various sounds and melodies all playing off one another. A highly recommended headphone disc for those of you that enjoy Swervedriver's softer moments. Surely to please those that truly understand the magical, musical complexities that Adam Franklin has created over the years.

This will be their first concert and there are many problems facing them, like getting a responsible chaperone to take them to the concert. Also, Madison and Fiona start to realize that something is wrong with Aimee. She is not eating at all and she keeps saying that she's fat. I think this is a great book and if you are a fan of the series, you should definitely check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book","review":"I love the Madison Finn books!

They might look perfect but they might not act nice. All the books have a great moral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste your time","review":"So, reading the other reviews I felt compelled to add my thoughts. Someone said earlier, glad to see someone from bean town getting props. What the heck dude? Mr. Lif. There are so many awesome artists from this area, don't spend your money on a band whose career has been made through disses. I don't like Eminem, but Benzino and the Made Men, have 'Made' themselves by jacking others fame. I like the guest work, but the guests are better than the group itself. Get there stuff. Guests can be useful but they usually show that a band is lacking talent when overused. I listened to this album and wished I could get my money back. It's not even worth selling, I wouldn't want to screw anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"My goodness! This is the worst hip hop album I ever heard in my life!

This album is utter rubbish. There's no saying further. The guest appearances are what make it worth, but for Master P (What da...?) to outshine them in song, then they must really suck. Really. 4 1/2 mics. Benzino said he's the 5 mic giver. Now I understand what he means.

I can't believe anyone would give this movie five stars, no matter how much they appreciate the sentiment...Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible film.

He knew them by heart. I bought these figuring I would add to the collection, but they are completely different. They are still fun and enjoyable, but a different kind of book. This is more of a math code book. Little stories are told about the familiar characters trying to decipher Mrs. Jewels' math problems. The trick is, the problems are done with letters and words instead of numbers and the kids have to use logic and code-breaking to figure out how the numbers work out. There are clues and hints throughout the book and it's really interesting for the kids. But it is not necessarily the same kind of kid who enjoyed the regular wayside school books, so buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"The book that I have read is called Sideways Arithmetic From Wayside School.The autor and the publisher of this book are Louis Sachar and Scholastic.What I like most in this book is the logical questions.The questions which have mentioned in this book is about mathematics and logical thinking.It really suitable for me whom I am a science student.It makes me think very deeply on the questions and improve my logical thinking a lot!I would highly recommend to all of my friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this would be like the other Wayside School Books","review":"My son didn't like this book because it wasn't actually a reading book, it's just math problems.

It is too difficult for a young reader. Most adults or older teenagers would probably enjoy it but only if they love math. My 9 year old child said it gave her a headache. My child was given this book at school to read and expected to do the problems in it. Some of the problems required math skills she has not even been introduced too. It is simply too hard for young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very good","review":"I bought this a month a ago and used it weekly to carry large boxes from a place 1/2 mile away from my home.

This one fit the bill nicely. It's inexpensive and light and it rolls. Simple to assemble, folds up quickly, easy to toss into the trunk of the car. Only small complaint might be with the spring loaded bar that traverses the width of the platform and serves to lock the handle in an upright position.

I have listened to and loved JMT for years, so I ordered this CD before release based on what was said about it in his newsletter. Imagine my chagrin when, instead of the beautiful, spiritual music I had expected, I found all this rock 'n roll (saxaphones!) and according to the liner notes \\"just having a good time with friends.\\" It sounds like not very good Crosby, Stills, and Nash, especially with that B3 organ. \\"Devotion\\" and \\"Walk and Follow Jesus\\" are the only classic JMT on this one.

It flies really nice in 10-15 mph wind. The trailing edge hums a lot but I like the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Surprising","review":"This kite is great. I have a Prism 4D. This kite needs a bit more wind, and with that, it is much more sturdy than the 4D. Setting up the leading edges requires one to use their head so that they do not break the connectors. The leading edge connection on the lower edges need to be pushed down and disconnected from the sail before being seated. If this is done, you won't break the connectors. Use your head and do not force these things from extreme angles and you will NOT break the kite on the first assembly. This thing can be adjusted for extreme fast and tight turns. Very fun kite that will pull you forward if you underestimate it's ability to harness the wind. Happy flying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kite for the $$$","review":"This kite is amazing (when I can actually fly it). I'm in the upper midwest and we don't get too many days windy enough to actually fly this. But, when we do, WOW.This thing is a great all-around kite.It's durable, yet light.It's easy to use, yet rewarding to master.It's size is impressive. So many people stop to watch it,.The carrying case is also awesome. Flying this is my favorite hobby. I just wish I could fly it more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome flying fun!","review":"This is an excellent kite to have hours of fun with at the beach or a park. At first it was a little difficult to control (the first 10 mins) after which it is sheer pleasure.Great colors and sturdy construction allows for this kite to crash hard and still survive.Definitely worth the money - but be careful flying it around people, it has the potential to move very fast at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more.....","review":"I've flown many lesser costing HQ sport kites and have always heard positive comments about the Prism Quantum. I'm not a real fan of Prism's 4 piece leading edge setup, its kind of cheap. Prism spent too much time trying to figure out how to make this kite dismantle into small pieces to fit into a small well designed pouch. I don't really see the purpose in breaking the spreader bar into two pieces, all those connectors to hold the rods together just add weight.My sons $26 HQ Quickstep with a good line set can out perform the Quantum. And the HQ is in 4 main pieces, not 8 pieces with connectors. I'd like to see a new Quantum designed without all the connectors. Who cares if the case is 10 inches longer, as long as it fits in your trunk.Paying premium money for the Prism name doesn't make sense here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product, poor experience","review":"This has been a frustrating experience of sorts. When I received the kite, the casing is stained with dirt. Inside there is more surprises! The sail of the kite is stained with black dirt and color run markings. I really wonder if this is a new item! When I emailed Prism, there has been no response. The kite is a good quality kite and flys well, but this poor shopping experience has hindered my future purchase decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for beginners. Spend your $100 elsewhere.","review":"First off, the kite came broken. I did my best to overlook that and figured it was just bad shipping. Either way it doesn't give Prism a good name.In short, this kite is not recommended for beginners.1. -It doesn't fly in well in light winds, (5mph or less)2. -The plastic connecting rods used on the leading edges where the wings fold for storage easily snap.I had just crashed the kite and was practicing the cartwheel launch where the kite starts nose down on the ground resting on one leading edge and you roll the kite into the launch position. I've done this maneuver many times with my $50 kite,so it caught me by surprise when the plastic connecting rod snapped in half.If you happen to know what you are doing, I could see how this could be a fun kite. When it did fly, it flew well. However, I really do not recommend this kite. Especially if you are new to flying. Or in my case, a kite to begin learning more advanced tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to fly and lots of fun","review":"I wish I lived on a windy beach where I could pull out my stunt kite more often.I have had a blast the the Quantum I purchased about two years ago.

An Ex-Mickey Mouse Clubber, Christina sang and danced with the likes of Britney Spears and pop group *Nsync, although Christinas vocals are hardly on the same level as her peers. Debuting at #1 on the Billboard Charts, this album has gotten the praise it deserves. Though it may be tainted with some teeny bop-esque lyrics and bubble-gum beats, demonstrated on Come On Over, and Genie In A Bottle, other tracks live up to Christina's talent.

It's represented here as 43 Classics, but these are not the classic hit recordings of these songs... they're all re-records made in 1995 (for I suppose the sake of making money that wasn't being made from the original records which were far superior to these). To put it in a nutshell, this collection is simply \\"Re-fried Hag\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-recordings.

Instead I read a book about a young lady whom was a court reporter during some of the trials and what she saw/heard.True some acounts are harrowing and emotional but not enough to live up to the unworthy title of \\"Doctor's From Hell\\".I had a few friends whom stated they wished to read this book when I was done and I told every single one of them that it isn't worth their time. I'll tell you the same. There are plenty of books out on this subject that give you a real sense of what happned and the evil people whom were responsible.I was really hoping this book was going to live up to expectations but sadly it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Author","review":"The author of this book is a court reporter, which is a ridiculously bloated way of saying \\"typist.\\" That is all court reporters do, they take dictation. Yet, Vivien Spitz fancies herself a novelist, and she wastes rodiculous amounts of space and time narrating stories about herself instead of sticking to the topic of the book. As the author, she contributes nothing, and one would be better off simply reading the actual transcripts of the trials.The factual information in the book is the only interesting content, but to get the facts, the reader has to muddle through incessant personal stories about the typist."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This book is a very dry mix of court transcripts and clinical descriptions. It was a difficult and boring read of what should be a fascinating subject. I would prefer to read the STORY, not clincal and legal descriptions. I'm sure there must be good books that are captivating and easy to read on this subject but this is not one of them. This book was a waste of money and a huge disappointment.

Makeba, Queen of Soth African song, is exciting and soulful as ever. The arrangements are subtle and tasteful.

If Bluetooth head set is active, and incoming call, phone doesn't ring at phone, only rings at headset which must be in ear to hear it = Many lost calls. Takes time to link up. If you get 15 t0 30 feet away, Bluetooth connection is lost and you have to relink it to phone. Too many aggrivating nuancices to list.The good comments; Unit does fit in ear well and comfortable.When used at short distances and at mostly line of sight it performs well and is better than a wired ear bud.

Low quality video, annoying music playing non-stop, and the narrator was really difficult to pay attention to, as his voice was rather grating and reminds me of children's educational shows from decades ago. I suppose I was expecting a BBC production and got, well, a video that offers very little insight to China as it really is, through a video that does not, at all, seem like it was from 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"This only contains 1 CD and 12 songs","review":"The description of what you recieve is incorrect.

The study of international relations is a humanity, and the attempt to turn it into a science necessarily drains it of all that is interesting or useful in human affairs.

Yes a \\"post it\\" sticker is what the company sent the book with- to work as one of the pages. I can understand a little wear and tear, but, when actual parts and words of the book are missing- you shouldn't sell it!!!

I enjoyed the quick read very much, but felt a great deal was left out too. The viewpoint of the angels makes this series unique. The author uses creativity while holding to basic biblical teachings. I wish the story had been longer and a bit more in depth, as there were some issues during this period of time that are complex and have been interpreted many ways. This is not a series for the serious Bible student, but it is certainly an enjoyable journey that ends too soon. I'll definitely complete the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farr fails as an historian and excells as painter with broad","review":"brush strokes. Never before have I read such conjecture...truly, I am appalled by the liberties Farr takes in construing the facts to suit her case. Indeed, I too am of the opinion that Marie Antoinette and Fersen were lovers; however nothing concrete has ever surfaced in any correspondence before and after the Queen's death to concusively determine the exact nature of the relationship. According to the publisher, Farr makes use of previously unpublished documents...really? Which ones? Did I miss something? This message is less a review to benefit other readers than a severe admonition to Farr: you have given the public nothing with this tissue of loosely woven fantasy...seemingly your fantasy. Stanley Loomis wrote the definitive book on this subject with The Fatal Friendship. Don't flatter yourself, Farr."},{"rating":"2","title":"The character of a man.......","review":"Heimel's first book was good, this one was excellent. Even if you're not a crime-fighing history buff, this chronology of Ness' life strikes an optimistic cord concerning what ultimately matters in life. Ness made plenty of mistakes in his life, but the testimony to man's efforts at doing the right thing is inspirational. He was not the person Hollywood portrayed him to be, but in some sense, he was much, much, more. This second edition is full of new information and insight. Just as you may find that the \\"professional\\" movie critics reviews didn't jibe with how you felt about a movie, you'll most likely come to the same conclusion about this book. Read it yourself. It's well worth the effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job, author!","review":"I am familiar with the efforts the author made to compile this significant title and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Eliot Ness, the man. He was a significant American crimefighter. Sad to see that he died under such difficult circumstances, never knowing he would become a legend. A very good read! Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, but marred by fictitious statements","review":"The story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchables is a fascinating saga of American culture, and Paul Heimel does a wonderful job of writing an intriguing, swiftly moving story. He's an excellent writer, and what is particularly noteworthy is the fact that he interviewed so many people who knew Eliot Ness. Unfortunately, he also includes verbatim conversation between his characters (since he wasn't there how did he know what they said?) and even quotes what the long-dead people were thinking! Researchers will wish that an index was included in the book, and the bibliography could have been improved with titles in italics, quotation marks around articles, and page numbers included where appropriate. Still, the book is a great read, and it will surely be enjoyed by all interested in the Gangster Era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a mad black woman","review":"I really loved it.

I am proud of Tyler Perry for taking a stand and showing Hollywood what a good quality movie is all about. GOD allowed movies to be made and when they don't show Jesus the movie is not worth it.

But as a movie, Diary of a Mad Black Woman will certainly be in contention for worst movie of the year.The characters were comically overdrawn. The dialogue was so forced the theater laughed in all the wrong places. The humor wasn't funny or even possible for that matter. The romance wasn't romantic it was so cheesy and sadly uneventful I wanted my money back. The two leading men were laughable characatures of good and evil. The women were insanely wounded or ridiculously strong. ZERO subtlety and even less originality. I've seen it done better, a lot.

None of thebrilliant actors from the classic BBC production took part in thismess, and it was justly despised by all fans and slammed by most UKcritics. The warmth and charm such talented actors like Robin Ellis(as the title character), Angharad Rees, Ralph Bates, Clive Francisand Judy Geeson put into the original series is totally missinghere. If you want faultless performances, theater-like atmosphere andgood quality television (mostly filmed on videotape, except for theoutdoor scenes), then you're best advised to wait for BBC to releasethe whole original series on DVD (soon please !!!) or stick with yourgood old VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellish!","review":"OK, I admit I'm a fan of the orginal but, being aware that the original cast were not involved I approached this with an open mind. I came away with one burning question. Had any of the casting department actually read any of the books???The saving grace could have been the presence of Fiona Victory. In the (much lamented) absence of Judy Geeson, she could have made a very credible Caroline Enys. I have seen Ms Victory in other roles and know that she could have brought the right qualitites to the role. However, she was prevented from doing that by the dreadful screenplay.In short, my advice is stick to the books or buy the BBC series.

It is fragmented and does not have the quality the original series has. If you have enjoyed the series from the BBC, you should purchase the complete series from Amazon UK (you do need to have a region free DVD player though). It is an investment, which gives about 24 hours of addicting televison. Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees are perfectly cast as Ross and Demelza Poldark. And although the series also strays from the books sometimes, it keeps the overall story intact. Of course production values are always less than with comtemporary movies or productions, but I find that good acting and a good script are more important. It is a shame though that they have edited the series (for contractual reasons it says on the cover of the DVD box) and I always wonder why."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - But Not the Entire Story","review":"I expected something a little different when I bought this Title.

Approximately three of the twelve drawers I installed were this way. I ended up drilling my own holes in order to line the channels up.The wood facing is occasionally rough with whorls plugged with putty that does not stain and blend well with the rest of the wood.The slides are of mediocre quality and bind easily. The drawer operation is very dependent upon the spacing between the tower sides, but this is hard to keep at the ideal dimension (24 1/8\\") as the tower sides are often warped.Overall the drawer feel is lightweight and cheap.

Compared to that album, this is absolutely horrible. Songs lack variation, creativity, and depth. I realize many people attach these descriptions to all of nu-metal, but I feel their first album achieves all three despite the musical style.Anyway, back to this travesty:Wayne's vocals have two modes on this album: distorted to the point of sounding like the chipmunks and trying to scream with no lungs to back it up.I would've given it 1 star, but I've heard worse.

What bugs me is their inability to craft an entire, cohesive album. Machine was a highlight of their career, but also somewhat immature, thoughtless. Shadow Zone appeared out of nowhere and consequently went nowhere. So I was hoping Static-X had learned from their mistakes (including that child-molestation crap) w/ Start a War. Tracks 1-6 are incredibly promising. But they lost me w/ Track 7 the minute I heard Wayne whining about being, ahem, \\"a piece of ass.\\" Note to Mr. Static: I don't ever want to hear about ass unless you're kicking it! And to sum it up, the rest of the songs only go downhill from there, which is not a reason to purchase this album. I'd download the first half from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 4th Album","review":"Before this album i really had no order of importance to my Static-X cd collection. It really brings everything home as a culmination into one cohesive sound for the band,which is awesome(i think that may have been an undestatement).This is the end product of their sound over the past few years after Wisconsin Death Trip with the brooding Electronica tinged Thrash Metal, the slightly more automated Machine and the Melodic and surprisingly good Shadow Zone.Each CD i enjoyed and each CD added to the sound of Static-X. Having been a fan of their music since Wisconsin Death Trip i cant wait for their next one(especially since the original lineup is back together except for the absent Ken Jay)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to shabby.","review":"I have been anticipating the release of this album for quite some time. As with their last 2 albums (Beneath,Between, Beyond not included)it takes a few times listening to it to get into it. My only problem with this album is that it doesn't have as many fast paced songs with a driving, insane beat. That is the reason I started listening to Static X in the first place. It was good music to drive fast to. I end up hitting the skip button through all of the slow songs, and only listening to the fast ones. Of course this holds true with all of the cds I listen too.

However, there are not many songs on this album that I can say really grab me as the old Static X of the past had done. I do like, \\"Skinnyman\\" being my favorite of this album, and have given, \\"Otsego Amigo\\" a fair liking without all the lyrical screeching would have been better, but it has a nice beat, \\"I'm the One\\" has a small part in my heart as well. Without offending I would have to honestly say in my opinion buy, \\"Wisconsin Deathtrip, Machine, and if you have to buy another static x album buy Shadow Zone\\" I really like, \\"Kill your idols, and So\\"..

The graphics are good and so are the levels, but one problem. If you're playing online, you'll need a fast internet connection so you don't have any/some lag. If you're using 56k, I would suggest you stay with a ping of 240 and below. If it goes higher than that, I suggest you quit. I have a 56k, so I only chose that much ping. Don't get DSL because you like this game, if you have multiple reasons to get it, get it. It would just be waste of money if you just got it for this game. I would've given it a 5 stars, but it needs very fast computers and fast internet connections. I have a fast PC, but slow connection.

In fact, in order to match the smoothness I had in Tribes 1 (with a P2-350 and Voodoo 2 video), I had to turn the detail levels ALL down and even then it was choppy if there was another character on the screen. (and when you have all the detail levels down, the characters look like triangle skeletons and the ground and buildings look like blurred vomit).So, I guess... judge for yourself.

Most all of the weapons are slow firing weapons firing slow projectiles making it frustrating to deal with the vast distances you encounter in the game. Think slow Team Fortress grenade launcher on a very large outdoor map. \\"You hit the guy! was he standing still?\\". . . 3. Steep learning curve. I never played the original Tribes and it is taking a while to learn all the controls and options. . . Overall I find Tribes 2 to be a dissapointment. Counter Strike is still my favorite.

Anyway, I snuggled up with \\"Too Much Tuscan Sun\\" and was greatly rewarded with a fresh and bright approach to travel writing. Needless to say, I immediately ordered book two, \\"Confessions\\" and was equally delighted. So much so that I sent Dario an email and we've been connecting ever since. Truth be told, it's the natural unfolding of a human journey divided into three volumes told with an innocence that I found extremely appealing. Don't miss one page of Dario's trilogy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected more \\"mature\\" writing. While there were some nice passages describing the landscape and the general ambiance of the area, the writing often felt juvenile and sophomoric when describing his impressions of people and their adventures. He leaves the impression of a smart aleck who gets his kicks from mocking people. It's not only Americans whom he mocks, but also those from Florence and Pisa as well. The juvenile delinquent that he admits he was when he was a teenager still shines through in his writing. I have no doubt that he respects his country, but his lack of respect for people would make me think twice about hiring him as a tourguide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick trip to Tuscany","review":"This book is a humorous look at the making of a small-group tour guide from the Chianti area, along with a collection of stories about his (mostly American) clients. The reader may roll his or her eyes at the antics of somec clients (really, 5\\" heels for a walk through an ancient castle and vineyard), but the author pokes fun gently and we all recognize the discomfort that can occur when traveling outside our normal cultures, and the odd behaviosr that can result from it. In addition, this is a good look at the famed Palio race from the point of view of someone directly involved. A good read and travel guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, charming read","review":"This is a charming book. English-born Tuscan resident Dario leads tours of his beloved countryside for foreigners. It's the perfect book to read on a plane, and would make a great gift for anyone thinking of going to Italy.Is this an official travel guide for Tuscany? No. It contains just enough tantalizing details about the country, the wine and the people to make the reader want to investigate further. Is it insulting to Americans? Of course not. Dario's anecdotes about some of his clients are humorous, and every tour guide around the world can tell similar stories about foreign tourists, whatever their country of origin. It seems that the only negative reviews here are from Americans, which speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a wicked look at American tourists","review":"You've got to be able to laugh at yourself to enjoy this because there is bound to be a description of his odder customers that hits close to home. His perspective is balanced; he clearly indicates that the descriptions of the strangest folks are very much out of the norm and most of his clients are wonderful folks. So his depictions are quite funny, real characters.I enjoyed learning a bit about his progression towards his profession and his reflections on life in Chianti.It is a quick and pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"does he even like Americans?","review":"Given his 10-plus years of guiding Americans on small, personalized tours of Chianti, it sure seems like Signor Castagno can't stand us. I'm sorry - there are three groups he did enjoy. One joined him in moral superiority regarding capital punishment, one toured with him multiple times each year, and one couple named their child after him.So, if you'd like to cringe and feel embarrassed and then angry (after rebuking his clients for characterizing Italians based on encountering only a few, he does the same to Americans), this is a great book. If you'd like to enjoy tales of an expat's experiences in the Mediterranean region, try Peter Mayle."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH TUSCAN SUN","review":"As a dual citizen of USA and Italy--I am going to have to agree with Valerie that this book is snotty and actually offensive to all tourists who may travel to Italy. We live part-time in Italy. I have at this point in my life lived on both sides of this book--as a tourist in the beginning and now as a citizen of this wonderful country. I was initially attracted to this book because I did not like Frances Mayes' \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\". First of all, this book is boring. If you are looking for a book that details step by step the Chianti Region, obtain this information in a tour book. In addition, after reading comment after comment of Dario's feelings toward \\"the hand that feeds him\\" I hope that he doesn't think this book is going to increase his business. Save your money and time in reading this book, if you read it, you may think Italy and its people aren't as gracious and welcoming as they really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Insipid, condescending, arrogant, this book manages to look down not only on Americans but also on other Italians, whom he characterizes as short, dark and moustached. The only interesting part about this book is the story behind the Palio and the rivalry among various Tuscan cities, otherwise just skip this poor excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"The premise of this book sounded great; after all, who to better tell funny stories about what so many of us have seen (which isn't pretty) when traveling abroad than such a tour guide?But this book is a major let-down. Sure, he had someone make a pass at him, and some drank too much, and some were late --but that's about as far as his anecdotes go. The encounters he talks about are neither odd, unusual nor amusing enough to make the book worthwhile. Maybe something was lost in translation. The writer does sound pleasant, and maybe that's the problem: he's just too nice to make this interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had loved it, but................","review":"The title really caught my eye. I loved the Mayes book, and was hoping for perhaps the 'other side'. Plus, having travelled alot in Tuscany, I looked forward to the tidbits and warm sunshiny exploits. The writing was sadly not compelling, and although I did read it through to the end (\\"maybe the next chapter will have the gem...\\") I never found the good parts. It says to me that, even with the potential of great content, the storytellers skills need to be masterful to have a home run. It's not in this book, sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snotty, snide and hateful","review":"I was looking forward to this book with the high hopes that it might be the equal of \\"Extra Virgin\\" or Peter Mayle's Provencal tales.Instead, Mr. Castagno lines up a procession of exaggerated examples of the protoypical \\"ugly Americans\\" abroad. Oh, yes, there's at least one American he liked and didn't make fun of (much). Overall, though, he prefers to paint the vast majority of Americans abroad as uncultured, ignorant buffoons.I can't imagine any American ever being willing to hire Mr. Castagno as a guide again, not after reading the apparent level of contempt in which he appears to hold us.

He, because he is so superior in every way, ridicules these people for things like their lack of knowledge of Italian history, being fat and out of shape and, in his view, stupid and rude. He really lets his American bashing run wild when he writes a full chaper on capital punishment. I don't need this from a \\"TOUR GUIDE\\". I'll be in Tuscany in 2 weeks and will not judge Italian people by this jerk. He needs a reality check. Wait! Isn't there an American cemetery near Florence filled with thousands of American G.I.'s who happened to have died bailing our his country so he, if he chooses, can conduct his tours in Italian rather than German? The book isn't even funny! He's a bully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book had the potential to be so much better. Unfortunately, it feels like it was only written to take advantage of Ms. Mayes' fame. Her books aren't favorites of mine, but at least she's sincere in her admiration of Italy and the Italians, and she can create a sweet turn of phrase occasionally.Don't look for good writing in this book - you won't find any. Castagno favors taking cheap shots at people who have paid him to be their guide. Just what we all want to do, right? Pay some guy to make fun of us, and read about what fools we are.I found his tales of juvenile delinquency (breaking into houses in the countryside and treating them as his own) more than a little off putting. He writes about it quite cavalierly, claiming boredom and having a good time with friends. In America, we call that breaking and entering - and people usually go to jail for it!I really disliked this book, and recommend that you look elsewhere for insights into the tour guide business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Sun Burned","review":"I have met several from Italy, and many obviously being quite materialistic.

I have lived in paradise-like places in the US and metropolitan cities elsewhere. Unlike this author, I can say that American tourists are talkative but friendly. I wonder how he would perceive waves of Asian tourists who travel in motor coaches and carry umbrellas under his Tuscan sun? I would rather read Bill Bryson's well-written \\"Neither here nor there--travels in Europe\\" to see how irritating Europeans equally are, not to mention how so cheap the men there are and try to hit on you without meaning anything.

No need for me to rehash the excellent reviews already written - I agree w/ those comments fully. I own many CDs w/ Elizabeth Wallfisch performing on a Baroque violin tuned to the proper pitch; as the name of the group suggests, 'enlightenment' is the key word - I guess an understanding of that difference between the pitch of this instrument and a modern violin would have led to the purchase of the appropriate CD, if 'playing along' w/ the music was the main reason for the acquisition? Oh, well - :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"After loving Mononoke and Spirited Away MANY times in the theatre, and loving Castle in the Sky on Dvd; this is probably one of the worst movies that I could imagine someone making of his calibur.

It's nothing like the others, its a Disneylike kid's movie - view and buy it strictly for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's up with the chapters","review":"Lovely movie about a 13 year old witch leaving home to complete her training. Nothing to add beyond what has already been said.However, I have found that on my primary DVD player, the last chapter (Gonna Fly and End Credits) will not play at all. It will play on other players, just not on mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad release","review":"One of my favorite movies Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have made. but the release that Buena Vista made is terrible. The original intro and end credits songs are gone and replaced with songs that have no rhythm. Not to mention the bad job on the dubbing. If your a fan of Miyazaki and wanna see this movie, dont buy this version, just buy a bootleg somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much needs to be said...","review":"Its a shame that all of Miyazaki's films aren't all released in theaters, and another that there is not a \\"Disney\\" section and a \\"Miyazaki\\" section at the video store. People simply don't know what they are missing when they see Kiki's in there with Air Bud and Land before time. Luckily, there is certainly talk of The Princess Mononoke being released in the theaters in the U.S., and Laputa: Castle in the Sky is set for release in October. After that, hopefully Disney will back up and release Future Boy Conan, The Crimson Pig, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind so that American audiences can all get what they've been missing. Kiki's is a delightful movie from one of the finest directors of our time. I have had the privelage of seeing Nausicaa and Laputa subtitled, and believe me, they are every bit as good as Kiki and Totoro. Buy this movie and watch for more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dip into Self Doubt, then Triumph","review":"Thursday, June 16, 2005 / 5 of 5 / A Dip into Self Doubt, then TriumphRounding out my viewing of early Miyazaki films prior to Princess Mononoke I arrived at Kiki's Delivery Service. Once again an original compelling idea from the great mind of the director. As a young witch coming of age, she sets out to find and make a town her own at the age of 13 along with her talking black cat. Unlike many of the earlier films this one shows a much more pensive and unsure side of a Miyazaki heroine. She has moments of self-doubt and loses her confidence in herself and her craft. Lovingly crafted, the flying scenes are again magical even with just the simple sound of the flapping of her black dress. No villains in this one, just a sweet story of a young girl trying to be all she can be and the town she adopts loving her back in Pollyanna style. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed DVD edition","review":"This review is forKiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD. Up until a recent move, when it went missing, we had a different DVD edition of this movie,Kiki's Delivery Service.If you're already used to any previous edition of the movie (VHS, DVD, just seeing it on The Disney Channel back in the day), you should know three things about this particular copy:1. They changed the intro song. The English song has been replaced with the Japanese song.2. The audio quality for dialogue is not as good. Actors often sound as if their voices are being projected through a fan.3. Some bits of dialogue have been removed (such as when Gigi used to say \\"They're calling you an egg stealer. And you don't want to know what else.\\" -he now just says \\"they're calling you an egg stealer\\" and it sounds noticeably clipped)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful story with beautiful graphics ...I bought it for my god daughter (age 2) & naturally I checked it out before giving it to her & I loved it so much I bought one for myself!

The animation is lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!","review":"I am not much of a fan of Disney films, and this film is why-it has such a great charisma and enchantment. Seeing advertisments for this film doens't do it any justice. The plot is simple yet slightly complex because for the character's changes throght the film. The music was fery fitting, although I tend to like the original music better. All in all, this is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the perfect way to enjoy anime!!","review":"There is too much to say about this movie to say it all here. Unlike many, I was fortunate to see this movie screened like a real movie at the Barbican center in London. It is simply amazing how easily you can be drawn into the growth of Kiki, as she gets used her new town, and as she discovers herself. I won't say any more, I would give it all away. However, I'll say this much for those who still haven't bought the film by now. It doesn't matter if you don't go for childrens movies, or if you're dead set against fantasy films, Kiki's delivery service is simply wonderful. The imagery is simply beautiful, the characters are realistic, and the plot is rich in detail. It lacks the cheap disney plot that make childrens movies dull and cliche, instead accurately portraying the troubles faced by a young girl on her own. A definite 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiki's Delivery Service","review":"When I saw this movie on Disney, I was totally shocked.I never thought a movie could be produced so fresh & unique.The storyline is amazing, & the characters fit in perfect with the basic story. The idea of this story is about a girl who has a talent of flying.She uses this talent to create a delivery service, but when she loses her confidence in herself, she loses her talent in flying.Kiki found out that all you need is a little faith to accomplish a big dream.Kiki had proven that she accomplished that dream, & she had gained her confidence back.This story has plenty of romance, fun, & entertainment for the whole family.You'll never get bored, because it reminds you that the only thing you need to accomplish a dream is faith.It also reminds you that the only thing you need to steer you in the right path is your heart.This movie is a classic, & I recommend this for everyone.Who knows, it might give you a answer you've been looking for so long.You can buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"You'd have to be one big iceberg not to love this film.

No point in reapeating these, they say all I think, My contribution to the reviews is simply Director Hayao Miyazaki is someone special. All his Anime are becoming classics, all are excellent, I have 2 now and I will be looking for more. All reviews of his other 4 productions I have searched have 4.5 - 5 ratings and I feel I can understand why after seeing those that I have, I cant wait to check out some more!.I am reasonablly new to anime, I am also an older person, I find some anime are fairly petty, pretty but sadly lack in storyline and depth. Cant say that for KIKI, It is a great story presented very well, and I recommend it to every one. I can also recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away.

It has been edited. It has been changed. Some of the best parts have been removed.When our daughter was small we watched this movie on VHS over and over again. We know it forward and back. This movie became our daughter's favorite film ever. When the VHS gave out and the movie had broken we began a search for the DVD replacement. We found this. Bought it and waited till Christmas to give it to her.It was the biggest smile of the day when she opened this gift.BUT it was also the biggest let down of the day when she watched it.I cannot stress it strongly enough that a film like this should not be tampered with.

It's a sweet, innocent, timeless story about growing up and trying to stay true to your heart. I'll admit, I cringed a bit when I heard that Disney had it and was going to dub it, considering the disasterous dub that was Sailormoon, but I was very pleasantly surprised! Aside from the bubblegum pop songs(which actually fit the story nicely)this is one of the better dubs I've come across. For the most part, it's a clear translation of the original script, the characters kept thier original personalities, and it's even most of the original score! And the voice cast is wonderful. All of the actors give solid, sincere performances in thier roles.

This movie is such a treasure. Breath-takingly crafted it's a visual experience worth taking time out of your day to enjoy. The story is fresh and surprisingly down to Earth considering the subject matter. It's focus is more on dealing with life as a thirteen year old girl than it is about being a witch. There are two bonuses if you have children: 1) There is not one inappropriate moment in this movie such as name calling or mild violence (which even Toy Story has). 2) My children like it more than Barney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiki is as adorable as any heroine in movie history.","review":"This is a movie to watch and cherish, even if you've never had kids. The animation, color, and English-dubbed performances are all wonderful, but I think the theme of this beautiful story will speak to adults perhaps even more dearly than to children!We're all like Kiki, trying to find our way in the world and hoping to make a living doing what we love... and we also know what it's like to feel like maybe we're not so special anymore, that we may never fit in, that our friends can't understand us anymore or that somehow we've \\"lost our magic.\\" Kiki may lose hers for awhile, but KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE never does for a moment.An absolute delight and one of my favorite movies EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankly, I like the English-dubbed version better.","review":"My wife and I saw the English-dubbed version first and then just saw the original Japanese one. Both are excellent, but frankly we like the English version better.More words are inserted in the English version to fill silences and pauses to enhance the visual effects. (Japanese tend to use more silences and pause during coversations. It is important to fill these not to bore Amercian audiences.)The translations were not always straight Japanese-to-Engligh conversions only to make the conversations more natural in English.Janeane Garofalo and the late Phil Hartman were excellent choices for these characters.Also, Sydney Forest's opening and closing songs are better suited for this particular animation film than Yumi Arai's.Again, both version are excellent. It is sometimes necessary to make some modifications to make the characters sound natural. The magical power of Hayao Miayzaki is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Animatad Movies I Have Seen","review":"Kiki's Delivery Service is one of the best movies I have seen.It has a great story and lots of enjoyable characters.I dont want to actualy tell any of the story just in case youv'e never seen it, but if your'e into cute stories this is one that always brings a smile to my face. You'll definitly will want to watch and enjoy this cute story."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Japanese/Spanish track confusion","review":"The Japanese Language audio track has a critical mistake. The final chapter is not in Japanese, but it is in Spanish! The Spanish track has this chapter also in Spanish, so it is not merely switched.

Can you say, BORING? I was enticed by all the rave reviews and saw the movie, but I lived to regret it. Horribly done, the story leaves little to the imagination. My advice, if curiousity drives you mad, see the movie. But if you can, avoid it entirely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it's me but ...","review":"OK, I have this video that my 3 year old daughter absolutely loves, and quite probably can't live without. I swear, I've seen it more than 100 times, and I still have no clue what the point of the movie is. I'm just not getting it. I'm not trying to offend anyone with this, but it just seems to go on and on and on with an insipid dialogue that doesn't really lead anywhere - though admittedly, the animation is great. I'm a great fan of Kirsten Dunst, and I also own Princess Mononoke and I love it - so it isn't the voice-over, Miyazaki (or anime!) that I have a problem with. Sorry, but I can't give this better than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, but nice","review":"Kiki's Delivery Service has some nice and smooth animation, but other than the eye candy, this anime is sorely lacking in story and imagination. I was hoping and expecting a lot more from this movie. The most imaginative thing is a girl that flies on a broom, a talking cat, and a kid riding a bike with a propeller. That's it. No creatures, no far-out worlds, and most glaringly, NO ACTION. I can't believe this movie came from the same mind that created 'Spirited Away'. 'SA' was most everything this is not: intriging, imaginative, exciting.I'm amazed at how many 5-star reviews Kiki's Delivery Service has received - it is not deserving of 5 stars at all. It is boring, and ultimately, disappointing. I hope 'Castle in the Sky' and 'Princess Mononoke' are infinitely better than this let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Althought the video was in good condition, it was in Japanese. I purchased the video for my three year old who saw clips of the \\"english\\" version on another movie. The description stated that Kirsten Dunst was doing the voice of Kiki so I assumed that meant I was getting the english version. I guess I can't expect the final product to be what it states when I only paid $1.84. I don't know if I would purchase something again as next time I may not get off so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A honest review from a normal person","review":"I am tired of anime nuts rating everything 5 stars. After seeing Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Princes Monoke, I was a Miyazaki fan. I immediatly bought Kiki's delivery service in hopes of another masterpeice.

You might enjoy it if you are 3 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiki's Amazing","review":"I do have to say that this is not my favorite Miyazaki movie.

This is my second copy of the movie and I was so disappointed with the audio. The dubbing was shortened, most of the lines that were missing are Jiji's. Almost all of the songs and background music were different.When you watch a movie and it leaves such a vivid impression you don't realize how huge a part the music plays until it is changed. It's like it's not the same movie anymore. I'll be pursuing a different version of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue needlessly cut.","review":"I have watched the VHS of this movie for years. Finally decided to buy the DVD since our last VHS player seems to be slowly dying. The DVD version only had the original japanese music in places where the VHS had some really cute songs in english that my kids and I love to sing along with. A LOT of dialogue, almost everything said by Phil Hartman, was cut if the camera wasn't on the character showing him speaking. Needless to say I won't be getting rid of my VHS anytime soon, and I'm very dissappointed with Disney for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate the disks that I got.","review":"I love this movie, and I was excited to introduce it to my young children.The DVD that I received has very odd sound errors. During most of the movie, Kiki's voice sounds terribly digitized and and cracked. It sounds awful. The strange thing is that it's mostly just the one voice that has errors. The music sounds fine, and most of the other voices are also normal. The movie consists of Kiki talking pretty much non-stop, so it really ruins the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Original Version","review":"After looking all over for our \\"original\\" version we gave in and bought this version.Started out great and then when Kiki takes off on her broom...the music has been changed.This is such a bummer. Why do they do this. Fortunately the voices are still the same whichis better than the remake of Totoro. I see from another reviewer that some of the dialoguehas been changed in this version of Kiki too. Haven't seen the entire movie yet so can't comment.Is it still sweet and delightful?

While the animation was incredible (as always) the plot moved slow, the action was sparse, and the humor was horrible to the point that you wondered what the characters were even laughing at.One good point, the cats were really cute.Normally Miyazaki can do no wrong but this wold have been better off as a short.Great message, horrible delivery. At least rent this before you decide to purchase...I wish I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Higher Expectations...","review":"This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Kiki's Delivery Service is simply a wonderful work of animation. The U.S. box art does not do it justice. Hayao Miyazaki creates a simple, yet beautiful look to this story of a young witch-girl as she goes out into the world on her own. Like many of Miyazaki's films, this one goes beyond the scope of most anime titles entertaining not only anime fans, but almost anyone else as well. Although not \\"disneyesque\\" in its artistic style, Kiki's Delivery Service is of top-notch animation and rivals any disney film in its overall execution. Orginally, I saw this in Japanese so I recommend the subtitled version. I have heard that the English version is well done as too. Either way, I believe this title won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for kids of all ages","review":"This movie is perfect for Pokemon-addicted kids.

Definately one of my favorite Japanese animation movies! Wonderful storyline, and cute charecters.

On her thirteenth birthday a young witch named Kiki must make her right of passage by going out into the world to live on her own for one year. Kiki picks a quaintly European seaside village as her destination and soars off on her broom. Her pet cat Jiji is her only companion. Like so many of the great Japanese film directors, Miyazaki's films achieve a contemplative beauty. There is an almost Zen like quality to the way in which he patiently allows his images to unfold. One event flows seamlessly to the next without the slightest trace of artifice. Miyazaki's unwillingness to rush the narrative allows the audience to share in Kiki's journey of self discovery. When the lights come up you'll feel as though you've also been away on a trip with an old friend.Preston McClear, author The Boy Under the Bed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This is a big rip-off of the cooking public.

However, friend who has read this novel's prequel, The Horseman, which also deals with reincarnation and is quite exotic, praised it, and I got curious and ordered it from the publishing house. Well, this is a suspense-thriller with unusual and exotic backdrops. Sexy and fast moving, never boring,from New York to Istanbul,politics, high-stakes terrorism,a sympathetic and courageous heroine, and yes, reincarnation is in the core. As I read the novel in between breaks from my heavy work load, I felt like I had a window seat on the Orient Express and pondered the question: is it the soul that reincarnates, or the genes? Even though I finished reading this novel, I still wonder..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Ink does have merit","review":"Red Ink based on the Atlanta child murders did not let me down. There is some solid acting and the story plot except for a couple of scenes was very enjoyable. The editor and the reporter relationship was that of a mentor making sure the reporter got the story right. A researcher finds that the police and the coroners office are involved in the plot to murder these children and is murdered before her conscience is too much to bare. Her husband played by Errol Wilks is bereaved and is full of questions opening up a can of worms when visited by the reporter.Too close his life is cut short leaving behind his young son.Of course, good does triumph over evil and the ending is dramatic!I would recommend this movie, keep and open mind..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fobidden Land","review":"I have never read any of William Sarabande's books before. This book is excellent. I plan to read more of his books in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Land","review":"Good story line throughout the book. Characters are developed pretty well and Sarabande gives a interesting feel of how socio/cultural life could have been pre-historically. Interesting parallels are drawn between world outlook then and now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"The grip is very comfortable and the shovel part is nice and strong. It does the job very well. Even ice cream that is frozen very hard can be served up.The description for this says that it is not recommended for the dishwasher. That is an understatement. I have had two of these. Each time, someone put it in the dishwashers and I only found out when I emptied it. The finish comes off pretty easily. Then it starts to corrode in the drawer between uses.There are other products with the same problem. So, be very careful what you choose.Why would it be designed this way? To make sure it wears out quickly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst items I have ever bought in my entire life!","review":"I bought this item without looking at the review but figured since it's Oxo it would be good as I have several of their kitchen utensils and I am happy with all. I was soooo wrong! the instructions said not to soak in water or put in the dishwasher so I washed it by hand, placed it on the drain board and left it overnight to air dry. When I went to put it away the next morning the spade was stained so I washed it again to see if the stain would go away, and the spade started to peel; thank God I never used it to serve ice cream, as it was possible that some of the material that was peeling might have been consumed along with the ice cream. I returned the item back to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The idea of an ice cream spade is good however the material that this one is made out of is very poor. It clearly states that it is not dishwasher safe, however washing it by hand still caused it to discolor and then to use it again presents you with metal rub off on the ice cream. Needless to say it went in the garbage during its first use & will never be purchased again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay spade","review":"I've missed my old ice cream spade. KitchenAid has one that I wanted to try but never got around to buying. Mom saw it on my wishlist and found this OXO Ice Cream Spade. I was very excited. It feels sturdy, but says do not put in dishwasher on it. That wasn't a surprise because most ice cream scoopers are that way. However, after handwashing it once I have pitting on it already. This is a surprise. I like GoodGrips and have a bunch of OXO stuff. Wish i wasn't already searching for a new spade on the internet though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for better","review":"This product warrants five stars only on the first use. If you put it in the dishwasher, it starts losing its plating and turns dull. They don't tell you that on the ads or on the product. The cushioned handle is comfortable, but who wants to dip ice cream with a chipping scoop that is hard to use. Look for one that's really stainless steel and that is truly dishwasher safe. Farberware has one but I haven't been able to find one. You're going to pay more, but it will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"less quality than old one","review":"the old ice cream scoop lasted for years... i ordered a new one on line from the same company.... what a disappointment..the quality was not there.. the metal scoop pitted and stained within 2 weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $","review":"I wish I'd read these reviews. Previous OXO products have been of high quality, but not this. OXO should place a warning sticker that this is not dishwasher safe. Washed in the dishwasher once and it came out ruined- the \\"chrome\\" coating was gone and the metal pitted. I have I high-end Bosch, so I know it's not a dishwasher issue, rather CPS- Cheap Piece of ****."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad product","review":"I bought this ice cream spade, washed it once, then used it once. It then turned black in the dishwasher! I have a Bosch dishwasher and used Cascade, so it isn't the dishwashers fault. I certainly did not expect a black, powdering coating to show up after using this once! This is the wrong product to buy if you expect to put it in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME - but not dishwasher safe","review":"I absolutely love mine - I've had it for a couple of years and it has had good use. I too never managed to see the dishwasher warning and after almost daily usage for two years it has, sadly, come apart. However, at this price - I really don't mind just buying a new one every two or three years . . . it is worth it. Hands down the best ice cream sooper I have ever had/seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Buy Again","review":"The men in our family love these. That's why I purchased four. My problem with them is that they CANNOT be put through the dishwasher. Therefor, they must be hand washed and of course, that's left to the women. Once these have been in the dishwasher they began to loose the plating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un homenaje al Paladín del Modernismo","review":"Escrito en primera persona como si el mismo Rubén lo dictara desde ultratumba. Muy bien escrito, por momentos la impostura se hace verosímil.Es un homenaje al paladín del Modernismo, hoy injustamente olvidado de igual manera que en vida le fuera injustamente negado el Nobel, posiblemente por su vida disipada y por no haber peregrinado a Estocolmo, sombrero en mano,como hicieron otros.De lectura casi obligatoria para los que no han leído la Autobiografía del Poeta, dictada por él mismo, brinda además una visión casi gráfica de la Latinoamerica y de la España de comienzos del Siglo XX.Fray Cástulo de A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for personal trainers","review":"I bought this for my daughter who has just finished training to become a Personal Trainer, this book was highly recommended to her as a work tool and she was thrilled to get it.I can't personally recommend it as I have no understanding of the whole genre but according to those in the know......\\"it's the ducks nuts\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE LEWIS VS BRIGGS FIGHT ?","review":"ON THE COVER IS LEWIS VS BRIGGS,UNLESS I MISSED SOMETHING IT'S NOT ON THE DVD?

Decent photographs are insufficient criteria to distinguish a book on birds. The book is written in a boring style that reads like, \`look, here are my pets, aren't they great?' The book lacks focus and unsuccessfully attempts to cover too much material. There are promising introductory sections intended for readers that have never owned a bird before where instructions on making \`first contact' without terrorizing the cockatiel are given. However, just a few pages later there is a large section on breeding birds. Surely it's unwise for a novice who wants a tame, loveable pet bird to delve into breeding at the same time? If the author had focused on one area, such as a guidebook for the new bird owner while avoided irrelevant distractions, I might have been able to suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I thought there were likeable parts of this novel and appreciate the youth of its author. However, I thought the plot was too incoherent to enage the reader over its total length. By the middle of the book, I was fed up with Jessamy, feeling her to be more brat than victim. This wasn't helped by the ambiguity surrounding Tilly Tilly and her link with Jessamy's past. I also didn't like the lack of concern for poor Shivs - I wanted to know what happened to her. All these things combined meant I had litlle sympathy for any of the central characters who, at the end, I thought were a self-indulgent bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"the icarus girl","review":"enjoyed the first half of this novel, the second half deteriorated steadily into a pretentious and unintelligible mix of ghost story and nigerian myth. disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Trouble","review":"While it's admirable that Helen Oyeyemi completed this novel before she turned 19, it's also painfully obvious she isn't quite ready to deliver a consistently well-executed or written story. There are several hints of sophistication and insight, however the novel is hijacked by clumsy, awkward and amateur moments (where was the editor?) The storyline has great potential (the idea of a double), however it's never developed or \\"tight enough\\" to be believable or compelling. There's a severe lack of real tension between TillyTilly and Jessy and the numerous storyline coincidences are a stretch. The lack of focus makes the novel meander back and forth between teen fantasy fiction and adult fiction. I do believe that Helen Oyeyemi has potential, it's just not seen in the Icarus Girl. Better luck next time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a First Novel","review":"Oyeyemi finished this novel before her nineteenth birthday, and it proves to be a hypnotic, thrilling tale. Some of the plot and characterization are a bit flawed, and I was disappointed with the ending, as I thought my fervent reading should have been a bit more generously rewarded. All in all, though, Oyeyemi seems to have a bright future ahead of her. Very absorbing and in some cases really frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books I've ever read.","review":"I was SO unimpressed with this novel but drawn to it by the summary. I loved, at first, the idea of some of it taking place in Nigeria, with the idea of a troubled girl, with the question of whether the girl's friend was real or a spirit or her imagination.But that's where my intrigue ended because almost as soon as I started reading, it became apparent that the characters other than the protagonist herself were one-dimensional and boring. They were flat and unbelievable and lent absolutely nothing to the story itself.As I read, I found myself confused by what was happening and why, found myself doubting characters' actions, and felt absolutely unmoved by what the climax was supposed to be. I know I'm no big critic, but this story while it had good intentions, wasn't planned well and ended up having a lot of loose ends. I definitely do not recommend this book."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},C={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-a3dd5a9e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/26.md","filePath":"glossary/26.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/26.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
