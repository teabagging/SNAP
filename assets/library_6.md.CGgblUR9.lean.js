If you plan on using this vacuum everyday and on more than one room, you will be disappointed. The materials are very cheaply made. I purchased mine about a year ago. I use my vacuum quite a bit, and have had to replace the battery (which will cost you about half the price of the vacuum itself) about every two months. The top part of the handle has broken off.

Unfortunately, the Eureka flunked miserably on my first use due to its low level of suction. A chore of mine is picking up sattered (dry) catfood kibble from the hardwood floors and all this machine does is spread it around. Dust and lint appear to get vacuumed, but anything larger than a grain of cat litter is too much for it to handle. Since I waited too long to return it I'm back here to buy another Dustbuster which is cheaper and much more effective. The only thing positive I could offer is the long running time on a single battery charge. I'd gladly cut that in half to get more suction... it's a great design, but worthless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Cat Hair","review":"I bought this product a few years ago to get cat hair off of my velvet sofa.

You still have to pick up the wet cheerios and bolts by hand. Emptying the dirt cup is a little messy because you have to remove the filter and shake it off, then dump the cup.

Granted, it is NOT a full size, heavy duty, suck up everything type of vacuum. That being said, it fits my needs for everyday cleaning after the kiddos, dog, and husband drag in dirt from outside. I find myself reaching for this little wonder almost everyday to do light cleaning of messes around the house. Several things I Love: lightweight (my kids can help me clean and clean their own messes!), small (fits behind my toilet and under my kitchen cabinets), powerful (just when I think it can't pick up that little pebble on the floor, it does!). I read many, many reviews before deciding on this one and I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all the simple work.","review":"The Vacuum works okay and it's worth it's price.

I'm sure the suction isn't nearly as good as a corded and it isn't as good as a Roomba, (Roomba can't do stairs though) But it is simply the best on the market right now. Easy to use and maintain, definately gets up dust and most anything else. The filter is always filled with dust. It helps, if you have a large object, to pick up the vacuum a little and place it over the object. This isn't necessary with cheerio type stuff but maybe a 1/2 cracker or something. They last years, as least mine has and the filters are inexpensive. I wish it was more agile to get under or around tight spaces. It's really a dustbuster on a stick but the dustbuster can't be removed. I use it several times a day for spot cleaning. It's an amazing convenience for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful vacuum!","review":"If I could give this product less than one star I would.

I will stick to my Roomba!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for NYC Apt living","review":"The biggest complaint I read in the reviews was that the battery only lasts about 15 minutes - it wasn't a concern for me b/c I'm not trying to do a whole house with it - it's perfect for my needs.I was looking for something to vacuum my NYC annoyingly SHEDDY rugs with. They've made me crazy. This is perfect. Charge is plenty. Love that I don't have to deal with bags. A bit awkward to empty, but it's a small price to pay for the ease of this vacuum. Love that it came with an extra battery so I always have a charged one.Only drawback is that it doesn't pick up cheerios/goldfish - which is a HUGE issue for me as mom of a 2 year old son. I still have to use my Swivel Sweeper for that. So I still have to use both, but I'm very happy with the power of the suction and it's very sturdy.I would give it 4.5 stars if that were an option. Definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to other reviews.","review":"I bought this as a result of previous reviewers who thought this was a great cleaner.

It picks up dog hair, grass, dog hair, lint, dog hair, crumbs, dog hair......get my drift. No more swiffer for me. It's quick and easy. Very lightweight and yet powerful enough to touch up a carpet.

You go from hardwood floors to carpet with the touch of one button. Another button on it changes from a long handled vac to a hand held. Being cordless is another plus. It is great for quick touch ups in between cleanings. Why pull out the full size vac for day to day clean up. I was using the regular swiffers, and this beats it hands down. I am purchasing additional units for my Mother and both of my Sister-in-Laws. Great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Helper !","review":"This is a marvelous product. I have had 3 for 5 years and have gotten 2 more as gifts. These are all still in working order. One of those was for a girl living in a dorm.

I loved it, though and I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, limited and confusing anime ...","review":"This series, about a girl on the 'wired' (internet of sorts) finding intrigue and danger, is far from intriguing or dangerous. The animation is minimal and choice of shots inadequate to maximize storytelling without animation. Perhaps one of the greatest problems is the limited story carries on for far too many episodes. The coloring is too bright too often which makes the different animation levels pop out against each other in an awkward way. All the drawings are crisp and well constructed, and the designs are decently pleasing. For this price, I wouldn't recommend 'Lain'...perhaps if twice as many episodes were per DVD it would be a favorable purchase. The DVD edition is acceptable, but, as with some translated versions using no english speaking natives, there are some embarrasing grammar errors on the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good program but horrible documentation","review":"The program works, but the documentation and support is horrible. Had I not worked with this product before I never would have been able to successfully install it. The installation instructions took up 1/2 a page in the manual and needed to be several pages long. Items such as device configuration, security on the Arcserve share and other items required to run the product were omitted. If you are a first time user, this is not for you! And don't even think of calling support unless you have a few hours to kill and like making long distance toll calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"I was very excited to upgrade my OEM brake/parking in my vehicle.

The other recipe, Mutther's Day Puppy Seed Bread on p. 64 turned out burned on the edges, raw in the center, and unedible for my dog. I pride myself in being a good cook who can follow a recipe. I think they failed to verify their ingredient lists for these 2 recipes. I hesitate to try any more of the recipes. Perhaps they didn't verify the ingredient list.

Many are meals like pasta, etc. It's an interesting book but it gets major negative doggie points for including recipes with raisins -- grapes are toxic to dogs.I am also not sure I trust other aspects of their recipe development. I made pineapple cookies which Droopy did enjoy eating, but I tried giving him a plain pineapple and he would not touch it -- does this mean I'm buying a can of pineapple for the recipe just because it makes it seem more tasty to the humans making it?Some are also no brainers, e.g., turkey burgers. Well yes, dogs are going to like eating turkey burgers but they also like the hamburger sitting on your plate, too, and I didn't need to buy a dog cookbook for that.That said, the recipes I've tried so far have impressed Droopy's pals, so that's why I'm not giving this a rock bottom rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeb and Jake","review":"Three Dog Bakery Cookbook arrived in great condition and was as advertised.

Atropine can cause serious health problems for dogs such as dilated pupils, heart arrhythmia and tremors.

The depression comes from the futility of the battle while the uplifting comes from the spirit of the American soldier and his willingness to endure despite the hardships he must encounter. This book is worth the read, if only to understand somewhat the ultimate weariness that comes from protracted hardship and war."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black Flower","review":"I taught American literature for 31 years at Mount Vernon High School in N.Y.

That does not make this a terrible read, just not quite what I was expecting. I have always been fascinated with books on this subject and this era in general, and although I found the writing in this book to be very original and interesting, there were times where I also found it confusing. There is some jumping from past to present and back to the past without much warning and that got a little confusing and made me pull away from the story a bit. What I did like about this book was the painstaking effort the author put into his descriptions. If anyone ever wondered what it was like to be one of the men fighting these battles, this book can nearly put you there. Overall I can recommend this book, but I do wish to warn people that there are some graphic portions and foul language, which add to the ambiance, but also may offend some.

You don't really need both, as the two cameras are very similar and the pair of books covers much common ground. However, we're glad to each have a copy for our respective cameras.It really is a first-rate book for beginners who need some help in learning how to use their Nikon digital SLR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish there was more","review":"After reading 250 pages of this book, I was left wishing there were another 150 pages to go. The information in here is so good, you'll wish the author had written 400 pages of tips on using the Nikon D50 digital SLR.But, I understand the concept of a Field Guide, and this book does manage to condense just about all the information you really need to know about setting up and using the D50 into its compact size. It's a perfect fit for my camera bag. Everything is in full color, too.The two-dozen recipes for shooting good pictures in various photo situations are clear, and use excellent examples. Perhaps the publishers will come out with a revised edition with another 20 or so recipes. This is exactly the type of information we need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Manual","review":"This book adds very little to Nikon's user manual--it's simply better written. So, if you're looking for expert advice on how/why/when to use the camera's more advanced features, you're going to be disappointed. There's simply very little \\"value-add.\\" In fact, only the first 1/3 of the book pertains to the D50; the remainder contains generic information on picture taking and digital manipulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"One gleaming inaccuracy","review":"This Guide refers to the meter focus button, which would permit you to change meter focus modes with a mere twirl of the command wheel.

It is a good tool to keep close to your camera bag for quick and easy reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A color manual and more","review":"I recommend this book to those who felt the manual that came with the camera was not enough. It covers everything that is in the manual with more detail and every page is in color as well. Along with the information on how to use the camera, it also gives you simple and basic information on how to take pictures explaining exposure, metering and more. Nice book to have around for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but not great","review":"This is an OK addition to the manual, but it seems that the author simply took his D70 field guide book and performed a search & replace D70 -> D50. At times, it's really embarassing and one wonders whether there was any kind of proof reading. As an example, the book shows a picture of the 18-70 mm \\"kit\\" lens of the D70, but with the caption claiming this to be the 18-55 mm D50 \\"kit\\" lens. The author also talks about features that the D50 simply doesn't have, such as the field-of-depth preview button, the metering mode button, etc. The book doesn't go beyond the manual at any time. One could have wished for a more rigorous treatment of subjects such as f-stops. After reading the book, I don't feel that I learned anything new about photography in general, or the Nikon D50 in particular. At least I didn't spend a lot of money on this picture book;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory \\"equipment\\" in my classes","review":"I teach classes in SLR photography, and when students ask for a recommendation for an inexpensive, full-featured camera, I point them towards the Nikon D50. Not all of them go ahead and buy it, of course, and many of the students already have a DSLR. But for those who do own this entry-level Nikon camera, I strongly recommend that this book be the first \\"accessory\\" they buy. If they have a Canon Digital Rebel or Nikon D70s instead, I recommend the other two Digital Field Guides in this series.While the basic usage information about the cameras is good, I haven't found a better brief introduction to photo basics than these books.

I prefer the Inkling version because Zeena (electric harp) is incredible on that version, but there's certainly nothing wrong or uninteresting about this version.If for no other reason, buy this cd just so you can hear the incredible final quarter of After Armenia. Whether we're talking Chest, Interstellar Space Revisited, The Inkling or whatever else, After Armenia is one of my favorite Nels moments on record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider Wisdom","review":"Cline's abilities on the guitar are, in a word, stupendous. Within seconds, the opening cut \\"Spider Wisdom,\\" displays a fusion of avant garde free jazz, no wave, and angular melody. This skillful weave of styles, along with weird ear-tickling noises coaxed out of the guitar and various electronic effects and the equally impressive improv skills of his sidemen (such as his talented percussionist brother Alex Cline) continues throughout the album, making this yet another essential for fans of Cline's guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Awful Album","review":"I can review a Nels Cline solo album and use a word like \\"awful\\" and it would be applicable to all of them. Having said that, this album blows. In fact, I don't even know why good guitarists like Cline choose to play a \\"free\\" jazz style anyway? Could it be that his compositional skills aren't that great? Could it be that he just doesn't have any idea what good jazz music is? Chances are all the above. Random noises, vast amounts of feedback, and heavy distorted guitar doesn't constitute good music. This \\"music\\" goes against everything music stands for. No structure, no melody, no rhythm, and no harmony. Without these crucial components, then all you will have left is anarchy. Don't believe the hype about Nels Cline. Go ahead and explore the sonic worlds of Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell, John Abercrombie, Terje Rypdal, and Steve Tibbetts.

This fits and works perfectly with the SU-4010, which if you want an awesomely awesome humidifier I don't think you could do better.

The color of the winds is especially warm and focused with wonderful horns and fantastic blend from the strings. The mood of each of the pieces is captured quite well. The first is appropriately vibrant as is the epic third which features unbelievable horn playing. Throughout, rhythmic security is maintained at all dynamics and tempos as is sustained presence of melody and balance with accompaniment. There is no note here without direction and focus. I would definitely recommend this as a first recording of the symphonies, followed closely by Szell's classic recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"There are MANY better collections of wedding music out there, and I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST - HAVE CD Collection","review":"I'm a teenager, but I'm also a sappy romantic.

Sitting down with Hecht at diners, grabbing a taxi together, Andy let down his guard just enough times to offer up interesting facets of who he was.

Sad for the author, Julie Hecht, who had the most amazing access to Andy Kaufman for well over a year, at one of the peak times in his life, and did absolutely nothing with it. She didn't understand him, she didn't appreciate him and she certainly didn't think he was very funny. Hecht manages to record a lot of banal conversations with Kaufman - but very little of it is interesting, new or enlightening. The fact that it took her over 20 years to even publish what was supposed to be a short story for a magazine, illustrates how little she understood or appreciated Andy (or Bob Zmuda). Most likely this book was whipped up upon the release and success of Man On The Moon. Ms. Hecht is in dire need of a sense of humor, this book is not worth the time of anyone who already appreciates Andy Kaufman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of A Book","review":"I bought this book expecting some laughs and insight into Andy Kaufman. What I got was a self-serving book by a very annoying author who basically has nothing worthwhile to say.

Then, years later after he's dead, she writes a book basically setting herself up as some kind of witty side kick who gave Andy all these wonderful straight lines. No. Actually you bored Andy, were about as much fun as a wet disrag, and will bore anyone foolish enough to but this book. What a wasted opportunity.

The only redeaming part of the tests were that sets of questions would build on one another, forcing you to take several looks at a question. For instance- based on answer for question 'a' and 'b', what is the answer for question 'c'. This type of questioning, however, is nothing like that found on Step 2.

I have found some questions in the CD that do not match the answering content in the software, the answers are not 100% updated, the test frame occupy 2/3 of the screen which I found like a bad design of the test, resuming all I can tell that is complete a lie telling that REPLICATE the ctual exam, I think that this author just wanted to be lucrative instead of making a piece of work that resembles the usmle based test, I recommend to try the PrincetonReview is more accurately than this hoax."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent update questions","review":"This is an excellent source for especially computer based USMLE Step2 Exam and for student doctors who prefer to study online.

He truly is in a league with Sam Cooke; what a powerful and emotive voice he has. This album has all his top hits, including my favorites of \\"Sleep\\", done in a very Doo-Wop style; \\"The Very Thought Of You\\" & \\"Cottage For Sale\\" (great interpretation of these two standards); as well as \\"Talk To Me\\", and 24 others. If you like Sam Cooke, Benny King, or Clyde McPhatter,(from the Drifters) you won't be disappointed with this album. Little Willie John was a huge talent who died young (about 30 years old) and in prison. But his music is here to be discovered and is a special treat to those of us who have never heard him before.

There are a lot of these parables floating around right now. I suspect the self-help authors like them because they can be used to dispense moral maxims without the burden of supplying proof or real-life examples. But if you are going to hand people life advice, you ought to be able to back it up. It is too easy to pass out sugar-candy.Finally, there is a lot of New Age nonsense in this thing.

It is interesting to me that none of the critiques of the book actually respond to the substance but resort to name-calling (one called it \\"garbage\\"...really?). Kreeft is the single best Christian apologist living in the United States today and this is the single best refutation of the atheist-uberskeptical-materialist culture in which we live...a refutation which I have never once heard anyone answer or challenge.

I have heard numerous complaints that their seems to be a need for an introduction to Philosophy before actually understanding the material and concepts in this book. I must agree.

The authors seem to answer lots of questions, but after a while their answers become predictable and increasingly superficial. No problem is so tough that they can't solve.

Although it's hook-up is suppose to be very easy, it turned out to be a nightmare. After you install the driver, and restart your computer, you have to plug the cord into the USB port, then plug the power cord into the scanner, then into the wall. It does not work with Adobe software, or any other applications, just the software they provide with it.

The installation disk aborts immediately when you try to install it under WinXP. There are new drivers available on their website, but you have to call tech support on your own dime to figure out how to install them (i.e. the scanner must be off, download all 14 driver files at 1.2meg each, run the web.exe first, when it says to reboot don't, run the uplib.exe next, ignore the error messages about not being compatible, ok now reboot, now you can turn on your scanner) When none of the instructions work, they email you stuff to read and hang up on you. You read the stuff they sent and that doesn't help either, so you call them back, they repeat the process and email you different stuff.

Those people are idiots. The King James Version isn't a translation at all. It's a revision of 2 previous English translations, one of them being the Great Bible. When the KJV was released, it was met with just as much hostility as modern Bibles are. Even the second edition of the KJV differed from the first edition, so which is truly the \\"Authoritative Version\\"? The problem is that people like to hold on to things that are familiar and treat everything unfamiliar with skepticism. People also love the KJV because of the majestic-sounding language. It sounds like it could be something that was spoken by God, even if it wasn't. The KJV wasn't the first English version; it wasn't the last; it has been proven to be inaccurate.

It is full of implausible events, continuity errors and bad grammar. It follows the story of a dictator called \\"God\\" who basically rules the world and punishes anybody who does not worship him. The book is split into two parts - the first is about the genocide, homicide and other atrocities caused by God. The second is chiefly about God's son, Jesus, whom God had with a virgin. The second is by far the best - Jesus is a rebel, and goes against everything his father ever stood for. The end result is that he is crucified.The rest of the book is complete trash.

Then do a little research into quantum physics, and you'll learn that the Vedas are the ONLY ancient religious texts which accurately described the nature of the universe--thousands of years before the development of scientific instruments powerful enough to \\"reveal\\" the same truths.

I think this book is a prequel. It fills in some of the back story of Jesus (the supposed non-sinner but we know the truth), but don't give us much information on his marriage.

They tell people not to be violent and to accept one another, then tell of destruction because one went against \\"god's\\" will. They tell to kill those that do not agree with another. Overall, I find the book to be quite pitiful. That and through the entire fairy tale it appeared that \\"God\\" had a split personality.

At 48 years of age with over 25+ years of intense research and introspection I am still more convinced than ever that the King James Bible represents the worst in mankind's imagination, and has been responsible for more crimes against humanity than can be counted. It's up to the reader to decide how much time and effort they want to put into this complex and controversial book. I could list many reasons why not to take this book as anything but a literary work of fiction but that would be setting-up my views to the narrow minded bigots and not convince those who don't want to deal with the bible with an open mind.

A woman would be better off single than being in the type of marriage relationship this book describes.If the material in this book is correct why would any woman want to attend church?

In my experience I have found that the traditionalist/complementarian views on women have done nothing but cause pain and feelings of inferiority for women.In my opinion, the authors have a poor scriptural foundation for their position. I am horrified that they would be willing to subordinate Christ eternally in order to justify the subordination of women. I encourage anyone who is studying the issue to read many books on the topic before making a quick decision.We are all called to be like Christ.

They allow Centro users to have a $30 data plan, but 755p users must pay $45. They could not explain the reason to me.Note that Verizon pushes their own 'wireless sync' e-mail solution, but that is a slow and bloated method of getting e-mail. Verizon does it to get control over your e-mail access. They made Palm leave out the Versamail program from the Verizon version of the 755p (it is provided on the Sprint 755p). Fortunately Palm makes it available for free separately, and it is perfectly legal to download and install Versamail. (Works on the Centro as well.) Versamail is simple and quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Vista 64bit","review":"I have a Treo 650. I just bought a new laptop that came with Vista 64bit.

His research is impeccable and his writing is clear and engaging. In Titan, his portrait of John D. Rockefeller is superb. Chernow provides a balanced view of this complicated persona, and places Rockefeller's life and accomplishments in context, traveling through more than a century. In terms of the story itself, one especially fascinating element is the dichotomy between Rockefeller's religious beliefs and business escapades, and how he (rightly or wrongly) justified his actions to himself. Another aspect is the evolution of the man from Robber Barron into possibly the world's greatest philanthropist, and philanthropic innovator. Overall, this is a terrific book about a extraordinary subject.Steven K. GoldAuthor,Entrepreneur's Notebook: Practical Advice for Starting a New Business Venture"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book though exhaustive","review":"I enjoy this book about a man whose legend remains but details tend to be assumed by most of us rather than known.Like most biographies, especially by Chernow, the details are thick and deep and can be tedious. But it paints a full, rich picture of the man JDR as well as the time period that made him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very long, but worth it for the detail","review":"When I received this book as a Christmas present I was not sure if it was punishment or truly a gift. Clearly it was the latter.A fresh, even-handed look at the life of Mr. Standard Oil himself with most of the warts and the accolades presented.One criticism lies in that Chernow never really presents any damning criticism or analysis for some very unethical practices. He leaves that to the reader and while in some cases, it's appropriate, in others it is not.It's amazing how a person so pious and truly interested in his faith could never reconcile his religious and his business lives. The ethical/morality tale has much modern relevance and like good history allows us to understand the past so it is not repeated in the future.In the end I wondered, what will Mr. Softy read like 50 years from now as the story of Bill Gates is shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Outstanding and very fair biography of one of the most powerful minds of the turn of the century.

He always captures the small less reknown yet pivotal moments in Rockefellers life. His poor relationship with his father that late in his fathers life he tries to reclaim. Is unsurpassed in capturing a man that all he wished was to feel loved as a child. Which by appearances he wasn't. Although a goal of Rockeffeler was to live to be a 100 years old was not achieved. He achieved so many others. His philanthropy was unequaled even by Carnegie and JP Morgan. He established the University of Chicago which has produced more Nobel Laureats than any other university. We see and feel Rockefellers decisions and the emotions behind many of them which is the most difficult aspect of biographical writing to achieve.

I loved the book. The story of Rockefeller's rise to be the first billionaire from his \\"rustic\\" beginnings and all that went into it is reason enough to pick up the book. Rockefeller is now synonomous with wealth and has become a part of the lexicon to indicate money and achievement. Chernow does an outstanding job fleshing out this individual and showing his path to the top, while being unable to completely leave behind a spartan childhood and its effects.Even if the story was not enough, which it is - Chernow's writing is worth picking up the substantial text and reading it over and over. His prose puts you squarely in the story and brings the times and the people alive around you.The history is worth learning, the comparisons to present day men like Gates might surprise.

Great insights into human nature, capitalism, government--life."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love philanthropists, this is the book for you!!","review":"When John D. Rockefeller was a young immigrant, he never knew he would be a successful oil tycoon. To start with, John D. Rockefeller had Alopecia Areata, a not too uncommon disease. He loved people. He never did anything he thought his customers would not like. He didn't work for himself, but for his people. In his 98-year life, he had three children. None of his children went into the oil business after him, not because they didn't respect their father's work, but because they did not want to screw up the idea that their father had started. John Rockefeller was a true American hero and helped shaped the way we run our country today. During the industrial revolution, Rockefellers ideals on humanitarianism were well respected and it is a shame there aren't more businesspeople like him today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased from the start","review":"Admittedly, many people already have an opinion of John D. Rockefeller, and many feel that he was greedy and evil. Just the same, the choice of language throughout the book is always negative to Rockefeller. He is never a good guy, even when attending church or donating money. He isn't upright, he's prudish. He isn't religious, he's sanctimonious. He doesn't form agreements, he forms cabals. Not knowing a lot about Rockefeller, I was hoping this would tell something of him. Not so. There are paragraphs saying that he only has religion and business as his activities, then suddenly we discover that he likes fast horses (and apparently has for years, since he owns several).This book reads much more like a rambling history of things that went on around Rockefeller than actual unbiased information about the man. A telling point might be that we never think of him as John, always as Mr. Rockefeller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is exellent in detail and tells true of the sinking","review":"The detail is stunning, in both words and a way one can't describe.

This book tells of John D. Rockefeller's rise from abject poverty to the status of richest man in the universe. His creation and building of the Standard Oil empire is covered very well from start to finish in this excellent book. Many of the companies that were created as a result of the breakup of Standard Oil by the use of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act are industry giants today.

The sections on JDR's philanthropy are less interesting but informative for those unfamiliar with the topic.

The author does a great job of keeping a healthy distance to provide an objective portrayal of this tycoon.If you are intersted in a book that will help you understand the differeent sides to a human being, this is certainly a good choice. Rockefeller's strengths allowed him to amass an amazing fortune and fund the America we have come to know today. At the same time, he caused a lot of pain and anguish to business rivals and family members.Throughout the entire book the author successfully shows how complex we are as people. In one moment we are able to provide some much joy/happiness and in the next capable of causing pain. This book goes farther than just business, it digs into the psyche of an amazing historical figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Excellent Book on Rockefeller","review":"This is a really excellent book on Rockefeller. It made me laugh; it helped me to understand who he was as a person; it showed how he became who he was; and it gave me a true and complete understanding of Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Sr. in an unbiased way.I read the negative reviews on here, and I want to refute them. Some say the author clearly favored Rockefeller; I felt quite the opposite at some points and think a really objective depiction was achieved. Others say the editing was poor; I didn't find a single spelling or grammatical error during the read. In terms of its editing, it was fine.If you want to know who Mr. Rockefeller, Sr. was, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story about an interesting man.","review":"A biography about one of our first true tycoons that reads like a novel. The reader comes away with a picture of an extremely complex man, one who was shaped by his upbringing and reacted to the circumstances of the time. Having not read other biographies of John D., I do not have a basis with which to compare this author's perspective of the man or the facts surrounding him. M. Rockefeller is presented as a man, driven by his personal philosophy and often at odds with members of his family and business associates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good way to put late 1800s into perspective","review":"This book puts the late 1800s into perspective. It's fascinating to read how businesses develop when little or no rules of engagement are in place. The most ruthless and devoid of emotion wins, which is good if you're part of the winning team. Not so good if you're trying to start a competing business or worked for the defeated party. If read carefully, you can see parallels with many business practices throughout the ages - including the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"John D. Rockefeller was perceived by many as evil;","review":"But the picture I got from \\"Titan\\" is he really was not culpable. He had a strong moral compass & believed he was God's instrument on earth. That may be misguided but not evil. He was not even particularly egocentric as most great men are. He just did what he felt was necessary & did it extremely well. That to make money by all means is what most sucessfull capitalist do. Money was his true god & the purpose he was put on earth. That was his measure of worth in everything he did. He did however, feel guilty in his declining years & sought to give away his money. Strangely, this was harder & more of a challenge than making it. Mr. Chernow does a fine job, presenting a balanced biography.

Though if you're like me and never watched the cartoon, then it's like a whole new set of adventures for the Enterprise and her crew (and you can imagine it with the real actors in your mind). The writing is pretty good, all things considered (aside from a number of typographical errors that should have been caught prior to publishing). The problem is that the quality of the episodes themselves is nothing to write home about. I can see them working in a cartoon but they're hardly worth the time and effort to sit and read through. Still, the author did an admirable job with so-so material, and if you're a fan of the original series then you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it in spite of its shortcomings.The episodes included herein are:\\"Beyond the Farthest Star\\"\\"Yesteryear\\"\\"One of Our Planets is Missing\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"way too small","review":"From Amazon, I usually buy shoes size 8.5 and sandals size 9, whatever the brand.

It has excitement, wonderful, colorful tales of adventure, plus I learned a whole new side of the origin of the airplane. The author did a very nice job of evoking the period: a lot of amazing people like Alexander Graham Bell and Henry Ford swirl through this tale focusing on aviation great Glenn Curtiss. I would highly recommend this book even if you're not an aviation buff. I don't know what some of the other picky reviewers are quibbling about. I just really enjoyed this story and the way it was written. There's also a great review that first drew my attention to it in the Boston Globe."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Shulman \\"attack biography\\"","review":"Seth Shulman deserves some credit for attempting to get overdue credit for Glen Curtiss's improvements to early forms of heavier-than-air invention. He is at the same time stingy in giving credit to Alexander Graham Bell's AEA organization, which provided immeasurable assitance to Curtiss. While the book is in places a good read, Shulman seems to have difficulty in judiciously using details, with the effect being his losing sight of the forest for the trees. In addition, when Shulman goes into \\"attack mode\\" (which he does in several of his books) he can be extraordinarily unfair to his subjects' rivals. Shulman is not as guilty in this book of the kind of misdirection, omission, and irresponsibility that he displayed in The Telephone Gambit, his attack on Bell, but readers should be very skeptical anytime that Shulman compares Curtiss and the Wright Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwaiveringly BIASED and UNBALANCED","review":"Throughout this book Mr. Shulman denigrates the contribution of the Wright Brothers. His bias is so prevalent throughout the book that I found myself shaking my head as I read blatantly contradictory statements within 5 lines of each other. The author's opinions and accusations are either based on his limited research or his intentional omission of fact. If you're even considering buying this book, I would direct you to the author's own words following a completely inane paragraph of conjecture about Orville Wright............\\"Or perhaps not.\\" That about sums up this biased inaccurate ploy concealed in the history section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and enjoyable","review":"I found this book to be a very fast and enjoyable read. The book is written in a manner that made me long to find out what happened next, I didn't want to put it down.Much has been said in other reviews about about the merits of the Wright's patents and the author's \\"bias\\" against the brothers from Dayton. No doubt the Wrights were first to demonstrate that heavier than air flight was possible. However, there is also no doubt that any technical superiority the Wright Flyer enjoyed was short lived. The Wright brothers litigation was allowed to languish in the courts only until the outbreak of WWI, at which time the U.S. military was eager to get its hands on the far superior planes being built by Curtiss.I strongly recommend this book. \\"Unlocking the Sky\\" will likely inspire you to read other books on the history of early aviation. After doing so, you can draw your own conclusions about the conrtibutions of Curtiss and the Wright brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curtiss is underrated","review":"Its probably true the Glenn Curtiss is underrated in aviation history. However, this story would have been more effective if the author could have demonstrated this without disparaging the Wrights. When he overstates the importance of Curtiss achievements (first public flight in the US, issuance of the first US pilot's license), and underrates the achievements of the Wrights, he loses credibility.Consider whether Curtiss would have had any place in aviation history without the prior work of the Wrights. Seems very doubtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Smithsonian Strikes Again","review":"The subtitle; \\"Glenn Hammond Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane\\", says much about the book. Curtiss had nothing to do with the invention of the airplane. Instead, the author vigorously argues in favor of Curtiss and the AEA (Aerial Experiment Association) as they blithely tried everything they could think of to steal, ignore, circumvent, or otherwise discredit the Wright's achievement. Their most odious act was the reconstruction of the Langley aerodrome, with the connivance of the Smithsonian, which has managed to so distort the historical record it is still fooling people today. This book carries their torch into the 21st Century. The AEA would be proud.For those of you reading these reviews, what the Wrights discovered/invented was not the Curtiss lawyer's narrow focus on wing-warping versus ailerons, but full three-axis control plus propulsion. Find an aircraft designer today who thinks those items are \\"obsolete\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at impact of patents","review":"In the epilogue the author writes \\"At its core, the long, bitter fight between Glenn Curtis and the Wright brothers pitted the virtues of open, shared access to innovation [Curtis] against the driving economic pressure for monopoly ownersip [Wrights].\\" This sentence really summarizes the book. It is more about patents and legal wrangling than about aviation. But the topic of patents and how they are interpreted is important to today's world and many would argue (although the author does not get into this) that a similar battle is taking place today in the information world, in particular with Microsoft playing the part of the Wright brothers.

I decided to pay an extra $30 to buy a refurbished TI-89. It looks like new and works perfectly. My advice is if you don't need CAS, pay a $20 more to get a new TI-83 or 84.

Annoying and time consuming to reset the program especially if this happens in the middle of a problem.I would not recommend this calculator to anyone until Texas instruments makes it more user friendly.But if your school is part of the TI Mafia (like mine is) and demands this calculator get a good manual (not a TI manual) and start practicing as soon as possible so that you are familiar with it's quirks.Some schools are also offering classes on how to use this calculator, TAKE THEM.It will help you out immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this some kind of joke?","review":"I bought the calculator and thought the software license was included in the price.

Rather than being a helpless, idiotic Mary Sue, the heroine, Yuri, is one that can actually defend herself most of the time. This manga is based on real people, events, and places from ancient history, making it a fascinating read. Shinohara evidently did a great job with her research! Equally touching is the main relationship between Yuri and Prince Kail of the Hittites. They acknowledge their love for one another, but the series is not centered around their relationship. Yuri's relationships with the other characters in the story are equally appealing.This is a manga filled with action, history, fantasy, romance, and even a bit of humor. It's sure to satisfy any fan of shoujo manga or of Chie Shinohara's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late 70's Gem!","review":"Wow what a record....Backed by Ronson and Hunter, Ellen Foley belts out one heck of a performance (as usual) on Night Out.

The only track that really stands out among all this mediocrity is \`Fallout', but that isn't enough to save this album.This band are as contrived and homogeneous as a pop band and are basically a boy-band but aimed at the \`edgy' rock audience, who think that this sort of thing is alternative.

I've also used it from time to time to sequence tracks, although it can't come close to products like Live and Reason which I also use. The problem is, the company appears to be belly-up, or circling the drain, or whatever, so this unique product is likely to become an orphan soon, an orphan with a cult following but no support to speak of. Combined with DM2, Studio Pro can be an inspiring and productive tool and/or toy, but unless someone buys this product line from the Mixman and breathes some life into it, it's really not an option for serious emusic people."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIXMAN IS BAD!

The color is almost exactly the same, and is close enough that you can't tell it's different unless you're staring at it. The shade goes on and comes off easily, and stores in a small bag that fits easily in the basket under the stroller. It provides a TON of shade and keeps the kids cool. We also love the venting on the side that allows a little extra wind the blow through when there's a breeze, and gives the kids a way to see out the side of the stroller when we're walking. GREAT buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super and very easy to use","review":"I tried another sunshade for my double jogger and it seemed very difficult to use and covered up the babies too much.

I was using a blanket to just throw over the canopy and then it falls on the handle bar in the front... but it gave no air circulation and the kids wanted to see outside (of course). I have a instep double stroller and this product works great on it. I can walk anytime, easy to put on, easy to take off at night. The girls stay in the shade and they get to see outside, which is great. The price is kinda high for something as simple as this, but it's because it's a MUST if your canopy provides just the basic shade (practically none). They know you need it. Junk price, but a great investment for you and the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I was very nervous about the summer as I have a 3 month old who cannot wear sunscreen.

Both kids are completely shaded and I do not have to worry about the sun. We also do not have to remove it to fold the stroller so that is great too.My only mini complaint is that the older one (21 months) whacks the younger one because she knows that we cannot see her with the sunshade on.

Not, certainly, out of love for good writing.The material in this book, carefully trimmed, might have made a single excellent article of the old New Yorker variety. Instead the book contains a forest of irrelevancies into which the reader is dumped, promptly to get lost. When, at last, the \\"biography of a bottle\\" is addressed, it comes in fits and starts that may be entertaining to an adman, but not to the general reader.Not recommended for those with a low threshold for boredom.

I have been searching far and wide for a book on this fasination female, hanged to death at such a tender age...beated by parent to marry at 14...sad thing is that there is no surviving picture of this strong headed intelligent being...she only survives in ones who give her the spotlight she hid from so long ago when she was alive. This fabulous and colorful nonfiction will break the hearts of the average human on earth, including teenagers.Just like Anne Frank, Jane Grey was a female foresaken and taken for granted, this girl lived far more long ago in history, in a world we will never be able to comprehend or understand.

I just wonder what happend to \\"the R-word\\"...research! The author's one-dimensional analysis of main charaters --- either bad or good, was too simplistic for adult readers and utterly unsatisfactory. I have read some other Tudor novels such as The Other Boylen Girl, The Queen's Bastard, and Elizabeth, but I would have to say this is by far the worst one. If you have to read, just borrow it from a local library. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as innacurrate as other reviews would have it","review":"The book does say she was beheaded and that she reigned for 9 days, contrary to other reviewers claims. I do wonder at why every fictional account of Jane feels inclined to give her some sort of great love of her life, differing only in who it is. This one gives us someone before she was forced to marry another.

Though that price has reduced greatly from $69, for a 336 page book, I'm not of the belief that the information contained is all that groundbreaking, nor worth $43 as of this writing.If you're reading this because of a PMP recertification requirement under Category 2-SDL, it fulfills that requirement in a rather dry and disengaged manner.

It looks like it should be able to solder thick wire and handle other heavy jobs but its quirky \\"Therma Boost\\" feature that is supposed to make it a 130 watt iron is lacking.At its heart this is a 30 watt iron. The idea is that you can pull the trigger to get a \\"boost\\" of heat and make it a 130 watt iron. Unfortunately, once you pull the trigger, you get a brief increase of heat, but then the \\"boost\\" turns off and it gets cool again. The iron has a built-in duty cycle limiter so you can only activate the boost feature once every couple minutes or so. If you weren't done soldering when the boost turns off, then too bad -- you'll have to wait a few minutes before you can get another boost of heat.Overall this iron is kind of gimmicky and you should get an iron that perform at a high wattage for a 100% duty cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool","review":"This is a great tool. The 130watt boost really dose the job. People that don't think theboost works need to read the instructions that come with the tool befor bad mouthing it.It dose just what it claims it will do.

Once you get use to the release handles you get to the point where you never want to go back to the other style of mult-tools.my first one was named a craftman which lasted over ten years then a part broke off. They replaced it having the bear name on it. i have had this style for over twenty years. I suggest going to the Bear and son home page and see what they have.

Although made in the USA, workmanship and quality were not what I expected. The finish is fair overall, but the plier head casting had minute chips/flaws along the edge of the serations of the needlenose. The opening and closing of the tool takes all my hand strength, (I weigh 240, 6'2\\"). I have oiled it heavily and worked it a bit to loosen it up to no avail so far. The friction is actually creating heat and warming the tool head up. Tool release arms stick out and get in the way of the tools which also are extremely stiff to get out. I had to pry the can open out of the body with my Leatherman Wingman, maybe had threadlocker on the joint, I dunno, first tool I have had that operates so hard, I don't even want to bother with it.

The TV was still covered under the 1 yr manufacturer's warranty. I had a Philips authorized service center look at the TV and deem that the power supply needed to be replaced. It has been a nightmare getting the TV back. My TV is basically being held hostage by Philips. The part is on back order with no end date in sight. They are the absolute worst Customer Service group that you could ever encounter. They give you nothing but canned non answers and are totally uncooperative and not helpful. I am still without my TV and it has been over 5 weeks now. Philips is one of the worst companies that I have ever dealt with and I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase this or any other TV from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore for Louis!","review":"This was one of the best biographies I have ever read. By far the best one of the life of Louis Armstrong. It took me only 2 days to read this book, I could hardly put it down. Not being much of a fan of Dixieland, New Orleans Jazz, etc...after reading this book I was hooked. I wanted to listen to every Louis recording available. Bergreen paints Armstrong as such an amazing character which he completely was.

Instead of the super white advertised, the bulbs were tinted such dark blue that the light shows up a nasty shade of blue-green. The 1157 bulbs just don't put out that much power to begin with so the uncolored regular bulbs show up a bit yellowed (as with many incandescant bulbs), add the dark blue tinting, you get green-blue light. I also bought the 168 Xtreme White wedge bulbs from PIAA (same product line, different bulb)and they come out brilliantly - a slightly blue shade of white. I don't know why the 1157s were so terrible. This is including weeks of any \\"burn in\\" time they might've needed. The PolarG 1157s I tried after the PIAAs weren't perfect either, but much better than the PIAAs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xtreme White Bulbs","review":"They are much brighter than the standard running & brake light that came on my Motorcycle, I would recommend them if you want to be seen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Springbok is still capturing my audience","review":"Beautiful sturdy Springbok puzzles are at the very top of my list as always.The puzzles frame perfectly!!

In 1965 he put together an international band and had a number of huge pop hits that combined traditional Brazilian rhythms and songs with American pop, and for a few years he was one of the most popular acts in the world. But the American and European infatuation with watered down Brazilian music faded as the British invasion began in earnest, and Mendes and his various bands fade from public view.With this album, though, Mendes has returned to a very basic and completely authentic Brazilian sound- far more authentic than the original Brasil '65 band. And it's an absolute treat. The sound of Carnival just echos through this album, and if you close your eyes you can imagine yourself in the middle of it all on the streets and beaches of Rio. Highly recommended for fans of Brazilian music, fans of Mendes, and people who just like to dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving...","review":"I'm writing this when others have already lavished high praise on the album. There is not much I can add except to say that from the opening few seconds of the first track to the last, I was deeply moved by everything I heard on this album.Sergio is to be commended for his trip back to his roots. Brazil is indeed honored with this album and Sergio definitely deserved the Grammy award for it.Bravo, Sergio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the kitch loving bossa nova crowd","review":"I was not into this album. The first couple of tracks are exciting, whistle blowers, but the rest of the album dissolves into a fusion jazz experience that I don't go for.

Lisa Raye did an interview about the movie. The film is about prison being big business. The women are being exploited, abused and enough is enough. The final straw is when one character ends up dies. Lisa Raye plays Francis Shepeard who is in prison for killing her abusive husband. She ends up heading an all out boycott on the prison conditions. Da Brat is Sabrina and she is the narrator. Which is cool, because her acting leaves much to be desired. The movie is okay, but I think the movie would have been better if we could have seen a flashback about Francis' character having to deal with her husband. The movie is okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Civil Is The Perfect Brand","review":"This movie is a winner.With an alstar beautiful cast with so much talent.They are LisaRaye, Tichina Arnold, N'Busche Wright, Monica Calhoun, Lark Voorhies,Da Brat, Mc Lyte and even Mos Def.The plot is so importaant and this is a great movie.Its baout women who too a stand because they were tired of their hard labor and sexist treatment while they are in prison.These women all shien in this movie and among that it has won many awards at film festivals even BEST PICTURE.I remeber reading amagazine and seeing an ad in a magazine for a movie after that i never heard anything else about it.NExt thing i know i was walking thorugh Wal-Mart and saw the DVD.I never seen it before so i bought it and loved it..BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION FOR EVERYONEOVERALL GRADE 97/100 = A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Movie - Not Just Your Usual Women In Prison Flick","review":"Don't let the cheesy looking DVD artwork confuse you; this is no T&A;, 1970s blaxploitation women in prison flick, (although some of those were damned good movies).These are women of color behind bars, but the characters are portrayed as strong women, edgy, and intelligent, and to their credit, the director, script writer and the actors keep this high level of quality and integrity throughout the entire film.

Chichikov, a confidence-trickster, realises that serfs that die between official censuses are not legally dead until the next census, and so still count as property. He travels the length and breadth of Russia, buying \\"dead souls\\" from landowners, and becomes - on paper at least - one of the wealthiest men in the country. Gogol uses this simple story as the basis for a set of farcical character-studies: he saw the book as a portrait-gallery of contemporary Russia, and filled it with short, self-contained comic episodes. He also wrote, with ironical pointedness, that Chickikov's journey stands for the journey of every human being through life: we move on, never sure of what is coming next, relieved each time that whatever it was we did, we got away with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fun and relevant","review":"Dead Souls is a classic 19th century Russian comic novel, considered a masterpiece so long that why it's considered a masterpiece has changed from generation to generation, so there's very little I could say about it that would move the needle. But I found it to be the best kind of comedy, a comedy written by someone who loves the subject, so the author isn't being mean. These are his people and he cares deeply for them.The subject of the book, how we pursue money and why, is as relevant today as it was a hundred years ago. We struggle with the meaning of wealth, how we measure comfort and \\"enough\\", how we deserve it.I've previously only read Russian novels translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky who I think are fabulous but this time I branched out to a different translator and enjoyed it, but missed the extensive footnotes that Pevear and Volokhonsky give you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging But Worthy Read","review":"I will spare a synopsis, and stick to my opinion of the book. This book is not a quick read and requires close focus due to the abundance of difficult, yet descriptive Russian names. The story is truely ingenious. The satire and social commentary become apparant at the end, although most people will know it is coming due to having read a description of the book beforehand. In the meantime be prepared to be read some action scenes and wity dialogue. The reason I only gave four stars is because it wasn't a book I couldn't put down. I think that is because the names wore me out, and because the repetition of serf purchase scenes, although lending themselves to the above mentioned action/dialogue, became redundant. I found myself thinking, just get on with the revelation of his motives already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"How about those gossiping ladie folk.

One mistake I made was that I did all the rice for my first time; which ended up being more then I wanted to make. I also will have to disagree with the book which says it only takes 5 minutes of de-starching/washing the rice. It took me an hour of constant washing to get it clear. The sushi book isn't really the best for recipes, at least the ones I like. It also suggests using items like turkey/chicken; which, seems too strange for me to even bother trying.

It comes with all the sushi making essentials, even a mini recipe book (as pictured in product details). If you enjoy inside out sushi, like california rolls, etc; just use a damp cloth to roll the sushi instead of the bamboo mat. This prevents rice from sticking to everything. It is also useful to keep a small bowl of water and vinegar (included in kit) to dip your hands in to remove rice residue on hands while preparing sushi.

Needless to say it's 2001 and I am still as ever in awe of Robert Smith and co.FOr being my intro to the Cure I must give this album 5 stars. Though not as \\"dark\\" as previous albums, it's a special album. I listened to it over and over. I think it's a classic album and a great representation of the Cure in the 90's. My favorite track is \\"Doing The Unstruck\\", as well as \\"High\\" and \\"Letter to Elise\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album From An EXCELLENT Band!","review":"Even though I am a die-hard Cure fan, I can be fairly objective about their albums. Upon first listening to WISH, I had trouble staying tuned to the complete album. In the years since it's release, I have come to appreciate the beauty in its moody ballads and unique guitar rifts from having the opportunity to listen to it in depth during a summer road trip. My favorite song would have to be A LETTER TO ELISE... I even named my daughter Elise in honor of my favorite band!This album did have some commercial success more so than other CURE albums perhaps more deserving due to the radio-friendly FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE, a catchy upbeat melody with a strong hook in the lyrics. The album has continuity, making it a good listen from start to finish if you have the time. Some tracks are more innovative, some more bland, but overall I would rate WISH with 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great effort, but doesn't quite stand up to some others","review":"This album runs in the middle of the pack of all of the other Cure albums. It's a decent album but it's short of being a great album. I could really live without \\"High\\", \\"Wendy Time,\\" and \\"Doing The Unstuck.\\" Those tracks seem airy and just blah. Apart, Trust, and End are definitely the best tracks on here. From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea is right up there as well. This is worth buying if you liked \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" and \\"The Top\\", those albums that vary greatly in mood. But for people stuck in the early 80's, who like Faith and Pornography, might not care for it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album for the ages","review":"I bought this album about the time it came out (92) and I have never been so much affected by an album in my life. I heard of The Cure from a friend and was persuaded to get it by him. Believe me when I say I took it EVERYWHERE I went.....EVERYWHERE. I was beyond obsessed with it. I never heard anything like this in my life. I was only familiar with mainstream rock at the time so hearing something like this was so different to me. Since then I have bought all the Cure releases but this one is most special to me. I think this one along with Disintegration are the best. Robert Smith is a genius. To pick a favorite would be impossible the songs are all fabulous. The guitar work is amazing especially on \\"A Letter To Elise\\". The solo is absolutely riveting. I can never get tired of it. \\"Wish\\" was the album made me expand my horizons musically and not just follow radio tunes. It all started here with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Cure's Best!","review":"Listenable, intense, and emotional. The Cure always knows how to open an album, and \\"Open\\" is a perfect beginning to one of their best albums.

I'm not even going to go into too much detail because this album speaks itsself...long live The CUre"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WISH all music could be like this","review":"The only reason this CD gets 4 stars and not 5 is b/c of the exclusion of This Twilight Garden. I'm a believer that all Cure albums are good/great in some way, and Wish is great. From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea will knock you on your a*s every time you hear it, it's that good. Open, Apart, End, Cut (yea!), and To Wish the Impossible Things are all classic Cure tracks. This is the best \\"starter\\" CD for new Cure fans - not as depressing as Disintegration, and not as frightening as Prnography. If you don't own this, what are you thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cure For Pain","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who said this album is more versatile. It is a beautiful album in every sense of the word. I haven't heard this album in some time, then on a drive home I listened to it with my girlfriend and I remembered all those times I spent alone with this album and how great it is! It has a little something for everyone. For those who love the Cure's \\"pop\\" side, there's \\"High\\" and \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" but I tend to prefer the Cure's emotional side. If you listen to \\"Trust\\" and \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\" and don't cry or feel any emotion, then you have a heart of stone. I also love \\"A Letter To Elise\\" and \\"The Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" and of course the most underrated Cure track \\"Doing The Unstuck\\". I would recommend this album (along with the singles collections) to anyone who is just getting started listening to the Cure. I believe this is the easiest album from thiers to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games of all time","review":"Playstation has Metal Gear Solid.

Replay value is high, as you control your character to make different decisions, which effects the outcome of the game. I can't put the controller down. Also, the game is tailor-made for me, as I like shooters, but shooters with a purpose and story. The game is just plain fun. I plan on playing Mass Effect 2 soon, but I still want to play this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better games to come out in a while","review":"Great game overall. Obviously deserving of all the awards it received.Awesome RPG and strategy elements, as well as gameplay, graphics and story. Not a lot of bugs in the design of this game in general. If youve been contemplating getting in on Mass Effect but think its too old now, consider yourself wrong.A timeless classic for the 360 with hours upon hours of gameplay. Plenty of auto save features to allow you to put in even small amounts of time into the game per sitting and still have fun and make progress.Get in on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal?","review":"I bought this game based on the fact that it was one of the highest-rated 360 games on Metacritic (91). I can't say I agree. Mass Effect is definitely top-notch as far as graphics and depth and voice acting goes, but the gameplay just didn't seem all that interesting to me.The third-person combat system is not very impressive and the action sequences seem very brief. I felt like I spent a lot of time just walking around and talking to people, standing in elevators, and driving my APC around generic planets looking for combat. When I'd finally get in combat, I would get relatively far and then die and have to start all the way back at the beginning.I've probably played the game for at least 10 hours and don't feel like I've really accomplished all that much. Maybe it gets better as you play further but I'm not willing to invest any more time in it to find out. Great concept and production values but the action wasn't done well enough to keep me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mass Effect - Not Bad At All","review":"Mass effect lived up to the hype without a doubt. Not only does it deliver a creative storyline, it also allows the gamer to take the story where they want it to go based on decisions and key events during the game. The best part is the fact that the gamer gets to detail their character, literally, down to the very scars on their faces and the shapes of their faces. Naturally, they also have a wide variety of classes & skills to choose from. It's basically like Starcon II meets Final Fantasy. I really enjoyed the \\"free space\\" aspect that allowed me to deviate as much as I wanted from the main mission and explore other planets and stumble across side missions. I've already played and beaten this game once, and have already started playing it again. Very worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever!","review":"First of all, if you're buying this game because you think there's nudity in it, DON'T! Because there is NO NUDITY! As for the game mechanics, they are absolutely atrocious. The storyline is sleep-inducing. The controls are almost impossible to get used to. The characters are as uninteresting as they could possibly be. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATNESS","review":"Mass Effect is a truly awesome RPG. The only thing is that its only about 30 hours long. That said it is highly replayable and very fun and engaging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated, didnt like it","review":"i bought this game with high expectations from everything i heard, and yes while the game does have depth it is also extremely boring and stretched out, not much fun to play, just time consuming"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Called \\"MESS EFFECT\\"","review":"I can't understand how anybody could rate this game over 2 stars. This is one of the worst games I have ever played, due to mediocre graphics, bad framerate (I thought I was playing on a slow PC sometimes), and excrutiatingly boring side missions. I actually bought MASS EFFECT 2 first. I started playing it, and decided to play the first one. I figured I would finish #1 and go back to #2. ME2 did not have the technical issues as ME1 did. Anybody that says the graphics in ME1 is great must be color blind. How this game got past quality control is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"No new news here","review":"What I would have to say about this game is really nothing different than what anyone else has written already, on the positive side and negative side. The game is fun, addictive, has great replay value (I've played it 3 times), and has you feaning for a second one. Once in a while I'll scurry the Net looking for any tidbits on ME2. The only negative thing about this game is the sidequests. There are a few that are extremely fun, i.e. the mission where you have to help a squad of alliance team members hold back attacking reapers. That was great. Hopefully the side missions will correlate with the story a little more in the next one. I understand ALL of them cannot, but at least a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"FPS RPG is A-OK","review":"This game has been out for a few years and it is still good!With it's multiple endings, and many ways to play the game this game has a lot of variety.Before going into a mission you think to yourself \\"who would be best suited for this mission?\\"For extra challenge you can try to get the achievements where you stick with a character as soon as you get them until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, That Sums It Up","review":"If you agree with the saying \\"Getting there is half the fun\\" this is the game for you. I suggest investing in a guide or at least finding an FAQ somewhere for the planets, unless you enjoy running all over looking for things which is fun too. Whatever your exploration style, this game can help you do it. From the huge galaxy you can explore once the prologue is done to the individual planets you can land on and even the huge space station introduced in the prologue you will not want for adventure. I'm about 13 hours into the game just doing optional missions. I've only completed a quarter of the main storyline, and there are many more things I've yet to do! Driving the tank-like Mako on any number of very detailed planets, none of which are the same and many that have their own weather patterns, is a blast (literally if you run into trouble, it's got a great cannon). I'm looking forward to the next one and I'm still working on this one! Viva la trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Score","review":"Some small graphical glitches aside, this game is awesome. The variety of things you can do, the characters, the story, the engine, even the menues - everything is done extremely well. I found myself playing through twice in a row, just to try what outcome different actions would bring. And some of them are quite different. The moral choices you have to make (which buddy do I send to his death?) were actually hard to make at times. The mix of shooter/story/RPG works well, and the occasional humor actually came across as funny, in no small part because of the great facial expressions. This one was well worth the price for me and I definitely recommend it.HT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read the reviews","review":"The beginning of the game has to much to do as far as profile. After playing the game I know they warn you about after effects to you physically and ppl should read it cause it does happen. I had a headache that lasted for days. I felt dizzy and nausaed for days. Anyone want to buy this game from me let me know. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck - Can't stand it!","review":"I'm playing this on xbox360. Maybe I'm just too used to playing on PC, yet again I haven't played a game since Jedi Knight II over 10 years ago and I'm freakin' shocked to see how bad this game is considering the favorable reviews. The dialogue is crap and choppy, the action is completely lacking for the first 3 hours. You basically walk around getting lost for ever; accessing the map is painful and hard to get your bearings. Countless & pointless side missions. Hard to use special skills. Annoying 'squad' members. The worst: the long elevator rides; seriously, some elevators take 45 seconds to arrive at the destination which makes me want to punch something.Why do I give it only 2 stars? Because I have slightly more fun playing Angry Birds. This game is such a freaking waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan.","review":"i thought this was going to be a big open world like Oblivion but its not. its really lame and the cover system sucks really bad. i think the voice actings good and the graphics are nice but thats not enough to make this game enjoyable.. the fighting is just anti climatic and when you kill somone they always fall in this sortof wierd arching position its really wierd and hard to exlpain but i guess that means that there still using canned animation which is kindof lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitive","review":"I ordered this game thinking it would be like BioShock or Halo. Boy was I disappointed! I only managed to play for a few hours before sticking it back in its case and shelving it. The graphics and audio are great, but that doesn't make up for the boring story line and snails-pace movement. With the exception of a couple of short battles, the gameplay has consisted entirely of listening to long-winded dialogue and selecting from canned responses so I can listen to more long-winded dialogue. Perhaps, as other reviewers have mentioned, this changes the further you get in the game but I for one am not willing to waste time finding out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good 3d shooter","review":"Keep in mind i dont generally like 3d shooters. I bought this game as a sci-fi RPG... which it isnt. After a few days play, the only RPG elements i have found is that you get to pick 2 team members (out of 5 or so) to run out in front of you and block your shots when the badguys rush in.This game world has a lot of background, and youll spend your first couple play sessions reading about all the various races and their political struggles.. then youll spend another couple days on some tedious shooter runs... then you'll go pick up a good game instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 360 failure","review":"After about 2hrs (forced myself past an 1hr) I can already say this is one of the most boring games ive yet to play on the 360. I tried to convince myself that it was going to get better, but it didnt and now im mad because i wasted 8.60 at blockbuster.reasons being: repetitive, The conversations are too damn long,lame sound effects,not to mention this game ripped off of halo's designs and characters as well as a whole bunch of other games. Its just boring, I dont even have to try and convince the average 360 player on how lame it is, in fact im surprised people have given this more than 2 stars!No action, no fun factor, no life, as you could care less about the miscellaneous characters.If your looking for a good xbox RPG, go with Knights of the Old Republic, now that was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST RPG in years","review":"Mass Effect is one of the best games I've ever played, and that includes all genres.The storyline is exciting but nothing reallyt new. What sets ME apart is character interaction. The choices you have while interacting characters are nearly limitless. Wanna be a goody-too-shoes? Go aheas. Wanna be dark and self-centered? Why not. Be both if you want too the choices are yours and yours alone.Getting to explore uncharted worlds and the quests they may lead to adds diversity to a genre that really needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game.","review":"I was NOT disappointed with this game at all. Great system for an action/RPG, original, with lots of replay value. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of RPGs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly the best console RPG out there","review":"While this is not the best RPG I have ever played - several PC games such as Planescape: Torment are superior, in my view - this is quite clearly the best console RPG on the market, and a work of art at that. While combat is not as well-executed as I would have desired, the story, dialogue, characters, graphics. sound, music and overall style of the game are almost perfect. Quality permeates this game, down the outstanding credit music (M4 Part II by the Canadian band \\"Faunts\\"). Kudos to Bioware for another masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massively Awesome!","review":"If you like RPG and FPS (it's third person) game types, then you'll love Mass Effect. The only annoying thing that comes to mind is that you can't skip dialogue. So, if you are playing it over or if you just keep dieing in a boss fight, you have to listen to them yammer on and on... but, the game's graphics and the intriguing mysteries and coolness of the storyline are enough to get me to play it a few times. Oh, plus the fun of shooting stuff!! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Fun","review":"The start may be a little overwhelming from learning new controls and getting a feel for the game so I can see why some might say that they don't enjoy it. But if you give it a chance and let yourself get used to it, it becomes pretty much the most amazing game. The story is fantastic. During the journey of your character you can do many fun things. Plus, it also allows for good achievements to add to your gamerscore. Finally, a game that actually seems possible to 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bioware never ceases to amaze","review":"What a dynamic game.

If you are an RPG fan you can't ask for better, but I'm sure Bioware will come up with something even better down the pipeline. Great job guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the explorers.","review":"This game does a great job of letting you roam and do your own thing while still keeping the main story theme and atmosphere going. When you get your ship roughly 3-4 hrs into the game its a great feeling to be able to explore the entire universe as you uncover treasure, quests, new species, artifacts, and information. The characters are fairly well developed and you have a hard time picking the 2 you want to take with you because you like so many of them equally. The combat is intuitive and fast paced and require you to take cover at times and use the various abilities that you can learn when you level up your characters. I dont like science fiction rpg's but i really enjoy this game. It also does a great job of letting each character use any weapon they want while still having a particular 'class' approach that makes them experts with a certain kind. As a gamer for 18 years i strongly recommend this game to any rpg fan that enjoys a good story which you control."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is GREAT!!","review":"I love this game.

Some of the assignments are boring, but the story is fantastic. I'm glad I read the book because if leads right into the game.Make sure you play around with the menu. There is a lot going on in there. Using your teams biotics and other powers is key to getting past many of the levels. I took me awhile to catch on to this. It does make the game a bit choppy, but once you understand, the game opens up.There is a lot to this game. If you have an FPS background don't treat this game like it is one. This is a very fun RPG.

This game is a bland attempt to reach as many gamers as possible, and to be everything for everyone. RPG? Don't you believe it. The rpg elements are simplistic and repetitious.

Personally, I love everything Bioware has made up till this date, but this game was a step in the wrong direction. My personal gripes with this game is it's game-play. The animations, graphics, and story are wonderful its just when you're dropped into the experience the flaws become apparent. Combat and exploration are stale and dull. Combat grows tiring and exploration becomes mundane. The sequel looks promising, but this title certainly isn't the best RPG on the 360."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...Amazing","review":"This game is on my list as one of the best I have ever played.

The story is completely amazing. You're Earth's last hope to stop this mass genocide of galactic species. No pressure huh...2. The graphics and witty dialogue are outstanding as well. The decision making help determines your future in this game and the next games to follow giving replay value an extra boost.3. Saren reminds me of Sephiroth in a way. He is controlled by alien that has destroyed many people over and over again. This gave me the extra boost to take this sack of crap out.Cons1.

In all honesty I can't put Gears above this one either. I can't wait to get ME2 & 3 next week. If you play straight through this game you may have 8 to 10 hours gameplay depending on your shooter experience, but if you do as many of the side quests as you can you may be like me and end up with just over 24 hours in this one title.

This decides what happens in the quest, but, ultimately, it will all lead to the end.This is what Mass Effect is. Finally a video game that isn't meant to be an RPG standalone acts completely like a MMORPG with FPS. We are able to decide the fates of mankind. We are able to decide the fates of several other races. We are given the option to be a strong leader, emotionless, or a terrible leader.This game has amazing replay value.

It is an adult story (thus the Mature rating), but the story is relatively long, and has a mostly completed feel to it in the end. Shooter aspect gives gamer something to do during the fight instead of simple \\"main guy attack bad dude #3\\" interface.

That cd (Skin) & I made many trips to D.C. while dating. Rest assured though, I didn't copy lyrics and use them on my wife. Ok, i thought about it. Ok, a couple of times.

It had to be the coolest \\"concept\\" video I'd seen up to that point. (That's what they were calling innovative, esoteric-style videos back then; nowadays, that's the norm.) I don't know if he did any others, but for any fans who've not seen the \\"Forever\\" video--especially if, like me, that song has become one of your favorites of all time--you've GOT to find it, if you've not seen it.Admittedly, the visual impact is probably a bit tame, in comparison to the videos and effects that are commonly produced today.

I am a major Seal fan and still find him way more innovative and captivating than Lewis. Although I do enjoy this collection of songs, I feel that they comprise a mediocre effort.

This is a change from SOS yes, and no.

I always find their music easy to listen to and in most cases fun. Most of the songs are for those are for the hopeless romantics. This is still the same for FILTH & DREAMS. However...I do agree with the other reviewers that they have taken a different approach to their music. I would have to aggree that it is slightly hip-hop but more r&b; laden music. There is still the general feeling of old SOS (MAKE YOU STAY, CLOSER THAN THE SUN & FILTH AND DREAMS). However they did shy away from the jazzy and uptempo feel that we SOS fans are use to. Songs like WORLD OUT OF CONTROL, INVISIBLE & SUGAR FREE still contain Corinne's beautiful voice but tend to aim in the direction of r&b; and hip-hop.Overall this is a decent cd to own. Most people will not give this cd a chance but die hard fans (like myself) will have to have it. It is still as good and versitile as the other cds throughout their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure jewel","review":"What a Cd! \\"filth and dreams\\" is definitly Swing out sister's best effort.

The Cd is good from the beginning 'til the end; Songs like \\"when morning comes\\", \\"filth and dreams\\", or \\"closer than the sun\\" are spellbound. \\"make you stay\\", my favourite one, is pure bliss.

All noises seemed to \\"set their teeth on edge\\"...EVERY TIME!! And ditto on the fainting spells. I mean, the lady really needs some iron in her system. It became humorous.

Mr. Hautala's main character, a mother who has lost a child, witnesses (experiences) the death of a young girl in an emergency room in a hospital. A victim of a hit and run.The experience affects the main character is a profound way, which is evident in Hautala's vivid emotional and descriptive writing as he trys to convey the the profound affect (spiritual) on the main character. What makes the story interesting, is that the haunting is not in a home but in the mind of the character.But there's more to the story. Hauntings abound and a sociopaththreatens the whole family.

There just aren't enough of them out there these days to satisfy me. And I even enjoy the bad ones if they're fun. This one, however, was awful. I hated every one of the characters by the third or fourth chapter. The female protagonist is overly sensitive, paranoid, sees ominous signs in just about everything, (then obsesses about it for several pages,) and she faints 3 or 4 times before the book is half way through. The husband is a dolt, hot tempered, and also easily offended. The son is just a hateful brat. I guess the author wanted to create \\"family tensions\\" as a backdrop to the \\"spooky happenings\\" but it was so poorly done and unrealistic you'll hate these melodramatic people half way through the book.

Over all, an amazingly bad book and really disappointing. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I am only writing a review to bring down the overall score of this piece of drivel.

Did the author have some sort of word count minimum that was met by repeating similar incidents over and over again? You can read the first few chapters, solve the \\"mystery\\", and skip to the end. The middle is plodding and pointless. In fact, don't bother to read this book at all. It is an insult to the reader. Oh, and the absurdly random graphic sex scene?

Nothing in the world seemed to make her happy or please her; therefore, it was impossible to empathize with her. She seemed to enjoy her misery in the loss of a baby years earlier and feeling that her husband and everyone else in the world didn't understand her grief. Get therapy, for goodness sake!

Also I don't think the narration was believable. It didn't make sense like when she got scared and was leaving her son not knowing what's going on.

But it hasn't ever clogged and always works as you expect. I've been using my Canon inkjet printer and Canon's ink for several years without problems. I do use it very lightly (Christmas and birthday cards, and the rare time when my laser printer isn't working), so I can't attest to heavy usage. But that might be telling in itself: this ink doesn't have problems when it sits unused in the printer for months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job, But Expensive!","review":"Okay, Amazon does have the best price on this ink.

Both the blacks and all the color cartridges seem to last a reasonable amount of time. When you can buy a color photo printer for $90, you must expect to pay a premium for the ink cartridges.

While she does not always sympathize with his treatment of the women in his life, Carpenter's examination of the unpublished letters of several of the women who loved him, including those written by her mother, provides a nuanced view of these relationships. Her portrait of her mother is especially instructive and engaging. Medina Oliver Reitman's dry wit and her unshakable sense of self-direction are both endearing and admirable. While she was ostensibly apolitical, unmoved by the radical social and sexual philosophies of her contemporaries, she is the best embodiment of the \\"New Woman\\" of the twentieth century in fact or fiction that I've come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda' dull","review":"For such an interesting man living in such turbulent times as the '20s and '30s in Chicago, this was kinda' dull. Reitman's daughter disects many letters to & from Reitman but really doesn't get into an indepth study of the man--or the times. It's basically just a superficial gloss-over of his many lovers (and there were a lot!)The author could have used a better editor--she jumps around quite a bit, making statements that aren't followed up.I kept wondering what drove him to do the things he did--and how he became involved in his diverse causes. You'll never know by reading this book.Too bad--he could be a very interesting subject that sheds light on a controversial political and social movement in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Found 10 New Reasons to Care","review":"More traditional country music, the real stuff, from shuffles to two-steps on Scott Joss, 2nd solo album with Little Dog Records and that great baritone voice to boot. 3 tunes of the 10 song album were written by or co-written by Joss. A wonderful arrangement of Daddy's Honky Tonk gets you up off your seat and dancing or at least tapping a toe. His cover of Lonely Sounds is heartbreaking, a woeful tale of a lost love. And the Joss penned A New Reason to Care brings the listener back up with a good tempo and heartwarming lyrics. On this album, Joss does lead/background vocals, fiddle, mandolin, and lead/rhythm guitars. Additional musicians include Pete Anderson, Taras Prodaniuk, Skip Edwards, Gary Morse & Lee Thornberg. The album is a must have for anyone who loves traditional country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Thinkfun fav","review":"great product simple yet lots of thinking esp for little ones better than other games out there buy it its worth it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THINK FUN SCRAMBLED EGG","review":"THIS IS A GREAT TOY FOR MATH AND ABSTRACT THINKING.

I think this album suprised lots of his fans,because of this latin shuffle(?) is never heard from sanbirn\`s music. I can hear lots and lots of different skills which I have never heard from his other albums. This album is very enjoyabl,probably most amount of improvisation than any other albums(except live)and he still have not lost his shape, I like sanbore like this red hot but still with his beatiful sound. I think he sax is very close to live, howerever this album get rearly boaring after 5th song SOUL SERENADE. Rest is good as first 5 songs but I just get tired because they all sound simular. Even though this album wasn\`t well balanced I still think he was very succesfull of playing these type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an album to relax in a bubble bath with wine","review":"Unlike David Sandborn's Close up (shown on this recording's web page), this is not a lite jazz pop recording that one associates with relaxing in a bubble bath with a glass of white wine.Put it this way, the last track is an Ornette Coleman Free Jazz tune.If you like the heavy jazz pop Miles Davis did in the 1980s, or the jazz fusion of Weather Report's \\"Mr. Gone\\" recording, or Return to Forever's \\"Romantic Warrior\\", then you will not be disappointed as most the tunes do stray into these soundscapes.Certainly one of Sandborn's more non commercial recordings.For the over genre, it gets an 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Could not be happier with the product & the vender. Thanks so much for the Excellent Customer Service.

However, the more I played it, the more I liked it's wide range of music styles. \\"Benny\\" is now one of my favorite all time sax tunes. Don't approach this as a jazz sax album - it's a little more pop than that. But for a great all around sax album, it's probably my favorite now. I took it on vacation one year and inadvertently left it in the beach house I rented. By the time I discovered it missing, someone else had evidently discovered how good it was and kept it. I thought I could live without it. Nope...couldn't. Had to get another one. That speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"How cool ?","review":"What a relief. After the previous 1991 grunge jazz (I've just made that up) album called 'Another Hand', we are seriously back on course with this beauty. The band this time includes funk catalyst Marcus Miller and a bigger horn section than normal. The result is another different overall sound for Mr. Sanborn and an exciting live sound to the recording. Groove playing is assured here, and there are at least three killer up-tempo tracks with a funky latin flavour and awesome trademark sax grooves by our man. Drummers out there, listen and enjoy Steve Jordan's minimalist playing, and his snare drum just behind the beat - lovely. I always skip the (three) bluesy tracks - not my scene, but maybe yours. There's one or two dodgy tracks - Bang Bang which is a shocker, but hey there's always the forward button for these. My recommended tracks; Alcazar, or the opener, Snakes. I'd say this is a must have album for any self respecting Sanborn fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm fusion....","review":"You would have thought, with a list of brass credits this big, that the music on this album would have more intensity, but aside from 'Alcazar', which is beautiful, the horn section sounds, well, cold and mechanical. It doesn't sound like a seasoned group of musicians, but rather like a CD where each track was put together in the studio (those redundant guitar lines on 'Snakes' are a great example). This includes a section of horns that sound like they were were sampled electronically and added around Sanborn's solo sax. Try Tower of Power for some really emotive brass section work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Ppar","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Moench and Jones. The pairing of these two is usually magical in ever sense of the word. The Batman/Dracula trilogy is some of the best Batman I've seen in years, but I think the pair really misstepped here. Even Jones, who was born to draw Batman, seems off this time, and the story fails to entertain at at all. If you are looking for Batman by these two pick up the aforementioned trilogy or the FAR superior Batman Unseen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Boyz returned in 2000 for this great set of books!","review":"I was delighted when Da Boyz were on Bats for regular monthly work, but they shine when they're doing supernatural stuff.

In this story, the girl tells her grandmother about the Goddess Pele and Her sacred mountain, while the grandmother tells the girl about volcanoes and geological activity. At the end of the book, the grandmother says \\"I told you the scientific story, and you told me the religious story, and *they were the same*\\".Beautiful illustrations and very respectful treatment of Pele and Her mountain. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science and Religion","review":"In reading this book, I am reminded of how often I have found that myths that explain how the world works are often merely a symbolic explanation that when cut down to bare bones are exactly the same as science claims. My belief that religion and science have no need to clash is reinforced. They are two different explanations for the same fact. Religion and science can work together, in fact. Science answers our need for an intellectual explanation and religion fulfills our spiritual nature. For me, science has never undercut my faith as it only reinforces the miracle of our world.I also find it amazing that these ancient myths have such basis in fact. It seems to me that the workings of this world our something a human being can know inately and are not solely the knowledge of the wild animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book that you can learn from","review":"It was great.

However once I had it, I could easily see why it's often referred to as their early peak. Unlike some of the other albums, it's very consistent. Track after track is basically what you would expect and hope for from Phish. Plus this disc serves up \\"Cavern\\", \\"Stash\\", \\"Tweezer\\", and the rockin' \\"Chalk Dust Torture\\", which all rank among their best songs. The best part is that everything else is nearly as great, and the more I play \\"Picture Of Nectar\\", the more I rank it up there with \\"Junta\\" and \\"Billy Breathes\\". It may be too late to catch Phish live, but it's not too late to get your hooks on one of their many great albums, including this one. It's jamtastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 STARS only for CAVERN","review":"I bought Farmhouse and Lawn Boy because two friends told me this was the way in to this underground band. I think these two should be on the Rolling Stone 500 but aren't for some reason. Anyway, I bought Nectar without anybody's guidance but my own. I was dissapointed because there wasn't really a theme to the album like the other two. It was more of a collection of songs arranged in a way that sound good together. Certainly the music is very complex and takes the brain around different places but I just didn't feel anything. \\"STASH\\" is amazing but it just seemed that it took an enormous amount of time to write only because it is so intricate. I gave this album 4 stars only for \\"CAVERN\\" because it seems like I heard iit somewhere in my childhood and it makes no sense but yet it does. I just bought RIFT and I am now back on track.

AVOID this one at all cost!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"Anyone who saw the Rolling Thunder performances will remember its neo-vaudevillian aspects. Of course there was Dylan, but T-Bone Burnett, Kinky Freidman and most especially the violinist Scarlett Rivera added greatly to the mix.

I am a huge Dylan fan, but this is one live album we could have done without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Gems","review":"Wonderful performances from the first song to last and best part is Dylan seems to be enjoying himself and the audience. After getting too famous in the mid-60's it's great to finally hear the period where he was able to come back and just perform without a posse of lunatics treating him like the Second Coming.If you've tried to turn a friend on to Dylan and just haven't found the right collection, try sharing \\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" and the joyously reworked \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" and see if you can't make them into a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob at his 70's best","review":"This CD is a must have for any Dylan fan. The band is tight (for Bob), the song selection excellent, and the sound quality is great also. \\"Baby blue\\", \\"Tonight I'll be staying here with you\\" and \\"Hattie Carol\\" stand out as some of the exceptional tracks on this double disc. I was concerned that Joan Baez's presence was going to ruin this album but actually she was quite an addition, singing very well with Bob. If you enjoy this album get the Live 1966 Bootleg series disc, it is a 6 star album!!!

These disks offer a beautiful sounding quality of one of the greatest tours ever assembled. The songs are alive and are ever renewed in typical Dylan syle with the versions embellished or totally made over to create a new being. Dylan's voice is clear and he seems loose and relaxed. It just doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Rolling Thunder Review","review":"The classics are all here and the quality is fantastic. \\"Isis\\" in particular rocks. By listening to these discs, one certainly gets a great feeling of the 1975 and 1976 Rolling Thunder Revue.

Dylan's painted face allows him to be more diverse. It has songs that feature just Dylan and his guitar and others with his stellar band.

He just rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob at his best!!!","review":"I have loved Dylan through all his changes but this period is my favorite, this is a great companion to the \\"Hard Rain\\" cd. which i think is the best live recording of all time. What a tight band the vocals are the best.and then there is Scarlet Rivera. i thought she added so much to Dylan's band and Rob Stoner on bass. thes versions are great and Dylan's guitar playing is great. i wish they would release \\"Hard Rain\\" and \\"Renaldo and Clara\\" on Dvd.

Pales in comparison to both the bootleg series concerts from 1964 and 1966. In Rolling Thunder, what's with all the shouting lyrics? Too self-indulgent with his voice and musical arrangements.

Dylan does some terrible performances on here that are what explain why the 1970s got a bad name. Ha ha ha. Come on!! Dylan did such quantities of drugs before these shows he has only one dynamic style. It is uninteresting. It is not musical. Just yelling. Lots and lots of yelling. To say it gets old... well... it IS old. Here we find Dylan at a dead end. Not a peak. We hear a lot of musicians, but not much music.This era is the reason why some people find Dylan only semi literate musically. Just yelling. But taken on his own terms -- a rich, stoned professional yeller from the 1970s whose audience is overindulgent -- this is one of the greatest albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Thunder Noise","review":"The Rolling Thunder Review was the beginning of the end for a whole lot of us original Dylan fans. Dylan was trying to break out of the traditional concert tour thing that he did to great effect in the 74 tour with The Band.

His career has been erratic ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one star too many...","review":"I guess I missed Dylan somewhere along the line. This is not the Dylan I knew in the 60's.

That has now changed. The recordings are surprisingly crips and probably owe to today's technology than anything else. What makes this a MUST is not only the great playing, but a diverse set list that includes songs from, arguably, Dylan's finest album, Desire. Though there is no JOEY, we get Hurricane, Oh Sister, Sara, Isis, Romance in Durango, and One More Cup of Coffee. As good as the NET shows are, this really captured Bob at the peakin of his performing prowess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Dylan fans already have it. Dylan dabblers should get it. Those interested in real songwriting craft and real performers put it in your shopping cart. An fine example of dylan performing with conviction/heart and soul and seeming to actually enjoy it. Great song selection matched with fine musicianship and relatively good production for a live album. My personal favorite songs- Tonight I'll be staying here with you, Simple twist of fate, Mama you been on my mind, I shall be released, It's all over now baby blue, Love minus zero/no limit, Tangled up in blue,Sara, Knockin on heaven's door, and the beautiful version of the traditional song The water is wide. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every cent....","review":"a superb live set from Bob. great songs and killer back-up band featuring T-Bone Burnette(of O Bro fame), violinist Scarlet Rivera and Joan Baez on harms. electric versions of old protest songs like Hattie Carrol and Hard Rain may jar at first but as you listen it all makes sense. and the songs from Desire actually sound better. Dylan's solo acoustic songs(Baby Blue, Mr. T Man) are great as are his duets with Joan. an extra treat is the 2 song DVD included which features Tangled Up In Blue and Isis on 5.1 Dolby Surround. Isis blazes rivaling anyone else for intensity(other than talentless noise machines like alt/metal bands). for no holds barred live rock n roll and great acoustic ballads this is hard to beat. rivals even Live 66."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a book for me","review":"Its got SOME good ideas but for the most part I really didnt like this book.

Not only are the author's \\"simple\\" examples unrelated to anything that programmers do in the real world, they are written from the viewpoint of the programming gods on Mount Olympus. Does anybody really care whether your \\"pointer to a derived function of a virtual base class that inherits nothing, can end up being a consternation for those expecting a pure, inherited pointer to a class that is virtually derived?\\"Huh? Enough said.C++ is an obscure language enough. And not one that will be around for very long in view of the developments of web programming in general. It will always be a basis to start from -- then once learned, quickly forgotten, like Latin.If you want more from this book then study FORTRAN, the precursor of the Latin we all know (and are struggling to work with to this day)."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent content & format","review":"This is a very good buy for anyone not having the paper version of these books yet.

Even though my old ignition system (cap, rotor, coil, wires) were less than a year old, there was a definite improvement with MSD with every product I have purchased.

However there is a spring mechanism that holds the wrench together to make it work. This spring is very flimsy at best, doesn't hold up to the slightest of tension. It will go out of shape with the slightest tug. I found it very difficult to unwrap the package without damaging the spring mechanism because the shrink wrap is totally wrapped around the product and spring. Once you pull of the shrink wrap, the spring will get bent and the entire wrench becomes useless.Of course right on the package itself is a replacement part number for the spring. How convenient, it must be a part they want to sell a million of because it'll keep getting bent/twisted and become unusable. This spring should be made from heavier duty material that won't bend out of shape so easily.

On the math section, answers for the questions are often wrong! Wrong explanations are given, for THREE of the twenty questions in just one section I did (before throwing the book away).

It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me. I consider it my rebound (without the consequences). Please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"It took me a long time to get into this book. I found the writing to be stilted and unnatural rather than poetic and flowing. Other than Kin, I didn't feel much for any of the characters and found it hard to understand their motivations.

Luckily, I still had a back up of the save file on my 360 hard drive. But doesn't that defeat the purpose of trying to back up the MU? Save your money, just buy two MUs as a redundant backup system. It's too bad, I had really high hopes for this.Note (if your computer recognizes the MU): You cannot pick and choose which game file you want to back up. You can only back up the entire MU.

The other two newman's cookies did not have this problem. The mint creme was the best of the three, having a slight mint taste, which I finished all of the packs in nearly two days. It was that good.

Well, these are not it. These cookies are simply sandwich cookies in the traditon of Oreo, but with a mint filling. If they had more stuffing they might have been good; as it was, they were too dry.

Due to the ingredients, which are more natural and--of course--organic, they're also a bit healthier. Pesticides and other nasty chemicals in foods hurt not only the earth, but our bodies as well. They may contribute to all kinds of health problems. Who really wants to put that stuff into themselves or their family? Usually, we do it because we don't have an alternative. Thanks to people like the Newmans, that's changed. You can find the chocolate creme Newman-O's at places like Wal-Mart these days, if you check the snack aisle. And they're quite worth it. Try some--I bet you'll agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better than those O's!","review":"My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream.

I asked my husband if he realized they where wheat free he said yes but that they were still good. My daughter gets mad when they eat \\"her\\" cookies but since they were coming regularly she has learned to share.The cookie part is very crunchy (more so than Oreos) and has a nice chocolaty taste.

I actually signed up for the Subscribe & Save for these. Never thought I'd do that, but you get a much better price and can cancel at any time. I won't be canceling these though, every six months I'll get my \\"fix\\" of these great cookies. These cookies make me feel good because of the taste, but you know I like the idea of the Newman brand to. It makes me feel good that a portion of the cost is going to charity.

The legs to the plastic ballerina are attached to the body with hook-type metal pieces that show as the skirt on the doll is poofed up so it looks really, really tacky and cheap. Not to mention probably unsafe for too young a child. The dome is plastic and doesn't even attach to the music box, it just kind of sits there as long as the music box is on a flat surface.There are cheaper nutcracker themed music boxes to be found(as well as more expensive)but how ironic I bought this in lieu of a 'cheaper' one!

Non-Parsis even had to tolerate finding human body parts in their front doors and yards, vultures having dropped them there after having their fill, thanks to the Parsi custom of allowing dead bodies to be eaten by vultures.

The Parsis are peoples that migrated from Persia to India several hundred years ago to escape Islamic persecution, and this book tells us in touching detail how present-day Parsis live their lives. You read the angst with which the Jewish girlfriend of a Parsi boy decides to leave India for Israel and you wonder if a similar decisions might not have been taken by Parsis as well if they had a homeland to go back to. Fortunately for India, they remained and flourished and became full Indians.While the specifics of this book make it a book about Parsis, Indians or Bombayites, the sensitivity with which Umrigar portrays the frailties, eccentrities, successes and failures of her community makes it a deep and loving foray into the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have lived in India and was looking forward to reading this book especially as I'd enjoyed another one of the author's books.

People killed that Motley Crue album but if you REALLY listen to it you hear a guy who's living out his dream of singing with his favorite band, and he lets it rip.

Stott has great expository skills, and they are displayed here.

Unfortunately, the author was unable to put any life into this story. The organization is very poor, with time lines and thematic lines jumbled about. Irrelevant biographical details and interminable discussions of various adoption laws make for annoying interruptions, and when an interesting narrative appears it ends abuptly without discussion of its relevance.

I reluctantly picked up this story and began to read it and was immediatly drawn to it's lovely writing.Set on a poor street in England, one side Jewish one side Catholic, you are told the story through the eyes of a young jewish boy. The days of torment at the hands of his cruel drunk father. The hardships his mother faced. But mostly a story of how love- a romeo/juliet kind of story.Oh it is sad.

The inclusion of dialog easily puts the reader in the time period. The tone and style of the author encourage empathy and understanding of both populations on either side of the invisible wall. The author conveys his and his sibling's emotions in the gentlest of ways while the reader easily grasps that at the time they were much more. While not quite a page turner, my attention never lagged and I would have willingly read more. I would have appreciated more wisdom on the overall subject such as was found in Arthur's letter to Lily."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Actually Did Put the Book Down Several Times","review":"I put this book down a few times--when I fell asleep reading it. I really wanted to like this book. I got it on special order from my bookstore. The story is just not alive. The book is totally without humor. The characters who appear as neighbors in the book are hard to differentiate. The dialogue is wooden. Events seem to live in a timeless, de-natured way in the author's memory. They do not unfold in the book. There is a lack of energy about the whole thing. It is just not very interesting. The book is in no way like Angela's Ashes. If Harry Bernstein had been sixty-six instead of ninety-six would this book have been published based on its merits? I am sure it would not have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, could not finish","review":"There were some very dramatic things in this book, but the author told everything with the same boring drone. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental and Obvious","review":"Although this memoir has an exciting story to tell, the writing is so poor, I had to force myself to finish it. The beginning is suppose to be written from the point of view of a 4 year old, but in fact the author's voice is the same throughout the novel.A gimic I didn't like was the author'z way of planting hints of what's going to happen. When Lilly has trouble breathing and has pains, you know she's going to die young of heart problems.I read the book in large print and thought this was a book for adolescents since it is very moralistic, and black and white. But perhaps adolescents will not like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read!","review":"As many others have written, I did not want to put this book down and thought about it when I was not reading it. I have just finished it and am sad to see that Harry passed away in June of this year. but who can complain since he reached the age of 101! Just would have liked to tell him how much I loved his memoir. I'm planning to give it as gifts this Christmas. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"This is one of of the best books I have ever read. I felt like I lived in the town where he lived every time I read a page. I just felt like I could see the people and the buildings and all. I have read all three of Harry Bernstein's books. I highly recommend them all. Harry had a father that did not love his family or take care of them. His mother did the best she could and she is a saint. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but the ending is worthwhile","review":"The title of this book is misleading. I was expecting the love story (that broke barriers) to be told throughout the book. Unfortunately, it took two-thirds of the book to find any depth to the love story. In many ways, this story is similar to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes (which I much preferred).When it appeared, the love story was quite delightful. The way that Lily and Arthur got married was wonderful. But with many stories from this time period, the struggles didn't end when happiness entered the picture.The author did a great job painting pictures of the conditions as they existed. But I would have preferred more about the Love Story that Broke Barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine memoir.","review":"This memoir was written when the author had advanced in age, but this doesn't take away from the clearness of the story. Harry Bernstein narrates the story of a single street split into two - a Jewish side, and a Christian side. Beside this fictitious chasm, there is also trouble within the household - an alcoholic father, grinding poverty, and a hardworking, unhappy mother. However, there are also moments of happiness that Bernstein narrates with an appreciable humor.The Christian side and the Jewish side do not mix, as if there's a tangible wall separating them. However, they do come together once during the two wars, and more significantly in the novel, when Harry's sister, Lily weds a Christian from across the street. The novel is very reminiscent in my mind of the segregation era in American history. I doubly recommend \\"The Invisible Wall\\", a fine read of about 300 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Melting Pot... Not","review":"Take the Torah, the Bible, \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" Mix them together and you have this book.It is tragic and touching and has you rooting for the \\"good guys\\" right from the start.

He had so very little but somehow in great detail shares his past. I did not get the feeling he was complaining or suffered major damage as a result of the negatives in his life. Not what one would do in this day in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read that makes you think","review":"Hard to believe the age of the author (in his 90's), and I look forward to another of his books. He has woven the story of his childhood, abject poverty of the family, his neighborhood and pre- and post-WWI times, together with the struggles of Jews vs. Christians mentality of his time, into an inspiring, probing book. It makes you reflect on mankind, what we have done and continue to do in the ways we treat each other. Yet he does not pity himself for his early life, rather it is a mesmerizing memoir into a different time and place, beautifully detailing the characters and their different ways of coping with the prejudices and terrible odds stacked against them. A great read for book clubs--so many themes within its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Magic Eraser instead","review":"This product is an inferior version of \\"Magic Eraser\\".

If this means anything to anyone, I have had a few significant musical experiences listening to this cd. In the solo at the end of Reba (which is possible Trey's best ever), if you are truly into the song and the emotions it provokes, you can almost feel what Trey is thinking just by listening to his guitar. Extremely powerful. But this cd is like a huge ocean. It takes a while to catch its sound because it's so complex, so don't force it upon yourself, but give it time to grow.

Now I have a feeling that I may get some flack for this someday but can anyone who has heard any of these songs live truly say that the studio tracks come even close? PHISH's first two albums are dull, musaky, and low-energy, partially because they hadn't figred out how to use a studio yet, they just tried to recreate their live performance. If only they had learned what they learned by \\"billy breathes\\" and applied it to the songs on this album, the album woudl be outstanding, but the result here is almost unlistenable.

I recently heard of them and bought this CD used and cheap, right here for three fity as my kids would say, and I am really amazed at the quality of music.This is a quality group and a good CD. If you are reading this, you probably like the sound of music that fills you with riffs and harmonies, great leads with cool licks from all GREAT musicians in this band.One could argue they are a little silly and wierd with there lyrics, but that is what creativity is all about.This is a quality band that just played in the wrong era.

You will receive four or five times as much information, although you still won't have dietary fiber information. The problem with Netzer's Carbohydrate Counter is that it neglects to break the carbohydrate gram count into its nutritional carbohydrate and dietary fiber carbohydrate components. That makes this book useless for those people whose nutritional needs require that information.

I recently discovered, through a wonderful Naturopathic Doctor that I do indeed have Chronic Candidiasis & as such need to keep my carb count to under 50 gms while on the recovery. My blood type (O) also suggests a high protein / low carb food regimen for healthy living & this book tells me everything about the carbs in the food I eat and don't eat.

They have the heaviness for the metalheads, the psychadelic edge for stoners, and the weird noises and ambiences for Radiohead fans. This is their 2nd best album, and it also comes with their impressive debut. Come My Fanatics is a lot heavier than their debut, and it shows, with the bass-heavy groove of Return Trip and the long jam of Doom-Mantia. The first album is in more of a Sleep sound, with some more stoner elements and Sabbath-flavored than their other albums. It's interesting to see how much they've evolved into the doom masters they are now.

In both books, he sighs constantly in response to events, at least once every page or two. When the author finally does include a few action pages, we get all sorts of italicized Marvel Comic Book sound words like Crunnnch.., and KKCHHhhewww!!,and Thuddd!!, etc, not to mention bleep, burp, etc etc. These attempts to bring sound to the written page fall flat, but do a good job of detracting from any actual action going on.

The feelings expressed in it are all within the range of believability and thus more meaningfull and allows one to feel the delicacy and importance of the moment.Samurai X, \\"Reflection\\" gave an excellent closure to the unforgettable series and truly is a heart-touching ending.

I have nothing bad to say about this tool.As for the review which stated you can't use this tool to tighten the oil filter, you don't use this tool to tighten the oil filter. An oil filter is hand tight plus 1/4 to 1/2 turn for a tight fit. A person with average strength should be able to tighten the filter without issue. If you need a tool to remove and tighten the filter, then this tool is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works! it really works!!","review":"Mine is a 1998 Toyota Corolla. The oil filter has been stuck there for a long long time. It's a Mobil 1 filter which has a very smooth surface(I will use Fram in the fulture).Tried several wrenches, plastic, metal, and the Pliers type. nothing works. Finally I found this (Lisle 63600) on Amazon. Then I removed the Mobil 1 very easily. It is so strong!FYI, this is a tool for remove oil filter, not for install.

It shows slighty more visual wear than I would expect for the amount of play it received. It did hit the chainlink fence more than a couple times, so maybe that caused the increase wear. Needed to have air added about every other week otherwise it would get too soft. Overall I would buy it again if needed.

The first book was to be about a single man, the second book on a couple, and this book on a family.The plot involves the murders of family members of the Greene family.

The novels have aged him much too quickly, and it's good to return to a younger and more vigorous Gordianus. The stories live up to the excellent writing of the novels, and though the mysteries may be a trifle simpler, just the way the author takes us on a trip trhough the ancient world is worth the price of admission. I'm anxiously awaiting the next novel in this wonderful series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge of short stories","review":"This is another bridge between novels. I read it between Arms of Nemesis and Catalina's Riddle. This is ten times better than the first set of short stories called the house of the vestals. The best short story is the last one that deals with the cherries brought from Asia that could possibly be driving a leading Roman general to insanity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saylor Scores Again With These Short Tales of Gordianus","review":"Being a great fan of Saylor's Roma Sub Roma mystery series, this book is a fun and engaging collection of short stories interspersed between the novels. Saylor has time and again incorporated historically accurate settings and context in his works (as many critics have noted) to make the reader feel as if they're actually walking and breathing in the smells of ancient Rome. It's always a pleasure to embark a mystery with Gordianus the Finder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gladiator dies only once","review":"I found it a joy to have all the stories in one volume, makes it easier to read. I can often remember a story but I can't remember which of several things it could be in, means trawling all over the house to look for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Historical Mystery Fiction","review":"I am definitely a fan of Steven Saylor's \\"Gordianus the Finder\\" tales, set in the First Century BCE, during the last decades of the Roman Republic. The present volume is a collection of short stories set fairly early in Goridanus's career, some decades before the more recent novels in the series. But like the novels, these short stories are filled with strong, memorable characters and genuine historial incident.I rate Saylor as quite probably the best \\"historical mystery\\" working today; his books always provide new insights into Ancient Roman life and society. The stories in this volume wwuld be a good introduction to the more complex and subtle novels in Saylor's \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" series, enjoyable in themselves but also illuminating the characters inhabiting the novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds fresh as ever","review":"This is the Phish album I listen to most of all their studio efforts. First of all it sounds great, and sounds fresh. Every time I listen it sounds like nothing I've ever heard before. You Enjoy Myself is a tour-de-force, Divided Sky is beautiful, Esther and Fee are great story-songs, and Contact is sweet in a silly way. There's really not a bad song on the album, although Union Federal (a band rehearsal) is a little tedious...Junta is the place to start if you want to know what makes Phish special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish brings jam into studio","review":"This, Phish's first studio CD, is what played a major role in starting the Phish phenomenom. Previously only available as tapes at their live shows, Junta was released later by Electra and it serves as the classic album for Phish fans. This was recorded in a period when the band was striving to bring their live, jam-driven music into the studio. Though they have recently steered away from this approach (Farmhouse), this CD unquestionably achieves what Phish was going for. With 2 of their most epic songs (YEM and Divided), it is simply a must own. Trey's beautifully soft and controlled guitar notes still give me goose bumps on Divided Sky; along with Page's rolling piano in the middle section of YEM. And the jamming in David Bowie is amazing. Other classics include Golgi, Fluffhead, and Esther. My favorite Phish CD hands down!!!!!!! -Pete McMahon"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Started It All","review":"This album is the first Phish I ever owned, as a matter of fact someone gave it to me, so I didn't listen to it that much when I first got it. I didn't quite grasp the concept of Phish at 13 years old, but now as a musician and lover of great music, I realized the amount of talent and great music Phish has. So I pulled this out as I started by ascent in to Phishhead status, and was once again reminded of the variety that Phish can get. Songs like Divided Sky, make me shutter in compelte musical ecstacy. This is a definite must for Phish newbies, and already dedicated fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This CD","review":"Okay, maybe I made a mistake buying Junta. Not being a Phish fan, I figured I'd expand my horizons and buy their first CD to find out why this group got so damned popular. What I found was a rambling mess of medicore musicianship and really (I mean REALLY) stupid songs. What bothers me most about Phish is that they're such a Grateful Dead ripoff it makes me sick. By the way, The Dead were much better musicians and Garcia wrote better songs. I'll give Junta another listen but I fear it's destined to be traded or sold. But before I do, I better dust off my bong...just to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"{yawn}","review":"This is a rambling album with a lot of \\"jamming.\\" Phish are lacking in good musicianship at this point. The main thing people should know about this album is that they totally [mimic] music from old cartoons. Really weak stuff.I will say, though, that \\"Fee\\" is a good song if you like nursery-rhyme style music."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEM and much much more","review":"This is pretty much THE Phish CD to own. Of the fourteen songs there are maybe two that fall short of briliance- simply becasue they are suited better for concerts- Foam and Dinner and a Movie. But Esther, Fee, Fluffhead, Fluff's Travels, YEM, Divided Sky, and David Bowie are all great here. Also, Icculus is perhaps the funniest song ever, apperaing here as one of the three live tracks. To be bold but honest, you need to get it or you will never hear jam rock at its finest. While maybe not Phish's masterpiece, this does contain their most memberable songs. Pick it up now, also a great starter album for all you non phishheads out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"This was the first Phish album I heard and I immediately fell in love with them. They are some of the most talented musicians I have come across. The way they can just improvise a jam for over an hour is amazing. Anyway, onto the album....Junta (pronounced Joon-ta, in case you're wondering) is the first album of Phish's amazing 17 year career, and out of all the albums, probably their purest. David Bowie has to be my favorite track on the disc. Clocking in at 11 minutes, the songs only lyrics are \\"David Bowie\\" and \\"UB40.\\" The rest of the song is an amazing, jazzy jam.If you're just starting out as a Phish phan I highly reccomend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish's first album is one of their best.","review":"Junta is a piece of musical genius by one of the worlds premier jam bands. Junta has a variety of playing styles as well as great vocals. This is definately the cd to start your phish collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, it was terrible.","review":"I know I'm in the minority here, but I absolutely can't stand this album. I recently heard a few Phish songs at a friend's house and thought I might like to get into the band, so I bought this album, burned it onto a couple CDs, popped it in my car's CD player, and put it on \\"Mix.\\"The first song I listened to was \\"Union Federal.\\" At first I thought it was a joke song because all the notes were being played off-key, but it lasted for TWENTY FIVE WHOLE MINUTES. I was shouting at the CD player for the song to end because it was so bad and torturously long. (I decided to tough it out and listen to the whole thing in case it got good by the end. It didn't.)The rest of the songs were mediocre at best. I couldn't stand \\"Icculus\\" and couldn't finish listening to most of the others. I liked \\"Fee,\\" which was one of the songs I heard that got me interested, but in the end it's nothing to write home about.Bottom line, if you're new to Phish, this may not be the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS MY PHRIST PHISH CD","review":"i WAS 5 i brought this on a whim because my dad said I could get whatever CD I wanted and I was like thats a funny way to spell FISH it changed my life I now go on summer tour every year and all the new years RUns and when I get out of school itll be fall tour time seriously thou this is a great album its got FEE and COntact A BUNCH OF INTENSE GOODIES i do believe if you dont download free music and are okay with a short album but with with really great stuff its a great phrist album it doesnt have their best stuff because their best stuff is live but it does give you that soul and a tiny bit of understanding as to what they are about it helped inspire me to find everything I could that they did and are still doingOF course this record does hold a special place in my heart because it was my PHRIST listen and enlightened me to my love of THE PHISH FROM VERMONT LOLZ but i really think if your a PHAN or are curious about becoming a phan this is a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUNTA!~!!!!","review":"I have all the Phish albums, and this is by far the greatest album ever created in music history. The album flows well, every song is fresh and dynamacially percise. Phish shows their true talent and muscianship through making Junta, and every song is beautfully put together and funky. I have been a Phish fan for a long long time, and heard every album a million time- this one, in my opinion, is just outstandingly dominant over the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you NOT own Junta?","review":"Whenever somebody asks me what Phish sounds like, I always say, \\"Buy Junta and find out for yourself. Now get out of here!\\" OK-- maybe I'm not the friendliest person around, but my intentions are good, and so is this album (see how it all comes around). Simply put, Junta is the crown jewel of Phish's studio recordings.Note: Phish does not sound like the Dead or Dave Matthews or anyone else. They sound like Phish."},{"rating":"2","title":"reference to post below","review":"This is probably Phish's best studio album, containing some of their best songs including the song that turned me onto Phish, David Bowie.

I really didn't know that a band could be so good at what they do. I was used to bar bands and I had seen \\"Page & Plant\\" perform as the only large scale show. Phish however.....was different, and out of their whole process of evolution as musicians, this album holds strong!! everyone loves a good YEM, Bowie, Divided, Foam, golgi, Fee, Fluffs, I mean...I'd be happy with that as a part of a single set list....to summerise, Junta is a make or break album, a true \\"test\\" to see if you are Phriendly enough for Phish :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely unbelievable.","review":"I believe this to be Phish's greatest achievement. This album transcends time and the sheer musical complexity of it is mind-blowing.

Es desesperante esperar la acci��n que parece que nunca llega y ver el misterio del dei gloria que no se sabe lo que es. Para quienes comparan la novela con Moby Dick, este libro no le da ni por los tobillos. La obra esta llena de tecnicismos y t��rminos marinos, pero en definitiva no es un gran libro y sinceramente sin animo de ofender no creo que sea recordado dentro de unos a?os. Los personajes se mantienen alejados y enigm��ticos y parece que nunca llegaremos a compenetrarnos con ellos.

After reading some reviews and a short excerpt, I decided to get the book. Too much nautical lingo; endlessly repeated literary images; a sudden, almost forced revelation of the identity of the narrator who could not have known the details of his own story; a not too credible plot (green lobsters?) are some of the book faults.

The other day browsing in Tower, I saw it on sale and bought it for myself.My god, what an outing. I've always been a big fan of Smith's work, especially the albums with Wes Montgomery, but this is even more impressive. His playing is inspired, and the room he gives his fellow soloists is beyond generous. To me the real surprise is the impressive guitar work of Eddie McFadden. Considering this was 1958, Eddie's playing was far ahead of the time, especially his fleet fingered lines on \\"Groovin at Smalls\\", and Parker's \\"Cool Blues\\". Makes me wonder why he never got his just due from the jazz guitar establishment. The other player who really caught my attention was Tina Brooks. Beautiful tone and phrasing. Lou Donaldson also was in exceptionally fine form. And the drumming of both Blakey and Bailey is always on the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest of the blues","review":"Jimmy's live recordings on Blue Note are something special..from Groovin at Smalls Paradise to At Club Baby Grand to Cool Blues.

Very easy to install. THe HP software for this printer immediately picked up the fact that duplex printing is enabled. So I tried printing a two-page document. Duplexer worked fine - mechanically. The only issue is that the second page printed upside down. In reviewing this on the Internet, I find this is apparently a common problem. In calling HP support, I was fortunate enough to speak to someone who was more interested in getting my email address than helping me with the issue, which is still occurring.Bottom line, check the Internet to see if your printer has issues with this accessory (or 'Accessoory' as the HP User Guide calls it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slothful","review":"I agree with Dr. John's review of this book, which could have been interesting, save for the bad editing.

Also it was mentioned in another review that it starts off with 15 different names, then it switches to nicknames, then back to their given names.

I had never heard them live before, though.Either they had a bad day when recording this concert or they should thank their producers a thousand times over for magically rescuing their studio recordings. The instrumentals are great in this live recording; vocals (lead as well as background) are abysmal. To me the vocals sound very poor and often off key, this is really not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sounds From Psychedelphia' (Lounge Records) Various Artists - 4 1/2 stars","review":"This has got to be one of the better various artists CD compilaions I've ever heard. One track each from ten(10) vitually unknown/little known psychedelic bands. Tunes from Three Four Ten,Transient Waves,Photon Band,Intro To India and the unbeatable Asteroid #4 make this title a true keeper. Bent Lag Fatima's \\"Ad\\" sort of maybe reminded me of Fifty Foot Hose and the only cut here I didn't like was Azusa Plane's \\"Drinking Scotch\\" which to me,sounded like a jogger running through a parking lot while playing an out-of-tune sitar. A bit too strange for me. Otherwise,'Sounds...' is a great pick. Essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next time someone sneezes...","review":"Shortly after reading The Hot Zone by Richard Preston, I found this book and had to read it. Carriers really brings the possibility of a deadly worldwide epidemic into focus. Mr. Lynch takes the plausible and spins a tale that is frighteningly possible. His description of the disease's progression was unsettling but the storyline was so captivating that I simply couldn't put this book down. Whether you give credence to the story or not, this book may cause you to look at every sneeze and cough (yours or someone else's) in a different light. Excellent job. I would love to see a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspensefull mysery at its best","review":"Carriers offers a wide array of characters all intertwined in one way. There are clues and subtle hints as to the outcome and you may think you have the problem solved or know where the book is going, but at the end the plot twists and you find yourself going back to see how you missed what was so obvious now. Lynch does a suberb job at giving his characters believable lines and feelings. It is not just about the virus, or the medical part or the mystery. It is about the lives of all and all the medical mystery. Take your time and read it slowly, it's well worth i"},{"rating":"1","title":"Workable for a medical thriller","review":"If the author hadn't made Holly into such a mushy hysterical woman who does nothing but get in the way and act out of her own selfishness, I may have given this another star. Everything else about this book had the potential to be thriller-tastic, from government engineered viruses to playing god to conspiracy. Ratchet those aspects up a few notches and keep Holly tucked safely away in New York, this could have been a goodie.I did find it fun to read about all of these American characters and settings through the eyes of a British writer, or I assume Lynch is British because so many of the terms he uses are from across the pond."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best BioSci Mystery read to date. A top-notch thriller!","review":"Patrick Lynch's \\"Carriers\\" seduces unrelentingly with itsincredible chapter by chapter cliffhanging style.It kept me up all night, literally unable to sleep untilI finished it. I highly recommend this book to anyoneinterested in the precarious relationship we have with ourprimitive ecosystems or who is fascinated with thatvoracious, unseen, world conquering monster that is thevirus. This is a truly frightening book, that brings homethe personal nature of a pandemic event with just a hint asto its secret carefully dangled in the context of a briefencounter. Everyone I've shown this book to, after readingonly a few pages has gone out and bought the paperback forthemselves. I eagerly await Lynch's next foray into thecardiac wild.Doug Kennedy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Genre","review":"Maybe a bit flawed in some places but overall a great read. Much more solid then Crighton's stuff which starts off glorious and ends up as a cat and mouse chase with one word dialogs. Lynch takes a subject, an ebola-like outbreak, which in itself seems so boring and trite, but instead of pumping out the same old gel, he gives us a solid detective story, working with the bioligists in hopes of finding its source. Not classic literature. Not a classic novel. But in its genre, a very fine piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally boring book","review":"The general idea isnt bad but the pace becomes too slow. Most of the book is about the wandering of people in the Indonesian forest. Nothing interesting really happens until the last 50 pages.

I bought it based on the ratings of amazon.com readers but i feel the need to voice my opinion before anyone else wastes $7 on this book. The writing was ridiculous and full of lame cliches like \\"joey liked monkeys\\" (that's an actual sentence!). I normally don't notice bad writing which means that this was even worse than bad. the plot itself suffers from way too many characters to the point that you cannot keep track of who's who. the science behind the virus is flawed and the sequence of events seems to have been written by someone with zero experience with viruses or medicine. i cannot stress enough how bad this book is.

The experience of fire, its danger, its allure, its power is implicit in each poem, with a variety of forms used. Kids could make their own book of poems, illustrate it, after being inspired by this slim but hot little volume.

I had not complaints with the company.Assembly was easy, just add batteries and attach the ball to the stand. It connects using a cotter pin that just slides on. The stand can be placed on a table or hung from the ceiling (it has a wire half-moon that would connect over a hook attached to the ceiling). The light comes with 4 color covers.Everything worked out of the box without issues. About the only complaint I have is when changing the color discs, you unscreww the outer plate of the light. I found it takes a few tries to get it screwed back on. You have to line it up just right. Otherwise, excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter loved it!","review":"This mirror ball is awesome and was my 6-yr. old daughter's favorite b-day gift! The price is great for what you get. We liked that you could mount it on a stand, as we can set it up in different rooms that way. You can also mount it from the ceiling though. It slowly rotates for a really pretty effect in her bedroom at night. The separate lamp comes with color covers, but we haven't used that much because the metal lamp gets REALLY hot, so we worry that it could be a fire hazard if left on too long (the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars). Overall, a terrific buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, So good!","review":"Seems to be working well so far. Solid construction.

The lighting effect looks great, when the product is working. The gears inside would bind up in several spots. This caused the ball to constantly lock up. This is a big disappointment. We were all excited to have a mirror ball for the party. It is too late to get it replaced before the event... The locking ring for the light was also screwed on crooked from the factory. This bent the ring slightly. I was able to fix that, but its another indication that there is absolutely no concern about quality.

The picture that is used is not at all like to item I received. The base is not a plug it is battery operated and it is a tabletop stand with the option of a hanging ball. The ball is not secure on the base, it is very wobbly, even my 6 year old was afraid it was going to break. We bought this for our playroom to secure to the ceiling but there was no easy way to turn it on without a ladder each time, not to mention I was afraid it would fall on our heads. I was not at all happy and did return the item. I am a frequent Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have ever had to return something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work if you use Battery Power","review":"I got 4 of these for a Holiday Party.

We received one of the BAD ones. The motor in the mirror ball stopped working after about 5 minutes of use. We will be returning it promptly! The spotlight was fine, but you had to commit to using just one color as the filters were not fast to switch in and out.

Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed. ( Quote Sara Brady to Senator Metzenbaun in January 1994.) Now thats some scary stuff. Look at the arrogance in that quote. It is proof of what I have always known about Sara Brady and Politcians like her. They do not really care about public safty .

Also, the mythology of Persia was just one page long, which I felt was too little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am using this book for a virtual mythology class, and it is a very helpful tool.

Upon reading it I quickly realized that this version modifies the original and dilutes much of its meaning. It eliminates some of the sad and difficult portions of the original story, perhaps to make it more comfortable for parents and children alike. But the result is to soften the book's overall impact.

So I searched all over the internet including Kettler's own website, to find this pushbar and read reviews saying it worked for the fold n/go's. Guess what - works for the fold n'go's, but according to Kettler customer service, not the Go Green fold n'go's. Apparently customers complained the bar that came with was not \\"green\\" like the bike, so the mfg stopped supplying it with the trike!

Sure, it's about the bear sub-culture and the author provides humorous insights there. I found a chuckle on every page. But I also enjoyed Mr Cohen's views on identity crises. In these days of economic turmoil and unemployment, many of us can relate to Peter Mallory and the shock that his sudden dismissal from a cushy job brought to his self-image.

I cherish his autographed inscription \\"to Richard from Richard\\" on my dog-eared copy of \\"The Tokyo-Montana Express\\".I look forward to meeting Steve Shepherd.He, too, is a keen observer of life. However, Shepherd sees the joys of life. He writes with a wry humor and a twinkle in his eye. You'll want to have his Italian-American neighbors over for dinner. You'll want to move to San Diego. You'll want to raise tomatoes. As an ex New Yorker and big fan of the New Jersey tomato, I found this book a joy to read. The title is great, too. \\"In praise of tomatoes.\\" This book would make a great gift for anyone who has ever tried to grow anything, any place, at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for the novice tomato gardener","review":"I picked up this book because I've decided to grow tomatoes on my patio in Southern California. I figured that any advice I could glean from the Shepherd's years of growing tomatoes in San Diego would be helpful to me in Laguna Beach...what I didn't expect was the charming \\"day-in-the-life\\" subplot to the main tomato growing narrative of life in a working class, multi-cultural San Diego neighborhood. The simply told year-long narrative about of how growing tomatoes has brought Shepherd's neighbors together makes this a heart-warming and interesting book--not to mention all of the wonderful tomato lore that makes the book a gardener's delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gardening tips from the PC thought police.","review":"I was fully prepared to enjoy this book. I love travel and gardening memoirs and am an avid tomato (and rose) grower. But after reading three chapters, I tossed it.

It's comfortable enough for background, and there are enough layers that one may \\"tune in\\" periodically and enjoy it's complexity. The high production values hold up to critical listening and fills my studio with music. Most music in this category tend to be so soft and Yanni/KennyG-like as to be over-processed, synthetic, and very wimpy. Heartbeat has an organic quality to it that keeps it fresh and interesting through many plays.This isn't the usual New Age stuff- it's more evolved, and much, much better.More, please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soothing and nurturing music","review":"I absolutely love the CD \\"Heartbeat\\" and listen to it all the time, at home, at work, in the car, before going to sleep, and I never tire of it.

A book that reviewed that time, with a look at the processes and in-depth coverage of one or two cases that happened during his time could have been quite entertaining and quaintly British. Unfortunately Pope believes he was not only the best person EVER in his job, but that it also gave him the authority to pronounce sagely on UFO cases through the ages, from Ezekiel to the Roswell film footage. Littered with inaccuracies of all kinds this book is badly written and a huge missed opportunity. In his desire to be sensational he ignores the lure of the mundane, a subject that, as a low ranking civil servant, he is surely most knowledgeable about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Finishing it","review":"This is by far the worst book on the UFO craze I have ever read. I'm up to page 100 and have yet to learn anything about this phenomina that I don't already know. It is poorly written and I have fallen asleep twice while reading it. I'm not going to go any further with this one.

I have read the top 100 books in this UFO/Alien genre and this is not one of them. Suggest you try 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Project Blue Book), 'Alien Agenda' by Jim Marrs (Crossfire), and 'Unconventional Flying Objects' by Dr. Paul Hill (NASA UFO Scientist) which are the TOP 3 books in this genre with more information in any chapter than Nick Pope's book. The conspiracy thriller, 'Alien Rapture' with an 'insider' black projects co-author is my favorite of the Top 100.

The map lacked coverage of areas of the western city beach communities both central and north.

This had an odd flavor, almost bitter. I maybe tasted a slight hint of butter with it, but nothing like my other seasoning. After one batch I began using my \\"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Extra Virgin Olive Oil\\" spray first and sprinkling this powder very lightly on top of that and was more satisfied doing it that way. I will probably finish up this seasoning, but won't be buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can Believe It's Not Butter (flavored)","review":"I believe it is generally safe to assume that \\"butter-flavored\\" refers to the flavor of butter churned from cow's milk. In Kernel Seasons' case, however, I'm not so sure. Kangaroo milk maybe? Or perhaps howler monkey? How about prairie dog? Whatever animal's butter this product's flavor is based on, you can bet it's not a member of the bovine family. I should know. I still have the unidentifiable taste of it in my mouth, having bought a jar and \\"flavored\\" some popcorn with it out of desperation because Safeway was out of my usual \\"Jolly Time buttery Seasoning,\\" a 12-pack of which I am now about to order to ensure that this never happens again. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"'No it's not....'","review":"Product features say there is no sodium...well, unless salt is now NOT considered sodium that could be true. BUT, salt is in the sodium family, so if you're looking for this seasoning to be completely sodium free, forget about it!! And it says too a serving size is 1/4 teaspoon, wow, that's like nothing!

Instructions as long as sixteen lines long contains several steps, yet they're not numbered. What were the authors thinking? Have they not used instructional materials before? Obviously, they're new to writing them.I have also also had the worst time trying to find the examples. I open up the Chapter 14 tutorial and get an After Effects warning: \\"23 files are missing since you last saved this project\\". Interesting, since I'd never opened the project. And then the tutorial doesn't work because the graphics are missing.This book gets two stars for reference, but no stars for execution. The lack of numbered steps is totally unforgiveable (I thought this would be a training manual) and the disk with the missing files is unforgivable.

Now, if they do some effects to a movie, change its color, or just change anything.. they tell you why they wanted to change it. They give you a CD and the book is like an instruction booklet on how to use the CD, they give you instructions step by step on how to make the animation that they did.I recomend this book!I have been using AE for about a year and some months with this book I still have learned some new tricks.

You don't really care about either one of them, Especially Renee, who was getting on my last nerves.My hope is that her newest release is better than this one.I do however have to give her props for attempting to broach a subject matter, that seems to still be taboo at the Harlequin Company, but makes up a considerable part of our population.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelivable","review":"Unbelivable pretty much says it all. I didn't believe any of it for a moment. I've read books where the attraction between the man and woman was fierce and immediate and bought it totally. This wasn't one of them. The dialogue was stilted and corny. The multitude of vicious comments and stares from other people was over the top and I never once got the sense that this was actually an African-American women. From her long straight silky hair to her impeccable speech, other than when she made the comment \\"I'm black and you're white' (over and over again), there was nothing about her to distinguish her from any other white heroine out there.

Valid point, but I personally don't mind parting with $20 each month to support my favorite show. I'm going to spend money on this show anyway.The only reason I give this particular DVD only 4 stars is the lack of commentary by actors or directors. Other than that, it's great!

The days of buying two episodes of a tv show you can record off TV for the price of a new movie are over. This is a slap in the face to the fans you expect to pay this.

ADV and Jim Henson should be ashamed. I think I will stick with my dub tapes rather than get this DVD. I returned mine. Sad to say though that people are still going to buy these no mater how overpriced they are. The episodes on here are great though. PK Tech Girl develops some of the emotions between Aeryn and John.

I was rather ticked about the whole deal. If it wasn't such a great series, I would never contemplate buying another DVD.

The information listed in the following is taken directly from the ADV Films website and should be fairly accurate, hopefully this will help you to determine whether to pre-order a copy for yourself or not. Unfortunately starting DVD#4 there will no longer be any commentaries, the first 6 were done at a Farscape Convention last year, and as of now there are no words of any future ones, that is the biggest change (I'm crossing my finger for the commentaries, but it isn't likely.)

Why is that all other shows are going the route of a one price/ whole season dvd system? It's fair to the consumer and a cash cow for the producers and retailers. However why does farscape decide to grab their loyal viewers by the ankles and shake them until all their money falls out of their pockets? It just doesn't make sense.

Until I realized they were charging [price] for two episodes, with no extras. Having bought the magnificent X-Files boxed sets for less than [price] each, I can't bring myself to justify the expense. I have the same problem with the old Star Trek episodes. Why would I spend that much when I can tape any of these episodes off the television?

But the book is somewhat more than that because it compares the treatment of women at private clubs with those playing golf at public and resort courses. The evidence is anecdotal because by their private nature a lot of what goes on at clubs isn't exposed to public scrutiny. Nevertheless, the author manages to create a reasonable picture of what goes on behind the closed gate with respect to women and how their situation has been improved at many clubs in the past 20 years or so. Although clearly on the women's side, the attorney author presents her case in a reasonable, thoughtful manner. Somewhat surprisingly, there is very little other literature on the subject. For anyone dealing with these issues today, this book is probably the best starting point, notwithstanding its age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Notes CD","review":"This CD is an incredible listening experience for anyone who likes bagpipe music.

Natalie's voice alone is worth the price of this CD as her uniquely beautiful voice and elegant style serve to give the songs a richer texture.

It is their best work since In My Tribe. It actually rivals (though doesn't surpass) IMT. Noah's Dove is absolutely beautiful and haunting at the same time - best song on the cd. Circle Dream is very beautiful and melodic - close your eyes and listen to it, you'll love it. These Are Days is their best definitive hit. Stockton Gala Days is lovely in it's own right. I'm Not The Man has a very nice ring to it also. This cd never gets old and can be listened to years after its release. EVERY Natalie Merchant fan should get this and listen to her at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merchant's Maniacal Swan Song","review":"\\"Our Time in Eden\\" was Natale Merchant's last album with 10,000 Maniacs. As such, it ranks with \\"In My Tribe\\" as her best collaboration with the band. \\"These are Days\\" and \\"Candy Everybody Wants\\" were two excellent hit singles that gained a lot of airplay. But the rest of the material is nearly as strong with a consistently pleasent folk-rock sound and socially conscious lyrics that never get too overbearing. The whole thing is so effortlessly good that it makes you wish that Merchant had hung in there as the lead Maniac.Overall, an excellent finale for one of the college rock era's best collaborations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Sounds Good!","review":"I've had \\"Our Time In Eden\\" in my collection since it was released and it still holds up.

But one song in particular made me want to curl up and put it on repeat: Mad About You. This song has so many levels, it's difficult to describe, as is so much music. It begins with a beautiful haunting string progression that reminds me a little of old Bogart movies. It quickly becomes more modern, but it still has this beautiful Roaring '20s feel about it. Even the line \\"Mad About You\\" reminds me of the Sunset Blvd. \\"Mad About The Boy\\"... If you have heard Hooverphonic, you will love this. If you like the new trend of bringing back beautiful old styles, like Big Band and Swing, and giving it a new flavor, you will also maybe enjoy this.

It works really well, my knives are cutting through tomatoes again easily (yes this is how I rank sharpness). The product was easy to use and not much effort or force is needed; all you need to do is follow the instructions. There is only one bad side to this sharpener (that is why I did not rate it a 5 stars); the product reshapes the angle of the edge of the product before sharpening, so slender narrow edges become slightly less slender (i.e the angle increases). I would like to see in newer versions, a way to adjust the angle of sharpening, to better conform to the original sharp edge angle. The product also dose not cater for blades in which the blade is only sharpened on one side.All in all a really decent product. I still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised. Great value!","review":"This sharpener works as advertised and as reviewed on this site. It brings an incredibly sharp edge back to knives and is really very easy to use.However, the reality is (as some have pointed out) that the sharp edge does not last very long. The truth is though, it is so easy to use, who cares? Just a few swipes and you're ready to go again. I find sharpening with stones very time consuming and it does require practice and skill to do right, which is why I don't do it very often. This sharpener allows my knives to have more consistent sharp edges for longer periods of time because I'm willing to take 20 seconds every other day and give whatever knife I'm using a few swipes.Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Tool!","review":"I had no idea my knives were so dull until I used this bad-boy on them; they are SCARY sharp now after spending all of 6 minutes going through my small collection!

I read some reviews about how this sharpener stopped working after ten sharpening so if you read this review a month or so after 10/01/12, comment on it requesting an update and I will let you know how it's edge and ability to sharpen is holding up.

Like they always say, a dull knife is a dangerous knife, and while I've never cut myself, it's been damn close. Used pretty much everything to sharpen blades, metal honer, ceramic stick, a bench grinder(!), and the AccuSharp takes the cake. There isn't a satisfying sound or anything when you're done, but damn if that knife isn't sharp. After doing my chefs knife, did every other blade in my house.The directions and website says it does serrated blades, but if your knife is mostly serrations (such as my pocket carry Kimber), it might be hard to get those deep serrations. So don't throw out your sticks just yet.Other than that, made my main knives sharp as hell, so I am a big fan of these tiny gadgets.Also, there is an \\"outdoorsman\\" version...it's just a different color, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!!

This wonderful device not only removed the dents but left my knife sharper then it was stock.Simply amazing!!!! Its real easy to use to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The rave reviews are misleading","review":"Trust me, if you have blades you truly care about (which is probably why you're considering buying a sharpener) you do NOT want to use this cheap sharpener on them. The carbide teeth really 'rip' the blade more than they do sharpen it, so yes the blade gets sharper but it's a dirty jagged edge. You'd be much better off with the Lansky 5-stone system or the Smith's TRI-HONE. Yes they cost a little more but think about how much you spent on your knives and it's probably a small investment in comparison. All I can gather is that all the people giving this thing 5 star ratings don't really know how to sharpen a knife. It doesn't take much skill, especially with a setup like the Lanksy. Please, if you care about your blades, don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Tool Poor Warranty","review":"I've had this tool for several years and it works well in my shop, no complaints.The blades have been reversed and finally seen their last days. I called the company to ask for new blades. They insist on $4 and a return of the original tool. I reminded them that I can buy a new tool for this price or less at my local building supply dealer. All I need is the two blades taped to a piece of cardboard and sent in an envelope. No! to get replacement blades, you have to buy a new tool.While this is stated on the original card, although the price was $3, this is very poor customer service.If the tool itself were damaged, e.g., broken, it would make sense but not replaceable blades.A warranty is defined as:A written guarantee, issued to the purchaser of an article by its manufacturer, promising to repair or replace it if necessary within a specified period of time.The customer needs blades, not a handle.

It will ruin your knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I cant believe all the good reviews on this. I bought it based on the reviews and dont get it. This thing is junk.

I'm sure that whetstones, sharpening rods, and belt sharpeners are better because you can choose your edge and achieve better angles, but regardless, this is extremely easy to use and it has worked really well for pocket knives and kitchen knives. I have not used it on serrated edges as of yet, so I have no input on its uses for that, but as far as straight edges go, it does a good job at restoring edges to dull knives. I will say that it will probably not restore factory sharpness, but for the ease of use and how quickly this works, it is an efficient compromise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"For under 10 dollars I was easily able to sharpen my very nice knives.

The product puts a mildly decent edge on my blades, though it doesn't seem to last. I have read other places where it might have to do with the angle, though I can't say for sure. Additionally, it does not feel like a quality item, but I expected that for the most part considering the cost.What I can't figure out is how this thing is so well reviewed. My only guess is that the makers got people to spam this item with their own positive reviews to get more sales. Also, when checking other reviews left by some of the reviewers (there is a link by the persons name that says 'See all my reviews'), I found that several had not left reviews on any other items.

This sharpener is so small I can fit it in my utensils organizer, and it works extremely well. If you're in doubt because of the price, seriously just buy it.

It has also become part of my standard wedding shower gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My experience was not good with this product. I think I temporarily ruined about 3 different knife edges with this. I would attempt multiple times on each blade, but the knife would just not end up sharp enough to cut paper.

Go with diamond and Arkansas stones and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use manual knife sharpener","review":"I was reading a cooking magazine that reviews products. In the issue I was reading, they were comparing different knife sharpeners. This was their favorite hands down.

I used it on a knife that has been dull for several years and it brought it back to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a miracle product, just a good sharpener","review":"Works better on serrated knives than any other sharpener that I've tried though. To be honest, most anything works fine for my chef knives, but the serrated bread knives sharpen up very well with this little gadget. So ignore the hype, this is a good sharpener, but you'll need to use it, spend a minute or so with each knife, carefully sharpening them. Does a good job and works as well as any sharpener I've ever used (regardless of price) on regular blades, and is easier to use on serrated knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good edge, but takes a lot of metal off","review":"I am sharpener impaired , and have bought lots of stones and sharpeners spending a bunch ($200 plus in all)This thing puts a great edge on , simply. makes knives a happy, sharp experience.However, It TAKES A LOT of metal off, so requires cautious use and acknowlegement of the fact that knives you use it on, ain't gonna last forever.That, I can afford"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like buying new knives","review":"After we used this sharpener (at the insistence of America's Test Kitchen Cookbook) it was like having a brand new set of knives.

It finally wore out; replaced with the AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener.Now my kitchen and pocket knives are back with VERY sharp edges. Expect the new unit to last quite a while too. Worth the price.Edit Mar 2012:After using this for a while, I notice it does odd things to the edges of my cooking knives. The edges are uneven and have some debris left behind after using the sharpener. It does a good-enough job for a quick refresh on a working knife, but isn't producing any kind of high-quality edge.

They had been recommended by a cooking program on PBS. When they arrived I decided to use one myself as my old sharpener had seen better days. It seems to sharpen very well although harshly. Perhaps I just need to be a bit more gentle with it. It is now a habit each time I use a knife to take a swipe or two on the shapener. Works fine. The only drawback to the unit is to be very sure to pay attention and use it according to the directions.

I have used it to revive countless knives at home, and even more impressively, knives at condos on vacation. Yes, it's a bit strange, but I simply cannot stand the dull knives at condos and vacation homes which cannot cut an onion and slip off thanks to being impressively dull. I simply pack the AccuSharp thanks to the fact it is small and light, and after a few drags across those staggeringly dull blades, I am working with a set of finely sharp knives, even on vacation.

The last thing I need is another electrical appliance to store, but I really needed a knife sharpener and bad! Looked around a bit for options at the local stores and was a bit disappointed with what I found. Then I decided to try online and came across this little beauty on Amazon. I was blown back by not only the price (under $10) but also by all the glowing reviews and dang near perfect reviews and had to give it a shot.

I was getting ready to toss it but I sharpened it and it's back in business now. it does seem to take off more metal than I'd expect but maybe that's normal for a knife sharpener.

A dull 420 stainless will shave a little after 10 pulls. If i have a little time I like to use this and then smooth out the edge with my compact leather strop. This leaves me with a good working edge for cutting rope to field dressing a deer. The angle isn't so steep that the blade wants to bend or chip easily but it is still plenty sharp for any job other than barbering. You can buy a better sharpener but they are all complicated or expensive and most of the time both. I own 5 other brands of sharpeners that are designed like this but they all truly can't come close to this one. They will all become extra gift this Christmas. I have some expensive sharpeners and will continue to use them on my most treasured blades (because they remove a little less metal when sharpening) but on any stainless or cheaper carbon blade I will now stick with the AccuSharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this knife sharpener","review":"Bought many in the past and gave to family members, they all love it. I can't go without this in my household. I use it about once a month to sharpen all knives and once in a while on a need-to-be-sharpen basis. Once the sharpener seems no longer doing a good job and I just reverse the blades in the sharpener. Once that becomes dull, then I buy a new sharpener. In my case, a shapener last about 2 years.

I have a $35 Henckels ceramic sharpener and a more expensive honing tool -- neither comes close to this simple device.

And the first time I used it, I was impressed: a few swipes with the sharpener and my Cutco knives seemed to work great. After a few days, however, it became obvious that the sharpness does not last long. After sharpening a knife with this gadget, it seems good for the next cutting job, but the next day, it feels like a hacksaw and I find myself needing to use the sharpener again and again.I'm back to using my flat stone.

This is all we use. I used to have a knife sharpening service, and I've tried some of the other \\"trendy\\" sharpeners sold here on Amazon, but this little device beats them all and saves us a ton of money. Anyone can use it. We get approximately two weeks of use before we have to open it up and turn the blades over - and then it's like a brand new sharpener again. If you buy the one with the replacement blades included it's like getting two sharpeners for a little more than the price of one. After we bought our first one of these, we put a professional machine ($300.00+) out in storage, and never looked back. Considering the price, there is no way you can go wrong!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Plain and Simple","review":"Junk! It will dull or totally ruin any large blade that you run it across. For thinner blades, such as most kitchen knives, it works reasonably well. Terrible for thicker blades, such as hatchets, axes, machetes, as it will dull them to the point that the only way you will be able to reacquire an edge is to use a fine file or grinder with a relatively smoothe/fine wheel.Save your money!

This will breathe new life into your dull knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"yep, it sharpens","review":"For so long I've used a wet stone to sharpen my knives, and then I found this. It works extremely well. For that extra little honing, I suggest stropping your blade on the back of a leather belt after you use the accusharp on it. If you're sharpening a cheaper knife that needs a lot of metal removed, but a dab of oil on the blade edge to assist that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"What can I say? For under ten bucks your knives will be sharp! I have an old set of cheap knives that it made like new only with a few swipes. I also used it for all of my hunting knives.

I have a lot of knives, and this thing is pretty safe as long as you don't go wild with your strokes while you're sharpening. The blue hand guard does get cut and eventually it will get sliced through, but that can be reinforced by tape or something sturdier. Be careful with expensive knives though, depending on the thickness of the blade and the grind on it the sharpener may scratch the sides of the blade. Obviously this isn't for $300 japanese sushi knives or for making anything shaving-sharp, but it's more than enough for the common kitchen knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sharpener","review":"Before I bought this sharpener, I was considering getting new knives.

After using it for around four months, honing the knife blades about once a month, I needed to open it up and reverse the carbide inserts because it had stopped sharpening the knives.Within another four months the sharpener was completely useless. It wouldn't work any longer. So the carbide inserts do need replacement after 30 to 40 times of use, and the carbide inserts that need be replaced are at a cost almost equal to what I had paid for the entire unit the year before.The \\"5 to 10 years of use between blade changes\\" on the product page is a complete exaggeration. I, just two weeks ago, paid over $7.00 to Amazon (best price on the web) for a new set of replaceable blades, after 8 months of light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed After Reading the Cook's Illustrated Review","review":"I bought this product after reading the Nov 2006 Cook's illustrated Review of manual sharpeners.

Perhaps it is because my knives were very dull, but the sharpener did not return my knives to the desirable sharpened state, even after about 5 minutes of passing the sharpener over the knife. In fact, the sharpener left grooves in my blade! Now I will have to buy an electric sharpener or find someone who can professionally grind my knives into the proper sharpness. That being said, the knives are a little sharper than when they started, but I have returned the device and asked for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed with this sharpener","review":"I too bought this knife sharpener because of the great reviews here on Amazon.

It is incredible that 203 reviewers average 4.5 stars on this item. It works but the end result is not a blade that is super sharp. I have worked in the restaurant business for the last twenty years of my life. I have not tested the results of this on a serrated knife. However, the angle at which it sharpens at is not the sharpest that it will leave a blade and I find myself sharpening as I have always done with a sharpening rod or a sharpening stone. That said, I believe that if you are skilled at either of the above then I would not recommend purchasing this item - however, if you are not, then this item should work. I don't find that it works that well on my molybedenum/vanadium knives, and a little better on the pure steel knives (most people don't have them because they rust a little easier). That is my thoguht."},{"rating":"1","title":"All my knives are dull now","review":"Either I got a bum product or this product is the worst thing ever.

I even sharpen my hunting and fishing knives with it. I haven't used a stone on a knife since I got the Accusharp all those years ago.The hardware store where I bought my sharpener has an Accusharp at the cash register for customers to use and it has had a hard life but still sharpens just fine.

This does a good job and is much easier so I am more likely to keep the knives touched up and sharp.Two things you should know. The first time you sharpen a knife you will have to sharpen more to make its edge match the angle on the tool. After you have this shape future touch ups are quick and easy.

I had recently purchased a Chinese Dao, and the current off brand knife sharpener I had in the kitchen wouldn't give the sword and edge and it was giving my kitchen knives a ragged edge. Sword Buyers Guide Forum list this as a good, easy method to sharpen swords provided you don't mind a secondary bevel (I don't), so for less than $10 I thought this was worth a try. After about 5 minutes of work, my sword was nice and sharp, and my kitchen knives are also cutting better than they have in years. This is definitely a great sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good hand sharpener","review":"I got it and well, dis not seem too impressed at first. I tried it on my KBAR combat knife, a folding knife and a throwing knife. I could not believe this plastic device could sharpen so well! Word of advice, read the back of the package which gives instructions; Make sure to sharpen with light force not hard! You give your blade about 5 to 10 strokes at first and you get a nice edge. When the sharpening blades become dull you can take apart the device very easily with a phiilips head driver and flip the sharpening blades around. In all, this is a very good sharpening device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this ...","review":"I recommend passing on this sharpner.

But the story and voice acting in the cut scenes are so bad that I can't stand it.It's like the script was written by an adolescent monkey on a braille typewriter. The dialog is horrible from the first word that's spoken and is delivered by characters who have nothing to do with the actual game.It would be nice if the story actually followed the character that I'm supposed to be playing, but instead it follows some lady looking for her kid, some Russian guy with a limp and basically anyone else who doesn't fly a fighter plane and isn't the main character.Ahhh!

The story lines have gotten insane and the characters -- especially their dialogue -- seem like they've been created for Three-year-olds. But we don't play games like this for the story, we're looking for realistic action, and this game misses that target big time. Instead of stressing actual battle characteristics, the developers have created impossible situations (really, flying aircraft carriers?) that simply does not engage the player.

I play GTA for story, I play Ace Combat because I want to hope into the cockpit of a F16/F14/FA 18 Super Hornet and shoot at some bogey's like TOP GUN, lol. For that, this game satisfies me. The missile warnings do get annoying and the physics of your plane moving on the \\"replay\\" make it look like it's standing still and just rotating but when you're playing, it's pretty fun.

Approching this novel with an open mind, the book started with a lot of promise. I was expecting a good mystery but instead the story got bogged down with a lot of melodramatic twaddle that sadly misses the mark. The storylines are too spread apart to form a cohesive novel.

The narrative is constantly interrupted so that he can show off every single bit of research he's done for the novel. A good historical novelist uses research to flesh out and propel his narrative--Saylor uses it to slow the book down and make it bloated.Second, the solution to the mystery--the trumpeted titular \\"twist\\"--is pedestrian in the extreme.Third, the character of O.

Unfortunately, the books suffers from too many subplots, and far too much of the \\"look how much research I did'' school of atmosphere.\`\`Fearfully dull\\" says it all.

Saylor shows he knows as much of this time period in Texas as he did about Ancient Rome...but somehow, the book left me cold. Perhaps it is the length, soem 550 pages, but about half way through, my one thought was \\"get on with it, already!\\". Not much of a twist at the end...it's obvious.

The plot, concerning O. Henry and a true series of murders in 1884 and 1885 Austin, Texas, seemed intriguing. The beginning was great. Unfortunately, the story itself seemed to wander and, without giving too much away of the plot, the murders seemed curiously remote form the main character.

How she is supposed to save the world-going back into ancient China and finding the 7 constellations-is original, though, and gives Fushigi Yugi the star. Except this is different from the average in that the main character, Miaka, is a twit. She often does silly things, and can be shallow as well, like how she goes back into ancient China. She goes back to Japan and assumes it was a dream. When she writes in her diary, she doesn't even MENTION China, she only mentions how she met a cute boy. (And there might be a romance between them! Can you believe it?)As for the artwork? It's good, but not as good as Alice 19th.

Miaka, a lackluster junior high school student, escapes the pressure of cram sessions and trying to get into a prestigious high school when she is magically transported into a book she finds at the library. During the course of this series (and there will be eighteen volumes in all), she must unite seven warriors and summon Suzaku, a phoenix-god that acts as guardian of the country she was transported to. My favorite part of this series is watching Miaka develop from a ditzy girl into a mature adult as she deals with betrayal, misunderstanding, building confidence, and (ultimately) love. Although written for young women, this story will appeal to guys as well. Fushigi Yugi has a great balance between adventure, romance, comedy and action.

After 4 months of use, the left cd player blew up and now won't even work. If you're using it for a few house parties, I might take the gamble on it but if you're using it for high volume and multiple uses everyday, spend a little more and get something more durable/quality (i.e. Numark).

The Italian dialog on the tape consists of their script as well as their conversations off camera. After every section of dialog (about 1 minute) you are given a translation of the key words and phrases you have just heard, then the story continues in Italian.

Generic remixes of very quality songs bysub-standard producers. Nothing of distinction here because of the tired 'thumpthumpthump' of mediocre Eighties disco. 'She's Yr Cocaine' and 'Raspberry Swirl' swagger with more sexiness than even the most lengthy mix. Seems Tori could get some more daring mixes (Squarepusher, Roni Size, DJ Shadow come to mind, all who recently made killer interpretations of various artists) but instead we are stuck with these flaccids. Too bad the tunes aren't as hot as the cover. Disappointing. Looking fwd to \\"Venus and Back\\", though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD, but. . .","review":"I got this CD for the remixes and after hearing them, I wondered why they didn't put the original mix on the disc. If a non-Toriphile got this disc after hearing the slow real version, they would be quite confused/displeased with a disc full of dance mixes.

The title Jackie's Strength is beautiful, I mean, the original version. But here, the remixes sound too Kylie Minogue, especially the first and third ones. Such remixes destroy Tori's work, and Jackie's Strength did not deserve any metamorphosis at all ! The Father Lucifer remixes are exceptional, and even if the other remixes are good for the dance floors, it is not Tori at all. Fortunately, her albums are beautiful, Tori is powerful on stage, she'll always be a great performer and singer, and I'll always appreciate her. But come on ! Just listen to the original version of Jackie's Strength, then listen to the remixes and you'll see the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, i THOUGHT it'd be good","review":"The reason I bought this single was because I love the song \\"Jackie's Strength\\" and its one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite performers. So, I was quite displeased when I made the discovery that the remixes are just like every other remix around, with no bit of originality, much less than Tori Amos deserves.The high points, which are few, are the \\"Wedding Cake Remix\\" and the \\"Sylkscreen\\" mix of \\"Father Lucifer\\". Still, there's little bite to even those, and to have such a gorgeous song be reduced to dance club mixes do make me a little perturbed.Tori is not incapable of good remixes, as the \\"Cruel\\", \\"Spark\\", and \\"Raspberry Swirl\\" remixes are really nice, but it doesn't always work like that I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT VINYL","review":"I LOVE Tori Amos and have owned this single on CD for some time.

It includes step-by-step instructions for constructing models with Rose software.However for detail on UML and the development process in many areas you will need to continue on with other books such as \\"The Unified Software Development Process\\".Important information is also missing on using Rose software. For example, the book does not tell you enough to be able to successfully complete Rose/C++ roundtrips. You will need more books and hopefully a good mentor/coach to help you become competent with Rose software but, again, this book is a very good place to start.I highly recommend this book for anyone starting out with Rational Rose, UML and the Rational process for software development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why read this when there are better books on the topic","review":"If you have a good understanding of the UML (and even if you don't) this book will not enhance your knowledge. The same applies for good modeling techniques and/or OO concepts - the book doesn't teach these. Then again it does not profess that it does so why blame it. The only reason I read this book is because it came with the Rose copy we bought. Frankly, even as a guide to Rose, it doesn't add much to what the (many) Rose manuals describe. The only people that should read this book, in my humble opinion, are those with a copy of Rose but without the manuals that come with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the place to start with UML.","review":"Unfortunatly, I tried to learn UML and Rational Rose by using this book. I should have read the preface a little closer, which states that this is not what this book is about.Even after learning about the UML from other sources and going back to this book, I don't know what it trying to teach. The only thing that I could see is that Rational Rose doesn't support the full UML notation and that this book does nothing to point that out. It tries to work around it.Spend your money on other books such as 'The Unified Modeling Language User's Guide' and learn UML first. Rational Rose is then easy to figure out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overview of Rational Rose and UML","review":"If you are getting started with Rational Rose and UML and need a book to get you up to speed fast this is the book. It pulls together a lot of key concepts extremely well. The book discusses the Rational Objectory Process and identifies where the various UML notations can be used in it. This is a great intro to this area. It was the first UML book that I read so far that brought these two together ( the language and the process ). When I want to present material to my colleagues on how to use the Rational Rose I end up going back to this book to get my program together. Even if you do not have the Rational Rose Software available to you this book teaches the material well. I recommend this book highly. There is a lot of material out there that can be extremely confusing to people just starting out. I think Terry Quatrani should get high marks in providing a easy to understand text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entry point for Rational Rose and UML","review":"I never seen Rational Rose before. I didn't know UML. When I installed Rose, I did need a rapid way to use it and an intro to UML.

An excellent result that surprised all my collaborators.If this is what you are looking for... Buy this book!I learnel UML concept too.

It's a simple-minded tutorial of Rose and visual modeling ( heavy on the simple minded ). I was looking for a book with a lot more meat in it.

Another very important point in this book is that the Pontian, Armenian and Assyrian Genocide, which is not written anywhere is revealed for everyone to be aware. The author wrote this book out of love for her mother, therefore there is no hatred involved.

It is a truly heroic saga. The weak writing does detract from the story, but the biggest problem with the book is the author's hatred. There is plenty to hate, but the author's mother, the victim, seems to have a much more complete view of her journey. The book shines when it tells its story, it fails when it tries to tell history. Millions of people died in that land in those tragic years. Not all of them were Greek, not all of them were Christian. There were many victims and many victimizers.

When genocide is 'swept under the carpet', it's just a matter of time before the same tragic history repeats itself.Now Ms. Halo has enabled the reader to truly grasp the scale of this tragedy by interspersing Themia's sad personal story with her very thorough research.I found this book to be haunting, yet inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredable book!","review":"If you like biographies, if you like history and stories that take you on a journey filled with tragedy, fear and unspeakable horrors, if you like mysteries and suspense, and if you enjoy reading about the ultimate triumpth of the human spirti - then this book is for you.

While almost any American artist can sing in a language other than English phonetically, Ronstadt captures the pronunciations, accent, dialect, intonations flawlessly and naturally !

Everyone I know who has it says it's hard to stop playing over and over...and over. Ronstadt is in magnificent voice, the arrangements are exciting and often surprising, the sound quality and production values absolutely first rate. Some of the songs are familiar by their English titles, such as \\"Magic Is the Moonlight.\\" Part of the fun is finding a favorite song you didn't know would be on the album.

Though the theory is very beautifully laid out and elaborated on, it suffers from several faults. If one examines the global conflicts throughout the last twenty years, the theory holds for the most part (US verses Iraq/Afghanistan West vs. Islamic), The conflict in Sri Lanka, etc. But the simple fact is that conflicts still occur within the same civilizations Russia-Georgia both belong to the Orthodox. A further fault is Huntington's own admitted inability to place Africa and Latin America within a civilization. Still despite my criticisms it is a very intriguing theory that should be required reading for anyone interested in global conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Paradigm with a Purpose","review":"Although Huntington presents a sweeping alternative to the recently antiquated bipolar paradigm of international relations and politics, his new unit of analysis does not address many of the issues at hand. He overlooks possible explanations of the current world political situation because of the new lenses of civilization-based analysis. He also minimizes the forces of economic development in the formation of post-Cold War blocs. The conclusions and policies that follow the paradigm presented in The Clash, are domestically xenophobic and internationally isolationist. The portrait of global politics presented by Huntington is neither true for the present nor desirable for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huntington Shows His Anglo-Saxon Bias","review":"Huntington is a historian who tries to understand the dynamics of world politics through simplistic -almost mathematical- concepts.

I can't help but think that this is too convenient. While I don't agree with the End of History crowd or any other such triumphalist movements, I think Huntingdon is, fundamentally, looking for trouble.I worry that the \\"civilizational fault lines\\" idea could become a reality if enough influential people start believing it.

Countries will likely support other countries not on the basis of strategic importance but on the basis of shared history, culture, and religion. He divides the world into nine distinct blocks: Western, Orthodox, South American, African, Islamic, Sinic, Buddhist, Hindu, and Japanese.I don't quite agree with Hungtington as I see a global alignment divided around nation-states (UN), corporations, NGOs, and crime and terror sydicates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent anaylsis of changing international relations","review":"Huntington's thesis is a must read of any serious student of modern international relations.

For example, his reference to the \\"Islamic Civilization\\" assumes a unity and cohesion among Islamic nations that simply does not exist. The various divisions that exist within Islam, and more importantly, the divisions that exist among Arab nations undermines Mr. Huntington's premise of a unified Islamic front ready to confront the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best post-Cold War book I have read so far","review":"The Clash of Civilizations was a revealing look at one possible causes of future problems.

It is the best post-Cold War book I have read to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Given all the focus on Islam in this book...","review":"why did Huntington's only criticism of recent U.S. policy relate to the Balkans? It seems like the specifics of U.S. policy in the post-Cold War Middle East (Iraq, Israel, oil, etc) could provide ample subject matter for analysis based on the rules-of-engagement Huntington applies to the Balkans.

I particularly enjoy it! It helps to better understand each method and its +/-This is a good book for those who use statistics for data mining.

The book serves the dual purpose of an introduction and a reference. An especially nice feature is how the authors explain the relationships and differences between different methods. By doing so, they provide context which I have not seen in any other book on this subject. The book is a very nice combination of basic theory and performance evaluation on data from a wide variety of domains and it is quite up-to-date.

Daddy has been taking to clear the level for the kids before they play it, just to avoide frustration. Also, if you like rolling a ball around, this game is for you - but that's about it.

I completed this game in under 4 hours. The word \\"repetitive\\" barely scratches the surface of just how unoriginal the levels in this game are. The story is non-existent.

Controlling movement is very difficult and has left me sorry I trusted any of the reviews on Amazon. The automatic camera angles are equally bad.3. Most requests (levels) are timed. And the game doesn't give you enough time on the clock to perform the required task without a lot of effort. Young children will be super frustrated.4.

I've even checked with their consumer relations, and they have no plans to release it for PS3. That move strikes me as not only stupid but also kind of mean to Katamari's loyal fans, who have thus far been PS users. I've already got a PSP, PS2 and PS3, and have neither the funds nor the room for another gaming system at this point. (If I do shell out the cash for another gaming system this year, it will certainly be a Wii.)Maybe it's unfair of me to give this game only one star when I haven't had the opportunity to play it, but Namco's outright rejection of loyal fans really chaps my hide.

The original PS2 games, katamari damacy and we love katamari, were amazing and katamari forever for PS3 is by far the best, but the 360 edition was disappointing to say the least. The controls on the 360 feel awkward and don't seem to be as responsive as the ps2 versions. The game was very short, and the mindless promotion of the xbox franchise (by rolling up xboxes and controllers) was annoying. The game felt unfinished. It seems as though the katamari team didnt put the effort into this one since xbox is not that popular in Japan. Overall the game was still fun, but it was a bad follow up to the other titles. If you've never played a katamari game, this game will be a pleasant surprise. The premise and game play will always make you smile.

The music is relaxing and pleasing to have on in the background (especially when you compare it to Dora or Elmo) and the images are fantastic. I also have the Baby Einstein movies and my son has always loved them (& still does) - but he seems to prefer the Classical Baby movies now. This is fine with me because I like them better, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"I have heard about classical music making babies smarter in their later lives or whatever and that is great and all but I am focused on the now.

Fantastic! Engaging! Beautifully animated! Unique! Creative! I can't think of enough great adjectives to describe this series. I'm waiting with breath that is baited for the part two to come out (they're shown on HBO every blue moon and I HOPE they're coming to DVD too). I've bought them for every birthday and shower I've attended in the last 6 months, confident that other mothers will love them as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Dance and Music!","review":"I have the Einstien videos and they are not engaging like the Classical Baby videos. My daughter really likes the Music and Dance videos. The Art one is for older kids.

I'd received a Baby Beethoven CD for my shower and listened to it once before I chucked it. My husband and I are both professional musicians and listening to the dumbed down versions of Beethoven's greats was not something we could tolerate. We received the Classical Baby set for Christmas and my son is extremely entertained as he watches the DVDs sitting in a bouncy chair. Not only that but the musical selections are outstanding, varied, and intelligent. I can't recommend these DVD's enough. I even enjoy them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"Adear friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, and it was the nicest gift ever!!, this CD is amazing, the music and pictures are absolutely stunning!

After lots of research and comparison, I ordered this set and I am not disappointed at all. As a matter of fact, my daughter fell love with it at the first sight! She'd move her little butt, raise arms and \\"dance\\" with her animated friends, and clap hands with big smiles after each chapter. Watching how my daughter enjoys the DVD is a great joy of my family now. I'd definitely recommend this set to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better than Baby Einstein!","review":"I was all about the Baby Einstein series until I saw HBO's Classical Baby series - it's SO much better! Why?1.The music is the real deal, not a \\"baby\\" version. In addition to a ton of classical music, there's also Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Mambo, etc.2. The animation is really cool! My husband is an artisit & he loves Classical Baby - he refuses to put on Baby Einstein when he's home.3. It's WAY cheaper! I spent $20 dollars for THREE videos instead of $45-60 for three Baby Einstein.4. Besides music, it also has famous art & dance5. It's a lot more interesting for parents!Just my little plug. I stopped buying any more Baby Mozart, Baby Bach or Baby Beethoven & now give Classical Baby to my pregnant friends!Although, when it's time to start teaching words & other ideas, I guess I'll have to go back to Baby Einstein - unless HBO comes up with some more in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Develop your child's brain","review":"My 3 kids watch these often and are still mesmerized by it.

If I had to go to a desert isle I wouldn't go with out this CD. I just can't get enough of it and I've had it for years. Most of the music was written by Zimmer but not all and it is the Zimmer compositions that reach in and caress your soul. This is just a masterpiece in vocals and drums. It makes me believe in the oneness of man. How can this music move a white guy from Chicago to tears? I don't know how but after all these years it still gets me.Thanks to everyone who helped make this CD possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best score ever written","review":"This generally unknown score by Hans Zimmer is his best work to date, besides Gladiator (and this score is better than Gladiator's). The songs on this album are some of the most powerful I've ever heard, and you can't help but get goosebumps listening to \\"Woza Mfana\\" or \\"The Rainmaker\\". Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A M A Z I N G","review":"This cd will BLOW YOU AWAY. The music is absolutely AMAZING. Nothing beats blasting this music and just letting the beautiful African music transport you away on a spiritual adventure. The traditional African singing takes you on a journey through all emotions - at times ecstatic and triumphant, and at other times gentle and sad.I've never seen this movie, but they also used the music for a movie about the Kalahari desert that played at Omni theaters back when Lion King had first been released. I enjoyed Hans Zimmer's work immensely on the Lion King, and was looking for a similiar kind of music. When I saw the Kalahari desert movie and heard this soundtrack, I knew THIS was it! Hans Zimmer has done it again, writing another original score that will positively KNOCK your socks off.If this music doesn't move you, I would suggest you might want to check your pulse!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of One","review":"This hauntingly outstanging score by Hans Zimmer is a treat. It truly captures the African voice and suspends the spirit of the people along with their traditions and beliefs. It is one that I listen to and sing along with everyday. Knowing the meanings to the songs is extremely powerful, but this is one track that go's beyond language and holds you in the rythyms and soul of the African beat. You yearn for more. The knowledge of the land and the language and the heart of beautiful Africa is captured in Zimmer's work and I recommend it to anyone with devine taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding but little known soundtrack","review":"I've never seen the movie or read the book, but I've been a big fan of this soundtrack since buying it some seven years ago. I first heard it while browsing through a bookstore in college and was immediately hooked. If you're familiar with Paul Simon's Graceland album, you have some hint of what this is all about. Personally, I like this better than Graceland. A very powerful and moving score that I rank as one of my all-time favorites. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music on here stands test of time...","review":"I bought this CD after I read the book and then saw the movie. What's funny about this soundtrack is it doesn't matter what type of music you \\"normally\\" listen to, as long as you like music, you will probably like (more likely, LOVE) this soundtrack. I've been listening to it for about 15 years. It is absolutly amazing and has made me interested in finding more African music like this.

Hans Zimmer, who is well known for his work on Cool Runnings, manages to enable listeners to be transported to the transvaal, to join in the musical protest of black South Africa, thereby strengthening the storyline. For those who have never experienced the beauty of Africa, this is an incredible opportunity to let the very music of the land magically transport you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"Truly worth buying. The movie is so amazing and incredible and the soundtrack is just as good. Whenever I listen to it, scenes from the movie just come rushing back. The best part though, by far, was the chair.

The Power Of One."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still get chills","review":"This is one of the most amazing choral works I have ever listened to. It is one of my favorite albums and I can't begin to guess how many times I have listened to it. I still get goosebumps listening to the rainmaker. Authentic African music or not it is wonderful stuff. I do agree with others that the one cut that should have been left off is the pop style song 'The power of one\\" but that is what the skip button on a cd player is for. I can't believe that this CD is out of print. Get it used or any way you can.

It operates at random whether or not you can access subdivisions such as Halloween, Get Well, etc. when looking for greeting cards.

I called Nova to verify this and he confirmed a simple search feature was not added. I continued to use the program anyway but found it was constantly shutting down, losing all my work. I finally reverted to saving every click. This was the last straw so I contacted Nova again and asked for a refund.

This was all I could find. It is terrible! It constantly crashes in the middle of designing a project. The graphics are very elementary and there is no way to search for a particular graphic. Browsing through the cards is also a difficult process. It doesn't allow you to see the inside of a card without choosing it for your project. If you decide you don't like it, you have to restart the entire process for creating a greeting card. Lastly, I spent 30 minutes creating a card that imported some of my own pictures. Everything was perfect on the screen, but when I previewed it for printing, it had substituted random parts of the pictures to display. I've used many greeting card programs, including American Greetings Creatacard, Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe, and Print Shop, and this is by far the worst program I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"maddening","review":"new to mac, but not new to making cards, banners etc, this program is just annoying, has a mind of it own, often shuts down right when I'm ready to print, or will close in the middle of a project, losing everything I've put into it.

A subsequent reviewer accused me of sloppily reading the text - and although I hate to admit it - he or she was right. The fact is, I hadn't given the book a fair shake. Since then, I purchased a used copy and read it from cover to cover...It's not easy to admit when you're wrong - but I've gathered more gems from this book than probably any other book I've ever read (and, like most aspiring screenwriters, I've read ALOT). One of these gems is the detailed chapter on act/sequence/scene and beat; the \\"Sea of Love\\" example was of particular interest to me.

This is a great book","review":"As a story analyst, writer and professor of screenwriting, I find this book invaluable. Learning to write screenplays is a daunting experience even for someone with projects under his belt. Robin and Bill's book breaks down the whole process into digestible parts.

Refreshingly inclusive; Peter Nelson knows that wonderful ideas and inspiration can come from the humble backyard, not just the professional drafting table.

I do wish there were more photos of the construction process so one could see each project in various states of completion. Nonetheless, it's a whirlwind tour and will leave you yearning for more.

The second half of the book contains (listed by state) all of the electric interurban railways in the United States and Canada.

The voice-overs try to hard to sound excited and some of the things they say is stupid in the midst of combat; \\"Hey, watch out!\\" \\"Awww, come on.\\" The characters of no names so you can't make an emotional connection to them. They're just refered to as Grunt, Heavy Gunner, Sniper and I can't remeber what they call the other guy. The aliens look stupid. They're too cartoonish. The guns are weak have have a horrible accuracy except for the sniper rifle. They was the only cool weapon. The commanding officer who's voice you hear throughout the game tries too hard to sound \\"gung ho,\\" but he sounds like a poor excuse for a wanna-be soldier. Play Halo instead.

Don Hawk came from extrememly humble beginings and is now in charge of the business career of the most successful race car driver of the last 30 years. Reading this book will show you that he has most definately lost that humility. I was a bit disappointed in the details of the deal that brought Hawk to Earnhardt Inc., but the events that lead him up to that point more than make up for it. It will truly touch your heart to see what Hawk went through just months before joining Earnhardt. This is a must for every Earnhardt and racing fan.

It's the best guide to use those oh-so-cryptic massoretic notes on the margins of BHS. Many detailed definitions of the words and abbreviations-- far more useful information than most other similar introductions to BHS.

I live in South Korea, and the employee at the bookstore in Itaewon asked me why I'm returning it and saw it herself. She said she should have looked at it before selling it. She was amazed that there was no Hangul. How in the world can you not have its script included in the book? I don't care what any linguist says, it's necessary to the language, especially as it is a part of its history. I give this book two big thumbs down as it tricked me into purchasing a \\"complete\\" guide.

These authors place more emphasis on behavior and ecology. These authors also utilize cladistics (explained in an excellent early chapter on systematics) throughout in their classification of fishes. This textbook is probably a bit more detailed in its content and slightly less readable than Moyle and Cech, but both make excellent references.

She is overly repetitive with descriptive materials, tends to ramble on, uses slang terms occassionally, and reveals personal bias. There is no place in nursing for unprofessional terms or bias against groups based on religious differences or lack of religious orientation.

Maybe for a quick 5 sec like someone here said but so far I havent seen him on the dvd itself. Even Saeed and Palash is hardly there. There are interviews included that is not even worth a look. The interviews are boring and with headache inducing visuals. Speaking of visuals, were the guys doing some heroine or smoking a joint when making this dvd?

Reading all the bad and good reviews of this game i went ahead and bought it. It was very fun for the first week. Then the game just grew old.

Give it a ren't and make yourself a favor,don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent But Lacking...","review":"This is an excellent game. There are awesome graphics, and the fighting part is fun. There are a lot of movies though, and when you begin to get really into the game, its over. I would NOT recommend buying this game since it's so short, but only rent it since it can be beat in 2 days. At least rent it. It's worth the 6 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no restart level in the ... game!","review":"While the FMV and the graphics look gorgeous, the game has a giant flaw that really detracts it from being a real top-shelf game: the load function ... If you fail a fight, then you have to restart..from the title screen. Then you need to reload your data, then if your scene is buried after a few cinematic cuts, you need to skip the scenes. This could have been avoided by having some sort of restart you could simply replay the fight scene. Oh no, instead I waste about 30seconds to cue myself back up to where I was before. The animation looks great, but the aggrevation from having to reload, made me glad that I rented, not bought this game. The gameplay got extremely tedious after awhile. Beat up guys, watch a cut scene, beat up more guys, more cut scenes....I suppose that part and parcel of the genre, but this game makes it seem so monotonous after a while. The cut scenes also break up the fluidity of the game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Get To Play?","review":"I bought this game and was soooooooo disappointed. Cinematics and more Cinematics, its like watching a bad movie. You go through fight 3-4 guys and then watch a movie for5 minutes. So repetitive, moves were weak, and gameplay was beyond poor. I honestly don't have anything good to say about this game. All I could say is forget about buying this game and buy Onimusha, now that's a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the PS2","review":"I have been playing the game for over 5 hours of actually game time (according to the save data) There are multiple paths throughout the game and different endings. (I have counted five so far). This game is a must get. It really takes advantage of all the PS2 capabilities; the analog controlers (different moves based on how hard you press a button) dvd drive (it is a dvd-rom disk so even though there is over an hour or so of video on it it is still one disk. Great graphics.. Defeintly worth the buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is SOOOO cool","review":"This game is a really cool game. You get to go through the whole game as any one of the three characters. It gives you the chance to hear all of the character's thoughts and they all have their own unique style and attitude that they express when you choose them to go on a mission. The one and ONLY reason I give this a four star rating is because it can get kind of boring since all you can do is go through the same game over and over again. The multi player mode is great too. You can pick your three favorite characters (or the ones that have been powered up to the highest level through the one player game) to go against three other characters. It's really a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Replay value, and it was a short game","review":"This game took approximately 3 hours for me to beat the first time I played, and I felt no desire to play again to release hidden things or learn more about the characters. The story is relatively boring,the characters uninteresting, and all in all the game is a dud. The play style is also pretty horrible. Essentially the game is a bunch of movies that tell you the plot, and all you do is fight in between the movies. The fighting system is easy and unimaginitive. This is a glorified fighting game that trys to be interesting by adding in the movies. It didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth a rental!","review":"First of all- make sure you have Sony brand controllers or the game won't play! But once you get going, this \\"action\\" game is non-stop interruptions by short insignificant mini-movies that only slow the pace of the game. Plus the movies are filled with awful banter that puts you to sleep- at least there is an option to skip through them! Nice graphics and control, but the moves are pretty weak and your opponents are NO challenge. As for the fighting style: remember Final Fight? Same thing. Also, the camera angles leave you looking at your character in odd ways so you can't tell where you are going. All things being equal, this game is pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bouncer","review":"The visuals are awesome but the gameplay lacks all the key elements that make a great game. Also this game is very short, like only 1hr and 33 minutes to complete short. I am very disappointed in Square. They have the reputation for producing top quality games for the PS1 but they lack a lot in cracking the PS2 code. Once again do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"lets watch the bouncer","review":"My friend and I rented this game over vacation, thinking that it would be great. The graphics looked cool and the story sounded interesting. Yes these were both true, but I think we got 30 minutes of game play througout the whole game. The rest were movies. So now jockingly we say to each other, hey lets go watch the bouncer. It is fun to watch, but I wish that there was more playing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you want to do?","review":"If You want to watch a movie, go to blockbuster, or buy this game. If you want to play a game, then get something else. This is not a game it is a movie. You get to play the parts of the movie that involve fighting. This game..er Movie is short, very short. The graphics are mind blowing, we expect nothing less from Square. This is the reason to get Final Fantasy X instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it, beat it, take it back!","review":"This game has some of the most beautiful graphics out there and I was very impressed. The Dreamcast doesn't have anything like this. This still however, is a horrible game that only lasts for a little over half an hour. When I first heard this I thought my friend meant short like Metal Gear Solid. In actuality he meant short like demo of MGS. The chance to play through as another character reveals nothing that is significant and you'll be glad that Blockbuster bought it instead of you. This game is another example of why I still spend more time playing my Dreamcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not worth it!","review":"I am glad that I rented this game to try it out first. It's pretty much just a 2 hour movie, and you get to play the fight scenes. You get to choose the point of view that you experience the adventure from - thus revealing hidden secrets of the three different characters. Graphics are wonderful, but long and drawn out. If you die during a fight, you have to skipthrough many movie scenes to get back to where you were. The plot is a bit predictable and overdramatic. Don't be fooled: this is not really a \\"Role Playing Game,\\" you have to actually fight in live action, but you gain levels and special abilities as you go along. Overall: a fun game, but it wasn't even worth renting because I rented it for five days and I beat it in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Sqauresoft's best.","review":"This game is a mix between Squaresoft's fighting system used in Ehrgeiz, today's best Cinematic's technoligies, and the great storyline quality from Final Fantasy. This game is definatly worth getting. It has a great replay value. A must for all PS2 owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rules All PS2 Games!!!!!!!","review":"This game is a blast! Everybody who's played it knows the storyline so i'll skip that. The verses mode rocks with four players and there are TONS of characters. The bouncer is more of a playable movie than an RPG. You can twist up the story a ton by play as different characters for every fight. And the real fun fun of the game is getting your best character up to the \\"S\\" level so you can kick your friends butts. There is only one thing i would change about this truly awesome game. I wish there was a two player Co-Op story mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"I hated this game so much. When I bought the game i did notknow i was buying a ... annimated movie for ps2. Gamers i warm you for your sake don't buy this game. If i could i would not give this game one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"its an alrite game but...","review":"This game could have been a lot better. The graphics are tite and stuff but u cant really interact with the backgrounds. ITs just there fo sho, and the story is pretty lame also. Most of the game is the cut scenes. Ive been playin this game for about 3-4 hours and im done beatin the game with all 3 players. The controls and move are basic and simple and the game is pretty simple too. it reminded me of final fight with better graphics and little more of a diverse story mode. The best part of the game was just fighting people like final fight. other then that it pretty much sucks. due to the games short length, i suggest that u rent this game and beat it over the weekend or somethin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is hands down, one of the best games ever!","review":"I just got this game ,and I can't stop playing it. Everywhere I look fo this games rating like Gamepro, here at Amazon, and all over online they all say this game is 5 stars! I'll have to put my review on that list of 5 stars because that might be my favorite game ever! I mean, when I got my first game for PS2(Tekken Tag Tournament which I give 4.5 stars) the guy at Toys R Us told me to buy this game instead of that! If you ever get lucky enough to find a PS2 you gotta get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest waste of Money","review":"For all the hype, you would have hoped it would have come at least close to being fun. Instead I beat the game in under an hour, most of the hour I spent watching stupid cut scenes. I bought a game not a bad movie, I could have beat it using only one button too. I don't like spending $50 on something that doesn't even last an hour. The replay is horrible, you fight the same people, you just get to see a different charater say different lines. It was still the same story. And are you kidding me with the 2 player section. I can't believe I wasted the minute to even load it up. I should have saved my money, taken $2 and bought Double Dragon and watched a really bad guy saves girl movie inbetween boards. Squaresoft should appolagize for releasing a game so poorly written. I want my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Graphics, but too short and no storyline","review":"This game sucks except the graphics are the best.

The plot is decent I guess, but the thing that bothered me most was that the game was so short. I had it on a three day rental and beat the game in a night and a little less than a day of playing. It's definitely worth a rental, but not quite worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom. . .","review":". . . and the Bouncer definitely hits bottom and not only does it not bounce, it then proceeds to tunnel through the earth and emerge in a strange and boring land. Instead of playing Bouncer, you might want to just hold your controller and watch cartoons -- you'll experience about the same amount of interaction but the stories and animation will be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this before you buy it.","review":"I thought that this game had great graphics and and controls were nice and easy, but the rest of the game stunk. The story is kinda stupid although it is cool that the story changes a little with each person. The camera angle in parts of the game are horrible, but worst of all is the fact that you can finish the game in an hour and a half or so. So if your thinking about buying it RENT IT FIRST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but gameplay is poor!","review":"OK, I agree. It LOOKS wonderful! But eye-candy isn't everything when it comes to great games. This is NOT a great game. This is an OK rental game, since it is easy to play.

The movie scenes are top of the line. The producer is Squaresoft!! The name sounds great!! One catch, the game ... It took me 2 hours to beat it. The gameplay is easy. The plot is ... The villains are annoying. The fighting is awesome, what little it has. I wasted my money, I shall not waste it in vain. Don't buy this game!! Have you ever hated returning a game to the video rental store, and not beating it, and having to rent all over again?!?! This is the game for you. Rent it, beat it, return it...in the same day! In my honest opinion, Squaresoft should stick to the Role-Playing genre,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better...","review":"I bought this game because I had heard it was good. Big mistake... The graphics are excellent. The story line is okay but seems to remind me of some OLD school games (like 3 guys going to look for the mayors' daughter). Alot of the other characters are faster and you don't even turn around in time to fight back. Although if you put together combinations they are pretty cool. Another draw back is you can't continue if you lose you have to go all the way to the beginning and reload. One thing I thought also to be funny is they way they are dressed... Who wears that kind of ensemble. Bottom line for all gamers. PLEASE RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it first does not last long!","review":"This game has great graphics but it just does not last long enough!

It still is a good game if you like fighting games."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","review":"ITs true that this is a great visual masterpiece but the game is only about 2 hours long and you have to beat it about 10 times to get all the secret characters who are useless anyway. Survival mode and vs mode are the biggest waster of time because each character have about 8 combos that you can do and all must be learned. After they are learned just pressing a button or two with L1 makes those combos come out. The games story is the worst. You will be bored with this game in three hours. Most enemies are only vunerable to one or two of those special combos so you are going to be doing the same thing over and over. The game also asks if you want to save almost every scene. If you buy this game you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Square's worst game","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The Bouncer is nothing but a rental, so don't waste your money on it. Yes, The Bouncer is a beautiful game. These are simply the best graphics on any system. The animation is amazing as well. BUT...graphics don't mean anything in the long run -- it's all about gameplay. The Bouncer has the most boring, repetitive \\"gameplay\\" found in any fighting game. The story is a joke too, and we don't really care for these characters at all. If you like gorgeous cinemas, then The Bouncer is for you. It is one big long cut-scene with about fifteen minutes of actual gameplay thrown in. The Bouncer is a laughable, beautiful, pathetic mess. Square should be ashamed of themselves -- The Bouncer is easily the worst game they have ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE WORD STINKS","review":"one day i was flipping throught the pages of a game magazine adn i came upon a game called the bouncer. it looked cool and i thought iam going to get that game. time came when it came out and i saw it at a rental store. i grabbed it and couldnt wait to play it to beat up some bad guys. boy did i pick the worst game to rent. i beat the game in 1hour 30minutes about and the thirty is for gameplay and the hour is for the in game movies. i have never played in a game in my life that has so many movies in it in so little time. iam giving this game a one because of the best part of the game that is the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME","review":"This game is really bad. I mean yea it has good graphics and stuff, but 1) it's super boring 2) the storyline sucks. I really like Resident Evil style games. This is definetly not!

The whole game is just fighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh ?","review":"The bouncer is ... well an RPG. Besides that its not that good.

You get attached to your characters and it has OK replay value.Graphics: 10/10 I've never seen better on a PS2 game. Movie and game graphics alike.sound:7/10 Everyones voice acted really well except for the main character, but he gets better as you go along.story:8/10. They turn a simple story into a complex one with this game.replay:7/10. You can play arcade, 2 player or a weird 4 on 4 thing. (or the story) The replay is better than everyone says.cut cinemas:10/10 That's what this game is. Movies. And at the end of the beginning movie when he hits the stairs and then the bouncer logo comes on the screen. Damn that's sweet!overall fun: 8/10 It's a big movie and you can play in the battles. I think it's great but if you don't have the patience to wait through lots of movies, then theres almost no point in buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing I rented this one first!","review":"The only good think I have to say about this game is that is does look really good! The graphics are great but that's the only great think about this game! I am totally disappointed with what they did to this game vs. what they could have done!If you are expecting to see a \\"double dragon\\" kind of 2 players with out a split screen type of fighting then think again. Next to that, you get the cheesy characters with the same ole cheesy names and cheesy story line! If you like story based fighting/action games that are very poorly thought out then you will like this one! Other wise, rent it, play it 2 or 3 times and then promptly return it and count yourself lucky you didn't waste your money on this stink bomb of a game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted to watch a movie...","review":"...I wouldn't pay $.... Yet, that's exactly what I feel like I bought after playing through Squaresoft's first foray into the land of the PS2. Yes, this game has incredible graphics and wonderful sound, as any movie should. What it lacks, however, is any sort of creativity. I mean, I felt like I was playing Final Fight or Double Dragon again. Square has raised the bar so much with their sparkling RPG's, and it is a shame that this product managed to creep out of the warehouse. Let's hope that Square does better the next time (as I know they will)..."},{"rating":"1","title":".:Fun.. for about 20 mins..:.","review":"Dont get me wrong.. I liked the game. It was decent. but.. worth buying? I don't think so. Rent it. save yourself some bucks. The game lasts about an hour... and nothing really happens. The CG graphics lack realistics as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics but bad game","review":"Just a couple of words to sum it up. Squaresoft is just not trying anymore. Yeah sure the cinimatics are great but all you do is just fight. You watch a movie then just fight. There is not brain skills involved no puzzels to solve and it is not worth buying. Stay away from this one until the price goes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"This is a very nice game. The story mode is filled with excellent graphics.

Although it has a storyline (a good one) and although it is a total of 30-40 minutes of playtime, it doe snot matter because the nonstop playing will come from the instant fighting with friends and not the story mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that glitters ain't golden","review":"This game looks fantastic. It's visually stunning and works the PS2's capabilities to a great extent. The sound and cinematics are nice too....but that's about where the fun stops. This is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in single-player mode. The controls are limited and clumsy (but the buttons are pressure sensative, which is kind of cool). There's not much in the way of skill here...mash mash mash, you know?I was excited about this game, but got instantly bored when I played it for the first time. Thank goodness there's a return policy at Babbages.Don't buy this one. It's short and boring..and pretty slow. Not good for a fighter/brawler."},{"rating":"1","title":"bouncer gets bounced","review":"this game is not worth paying for. i had more fun going to the dentist than playing this game. first of all, 75% of the game, you have to sit and watch the cinematics rather than playing. second of all, the gameplay was rather boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bouncer is a good rent.","review":"It is a good fighting game but the game can be beaten in a matter of minutes. It took me about 30 minutes to have all my characters to max power and its not much fun after that. I recomend you rent it then see if it is worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Graphics That Fall To The WaySide","review":"To start of with this game has some pretty great graphics, but it stops there. The storyline is interesting but the CGI interruptions are very numerous and take up at least a 1/4 of the story. And to top this all of the story barely lasts over an hour. Squaresoft makes some phenomenal games just look at the Final Fantasy franchise, but this is not anywhere near what I expect of them. If I wanted a fighting game i would get something like Tekken or Bloody Roar. If u like realistic fighting games and fighting/tornament games this is for u. However do not let the promise of a good story game or the Squaresoft label fool u, a Final Fantasy this is most definitely not. To give what positive review I care to, in the whole fighting/tournament genre this is definitely one of the better ones. The fighters look very realistic and the moves do as well. However the premise to this game was the story and boy did it choke!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but a bit short","review":"When I first played this game I thought it was very fun. The graphics are great the best I've ever seen. The fighting was also pretty good the only downside would be it reacts a bit slow but still very decent. The game takes about an hour to complete with one character, but there are 6 different endings, two for each character. This is kind of short but you have to keep in mind that it is an action game not an RPG. So for what it is it's decent but nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lush graphics but there is something missing, gameplay!","review":"Lets get on with the good things about this movie, great graphics and nice cinemas (hence the two stars and not one star). Now that thats out of the way lets get on with everything wrong about this game. I completed the game in less then a hour, majority of that time was watching very excellent cinemas; but really if I wanted to watch cinemas I would have rented a movie that could go twice as long as this so-called \\"movie.\\" The big problem I have with this game (or movie), is how much time I actually had of playing time. It was very little! Twenty minutes of gameplay is not worth fifty bucks. I suggest you just rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics, poor play","review":"I read the other reviews and I agree with them. It only took me about an hour to beat this game one time through. I was expecting something much much more.

So would drilling and tapping holes in the areas covered by the lock and bolting from the inside. Or countersinking the holes and using flat headed socket bolts with nuts on the inside.

There is no silver bullet to getting Web traffic as this book has pointed out. SEO techniques are essentially spamming on different levels. Google, Yahoo! and MSN change their algorithm routinely to combat spamming. So any technique that you use would give you high ranking for a while, then your site ranking would disappear. I like this book because it presents a wide and effective approach. Quality contents, for example, will give your site a high ranking on the long run.

The apache people were a nomadic people, and the US Government taught them more about treachery than any village elder ever could. Treaties broken , starving people forced to march to barren wastelands, all the things the US Government forced the apache to endure are here. Only then did the apache begin to fight the white man in seriousness, and then only in small numbers. It is a tribute to their tenacity and strength that they were able to avoid capture by 'three stars' Crook for so long. In particular my favorite chapters were those about noble apache chiefs like Cochise and Mangas Colorado. These were the true leaders of the apache, Geronimo was never revered as a leader until he broke off from the main tribe.

(I bought several books on the Southwest at the same time, and most of them were soporific, so this one really stood out.) It was first published in 1938 and relies on, among other things, first-hand accounts (although as the author reminds us, one cannot expect entirely dispassionate histories from people who actually lost friends or family in skirmishes).

All I hear on this and his other discs is a dillusional amateur who got more chances than he deserved to make a listenable album. The HooDoo show was a smokescreen to hide the fact that there is no talent contained within.He may have believed in what he was doing, I'm not contesting his drive, just the fact that this stuff is not and never will be saleable or listenable. Hence, the preliferation of 2$ copies of this waste of plastic.

The information is good but as far as it being a must see for everybody, I think there are better products out there. Also, it is boring as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetical, Yet Politically Charged","review":"Bruce Cockburn's 1983 offering shows the singer-songwriter at a lyrical peak, with politically charged, poetically lovely words that are unfortunately all too relevant in today's increasingly repressive society. Cockburn thoughtfully turns his acid-etched pen on tyranny in the name of security, exploitation of the poor, hunger, alienation; yet he also creates poetry of delicate imagery and aching beauty. Musically, except for the anthem-like title track, the band is tightly controlled, almost spare, and there are not as many of the musical hooks found in some of his other works. Intelligent, thought-provoking, and profound, \\"The Trouble With Normal\\" is an excellent offering by one of the most talented singer-songwriters of the past twenty-five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars so far.","review":"The weber site provides a quick identification of the part numbers needed for your grill.Bars are stainless and quite heavy.

It is poorly written and does not explain difficult subjects well. Often the author has a mocking tone and will say something like, this paragraph is confusing and you should reread it. It actually said that. In another part it asks what does this difference mean? \\"(Think hard about this. I'll wait for you in the next paragraph.)\\" What the hell does that even mean??? Maybe the author needs to do a better job explaining in a language students speak. We are not all stats majors and really don't give a damn. If you need this book for a class, I'm sorry. Sucks to be you (and me). Also, be prepared for the software to be unusable. It requires the use of a damned floppy disk...yes, a floppy.

They still have the blues, what they have produced is actually more of the same thing. Which is, in their case, not a problem at all. On the album are very beautiful songs about life and it's bad sides, about hope and love. A great album by a great Dutch band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rare Hooker at a bargain price.","review":"This is a great CD. The first CD alone is worth the purchase price. It consists of rare sides transcribed from old 78's from obscure labels like Chance, Staff, Acorn, Regent and others (1948-1950). Plus 5 live tracks w/backing by Muddy's band circa 1960. The sound quality is reasonable considering the source but some of the performances are blood curdlingly awesome. If you don't have any Hooker the other CD's have a lot of his best Vee-Jay sides. There is absolutely no documentation with the CD's except for a track list but it's all killer stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny to a point...","review":"This is a parody of The Silmarillion, you know, that book about the history of the elves that seems to last a billion years? Well, this is funnier, in a way, but not as long. Yet it also seems to repeat itself a lot. There is only so many times I will find smutty elves funny. And yes, some people may be insulted or outraged. Mostly because the author does seem to hit a few other books, movies and television series while creating this silly masterpiece. I doubt it will be as well remembered as Bored of the Rings, but it will come a close third, after Doon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silmarillion, but readable","review":"My first copy ran away and I haven't seen it in years, so I was thrilled to find this listing!I have a very checkered past with the Silmarillion. I have tried to read it three times, and every time I failed to make it more than 1/3 through the book. I don't know why, but I cannot persevere over it.The Sillymarillion is wonderful, though, because it gives me all the background knowledge that a lover of (almost) all things JRRT should have, while being funny and well-paced.

With pixie records, BAM! they grab you instantly and you're hooked, you just can't and won't let go(pixie fans know this). however with frank black work, the effect is not always the same, for me anyway. it's more like the wine process, good at first, but (with time) the more you listen to it; the greater it becomes. at the beginning of my \\"frank black and the catholics\\" album i felt a little disappointed.. however, ofcourse, the more i popped it in the more delicious it became. which is what i think will be the case with this one. i have several frank black work already and if you're looking around for reviews on what to get.. let me tell you that; it doesn't matter.. having one will inspire you to get another and so on.. you will have them all. atleast i know i will."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pixies were Black's band","review":"and this record proves it. Losing not one iota of his knack for esoteric, undeniably catchy rock music, Black picks up where Trompe Le Monde left off, much to a saddened Pixie fans' delight. A power chord fest from start to finish. I honestly can't think of a dull moment on the cd. Altogether, anthemic and mysterious, with a nod to Brian Wilson by covering \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\". Some sort of a mini space theme running through this, too. Doesn't get tiring, either.I knew that song was about the Ramones. I knew it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Splunge\\" for me too.","review":"I concur with the other reviewers here. You may hate it at first, but give it a few listens and before long you will require your fix monthly. If you are expecting the Pixies, you will be disappointed, but only briefly.

I still discover bizarre and wonderful new things with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your first step into Frank Black's great world.","review":"This may not be \\"Teenager Of The Year\\" or \\"Cult Of Ray\\" but it is still pure Frank Black. Black has a way of talking about science fiction while beign quirky all the same. It's Black's fiery hard rock roots combined with new styles, which are reminescent of They Might Be Giants. Since I am an avid \\"The X Files\\" fan \\"Parry The Wind High, Low\\" is my favorite song.Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut.","review":"I bought TOTY first, loved that so much I went out and bought this one. \\"Los Angeles\\" starts out strongly, and then it just goes from there.

The musical textures vary, and in some songs their are twists (Parry the Wind High, Low) that keeps things interesting. Just a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better over tim","review":"This is one of those albums that gets better the more you listen to it. Read the lyrics and you'll appreciate it even more.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank's way cool","review":"Like all of Frank Black's work, this one's as a treasure.He delivers the goods: alternately grainy rocking blasters and melodic roller coasters of fun and games worth every second.I think Frank Black struck a deal with the universe long ago. He has access to all the riffs and elusive harmonies - not to mention radically cool, mysterious lyrics left off limits to all the pop stars who try way harder.Frank Black has certainly evolved as an artist, which is evidenced on later discs than this, but going back to this one time and time again proves entertaining beyond belief.Rock on you crazy, brilliant diamond.

This is a book about the end of those days in Boston. Skeffington, the mayor of Boston (a thinly veiled James Michael Curley) is running for one last term as mayor. This is the tale of that race and of Skeffington's life in politics.What makes this book particularly precious is the, still accurate, portrayal of the hatred between the Irish and the Old Yankees in Boston. Skeffington, an Irishman, has adroitly played the political game for years. This book tells of how the Irish came to power in Boston. More important it tells how at the end, politics became less about speaking clearly and shaking hands firmly and more about money and television.To me, Skeffington is the king of the political characters. He has humor and sensitivity. Would that there were anyone left with the entertaining humor he brought to the world of politics.A most entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, the last Hurrah","review":"The last contract that James Micheal Curley signed at 2357 before his term as Mayor of Boston ended at midnight has dissapeared from East Boston in a upgrade of Logan International Airport.

Most, if not all, of the incedents in \\"The Last Hurrah\\" could have taken place during the last of James Micheals several terms as Mayor. (Except his death on the night of the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.) Are the politics today better? They are diferent. But I'm not too sure that they are better.

What resulted was a fun, upbeat, girl-centered album, almost all (if not entirely) female singers. The music is fun, and the random quotes from the show add an interesting aspect. I've never seen it, but previewing the show like this is easy and effortless. The only problem would be that I can't just listen to it randomly because the quotes are in the way, especially when I just want to hear music. But all in all, it's a fun album and worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent mix of covers","review":"Leaving aside the TV show tie-in nature of this album, this soundtrack stands up nicely as a concept album, with female artists covering classic tunes relating to love and domestic life.A glance over the list of artists will suggest the soundtrack will be somewhat uneven, and that's borne out by a through listening. SheDaisy doesn't really have the chops of Martina McBride, Liz Phair or the Indigo Girls (and the latter don't even seem to be trying particularly hard).Some artists, like Phair or Gloria Estefan, try and put their own spin on things, while others do a more note-for-note classic rendition. It's typically those trying to make the song their own who succeed the best, and there are enough such performances to make this album work.Fun stuff, although it's a shame more of it never made it onto the actual TV show.A recommended purchase for fans of Liz Phair, Gloria Estefan or Martina McBride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album is misdescribed, really disappointing","review":"When you see this album, you may think it includes all the nice DH score by Jablonsky. However, you would be wrong.Instead, it contains a random selection of pop tracks, and the theme tune to the programme. I have no idea if these pop tracks were featured in some trivial way in the programme (don't personally remember them), but no matter: it's no different to the standard dross you can buy anywhere.I don't understand what compelled the creators of this soundtrack to produce yet another generic dance album, instead of putting Jablonsky's score (which is world-renown) on there. If such a soundtrack were released I'd gladly give it 5*.As for this though...I have absolutely no idea what went through the minds of the majority of the reviewers here who gave it 5 and 4 stars. Perhaps they just like the music. If you like pop tracks, sure, why not, good as any album, but it's not the \\"Original TV Soundtrack\\" as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate For It!","review":"What an amazing album. So many soundtracks have made their way onto the market, but not many can claim to have a good rep. This one, I'm sure, will have. Like Legally Blonde 2 OST, or Shark's Tale OST, Desperate Housewives has a feature single, this one by Shania Twain, Shoes. From an artiste whose last album was her Greatest Hits, this comeback is surprisingly smooth and well-composed. Throw in other hits from Joss Stone, as well as theme tracks from the show, and you have one perfectly good album that can brighten up your day while doing laundry, or typing out a report for some deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeAnn Rimes","review":"LeAnn Rimes is just phenomenal!

That's all you need!The charcoal dividers are a VERY nice added feature - comes with all the accessories I bought for my old (20 years and still working!) Weber 22 incher! Tool rack, cover holder, grill grate with the ends that open for adding extra charcoal and side table. Even my thirteen year old DAUGHTER said, \\"Cool!\\" when she saw it.

The laughs come regularly, and the book is a pleasure, whether or not you're planning on a South American Island adventure.Our intrepid couple keeps coming close to disaster, but never have a bad experience. Their humorous close calls with island bureaucracy, unreliable airlines, annoying French tourists, challenging rental cars and traffic, just seem to bring them closer together. While there are clouds following them around, it never gets worse than slightly overcast, with bright sun by the end of each chapter.And what are we to make of the mysterious \\"Rick\\" figure.

But she also shows the price he and she paid for their love story--a broken first marriage for him, guilt and pain for all involved, and the deep tragedy of the death of a child. A skilled reporter and stylist, Darling can create memorable characters and scenes. But what makes this book so powerful in the end is her refusal to spare herself or be less than candid about her motives and behavior. If you believe in love and in its power to redeem the soul (or even if you think you might), you'll find yourself thinking about NECESSARY SINS long after you have read the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt get everything described/Seller will not respond to emails","review":"I ordered a figure and in the description it stated that it came complete with accessories.

It does what it is meant to do and can be wiped clean for repeated use. It is not suitable for the dining table or buffet, the design being sharp industrial and the bottom too rounded to be stable.

And there isn't any help in figuring out how to use the color variations.

There's nothing about working with pattern, either. Clever but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great packaging. Short on content","review":"This book is attractive and cleverly packaged but not very helpful in terms of choosing color schemes for the home. I enjoyed flipping through the pages, however, the \\"rooms\\" are inexpensive sets that do not resemble actual rooms (especially the kitchen section) and the colors combinations are unconventional and unlikely choices. Also, the book refers to only one paint brand, and it is not one of the finer brands on the market. I would not recommend this book as a paint guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the \\"classic-minded\\" decorator","review":"Lime-green or tangerine-colored walls are not my idea of beauty. Yes, there's a lot of color combinations that you can choose from, but you'll have to remove every single strip in order to see what most of them will look like together.

With a bigger tank and maybe plants in the way of the bio-wheel outflow, it would probably look better."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better filters out there","review":"I have never had a filter give me so much trouble on start-up. I opened the box and the intake extension tube was missing. OK, I could make do. I put the filter together, put it on the tank and I have to say it started immediately. But then it started to gurgle, lose suction and go dry. I took it apart 5 times trying to find the problem. I checked the impeller, siliconed all the seals and removed and siliconed the intake hose where it meets the canister. Those intake and exhaust tubes are loose and leaky. I wanted to like the bio wheel, but it's just too big for the back of the tank. I don't want to cut out another section on my hood to accomodate it. The filter has been running for the past half hour.

I love it.","review":"I was honestly surprised to see all of the angry reviews on here. Of course, I've never heard anything else of theirs and I bought this CD without any idea who the band was, what they sounded like... Here's what shocked me: Their descriptions of the struggles at sea? It's pretty good. As a mariner, I was shocked to actually hear songs that weren't just using shipwrecks as euphemisms for relationships --- but as violent, frightening occurrences that can leave you physically adrift and going through a lot of strange psychological changes.

I loved all of this bands stuff pre-\\"Tales Don't Tell Themselves\\" (I even gave \\"Hours\\" the benefit of the doubt on a few less than stellar songs out of general respect for this band). The first time I heard this album all the way through, I thought it was some mistake. Maybe the manufacturer printed the wrong cd? How could this plain, lyrically and instrumentally VANILLA album belong to Funeral For a Friend. Alas, it does. The truth is, the entire thing is extremely boring and void of any passion or effort (and the lyrics are incredibly cheesy and bland). Notice that while their previous cds (some being 6 years old) are selling for over $2 used on this site, this cd (came out almost a year ago) is selling for 1 cent.

The production to me personaly is great....The catchy melodies are gone, the tearful, and grasping lyrics are nowhere to be heard...after 3 amazing albums...FFAF have found their senior slump....maybe next time...I just didnt think it was possible...and it's apparent becuz most reviewers are also agreeing with the lack of emotion on this album...maybe Matt put all his heart in his solo cd...we'll never know....and I don't see this album as maturing....I see this album as a fork in the road...So sad...a true fan now dressed in black for his own Funeral...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong sze","review":"The quality of the product was okay but it was overshadowed by the fact that they sent me the wrong size!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Marketing in One Evening","review":"John Mariotti has written his best book yet.

This book of quotations stands heads and shoulders above the rest of them, not because it's women but because it's full of superb, thoughtful, wise, witty, useful quotations and because it's so well-documented (you know who actually said what, on what occasion).

I'll buy any book Rosalie Maggio puts her name on because she does her homework and has good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice remaster, BUT, the surround mix has a problem...","review":"First, this remaster definitely has a clarity to it that the original CD didn't; I hear things I've never heard before, which makes he upgrade worthwhile to me.Unfortunately, both the DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 mixes used what appears to be a DIFFERENT RECORDING of \\"Into My Arms\\", one of mt favorite tracks on the album. In this version, it sounds like Nick is saying \\"Innoo my alms\\" instead of \\"Into my arms\\".... I kid you not. Every time. There are a few differences in line delivery outside of this, too... not sure what they were thinking, but it's immediately noticeable and should not have been released this way.The CD uses the correct version of the song. WTH?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholic Boldness","review":"Nick Cave's bravery and honesty on this album put him among the most revered poets and songwriters. His portrait of love as a force that can be simultaneously demonic and angelic is sublime. This contradiction is felt strongly not only in his words but also in Cave's painful melodies. The album and it's author stand alone, despite being in the presence of great achievements in love and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Agnostic's Gospel Record","review":"For years I didn't understand Nick Cave. This is very hard for me to admit considering how much he means to me now, but unfortunately it is the truth. I bought several of his earlier albums over the years, and the howling vocal assault, the crashing pianos and gothic affectations were all lost on me, yet I could never bear to sell them. Thankfully some part of my subconscious kept my rash capitalistic impulses in check, because when this record came out everything fell into place.Some how this beautiful collection of dour love songs enabled me to make sense of the earlier works filled with a gloomy obsession with God, murder, the southern mystique. So this album is a world changer for me, it is filled with passionate songs about love, faith, and uncertainty that often make me cry. It remains one of my favorite records of recent memory, and so I am compelled lend my voice to the choir and give this already well-reviewed record my unassailable praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boatman's Call","review":"I had never heard of Nick Cave until I heard a clip on internet radio.

It is very deep...and you never know where he is going with each song."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Nick's best yet.","review":"THE BOATMAN'S CALL: Close yourself in your dark room. Put those earphones on. Experience one man's hands-on memoirs of relationships that, for whatever reason, didn't work out. Guys who have been through the wringer can easily identify with Nick's perambulations. These are the recitations of a mature individual--nothing punky, no pyrotechnics and no bullshit--just honesty and experience and wisdom. Anyone who's been there can easily identify with his whistful, mature and spare compositions. This CD will stay with you like a splinter in your brain. You don't deserve music this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album ever recorded","review":"Simple as that. The lyrics are in my opinion his best yet - finally producing the love lyrics we always knew he was capable of. 'Are you the one that I've been waiting for?' in particular is the apogee of poetry and rock combining. As the other reviewers note, there are many other superlative tracks on this one - people aint no good, into my arms, and green eyes chief among them. My number one album of all time.Note - if you like murder ballads, you might not like this album. As I understand it, Nick and co were so disappointed with murder ballads that they rushed to record this one to make up for it (the release of this was however delayed as murder ballads inevitably sold more than all their other records)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bottle of good Merlot and candle light","review":"If it's Billy Holiday or Billy bragg that you curl up to at night with a bottle of spirits, you have every right to experience The Boatman's Call. This album is a lullaby that will rock or cry you to sleep. I advise drinking way to much and making your partner dance with you slowly to \\"People Just Ain't No Good\\" or \\"Green Eyes\\". If they are still there in the morning, Marry them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elequent Nick Cave","review":"This is a soulful songster to begin with so saying this CD is happier is a relative thing. The lyrics conjure up images that challenge the normal limpid way songsters try to describe emotions. The feelings expressed in the words challenge the listener to explore a better way to say how they personally would feel in the same circumstance. I have all ways liked Nick's voice and I think the music he writes and sings fits his style. There are several very good songs on the Album not the least of which is the love song used in the movie Zero Effect. Get the CD and listen to it several times it will be worth your time and your emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"May just move it to my Living Room!","review":"This chaise is almost as comfortable as my recliner - more in some ways!

The resin band broke recently, but the watch is still running. The product description mentions a 2.5-year battery life, but I'm sure it can last much longer with limited alarm and Indiglo use. The watch wears comfortably and is quite durable. It's also easy to program and has plenty of functions.To give a better feel for the size of the watch--the silver-colored portion is about 3.7 x 4.6 cm. The thickness from the window to the steel back is about 1.2 cm. The watch is a bit big for women and children. Even at the tightest notch, the watch fit loosely on me--but I do have incredibly skinny wrists.Also, a note: The viewing window is slightly convex and sits higher than the silver-colored frame. Because it bulges out a bit, it's prone to scratches. The window doesn't damage easily, but running it against bricks and walls will certainly leave marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Phish, you'll like Rift","review":"Rift is often called Phish's concept album, and I agree. Junta, Lawn Boy, and Picture of Nectar were great albums, but it seems that Phish really lays its musical foundation with this one. The list of songs is great. I love them all. They all contain motiffs and themes which would later develop into the phish that we all enjoy when they are touring. Maze is always fun to listen to as it has developed into one of the great jam workhorses of the Phish arsenal. Silent in the Morning is the essence of harmony, which Phish has always sought. Horn lends a slower funkier soulier notion to the album as Trey plays with his heart rather than his hands. Mike has a good number of songs on here which are always catchy, groovy, and finny. The Anastasio/Marshall tunes are pristine, played perfectly. Basically, Rift is the essence of modern Phish. If you like Phish, you'll like Rift."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah, i'm afraid it is that good","review":"A lot of Phish-heads out there are going to tell you this is such a great album ... personally I burned out on Phish many, many years ago, and hadn't played their stuff for a long time. I just listened to this album again for the first time in probably ten years, and was reminded of something I read around '93 - an interview in which Trey reckoned that Rift was the first album where they really got things right."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic phish","review":"one of the best phish albums ever. not to be taken for granted just because it wasn't recorded in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can delight and inspire you as an artist and a listener.","review":"Rift, is a dreamy album with much to listen to. Every time you listen to a song a new note will tingle your brain until you relize the pure genuis that is Phish. They have developed an fan base over the years, but rift will delieght more than the adverage phish fan. Anyone who listens to this album will fall in love with its ability to flow. Phish has once again made an album that can put your mind in its very own state of mind.If you buy any album this century buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rare Horn, what more can I say?","review":"I am a devoted Phan and though this album is not the phinest of Phish's albums, it has some great songs on it. Lengthwise, The Wedge, Weigh, Mound, It's Ice, and HORN! How could you not like this album? But I agree with those who say go get Junta, SS+P. Just collect live tapes. There is a greater variety in them and they don't cost anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish does it again, how would we live without them.","review":"Rift is by most people's standards fairly tame compared to live shows, but bristling with excitement none the less. As with all Phish studio efforts, one must look at a songs ability on the stage as well as on the disc. Rift displays Phish's diversity once again. Rift is not a concept album. I challenge anyone to find repetition in the themes of the songs. Every song is a gem and thus should stand alone. I give this album my highest reguards, not surprising coming from someone as fond of the band as I am, but the intensity of the music itself commands respect, and so Phish you shall have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"One of my favorite Phish albums. A classic. Don't know why I waiting so long to buy it..probably because I knew all the songs already from their live albums but is always interesting to back and listen to the studio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flacid music, little enjoyment","review":"To all of the Phish apologists and blind fanatics who gave this five stars, I say, \\"Come on! \\" This has to be one of the worst phish albums they ever released. These people should expect a lot more from such accomplished musicians. I am a huge phish fan and this album was a huge disappoinment. Maybe it was a concept album, if so, please drop the concept. Leave it off stage so we never have to be berated by these tunes. It's not as bad as this sounds but I KNOW Phish can do a whole lot better. Take Billy Breathes for example. That CD has feeling, purpose, and emotion, while maintaining an appeal to each song that catches when you listen to it. This album just puts me to sleep. Buy Junta, Billy Breathes, and Story of the Ghost before you even touch this thing. If you have all those, stick to trading, this would just be a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't trust the blind (deaf) apologists","review":"Hey, let's be real. This album goes in the back of your cd book because it's definitely nothing special. Many of the Phish apologists (and there are a lot now) say that this is concept or that it sounds like one of their best studio albums. I THINK NOT! This album has little emotion and depth. The songs have little feel and even less flavor. Compared to their newer albums, especially Ghost and Billy Breathes, this album is one of those that you would rather burn then purchase. And that's just to see where Phish went wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horriphic","review":"After buying Junta, I thought that I liked Phish, but Rift is terrible. Don't get me wrong; the virtuosic playing is there, but this effort falls short in the songwriting department. \\"Lengthwise\\" and \\"Wedge\\" are particularly wretched offerings. From the barbershop quartet intro on the title track through every track afterwards, the lack of taste shines through! As I said, this album was bad enough to completely turn me off from this instrumentally talented band."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED ADDRESS","review":"Yes, you told me I could return the cassette, when I wanted a CD; however, on the return address, it seems the post office tore it with tape, therefore I have no way of knowing where to send the tape back to. Please send me an email with a return address. Thank you!tmcdonnell@svc.edu"},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid refuse","review":"This disc has no soul. How could a supposed musical \\"concept\\" concerning a rift in a human realtionship be so void of human emotion? I couldn't even bare to think that someone might actually see it in my collection, so I sold it. The instrument sounds are produced well, overall the sound is clean, but the music is lame. If compared to any number of other rock guitarists (Fripp, Howe, Vai, Satriani, Belew, Zappa to name but a few) jazz guitarisrs (Pass, Hall, Roberts, Montgomery, Benson, Metheny, Frissell, Stern, Abercrombie, once again naming but a few) or real musical virtuosos (Bach, Beethoven, Brahams, Mozart, Chopin, Debussy, Starvinsky, Rachmaninoff, Bird, Diz , Miles, the list goes on...) Anastasio commands no instrumental virtuosity on this effort. The only other Phish disc that I still own is \\"Billy Breathes\\". At least that one has some emotion. I would rather listen to old Glen Campbell lp's than ever spin this drivel in my player again."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars, excellent","review":"It'd be wise to begin this review by saying that i'm not the biggest fan of the new Phish material (99 and up). Nothing against the band members, but I think they made their best music up to that time. It s natural. Not all good artists and musicians create masterpieces all life long. The good material has its good moment, and it did last very long.This record is the finest. The best songs you could think of that make their shows. Rift, Wedge, Maze. ClassicsI reccomend this album because it is full Phish, or really medular material that stays w/ you for very long. This is the band I like, and I hope you enjoy this record too."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of energy","review":"honestly, i haven't been using this video long enough to see results, but i have to comment on denise austin's enthusiasm. i have a few other exercise videos that put me to sleep. the personal trainers act like they don't care if you meet your goals, but denise is on fire! i would love a good dancercise video with her in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Ja make his glorious return to the hip hop market with R.U.L.E, a song tittled CD.

I actually liked his \\"Pain is Love\\" album a lot. Its a shame he had to fall off so hard, but damn, when youve got some of the wackest people in the industry behind you, I guess its inevitable. The best songs on here are \\"Get it Started\\" with Claudette Ortiz, who is just BLAZING on this track, and \\"Where I'm From\\" featuring Lloyd. \\"Wonderful\\" is a good song and all, and I actually think R. Kelly and Ashanti did a good job on the hook. I'm just sick of him dwelling on how \\"b*tches wanna bring him down\\"...damn, if thats all we're gonna hear for an hour plus, save it...cuz I can hear that in the unemployment line. He needs to up his lyrical content, and bring it back to where he came from, not all this pop glitz-and-glamour sh*t.

Go pick up Venni Vetti Vecci because that was before Ja Rule got greedy and made songs with Jennifer Lopez and Ashanti. I do believe that if it werent for Irv Gotti Ja Rule would still be an alright rapper. But that idiot just fed him too much E and told him to keep makin the same song recycled.

The rest of the cd is not even radio friendly so it wouldn't even work for any other song on the radio and plus there is nothing of substance on the cd to pass as radio other than wonderful and new york.

You will find that the lifestyle that Ja promotes primarily exists within the black urban neighborhoods (ghettos) that have poisened our nation.

Any historian who writes a couple of hundred years after the event and reports dialogue, witticisms and even facial expressions is obviously writing a lot of fiction, but fiction or not, its high drama, presented in vivid detail. one of these days, someone should do a translation without the long lists of \\"who reported to whom\\" (the isnad) because they do take away from the flow of the book. Tabari also makes no attempt at social analysis and has little to say about what the \\"common people\\" might have been doing and why, but his history is one of the prime sources for all the famous stories of islamic history and one can see why. well worth a read...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and provide good insights to new owners","review":"The author describes what a family entrepreneur needs to know in order to run a successful family business. The autor also highlights three major management functions - communication, cooperation and control for a family business owner such as how to evaluate relatives in a family business. It is practical and valuable because small family business owners may not know how to handle such situations effectively. After reading this book, it helps me to understand how to manage my family business practically.

When the albums were put in the box, 2 of the albums were facing each other which caused the metal to scratch. For the amount that I paid for these, I was not happy.

There's a waiting list for Philip B Jet Set Hair Spray at all the retail establishments (we've checked ALL of them).

It also has a few nice visual effects, decent cinematography, and overall decent acting. The boys felt a little uncomfortable around eachother (maybe they needed more practice to better portray a group of friends?) but this wasn't too bad. I think the big problem here was time; this movie had only 16 minutes to introduce the characters, unleash the monster, and kill the characters, and that's just not enough time to effectively build the sort of presence that an unseen monster really needs to be scary. This probably would have played better with just two characters fighting to survive as the evil darkness slowly, but surely closes in for the kill.As it is, the movie is not scary, not very intersting, and really only worth watching if you're a horror writer looking to learn more about what does and doesn't work in a horror film. Anybody else: steer clear - this movie is 16 minutes of life you cannot get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother","review":"This movie was a total waist of time. The actors need to do more work on their skills. You will never see them in a major motion film. The story was weak an lame.

Ziporyn however rises incredibly to the task of creating such an interesting novel while also loading it with contemplative philosophy in such a way that it does not overwhelm the reader, but further fascinates him. I had the pleasure of being Brook Ziporyn's student and I never realized that he possessed this literary/imaginative talent, though the brilliant presentation of his philosophical musings is no surprise at all. This book is extremely entertaining, very well written, yet it also leaves the reader with a new contemplation after each chapter and page. Definitely read this if you are a fan of SF/Fantasy and you are philosophically minded. The incorporation of Buddhist/Daoist thought is apparent to those who have studied such philosophies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Live Set","review":"Peter Green continues the third phase of his career with this latest lineup of his Splinter Group. In this excellent set the Group performs at a small jazz club in Soho, and runs through several of Green's Fleetwood Mac hits (Black Magic Woman, Rattlesnake Shake) as well as the usual repertoire of blues standards and Robert Johnson songs. Guitarist Nigel Watson contributes one original song, and there is one Bo Diddley tune added. The sound is superb and the performances are magnificent. One can't help but wish that Green would try his hand at songwriting again; he hasn't recorded a composition of his own since the early 1980s. It would be interesting, at least, to seee what this band could do with some original material. However, perhaps it's the singer, not the song, that really matters. This CD set is highly recommended for any Peter Green fan or blues enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.G. Doing Great","review":"This, the third of the Splinter Group cds is very good. Peter Green continues his comeback. It is great to hear this legendary guitar master back in form. It is a temptation to want everything to sound just like Fleetwood Mac of the 60's and early 70's. But, Green and company take the old standards and make them fresh and interesting. Green continues to improve and sound more at ease with what he's doing. Even if you are not a hard core Peter Green fan, there is a lot to like about this cd. Well worth the effort to find and make a part of your collection. Solid blues and a touch of jazz feel with a little old time gospel sound in spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wheel for the price","review":"Great wheel for the price..Using the wheel for a bird feeder ferris wheel.

The book talks about the multi-faceted \\"renaissance\\" person, giving historical perspective (and dignity!), reminding us that this personality type has produced tremendous successes in history (Ben Franklin, Leonardo DaVinci to name two) and is a viable alternate path from the single-minded pursuit of destiny. The book also gives the reader several activities/frameworks to help focus those multiple interests in to a manageable lifestyle (my favorite was the ice cream shop analogy). Personally I've found the book helped me explain a diverse career background and create interest during the jobsearch process, diffusing the \\"what do you want to be when you grow up\\" skepticism.

This book gives advice and comfort to all the renaissance souls in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I'd known","review":"I've often said 'if only I'd known this years ago' but have rarely meant it so whole heartedly. The Renaissance Soul has reassured me that I'm not fickle, unable to settle to anything, a part-timer or doomed to never amount to much. I had the misfortune to attend the kind of school where we were not encouraged to have wide-ranging interests and were expected to make a once only career choice at a very young age. My 'failure' in this respect led to a lot of unhappiness.Margaret Lobenstine has told me I'm normal. Different, but normal.Her explanations of what it means to be a renaissance soul and the advice and exercises she gives to help us cope with our renaissance nature are invaluable. I felt a huge sense of relief after reading this book.

I listened to this album 3 times trying to like it... never happened.I sold it for 2 bucks soon after buying it. This is not the same band who brought us \\"Among the Living\\" and \\"State of Euphoria.\\" Something good did come from the band's split.

His Ragged Dick character is witty and charismatic, rising up from homeless street urchin to respected bookkeeper by dint of hard work, frugality and focused study.

This helps you maintain a calm attitude, and takes the nervousness out of situations.

If that's what they smell like on the outside, I'd hate to smell the inside of a capsule.

The lack of effectiveness alone would cause me to give it about 3 stars. However, the smell of this product makes me give it 1 star. I mean this as literally as it sounds.

It is now 4:am and I have not yet slept. I did notice a slight happier feeling, I think, unless it's just my mood or placebo effect, but I feel a bit giggly, warm and happy after taking these. It is true what they say, these things smell pretty bad but it's even worse if you're like me and open the capsules to eat the powder.I have an irrational worry that the capsule won't fully digest, so I remove the contents and eat it that way. It tastes like horse manure mixed with sand (I think the sandy bit is calcium, but, who knows maybe it is really sand!)so in summary; it lightened my mood, and my wallet but didn't get me to sleep but everyone is different, I'd rather have tried it and have it fail than not tried it if it may have worked, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service, quality product","review":"I had very good service from this supplier.

I will keep you posted in a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this because of recent sleeping troubles due to losing a family member and some other things. I took it for a week or so and I didn't see any progress in helping me fall asleep. I'd used this with other things such as eliminating caffeine, sugar & alcohol and all the things sleep experts recommend. I'm a big believer in using natural herbs when and where circumstances permit. This just didn't work for me. I thought maybe I could use it for anxiety as needed like I've read some people do. When I tried that I felt very zoned out and a little nervous at the same time I only took 2 maybe that was too many. I researched it and some people have a sensitivity to this. From the reviews on this site it seems to work well for many people. If you are looking to relax or for help falling asleep try it and see if it works for you. If not then you are one step closer to finding out what does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sick","review":"I was extremely hopeful when trying this product - menopausal symptoms have made it difficult for me to stay asleep during the night. Unlike others here, the product did not work for me and worst of all the next morning and a good part of the day I suffered from nausea, vomiting and upset stomach/stomach pain. I called Nature's Way and they confirmed I had an unusual reaction to their product and recommended I discontinue use (not that I needed that bit of advice).

I tried using Valerian as an alternative to my anti-anxiety pill and had an adverse affect. The first day I took one in the morning and one at night. I felt euphoric and slept well. By the fourth day, my stomach was bloated till it was hard, I felt anxious and almost had an anxiety attack. My heart beat hard and fast and I was short of breath. Went off it right away and went back to my anti-anxiety pill. Be very careful if you are taking any kind of prescription meds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Helps Me Sleep.","review":"Excellent product. I take 2 before sleeping and it helps me fall asleep much quicker than if I don't take them.

Will buy again when I need a refill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifelong fan...","review":"I love Frankie's music and her attitude and have been a devoted fan for 30 years. I was very excited to see this book for sale and ordered a copy immediately. That being said, while it was interesting to learn details of this artist's life, I found the writing lackluster and the story sparse. There's a definite cultural divide: when reading of her oh-so-English upbringing, her dealings with the British government and the 1950s-60s folk music scene in England, it doesn't translate well to the American mind. Still, always glad to have another piece of the puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"very small and not too soft","review":"Our kitten is 5 months old and our apartment is very drafty so we thought this bed would be a good idea. He's pretty stubborn and it takes him awhile to accept anything new but he really does not like this bed at all. The material is kind of scratchy and the stitching is not very well done. It really may just be that our cat doesn't like it. If we put him in it while he's sleeping sometimes he will stay in it but he's going to outgrow it very soon. If you do get this make sure it is for a relatively small cat or kitten or plan to be getting a new one when they outgrow or destroy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nia Vardalos' second Big Fat movie!","review":"Here in Nia Vardalos' second big fat movie,this one co-scripted by her,Connie(Vardalos) and Carla(Toni Collette) are longtime friends who have since childhood pursued their dream of singing on the stage. They perform showtunes from various plays and movies in various costumes. They escape a mob after them for a large monetary debt. An accidental gunshot murder was committed in the process. David Duchovny's character takes romantic interest in Connie. Vardalos' real-life husband Ian Gomez is Stanley,the owner and operator of a nightclub that Connie and Carla perform at. In another scene,Connie's dream of meeting Debbie Reynolds comes true. Reynolds suddenly appears out of the blue into one of the clubs. I thought this film was excellent. But sadly,it was a box office disappointment compared to Vardalos' first film,2002's MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. CONNIE & CARLA only ran for about three or four weeks in theatres when it premiered on April 16,2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"A modern day Victor/Victoria that has more misses than hits","review":"I hate to be so cruel to a gay-genre movie (as I have most of them), but the truth must be told. This was a heavily watered-down Victor Victoria with a splash of Sister Act for the plot and a dash of dashed hopes for the ending. The acting was only fair, at best. Sure...there were those heart-felt moments, but they felt more produced than natural. Sure...there are a few laughs, but they were definetly constructed as laugh-points and lost their effect. As for overall comedic value, this film gets a 3/10.Compare these to some of my favorites: To Wong Foo, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Victor/Victoria. You'll see where this film flops in production and quality.Sorry Connie and Carla...but the show's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for Nia and Toni","review":"Perhaps I expected something less juvenile and predicatable. I did not utter so much as a giggle throughout this film. The only emotions I experienced were utter embarrassment for all the principals and admiration for Vardalos and Collette for being able to make anything of the picture, and perhaps for having the nerve to appear in it at all. Well, Nia wrote the thing so I suppose it was Toni alone who really stepped up to the plate. She could read the phone book and make it theater, but even SHE could not make me believe that she'd ever be mistaken for a drag queen. But really, why...why on earth was this picture made? Characters are totally formulaic and unbelievable. Writing seems geared toward a 15-year-old audience. Michael Lembeck's directorial style is TV-sitcom all the way. The laughs are cheap and the dialogue's feeble. But still, Vardalos and Collette light up the screen even in this worst of all possible comedies, so that's something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confucious say....","review":"Put a Fat Man in a Wig.....and you get an ugly bird.This film was god awful, such a shame as Toni Collette is a wonderful actress and she should fire her agent for 'finding' this for her.

It stars two great (my favorite) actresses who really bring the characters to life. If your in need of a serious laugh then this movie is one for the books.

I liken this movie to the spawn of two movies, The Birdcage and Thelma and Louise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boogie Wonderland","review":"\\"Connie and Carla\\" is so far removed from anything real that it begs description. It's neither pro-gay or anti nor pro-straight or anti. It's set in a world that doesn't exist nor will ever exist. It's a fantasy without being fantastic: it's a parody without humor. It's a dud.It's only saving grace is the humanity of the performances of Nia Vardalos and Toni Colette who both should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Blows Chunks","review":"THis is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was expecting a LOT more from Nia! I do not recomend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"D King","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable movie. Sad and hilarious parts but most importantly was David Duchovny's role as locating and trying to get to know his estranged brother and the gradual understanding, appreciation and acceptance of his brother's lifestyle. David Duchovny did a superb job and for me this was the core/message of the movie. He loved his brother for who he was and the lifestyle he lived made no difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious at times, funny throughout and wholly entertaining","review":"I had no high expectations of this movie and it surprised me in a very positive way. I thought the movie was highly entertaining (you have to love all the musicalsongs), hilarious at times and at one point emotional(the fight between Robert and his brother Jeff). It's a good comedy of errors. Of course it is full of cliches, but who cares. Nia Vardalos and Toni Colette are very funny and of course David Duchovny is as always his charming self, which in this movie almost makes a boring person compared to the other very colourful characters of the movie. If there is one weak point to name it must be that the contrast between more reallife characters like Jeff's and the other characters is too big. Duchovny is very funny at times, but his humour is very different in style. Luckily they did not make him sing and dance like they did Richard Gere in Chicago. On the whole an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase.","review":"Enoying my purchase very much.

Well worth the money I paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun on the Run","review":"Connie and Carla takes a modern day spin on the wonderful Some Like It Hot with twists of Victor Victoria. The \\"danger elements\\" are never too threatening, and the comedy never stops. The always excellent Toni Collette is virtually unrecognizable as the reluctant drag queen. Nia Vardalos (double duty as writer and star) is irresistably upbeat and unpredictable. And David Duchovny is as charming as ever. The film's bouyant energy maintains audience interest every minute. The songs are great. And thank goodness, gay issues are treated with respect. This is a film I'll watch many, many times and always enjoy. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute gender-bending comedy","review":"CONNIE AND CARLA is a cute little comedy starring Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette, two appealing and capable leading ladies and featuring a script that plays like a goofy combo of SOME LIKE IT HOT and VICTOR/VICTORIA.After witnessing a horrible crime, Connie and Carla (Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette) decide to go on the run. Arriving in Los Angeles, the girls quickly decide to re-invent their old dinner theatre musical act, and pose as drag queens in a struggling cabaret bar.This movie is actually quite delightful. Vardalos and Collette make an irresistible comedy team, and the girls actually sung all their numbers themselves (Collette starred on Broadway in THE WILD PARTY). Debbie Reynolds turns in a hilarious cameo (belting out \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\", Rizzo's big number from GREASE), and the supporting cast, led by David Duchovny, Stephen Spinella and Dash Mihok is sensational.For musical theatre fans, CONNIE AND CARLA is highly-recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHAHAHA: Laugh Out Loud Hilarious","review":"Laughed as hard as I could during Connie & Carla. Nia Vardalos just knows how to keep the world gut-bustin' giggly, and sidekick Toni Collette plays Carla perfectly. Classic fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good natured, sweet, recycled comedy","review":"Some Like it Hot, Victor/Victoria, The Birdcage, Priscilla ... yes, been there done that. There is still something so good natured about this comedy that it has an infectious charm and good will about it. Vardalos is fine, Colette is amazing and quite funny in her make-up, Duchovny is charming as the dope in the middle of it all. This one packs some laughs, goofy musical performances and a not preachy tolerance message into one enjoyably harmless package. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Region 2","review":"The Connie and Carla DVD is a region 2, a video intended to be played on DVD players in Europe, something I didn't know.

It needed to be about 5 or 6 chapters longer, it just felt as though it was missing some depth to the charactors and he could have expanded some about the situations of the people that were on Thorin.

Also, extremely respectful and intelligent maneuvers on each side. It's the best piece of gureilla warfare (or mentioning rebels) since Saga of the Grey Death Legion (that I've read). That's quite a well. The voicing isn't quite realistic, which is what stopped me from a 4 star rating.

I felt his ideals and basic charecter remained the same but, for some reason the thought of him as a main stream adult didn't apeal to me as much as him as an adolescent child or even a mine worker.

The first 200 or so pages were terrific Power of One prose. Then, the story seemed to accelerate out of control, and all the pieces ceased to connect and complete the intended circuit. There were a number of items that were significant, yet unexplained in the story. Like - what happened to Harriet? - to the camera? - to Hercules? - how did Mambo's teeth end up on a necklace on that Tandia wore? to what happpened to Hymie for heavens sake? Sorry, this one just didn't dance to the same beat as the Power of One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I didn't know this book existed until three years after I read the Power of One, one of my favorite books. I had trouble getting it since it is out of print but I finally got a copy. I took off work to read it. Although it satisfied my desire to know what happend to Peekay it was substandard compared to TPOO. I would've prefered a paragraph synopsis describing what happened to the principles at the end of TPOO to Tandia. It was poorly written and did not have the storytelling feel of TPOO. Characters were underdeveloped and you didn't feel like you knew Peekay as in TPOO. They also changed Morrie's name and never explained WHY! It was a long book and would've been longer if it had been done right. As much as dreamed of a TPOO sequel, I think I would've preffered to go on not knowing than read Tandia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tandia:A worthy sequel to \\"The Power of One\\"","review":"After reading Bryce Courtneay's \\"The Power of One\\" I was thrilled when I figured out there was a sequel and ordered it immedialty. \\"Tandia\\" is a good book, but at times seems to drag a bit. It is still a worthy follow-up and I definetly recommend it to those who read and liked or loved \\"The Power of One.\\" The ending of the book is very emotional, well written, and thought out. The ending alone will make you forget the little parts of the book that dragged along. Warning:it is a sad ending. I hope that Bryce Courtenay decides to write another book, following up on the end of this one. I highly recommend this book again, and though it can't even be compared to \\"The Power of One\\", it'll quench your thirst for more Peekay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tandia reads like cheap fan fiction.","review":"The Power of One was a compelling and visceral tale and a hard act to follow. Tandia doesn't live up to it. Do not buy this book it is a disappointing read. The writing style of the books are so different, almost as if they were written by two different authors. Power of One takes it's time, letting the story breathe and build slowly. Tandia tries and fails to cram too many plot lines and unimportant characters into 900 overly dense pages. At times the book seems like a cheap romance novel as it focuses at length on the tawdry details of the characters' sexual histories. This book could have been every bit as good as Power of One if Courtenay had elected to edit it down to half it's length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly flawed","review":"The Power of One, to which Tandia is the sequel, is flawed, but absolutely beautiful.

But after the first, then the second brutal rape scene within the first 50 pages, I just threw it in the trash. I loved living in the author's imagination when he created Peekay, but I couldn't escape his world fast enough when he created poor Tandia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoloodle Shame!","review":"Power of One is a masterpiece! A treasure gift to be shared with family, friends, business associates.I had sent to Australia for Tandia and all Courtenay's books before they were available here.Tandia is material for fire place at best. A brutal clone gone wrong of Power of One. Bryce Courtenay on real bad drugs.His brilliance in his other books are found gold, warm sweet potatoes! Power of One should be required reading for schools throughout the globe. Tandia is nothing more than a Harold Robbins imitation that doesn't cut it. Absoloodle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I really did not enjoy this book. It was such a let down after the Power of One.I thought Tandia was a weak, uninteresting character. Fortunately Peekay was the same as ever. I found that I was already up to page 200 and the story had berely even begun. I was bored through most of the book.Although it was brilliantly written as all Bryce Courtenay books are, I thought the plot was very unsatisfying. However, I really enjoyed Peekay's title fight and most of the other bits about Peekay. It was just Tandia who was boring and I often found myself skipping chapters.I did think that the end was fitting, it was the right way to die. If there is a sequel, I hope it turns out better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book.","review":"I hate Bryce Courtney. I hate the way he ruins a decent and heart felt book, by a second rate follow up, a marketing scheme to milk more money from poor readers who would be better off not reading his books, or getting them from the Library. I loved the Power Of One, even though I read it and this so long ago, I still remember the satisfaction of finishing it, and how warming and rich the story was. But no, Bryce couldn't leave it at that, and had to write a follow up, which was only a fifth as good as the first, thereby leaving me disliking The Power of One a little. Did this book strike anyone as a little indecent? I have no problems with sex in art, books, movies etc, but for some reason, when Bryce decribes it, it feels a little dirty. Perhaps this was the one reason I did not enjoy this book. I am sorry to burst any Bryce bubbles here, but the man is far from a genius, and is neither remotely interesting or slightly amusing. Read the Power of One, and stop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a weak sequel.","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer I didn't think that this book was weak as many follow up book often are. Perhaps it was because this didn't feel like a sequel as it picked up where 'The Power of One' left off. It is an incredibly clever book with so many threads that come together perfectly. However, I would say that it is important to read 'The Power of One' first. It is not exactly essential for the understanding of 'Tandia' but I feel you will appreciate 'Tandia' much more if you take the books in their intended order. When characters from the first book pop-up, the familiarity adds to the feeling of the reader being part of the book themselves. The ending is exactly as it should be, and remember! The best fairytale ending is the one that makes you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as its predecessor","review":"I just finished reading Tandia tonight, and, like many reviewers, was moved to tears by the ending. It left me feeling frustrated and bereft, but Bryce Courtenay deserves much kudos for a brillant, amazingly written ending which neatly fits in with old refrains from Power of One, and continues the lingering mystique of Peekay. The novel's nitty-gritty descriptions of apartheid, and the exhausting, on-going fight against it, were very informative and vivid. I loved the character of Tandia, and the way her life and struggles mirrored the spirit of Peekay's. I loved reading about Peekay's deepening emotional maturity, and his realizations about the countless nuances in the often thorny reality of race relations. Though I loved The Power of One, I love this one a little bit more, for its ability to elicit a roller coaster of emotion from this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible subtitle: The Power of Schlock","review":"It is hard to believe that this book was written by the author of The Power of One. What I'd hoped would be a fitting sequel was, as another reviewer aptly described it, \\"Harold Robbins\\"-ish. Contrived and cliche-ridden, none of the warmth and beauty of its predecessor - not quite a disaster, but not worth the agony of reading tortured descriptions such as \\"socks as white as driven snow\\" while trying to ignore the inexplicable plot devices and coincidences that moved the turgid prose to its inevitable conclusion. This book needed a judicious editor. The only reason I gave it two stars was that the historical references encouraged me to read more about apartheid and its impact on the country and its people."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"half way through the book and I think I'm going to just drop it. Bought it because I loved Power of one. But I am bored... not grabbing me and too much description of uninteresting things, at least uninteresting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable for the wrong reasons","review":"I enjoyed the Power of One and went to the trouble of getting Tandia shipped across the Atlantic to check out Courtenay's sequel -- a mistake both in terms of time and money spent. The beatification of Peekay in this second book renders him wholly un-appealing and in-human. The need of the author to stuff the book with historical context may be valued by high-school history classes but served in my eyes to completely obscure whatever flow the story might otherwise have managed. Tandia herself is poorly served not only by her fictional circumstances but also by the neglect of Courtenay who leaves her vastly under-developed. In sum - I did not enjoy my reading of the book and, even worse, was so distracted by the discomfort that the lessons to be learned from the South African situation were lost to me during the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to The Power of One","review":"This book is possibly my second favourite of all time. Second to 'The Power of One' of course. I love the way this novel tells Tandia's story and then re-introduces us to Peekay. Courtenay ingeniusly combine sthe two stories and his imagery and language are second to none. The characters in this book are perhaps even more likeable and fun to read about than in the first book. There is nothing not to like about the story of Tandia. A must read for all Peekay fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power","review":"I love to read and I have read Tndia and the Power of One and never have two books influenced me as much as these have.

I had to read it and I'm glad I did. After reading this book I realize what I knew about the apartheid in Africa was just the top of the iceberg. This book took me deep into the lives of the Africans in South Africa and what they suffered through. I just finished the book and am shocked at Courtenay's talent. He has done something most fiction authors can't ever do. He wrote a book that pulsates with emotion and truth, I felt like I was reading a biography, it was so real. This book will stick in my memory for a long time, and when it starts to fade I will read it over again, and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I loved the Power of One.

Bryce gave extremely graphic details of every event in this book, some were almost more than I could handle. He certainly makes the prejudices quite real, my heart broke a hundred times. As with The Power of One, I found myself having a hard time putting the book down each night and couldn't wait to pick it up the next day.

This movie doesn't really focus on what the Seabees did or what they went through. The vast majority of this movie focuses of John Wayne's social life (dancing & mostly uninteresting dialogue/parties), instead of Wayne actually preparing these people. There's only two relatively short war scenes (one in the middle & one at the end) & virtually no time spent showing these guys getting ready for war. Even the war scenes aren't anything great--you can tell who's going to get shot because they suddenly become unusually melodramatic & happy so you'll feel sorry for them when they die (but not much character development, so it doesn't work). As far as the quality of the DVD, it has a pretty clear picture & some interesting production notes about the real Seabees.

I won't knock John Wayne's acting, however, because he performed it as only John Wayne could. But some of the other acting was downright daffy, like when the singing Eddie Powers (William Frawley) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine. ... The Fighting Seabees wasn't a totally bad movie, and I thought the formation of the SeaBees (if this movie is accurate) was very interesting. But some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure John Wayne!!","review":"Not a lot to say, except it's the Duke at his best.

We needed some music samples, so we did some more research on the band. Even though I do not speak Spanish, music is a universal language and these guys can lay it down. Sure, it sounds like big hair 80's metal. But, it has more melody than most of today's stuff, it has a great lead guitarist (Walter Giardino) who has studied his Blackmore properly and Gabriel Marian can sing. Even though I do not speak their native tongue, I can dig the tunes and this disc is a great play. I have grown fond of it and it sits quite nicely with my Yngwie, Joe Stump and instrumental discs. It isn't computers, machines and looping. It's 'lay it down and let's rock' 80's melodies and if you don't care for the syrup, you may not go for it.

I felt as though all it really had was Bobbi talking about herself and giving simple basic steps such as \\"put on pink eyeshadow\\"...If you want to learn about makeup at more than a beginner level, this book is now right for you..There are no even close to dramatic makeup looks in this book and it highly focuses on NATURAL beauty which consists of VERY little makeup and really 3 minutes of time in order to achieve the look.

I am glad I was not the one paying retail prices for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it was I like it","review":"I got this book when I was 16 or 17 years old, and I liked it. I've never been much for fashion or glamour, but this book focused as much on looking and being healthy as it did on making your self look really done up every day. Also, the author really encourages girls to really love their individual, unique beauty, and discourages doing anything to alter the way you look naturally. I suppose I havent read many books on the subject, it may be pretty standard for these books, but it sure is a change of pace from so many other messages women and young girls are constantly bombarded with. Sometimes I still pull this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun even for over-teens","review":"I bought this book even though I am already 28 years old, because I wished I had this book when I was a teen! Bobbi is like a super cool mom. The book addresses everything, from concealing zits to when to expect your period. She writes this book in a tone for girls between 11 and 18 and there are sections that moms should read. The book is upbeat, if simple, and if I had a daughter I would certainly love to give this to her! So moms, do your daughter a favor, buy this book! I wished my mother did!This book should be required reading for teenage girls in civics, or home economics classes, in high schools everywhere.

It talks about the most important makeup tool: blush and mostly emphasized on skin care.The book is designed to make teens feel good about themselves how they are and not about how they should wear makeup. If you are a make up fanatic looking to pick up tips this is not the book for you. If you are a teenager who doesn't wear makeup, and is wondering where to start this book is good for you.

A few chapters (such as \\"Prom Beauty\\" and \\"Experimental Beauty\\") do encourage girls to have fun with makeup and trying out new looks and colors.Besides basic beauty, this book also covers topics including hair care, smelling good/bad, preteen beauty (for girls ages 10-12), mother/daughter beauty, skin care, global beauty, and many more.I would recommend this book for girls ages 12-18 who want some simple makeup tips or a confidence booster."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY DISSAPOINTING","review":"I found this book was very obvious and talkative, not very helpful.

It offered a few good tips for teenagers who are beginning to use makeup (emphasis on the \\"few\\"). However, not everyone wants the natural look, and not every teenager is a beginner. Also, Bobbi tends to overgeneralize and neglects to consider the self-esteem of those who have blonde hair and blue eyes (like me). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, even beginners.

Bobbi addresses the girls as peers, tells them to love their looks, particularly those things which make them \\"unique\\"- freckles, a strong nose, etc., and urges them to use make-up primarily as an enhancement.

Bobbi talks about make-up a whole but never explains exactly how to apply it. And Bobbi contradicts herself in areas; like proclaiming Brooke Shields and the ultimate beauty, then going on to tell us we are all beautiful and beauty comes in different shapes and sizes. She also begins many sections with \\"You want...\\" or \\"You don't want to...\\" I thought the point was for US to decide what looks work for US. The section on body image attempts to make girls of all body types feel good about themselves, explaining we can't all be as thin as women such as Courteney Cox. Yet those are the only pages in the entire book which show anyone over maybe a size 3. There are no plus sized girls featured anywhere else, only to serve as an example of what exactly plus size is.

The songs are very rhythmic with a mystical atmosphere and a very good variety of musical organs. The production is amazing and i really like the way the guitars in these songs sounds.

For me it is by far his best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"gotta be honest","review":"I've got to be honest. I love the guy, but of all his albums, this one contains the worst stuff. The best songs here are OK, and the throw-aways are worthless. On the album \\"Henry's Dream,\\" the song \\"Brother My Cup Is Empty\\" was essentially a throw-away (albeit a good one); on this album, it would lead the pack.Exception: I really got to like \\"Do You Love Me Part II\\" once I caught on to it. But the rest of this record is weak - \\"Red Right Hand\\" is kind of interesting, though.Fortunately, his albums improved a bit after this, because I think he came to terms with his mellowing nature and stopped trying to sound like a drug-addict rebel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard listen, but one worth the effort","review":"On 'Let Love In', Cave creates a pretty horrific 'anti-love' kind of mood - from the subtle cruelty of 'Nobody's Baby Now', to the demonic fury of 'Loverman', to the chilling pedophile in 'Do You Love Me (Part II)'. These are some really good songs that don't shy away from heavy themes, and in truth it is a relentlessly melancholic, violent album. The classic 'Do You Love Me' could be interpreted as the song of a brutal rapist, and the frantic 'Jangling Jack' is a pretty wrenching tale.But that doesn't mean it's a bad album; rather, it's a d**n good one. It's hard-hitting, powerful and reveals all its charms and nuances after multiple listens. Cave comes through as a master songwriter and balladeer. This is top notch work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs","review":"Oh, Nick, I thank thee for what you recorded! I'd kill for 'Loverman', 'Red right hand (this memorable bass guitar line)', 'I let love in' and 'Lay me low'. These songs are nothing very innovative but anyway precious gems not only for Cave's fans. If you didn't like 'The first born is dead' etc. you may give Nick a second chance - he's more 'edible' now, but nevertheless fantastic, and singing unforgettable things, with his dark humour, and well-known deviations. As for music, it's almost an album to be played on the radio, as for lyrics, I'd never let my little child listen to the radio if I knew Nick was there.

We've used it for our third and fourth children as well. We've had other types and they were horrible compared to this one. It's a great monitor. My favorite features are the rechargable battery (I've never had to change a battery) and the beeping when there is a low battery or the base/listening device are not on the same channel. The sound has always been great and it's nice to have the lights when there are noises as well. I highly recommend this monitor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"We're coming up on my son's 2nd birthday and the second receiver for this thing is about to die. The first died around his first birthday. I would have liked to use this monitor for a second kid, but it was just not made to last that long. It seems that the receivers are prone to shorts - we were not that rough on them as they stay in one place most of the time. I was disappointed with this product's useful lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Customer Service from Fisher Price.","review":"We have been using this monitor for 6 months now and are really pleased with it. Like some other users our sender unit failed at about 10 weeks of use without any warning and we have no idea why. However we rang Fisher Price helpline immediately and a replacement was with us in two days. We haven't had any further trouble. We live in a townhouse and have lots of neighbours with children so it is very useful to have 10 channels to choose from. There is a light indicator as well as the sound. The sound is so good that it has even picked up the TV from downstairs at times. There has been some static at times but it depends where in the house we have the receiver unit. I am slightly deaf but I can hear my son breathing on this monitor and would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance. Check Consumer Reports for Many Better.","review":"This was our first baby monitor, so if I didn't have to replace it when it stopped working after six weeks, I never would have known that there are better ones for the same price or less.Compared to the Sony we're now using, this unit had much more interference, much poorer sound and shorter battery life. Never mind that this unit just flat-out stopped working after six weeks.Check consumer report's website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Fantastic product, great range and battery life. The monitor has lasted for us from somewhere around 10-12 hours without a recharge. We've only used it for a week or two though, so as to the longevity of it we are unsure. The sensitivity is very good, in some cases too good as it picked up house noises so clear that I thought it was our daughter. Only drawback I can think of is that due to the highly sensitive nature of it you can't walk into the nursery with the monitor in hand or you'll get some serious feedback which would definitely wake up the baby. In fact with our wood floors (sound bounces a lot more than with carpet), we have to be careful with the sound even if we're several rooms away from the nursery with the monitor. But as long as you're aware of the issue, it can be avoided easily (and why would you need to take the monitor into the nursery anyways?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"This is the first monitor I've ever used, so I really didn't know what to expect...I did expect, however, that the monitor would pick up my baby's sounds throughout my not very big house (about 1500 sq ft). It doesn't. If I'm \\"too close\\" to the receiver (within 15 feet), the feedback that comes through the monitor is unbearable (a loud screeching sound) and the monitor is, as a result, useless. Worse than that, I can't get more than 25 feet away from the receiver or the reception goes out entirely. Even when the monitor is producing a useable signal, it's accompanied by a ton of static. I think I'm going to try a different brand..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price !","review":"i bought this monitor from amazon a month ago and i'm very happy with it .it has a nice reception and you will not hear noisy static like with other crappy monitors.

We've ended up buying another one from a different manufacturer. The first one had problems with the reciever. The second one would not turn on well. I would flip the switch several times before it would turn on. Then it started losing signal when we were 20 feet away. It would be fine one second and then beeping the next that it had lost reception. Now it won't even turn on. When I've called customer service they said they would send us a voucher for a new one but we've never recieved a thing from them. And that was after trying to hard to get in touch with them. My husband and I are very displeased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Electronics","review":"I've only had it 4 months and one receiver doesn't turn on and the other one turns on only after several attempts.

A winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pure Guava\\" is a ninties classic","review":"One of the more weirder albums from Ween, Pure Guava, is definitly up there with one of there best cds of all time. Timeless classics such as \\"Push Th' Little Daisies\\",\\"The Stallion (pt. 3)\\", \\"Touch My Tooter\\", and of course the prog rock specialty \\"Don't Get 2 Close (2 My Fantasy)\\". Another thing to remember about this album is that is was there final album using a four-track recorder. The same recording device was used on debut album \\"GodWeenSatan: The Oneness\\" and sophmore album \\"The Pod\\". The great thing about this album is that it is so loose and free which means it can be liked by anyone (with good taste in music). Each song is different, and the great thing about this band itself is that if you don't like one album you'll probably like the next album. Because every album of theres has a different theme. This album was very enjoyable to listen to. I Think if you are reading my review, you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lighter side of the Pod.....","review":"This album, in my opinion, was a continuation of Ween's previous album \\"The Pod\\". Just as sluggishly delerious as \\"The Pod\\" but on the ligher side. They even continue with the bizzare tale of their stallion god in the more airy version \\"The Stallion Pt 3\\". \\"Push the Little Daisies\\" had my head spinning and my lungs laughin out friggen loud while \\"Morning Glory\\" made me want to \\"....go out and laugh with the pumpkins...\\" (???) or hide under my bed in hysterics.

No","review":"Ween's clever smirking artyness sounds considerably less innovative and cerebral in large doses.

It is a tired subject. Amado's writing style is tired, this being his last \\"book\\". Bahia of today (2010) is electric with multireligions, petroleum, jeitinhos among friends and non-friends, dynamic women who serve as medical missionaries, and of course a coastal scene which rivals Recife, Rio, and southern-most Brazil. None of this emerges in the writing of Amado -- just male-female disengagement, property issues and short scenes without a plot line. The title in English sounds more Texan than the dream-style of Bahianos. I prefer his earlier novels which sealed a culture in mid-century when the lid on Brazilian people was about to explode."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a mystery...","review":"A big dissappointment too.

This is bad art, too.The photos are totally unappetizing. The design is lame. It's like a display of how horrific you can make food look. It's disgusting. I'm surprised at Charlie Palmer and Ten Speed Press. His other books and his cooking are awesome.Even if these recipes are fabulous, I'll never know it because the book is not useable -- with stark type going in many different directions on each page -- it's impossible to cook from it.Design professors!

Images of the dishes (if that's what they are since they are nearly impossible to make out) are in negative. Completely unappetizing.

Sweet house of horrors has none of the trademark Fulci gore which was quite a let down not to the mention the movie is just absolutely a waste of time. By this point in his career I think Fulci just ran out of ideas and threw this together witout much effort. Even the trademark eyeball scene was sub par at best.If you're a \\"HUGE\\" fan of Lucio Fulci and haven't seen this film I recommend strongly that you rent it first.

The Angel in the House is even better, a really remarkable CD in terms of both performance and sound. The Story were Jonatha Brooke and Jennifer Campbell, two women with marvelous voices who were able to blend them in quirky yet appealing harmonies. They often appeared as an acoustic duo, but on their recordings, they were backed up by a crack group of musicians. On The Angel in the House, there are some really effective uses of percussion, often offering surprising transitions of style. The Story were able to make music that is at the same time immediately melodic and accessible but yet full of musical twists and turns. The depth and complexity of this music demands that it be played over and over again.

Richard Cain was rumored to be involved in the CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro and he was also named as one of the mob hit men supposedly involved in the assassination of JFK. He was appointed Chief Investigator for the Cook County Sheriff's Department at the same time he was on the payroll of mob boss Sam Giancana. What is amazing is that Richard Cain's corruption was widely suspected yet it did not prevent him from moving up the ranks of law enforcement. Along the way he also found time to bug foreign embassies, pass himself off as a psychologist and become and informant for the FBI.

The Tangled Web is my first ever \\"mob book\\". The pace certainly propelled me though it fighting off sleep to do so. The author's use of crime terminology brought realism to the page. His desciptive narrative brought color to the black and white of the time period.I am a fan of murder mysteries which this was not. At times I thought the story was influenced by the fact that the author was also his brother and was \\"easy\\" on this corrupt man. Possibly he has been \\"too easy\\" on this character, Dick Cain, I thought but the last chapter changed my thinking. Dick Cain was clearly a sociopath from my perspective and they often have ingratiating personalities thus the portrayal.Michael Cain writes brilliantly particularly noting his extensively poignant vocabulary.

The buns came apart before she'd even worn it out of the house. I had to do a lot of pinning to keep it together. I ended up making her a headband with Leia buns attached because the wig was so uncomfortable, and I didn't think it would hold up for her school party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad- Wig better than expected","review":"I bought big since some mentioned that the wig and costume can run small.

It's a much better quality than I would have expected. It didn't quite cover her head entirely but luckily my daughter's hair color is almost identical to the wig so no one noticed but us. The wig kept its shape well, though I did keep the nets over the buns, which I'm sure helped. My daughter only complained about \\"itchiness\\" by the end of the day, but she'd had the wig on for about 10 hours at that point so I'm not surprised.The belt is a little disappointing...a simple white strip of fabric that you tie on, but for the money and the fact that the dress fit very well, and the quality of the wig, the belt was easy to overlook.I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wig is not usable","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. We were very disappointed by the wig which is way to small to fit over any child's head and which is definitely not the same wig as in the picture--the buns are about half the size of the photo.

A compilation of short stories by Dobyns, the title story gives us a peak into the mind of a man dealing with the same frustrations which haunt each of us. His solution is far different than what we might seek, but there is an \\"everyman\\" quality to his choice -- we WISH we could do that...The book is filled with images which will stay with you long after finishing the book -- from pigs hurling from the sky to a lovingly propped-up old dead man.

I felt a little trepidation about this but I followed the book's advice on performance anxiety and took a deep breath. When I submitted my request for the return, a box popped up and told me to simply keep the book and expect my account to be credited.

Electrical diagrams and diagnostic explanation are few and far between, and overall the book ignores or barely glazes over the details for a Geo. The title is deceptive and the \\"2-cars-for-1\\" concept is false.For a good geo metro repair manual, purchase the Chiltons 89-93 Manual. It will also cover 94 geo metros, which are identical to 93, except the half-metal bumper was replaced by a whole-rubber one.

Not only do you get a feeling for his virtuosic performance on most of the popular genres of music (rockabilly, jazz and country), but the other performers and performances are right there with him. Danny Gatton's musical gift was his ability to mix and match many musical styles (kind of like a musical Chinese menu) and make it look effortless. The musical community surely misses his great and unequaled to this day talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"I liked this book. It had good characters, a good plot, and tied all books in the My Teacher Is An Alien series together very well. However, some things were exceedingly unrealistic. A good example is the captain of the spaceship. For anyone who doesn't know, this captain is a sort of fish tank like box who can speak and think, and supposedly his species from his planet are advanced enough to join the League of Worlds. This is utterly ridiculous. The only thing that sets us humans apart from is one gesture: thumb to finger. Even if a box had a brilliant idea, he would not be able to carry it out because he would have no way to carry it out. He could not get the supplies, put them together use his invention, because he cannot grip.

All the different play-by-play announcers (ESPN, CBC, WKBD, WXYT) take their turns in cameos, and appropriate tributes are paid to Stevie's courage, Scotty's mastery and the Red Wings teamwork-in-general.

The album is blues oriented rock, so fans of Coverdale during his Whitesnake days may or may not embrace this new release, depending on individual taste. But the tracks are solid, mature and Coverdale has evolved with the times to produce a winner here. I think fans of melodic hard rock and blues oriented rock would both appreciate this newest offering. This album can potentially win Coverdale a lot of new fans as well as please his old ones with the current direction of his music. It's a solid rock album in a vein that should be appreciated by everybody.

After listening to this CD for this first time, I said to myself, \\"Good rock-n-roll is still here - thank goodness\\". That's what this CD is all about. Davids'vocals are still strong and he sounds amazing. The music is awesome. The guitars, both acoustic and electric, are dynamic and intense. Being a drummer, I really appreciate a good rhythm section. What's important to me is a strong beat. The \\"snap\\" of a snare drum and a booming bass guitar.

The production on the album is incredibly wack and is the album's biggest weakpoint. Tash's rapping on the other hand is superb and he comes up with sick one-liners that make you hit the rewind button. GZ is GZ with Kurupt is a classic song. The Game featuiring Carl Thomas is also a great track that utilizes a slinky laid back beat and has Tash ripping the mic. Smokefest 1999 featuring Outkast and B-Real is yet another one of the standouts. The beat is thick like the smoke they are inhaling and lazy sounding on this song. Uh lets see couple other good tracks here and there but none worth mentioning. Also the skits are more than just stupid. The album's production is the main flaw, and even Tash's unstoppable flow and potent lyrics can't save it.

TASH has been the only person I know of to sound better solo than he did with his crew. His metaphors and similies when he is rapping are out of this world. He is the metamorphisis of what Rakim used to be. His style is the bomb and he will never get old. His desciptions of what he is like and what he does can make an average rap lover, go gangsta in a second.

Kept the temperature very stable for 3 weeks, at which time it became erratic, heating and then instantly flashing fast that the tank was too hot. Then it would shut off, flash that the tank was too cold, come back on, etc. This would all take place in a span of about 10 minutes. Obviously they have a problem with the thermostat as I have now read other sites with comments that are very similar.

Kept Tomtom and returned 3100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, a bit sluggish with WinCE","review":"The features of this little unit are great; the voice commands, the auto rerouting, the cheerful graphics. You get the mounting bracket and power supply too. The only downside is that it is running WinCE, which makes the operating system bloated and thus it tends to slow down every once in a while, especially on power-up. It can take 20-30 seconds for the screen to respond to a button press. But once it is \\"warmed-up\\" it operates fine. My guess is that the microprocessor they are using is a little underpowered to do the graphics and the satellite management. I'd recommend it anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy a competing product. My Magellan 3100 arrived from Amazon and worked for a few months but it wouldnt shut down when the motor was turned off. I have been trying to get it either repaired or replaced since I purchased it back in december. Its incredibly complicated just to get the request to them, they want everything but your Dog's name. They have had this information for literally weeks and all I want is a return authorization which they said I needed. I got one email saying they were going to make my request a priority then nothing. I cant even get the return authorization for them to look at it much less the actual repair. Do yourself a favor and get a Tom Tom or something. This company doesnt care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This is a great GPS for the price.

I live in the Raleigh, NC area and found the map to be way out of date. Build date for map is 3rd quarter 2006. There are main roads and an interstate MISSING from their map. I contacted their customer support and was told they do not have an updated map and do not plan to release one for the 3100. They said it was a cheaper gps and they were not updating them with new maps. What is the point of buying a gps with out-of-date maps? The support rep said she did not understand my complaint because I got this unit for less than half the original list price. It does not matter if I got it for free, it should have an up-to-date map or have updates availible for it. DO NOT BUY THIS GPS. TRY SOMEONE ELSE LIKE GARMIN OR TOMTOM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not be happier!","review":"I love myMagellan Maestro 3100 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator! I first took it out of the box at my sister's house and she had just moved. I was literally able to turn it on and enter my home address within 5 minutes. I also chose the \\"least use of freeways\\" route for the heck of it and totally enjoyed the back country roads we went over to get home; I saw places I never would have seen otherwise, and thoroughly enjoyed not having to try to read a map at every stop sign or fork in the road. It was created by the same folks who created Hertz \\"Neverlost\\", which is in many of their rental cars. It's intuitive and fun to use. I especially like being able to go someplace new after dark and not have to try to read directions in the dark, particually when I'm alone. If you ever go anywhere you've never been before, even if you can read a map upside down and backwards, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magellan Maestro 3100","review":"I love this item.

The 3100 is ready to go right out of the box, has a sensitive receiver, and ALL of its menus and features are intuitive. The display and maps are simple, yet clear, easy to work with quickly, and purposeful. There is no mess and using the unit doesn't require much toil and handling. Reroutes are fast, and instructions and tones are kept to a peaceful minimum.One negative is that the unit comes with a car charger only, and does not charge via the USB port."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"My wife caught this for a very good price. Even at the price tage of 150 bucks you can't go wrong. Download the update as soon as you get it and your set. I saw some people say it was short on the POI's and the update takes forever.

I don't think there is a better bang for the buck than this lil gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"The Magellan Maestro 3100 is a great starter for gps. It's maps are clear and navigates well on most major streets. The only problem I have encountered is with new streets ( 3 yrs or less ) not being updated in the system. Especially in a city like Dallas, where new roads and neighborhoods are constantly growing, I would have expected more updates, at least up to a year ago. Otherwise, for more established areas, this machine is really great. It lets you know when to get into the left or right lanes ahead of time before a highway splits.

It got me where I needed to go with few problems. Unfortunately about 45 days later it stopped charging. I don't know if it was a problem with the unit itself or if the cable wasn't making a solid connection. Luckily I had purchased a two year warranty, not something I usually do, but thankfully this time I did. They were completely out of the Magellans, and so they offered me a Garmin Nuvi-hopefully it won't break after a month and a half.

It has worked flawlessly for me so far and never failed to guide me to my destination. It has a split screen that comes on well before your turns, which guides you since one side of the screen is for the turn and a voice alert telling you beforehand when a turn is coming up.Yes you could get a GPS with a bigger screen, more options and it might even play videos, but for the bucks that this cost, I just have to rate it as a best buy.Kenhttp://aboutfacts.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS Navigator","review":"As the saying goes, \\"You get what you pay for\\".

The photographs are often out of focus and the colours are poorly produced. The brief plant descriptions are separated from the photographs and are not overly helpful. The book may be useful to the less ardent gardeners of the world but given the hefty price tag, I would spend my money elsewhere.

Good luck with yours!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed Reviews are Positive","review":"Check out both extremetech.com and anandtech.com for very detailed reviews of the 30\\" version of this set. Both reviews highly recommend the 30\\" set."},{"rating":"2","title":"20\\"- For small rooms and aspirations","review":"I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable. But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms. The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark. A 20\\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation. There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set. I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This is the best device I have bought for at least a couple decades. I am a degreed engineer, and I love gadgets. Just the best. I have had it about 3 months, and I love it. Attractive base, all the connections, removable speakers, picture quality is among the best LCD that I have viewed. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a short lifespan","review":"This Tv worked great for a year and a half. It progressively started going black, and recently went completely black. While you can hear the audio the picture is gone, no picture, not even on. Very disappointing. So to all of you gushing over this tv right now, be afraid, be very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"Price was very good ($389), good features, but doesn't deliver on image.The screen has a film across it, causing unacceptable light reflections and a bit of wavy distortion. It states HDTV ready, but when hooking up to my HDTV tuner using component cables, I could not get the TV to synchronize on the 480p signal (it displayed two images - side by side). Forget about 720p or 1080i - no image at all. Picture from satellite using S-video connector was not impressive. This unit is going back (even my non-techno wife complained about it). By comparision, I do like my Sony 50\\" HDTV LCD rear projection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Olevia!!","review":"I purchased this TV in August 2006, and it quit working around March 2008. (less than 15 months!) Apparently Olevia utilizes the substandard Darfon V144 back light inverter board.When the board goes, so does the TV. Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $200. But why invest that amount, when you can add another $200, and purchase a new and better TV.I'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand. I guess that's why you see so many of them for sale online. And their either refurbished or open box. I'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability.Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Samsung or RCA product. Trust me; being cheap in the beginning, is really not worth it in the end. I learned the hard way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced TV","review":"I use this display in my line of work. The quality is generally above average if not that great. The color is not as bright or vivid but the ability to receive and play HD programs does let one peek into the future of digital programmings and that itself is an enjoyable experience.The LT30HV has considerable weakness in the DVI mode, often the display will exhibit no picture or incorrect color scheme, 6 months to a year after opening the box. For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen. This slight discoloration can take the fun out of having the LCD TV.For the price advertised here, it is definately not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with remote control","review":"just bought 27\\" syntax olevia. the picture quality is good. however, i have the infamous remote control problem that many 27 and 30\\" models seem to have. the remote only works from 2 feet. needless to say it was not what i expected. i'll try contacting their support and have it fixed and post an update."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"viewing angle is terrible and there is a DOT ON THE SCREEN THAT IS VERY DISTRACTING. do not get this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely Advertised to Have High Definition Resolution","review":"I was duped into buying this tv by the clearly false claim on the Amazon product description that it is \\"HDTV Ready\\". After plugging it in, I was surprised by the lack of resolution, and after investigating, realized that HDTV is defined as having a resolution 720p and above. This tv only supports a resolution of 480p, the same as an analog set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Clarity and Bad remote","review":"Read the reviews before you buy this. The tv DOES have a horrible problem with the remote. I tried standing two feet back, didn't work. You must place the remote less then 1 foot away for it to be used.The picture on my 25\\" tv that is 8 years old is better than this piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Don't be frugal like me and think you can get a deal on this thing because you're better off buying something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"HD ready means HD ONLY--not basic cable","review":"I was so excited to get my first flat screen tv; I have been nothing but dissapointed since then. What they don't tell you ahead of time is that the quality of the image is only good if you have HD. I called syntax customer service, and they said it would only get better if I got HD, or digital at the least, so they couldn't help me. Not only that, but Amazon.com would not accept a return since the TV was 30\\". Make sure you research this very thoroughly before you purchase it. I didn't, and I regret it. I hope this warning helps those of you with basic cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but can't watch tv","review":"check online forums..I am among the manyOlevia owners who find the picture justfine until the screen goes black..its notworth plugging/unplugging (over and over)..inexpensive but never again and techsupport ranges from unavailable (phone systemproblems) to \\"sorry..you're on your own\\".

There is no blurring, pixiling. just a crisp all around image that looks great with my PS3!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I am very happy with this 20\\" LCD TV. The picture is excellent, the sound is good and it can be used as a computer monitor-all for under $400! If you want all the bells and whistles, then by all means, pay two to three hundred dollars more. If not, then this is a terrific TV for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of useful technical support","review":"Problem was that the component video input (YPP) was non functional. I did not find it possible to contact a real person at technical support and the \\"phone tree\\" menu is impenetrable, probably by design. The email input option for requests resulted in an insulting,lame response to the effect \\"If you connected your tuner to the YPP input, it should work.\\" I would not have requested assistance if it had worked! The component video output from the same tuner works fine with another HDTV I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased customer","review":"I did lots of research as to what type of TV (plasma, rear projection, etc)is best in the HDTV world. For the space in my house, I needed a TV less than 40 inches so was fairly limited b/w smaller Plasmas and larger LCD's.I looked at the Sharp, but was willing to go with the Olevia due to the # of favorable user reviews I found. There are a couple of 'expert reviews' that don't recommend Olevia (Cnet), but there were some very favorable recommendations (extremetech http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1642839,00.asp gave it an 8/10)I received the TV in fine shape - excellent packing. I was shocked to have it up and running within 5 minutes and looking great - I expected it would take much longer. I had Comcast upgrade to the HD service and Hi-def looks awesome on the TV. The old analog channels are passable, not great...but I'm hoping most the programming will move hi-def.Hope this helps in your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable and Customer Service is Poor","review":"Everything your read about the picture quality is true... however, this product just isn't reliable. Cost me another $600 to get it fixed and it isn't even 18 months old. I am sure I am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues. Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed. I think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for a computer @ 720P with ATI video card","review":"I bought this for a computer monitor/ entertainment system. With ATI AIW 9800 pro video card. Before hooking up the tv just go into control panel and advanced monitor settings: and pick the troubleshooting screen (its in there) then check the \\"force 720p\\" checkbox. its that easy resolution will be 1280 X 768. Gaming on this screen is excellent with no classic lcd problems. I would definately use the DVI cable though as the vga cable has slight image ghosting due to RF interference. The tv tuner is basic and the picture is mediocre but if you're just using it for digital media like me ... an excellent choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A $1200 LCD TV","review":"I too have experienced what Gary Bergman has described in his review. On Occassion, my Syntax LT30HV's screen goes black. I simply unplug it for a few seconds, plug it back in and the picture re-appears. But I can't complain, this TV cost $1000 less than a major brand. Todays price is even better. Makes a good TV for the kids room.James Dorsey, I too have not received my $100 rebate either. The manufature online rebate status has no record of my rebate.Amazon should look into this since they sold and promoted the rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU WILL REGRET BUYING THIS TV","review":"I bought this tv to surprise my husaband when he returned from the Middle East. We had it 2 years. It now goes black all the time. I'm a Television Consumer reporter and would never recommend this TV. It didn't have that many bad reviews two years ago, but it does now. Do Not Buy This TV! Read the reviews. Works for awhile and then goes black. Invest in something better. It will eventually break on you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really disappointing","review":"I bought the TV from CompUSA for 699 (after MIR).I got the product home and since I did not have a HD reception I connected it to my DVD player. Since it was DVD and I know the resolution difference between the DVD and HD, the quality was acceptable.Now that I have HD reception from my cable provider (Comcast), I find that the quality of DVD and the HD channels that I see now, is almost identical.Since one would buy the HDTV for picture quality, if the difference is not significant, then spending the money over such a product in my understanding is useless.I would discourage anybody thinking about this TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not call it TV","review":"Just received it from UPS and found out it does not have CATV input.

After about 8 or 9 months I would continually lose the picture. After several discussions with Customer Service (they had me try various things to correct the problem), they decided to ship me a new TV. I received it in early October, 2005 & everything was fine - at first. About 10 months later, the set started going black after it was first turned on & I had to turn it off & then on again. Over the course of the next couple of months, this problem got progressively worse. Now, I sometimes have to turn it off & on 10 to 20 times before it will stay on. So, I have had two sets -- neither of which worked a full year. Also, I found out that the second set that was sent to me was a refurbished set. I have spoken with technical support and customer service on many occasions but they refuse to do anything about it because it is \\"out of warranty\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't do much better for the price","review":"I've had this unit for about a year and have been generally satisfied with the unit. I use it as a TV and PC using a TV card. The display is quite bright and the colors are vivid. The only technical problem I've had has been with red static, which I think is my video card more than the TV. However it's easily corrected by changing the color depth lower and then changing it back. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Olevia, despite not being a major brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great.","review":"Do NOT buy this unit for your bedroom; the blue off-light is brightenough to read by so, instead of simply turning the set off from bed, I then have to get up and block the light.

Using it in the master bedroom, the 30\\" size is just right.Especially using a DVD player and hooking up your computer produces exceptional results.

Syntax Olevia just has a horrible custome service problem. The set ran fine for two years, then one evening would not come on. The screen turned blue then black. I could get sound but no picture. Tried the companys web site (24 hour response promised, No response after a week). The next day I called customer service and was told the nearest repair facility is in Canada, and it would cost more to fix than a new set. Have a nice day. I woud stay very far away from anything this company makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUT........","review":"When i bought this cd, i had high hopes for it. After playing it several times, i realized that it was not the cd for me. It had some good songs, but not enough of them. It had a few outstanding arrangements. This cd could have been better with more selective song selection and better arranging. Maybe in the future we can have some of both. I love you Michael, but this cd doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great lesser known band from the 40's","review":"Bobby Sherwood was never a \\"name\\" band in the sense that Miller, Shaw, and the Dorseys were, but his was a really original outfit with great arrangements and soloists...amongst which Sherwood on guitar was a noticeable contributor(listen to 'Swingin at the Semloh' for a truly original acoustic intro). The later tracks have that great sax section sound, and the attack and drive on numbers like 'Poor Little Rich Girl' is up to the best standards of big band performance on record. He later appeared in films, but the recorded legacy of his 40s' band is fortunately with us for posterity.

I have suffered with migraine headaches for years. And I usually make two different dinners each meal--one for my family and one for me. I was hoping to find some recipes I could make that everyone would be able to eat. This book starts out identifying foods that possibly \\"trigger\\" headaches, ie., citrus, broadbeans, raw onions, caffeine, etc. You are then informed to avoid these foods. Then the authors print out recipes THAT HAVE THESE SAME FOODS AS MAIN INGREDIENTS!What a waste of my money this book was. I am disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! This book has been needed for a long time!","review":"This book explains in simple language how the selection of foods can help avoid migraine headaches. Most books describe how migraines begin, but this book goes to that next, most important step...what you can do about it! So many migraines begin with foods that \\"trigger\\" the onset of the migraine. This book provides lists of all the foods to avoid, and helps you eliminate the ones that are a personal \\"trigger\\" for each individual. It's easy to figure out what not to eat, and through choosing from all the recipes, grocery store shopping lists, charts, etc., it's such a relief to know WHAT to do, finally!Anyone who suffers from migraines should have this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book thinking I would be getting more of a variety of meals to help prevent migraines and better planning of meals. What I found in my opinion was a lot of receipies with questionable migraine-triggering ingredients. There were VERY few recipes using just the \\"foods allowed\\" section. I found about 10 without any yeast, vinegar or other questionable items such as canned or jar ingredients. When you are at the elimination diet stage after being first diagnosed with migraines, this is the diet you need most. At my next Dr. appointment, I plan on bringing in the book to get his opinion.

No food has ever been demonstrated to cause, promote, precipitate (\\"trigger\\") or aggravate migraine. Beyond a placebo effect, dietary restriction is ineffective as a treatment for headache. (The exceptions are foods containing caffeine or alcohol, both of which are more properly regarded as drugs.)
