I had known that Taylor was famous for his time study techniques, what I didn't know was that he may have been partially or indirectly responsible for the advent and/or need for the human resources profession as well. He also had some involvement in cost accounting as it relates to calculating overhead rates for which I will be eternally disappointed in him for.

It was not only repetitive, but unnecessarily florid, slow, and melodramatic. Here is a sample:\\"Gradually she realised that her life, her freedom, was sinking under the silent grip of his physical will. He wanted her in his power. He wanted to devour her at leisure, to have her. At length she realised that her sleep was a long ache and a weariness and exhaustion, because of his will fastened upon her, as he lay there beside her, during the night. She realised it all, and there came a momentous pause, a pause in her swift running, a moment's suspension in her life, when she was lost.\\"And it goes on and on and on like this, unto the third generation. No doubt all this purple prose was extremely erotic in its day, but none of these characters seem at all real to me, and there is no plot to make up for the lack.

The Rainbow is a book that is simply TOO stuffed with Freudian thought, and simply TOO concerned with implied incest and the kind of base themes a perverted teen could think of in under ten minutes.

While it's hard to hate the Ellington band, especially during the period of 1957-59, when it was stuffed with talented soloists and Duke was clearly feeling inspired, this album of charts put together solely to evoke excitement among big, unsophisticated festival crowds comes across as just that: over-the-top, shrill and, ultimately, rather exhausting. Sure, there's some exciting playing here, particularly from Clark Terry and Paul Gonsalves, but it's all in the \\"more-is-more\\" mode. After a decent rendition of \\"Perdido\\", it quickly wears out its welcome. I mean, who buys an Ellington album to hear an extended drum battle between two drum kits? Yikes. Best Duke studio album of this period is still probably Blues in Orbit, and best live recording is perhaps the At the Blue Note set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book is very well written and interesting, discussing neuropharmocology from molecular, cellular, and biochemical bases as well as physiologically and socially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Great review of neuroscience from the pharmacological viewpoint.

David Fincher is once again in top form as he meticulously recreates the era when the Zodiac killer was haunting the Bay Area. Great performances by the actors throughout the film and the story is very involving even for those who know it well. If you are looking for car chases and shootouts this is not the film for you. This is a psychological thriller that follows the investigation of the infamous killer. The special edition has several very in depth docs about the case that the bare bones initial DVD did not have. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in top notch suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zodiac","review":"In the late 1960's, the Zodiac killer terrorized Northern California. Investigating the murders were detectives Dave Roschi (Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Edwards). Reporting on the murders in the press were Paul Avery (Downey) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal). In fact, the movie is based on Graysmith's book and the obsession he developd in trying to find the Zodiac's identity. As such, the \\"solution\\" provided has not been proven, but is the belief of Graysmith.\\"Zodiac\\" is an interesting and well made movie. Fincher's direction is not a showy as his previous efforts, but keeps the tension high when necessary and interjects small moments of humor to lighten the mood when necessary. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Downey, and Edwards are all very good in their roles, and Lynch is suitably creepy for most of his screen time. \\"Zodiac\\" may move too slowly for some in its last half, but those that want a peek into the hunt for a serial killer will not be disappointed. I highly recommend \\"Zodiac\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Poor Unbox Video Quality","review":"The movie itself was very good.

While I know the video quality isn't going to be DVD quality, there's not a lot of fast action or motion, ALL of the motion in this movie had a blurred, staggered effect that actually hurt my eyes and made me feel a little nauseous.I recommend watching this movie, but watch the actual DVD and skip the Unbox download."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD review","review":"This was a wonderfully acted and directed movie.

Serial killers, interesting as they are in reality, do not make for successful film making. It gets a bit tedious and one dimmensional after you realize things are going nowhere. That 4 or 5 year interval gives the actor a chance to over act and over re-act and the audience a chance to get a beer.Terrific cinematography as always from Fincher. Great music track. No 'Seven' no 'Manhunter' but it wanted to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and suspenseful.","review":"This is an excellent movie about a complicated and difficult case, told partially from the perspective of a young newspaper cartoonist who becomes fascinated with the case, which is based on the real life author of the book of the same title:Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed. The recreations of the killings themselves are chilling and extremely well done, and the times are places captured perfectly. All the details of this long and complex case are well presented, and the gradual focus on the most likely suspect is well presented, as is the missteps and failures of law enforcement to collaborate effectively. A thoroughly enjoyable crime drama. The extra features are quite interesting too, including documentary interviews with some of the major players as well as one of the victims who survived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very interesting look into the history of the past","review":"This movie accurately depicts the efforts of the SFPD and many other police agencies went through during the lengthy investigation that, sadly, didn't end with the capture of the killer. To this day the killers identity remains unknown, however, this movie recognizes the efforts of a few key people (Robert Graysmith,Paul Allen,David Toschi, and many others.) Without them the investigation wouldn't have even gotten as far as it did.Though this movie might seem long it sure is worth the wait.If you are a fan of history chances are you will like this movie.Plus this movie is not expensive, I tracked a copy down in a local video store for $4 new.Happy hunting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!

The DC apparently will be released next year and will include not only extended material but also a huge amount of special features!!! What a hoax! I could hear, feel and see the publishers laughing in my face!! I was so disappointed, that I really needed to decide if I should even watch the movie... Of course I did and I was not disappointed by the movie itself! Truly a great suspense movie, great acting, straight forward and in your face! Brilliant!

Excellent performances by all cast members, but Mark Ruffalo was exemplary, and \\"owned\\" it. RDJ was also very good, but Ruffalo was on point in this one.Zodiac is the story of the 1970s serial killer who thrived off of eluding police and journalists with his cryptic, dark messages. Each character who gets involved in the Zodiac's web suffers in some way, and watching how Zodiac affects the lives of each character is painful to see. Definitely a must see, if nothing else for the excellent character study and nail-biting thrill rides throughout the time period of the Zodiac's horrifying reign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I missed this in theaters, but this dvd is well worth watching for its procedural approach to a famous case I knew nothing about. The performances are first-rate, but the sound is a little muddled. The period soundtrack is cool.

Like the numerous details that Fincher incorporates in the film to keep on your toes, the HD DVD version boast almost 3-D like realism and I'm sure the Blu-Ray version is the same except that it does cost considerably more than $8!! Don't be put off by the length of this film, you surely will not be bored and there are several frightful moments in this docu-drama that will surely make you jump. Compared to the trashy slasher movies that are coming out of Hollywood, this film is a true original in its own low-keyed way--it grips you and won't let go.

And like the case, the movie is left open for discussion but not so much that it leaves the viewer disappointed. Great acting, beautiful cinematography (it really helps that the movie crew used natural light to set the moods of the scenes), and a well written script, I would highly recommend this movie but continue to tell people that they had better be ready for a long evening. If you go to see this be sure to ask yourself one question, \\"If this came as previously planned (in time for the 2006 Oscars), would it be better than The Departed?\\" I was asked that coming out of this movie and I'll leave you all with your own answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another DVD double dip!","review":"There is a 2-disc director's cut coming out in early 2008.

Furthermore, the woman who played Gyllenhaal's wife was creepier than the alleged \\"Zodiac Killer\\" himself. Robert Downey Jr. was the only redeeming quality about this film. Yes, Downey Jr. and the case the DVD came in with several misprints, the credits to Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" and the credits to \\"Music & Lyrics\\". HMM-the case itself was more intriguing than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Boring...","review":"...the two deadliest sins of movie making. After reading the reviews I had really high hopes. Man, were they ever dashed! Forty-five minutes or so into the flick I didn't care what happened. I was actually thinking of walking out. An hour later I was kicking myself for not acting on my instinct. IMHO this movie stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This flick is just gosh awful! I had such high hopes for it, given thecast, but the film is totally sabotaged by poor direction.R. Downey Jr. mumbles nearly all of his lines with a cigarette in his mouth, so don't count on understanding him. Other characters rival hismumbling as well. The film is too long, should have been edited down to2 hrs max. Too many subtitles are so miniscule as to be illegible most of the time. And the lighting? Just awful. Too bad this work which had potential is such a failure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This is perhaps the worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure to watch. The script is erratic, if indeed this monstrosity was filmed using a script. For example, there appear to be two, mutually exclusive, endings to the film. One is left wondering why the first is included. Also, the film seemingly never ends -- it wanders aimlessly for hours.The quality of the cinematography is terrible. The camera is more often out of focus than in. The color is terrible and the sound simply is not there.Save your money, time and sanity. Just say no."},{"rating":"2","title":"The farthest thing from boring","review":"It was done really well and really captures you the whole way through but you must remember that it's a true story so it's still guessing on some things... and that's all i'll say about that haha. DEFINITELY worth seeing. It's the type of scary movie that doesn't have one \\"cheap\\" scare, if you know what I mean.Some of the one liners are so great (robert downy jr especially) which was a surprise to me-- and the more times you see it the more you appreciate it. Really an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Depiction of Haunting True Events","review":"David Fincher did a fine job with his portrayal of the serial killer \\"the Zodiac\\" in this film. After researching this story extensively this movie really rang true and depicted the events in an authentic and true fashion. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a really good performance as the lead and Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo both give fine supporting performances. I think there was less hype about this movie and it was underrated because young people were probably expecting something graphic like SE7EN, when this is a more in depth unfolding of a story than a blood and guts movie. In any event it is a commonly overlooked film that is extremely well made and it will have you engaged from start to finish with twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 hours!...NEVER LOST MY ATTENTION.......","review":"Any time a three hour film holds my attention,somebody did something right!!!ZODIAC never lets up.It is so chock-full of info and police leads and dead ends that the viewer is actually actively examing ALL of the evidence attempting to make an arrest! NOW THAT IS INTERESTING.What's great about this \\"whodunnit\\" thriller is.....WE DON'T KNOW.You could watch this film several times still trying to piece together the profile and actions of the Zodiac killer, and may come out with a different solution each time.It is so good to see the enigmatic Robert Downey,Jr.,again, so brilliantly portraying journalist Paul Avery.This really is a well researched and complex film delivered with much integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe we have our man","review":"The feature on the disc is the most compelling story yet told of the Zodiac case. I love the point of view that the story is told from, that of the detectives that were unlucky enough to have worked the case and how these murders changed their lives and the lives of that part of the country.Even more compelling are the supplemental features which include interviews with not only some of the real life law enforcement and ancillary personnel involved with the case, but two of the surviving victims. Watching these videos and hearing the often contradictory statements leaves no wonder why the case remains unsolved.If you have any interest in this genre of film, you owe it to yourself to pick this up pronto. I'd highly recommend the HD-DVD version which I own and consider to be the superior version, but we all know why I can't do that :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zodiac DVD ...a classic","review":"A great movie with plenty of suspence and drama. The attention to detail and the brilliant indvidual acting performances make this a joy to watch. The special features too are excellent with extensive interviews from the real police and detectives as well as survivors make this special edition a must-have item for anyone who loves movies. At such a lengthy running time it zips by without you even noticing and this reviewer has watched it a number of times already since its release last year. Overall David Fincher has created a gem, easily his best work to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Future Double Dip","review":"This is a fantastic movie, but I thought it'd be useful to post this information for those who didn't know. If you enjoy this film, just like Fincher's other movies (\\"Fight Club\\", \\"Se7en\\"), there is going to be a Special Edition release of this DVD. In 2008 there will be a release with multiple commentary tracks and loads of extras. This release here is the \\"bare bones\\" version. If that's all you need, then fine. But for those who don't want to get ripped-off buying the same thing twice; it's probably worth waiting for the 2008 disc. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film but dont buy this version!!!","review":"Dont buy this DVD. Not yet anyway. This is a lame bare bones edition rushed out too fast. There will be a special edition with Finchers Directors cut, commentaries and a full documentary on the case released later this year or early next. Great film but they will double dip ya so wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Digital Transfer!","review":"I was surprised by the poor image quality on this DVD. There are constant digital artifacts, and the darker the lighting of a scene, the more the artifacts are evident. If I had seen this film without knowing the source was a DVD, I would have thought it was a mediocre cable transmission. I am not a digital video expert, but the artifacts seem to result more from digital noise reduction than from compression, at least as I understand the effects. In any case, the unstable, wavy, and smeary images really sap the energy of the film. (This refers to the regular DVD version, not to the HD DVD version, which I haven't seen.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FRILLS DVD","review":"The film is fantastic--I'd argue Fincher's best--but fans might want to wait for the deluxe edition DVD that is coming out after the new year featuring the director's cut of the film and hours of special features.

I have a 5 pound Yorkie who is only trained to the pad - we adopted her that way and it works out nicely so we don't have to plan our activities around someone dashing home to let the dog out to go potty. There are other kinds by this company but they leak; so do all the other brands we've tried. The key here is to make sure the package says \\"Ultra Thin\\" and they are as thin as paper but hold more than a day's worth of pee (who knew a little dog could have so much pee!!!). They must have some sort of scent, because she found and used it right away once we switched from the leaky kind (though we did have it in the same spot). I thought it seemed gross at first to have a dog potty in the house, but it's just like the concept of a cat using a litter box, and dog pee doesn't have that strong ammonia odor like cat urine does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack to the bone","review":"This album makes no sense at all.

Rent before you purchase it for your vampire movie collection. Grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother, where art thou!","review":"This is a visually stylish movie that puts an interesting spin on the vampire myth. Unfortunately this new mythology is underused and this is, in effect, just another 'hunt the monster' movie. In this respect it is moderately successful but suffers a couple of major flaws. Neither Scott nor Burrows have been suitably cast. Both are talented actors but neither is able to bring their derivative characters to life, despite their best efforts. Scott is forced to recite some woefully portentous, painfully enunciated dialogue, and Burrows has to perform a stereotypical hard-nosed but damaged cop routine. Ally this with a rather predictable plot and the whole thing is bit of a let down. On a brighter note, the ending blatantly paves the way for a sequel.

It's one of those you have to be in the right mood for. It goes something like this: a team of commandoes, led by Jimmy Wang Yu, must rescue the allied generals (including the American commander Abraham Lincoln) from the Japanese during World War II. Wang Yu was selected for the mission because James Bond, Baldy, Snake Plissken, and Rocky were all busy. Along the way, our heroes encounter flying amazon women and a haunted house before doing battle with the Chevy driving Japanese Nazis. Yep..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most garbled plots ever","review":"It is really hard to describe this film.The movie starts out with a group of generals (one of them named \\"Abraham Lincoln\\") in Civil War era army outfits in the middle of Canada being attacked by the Chinese sometime around World War II.It goes downhill from there.The plot is a bunch of unrelated scenes held together by the pretense of rescuing the generals from the Chinese. (And barely at that.) It is as if someone had grabbed scenes from a bunch of different films at random and filmed them. (Which may actually be true, from what I have read about the film.)Jackie Chan is in the beginning and end of the film. The rest is left up to a cast of relative unknowns.The DVD is not the greatest quality. It is a pretty cheesy movie.

I had first purchased a Bachmann controller, and although it worked well, I really wanted something with more options and that could be used with a wider variety of track more easily (the Bachmann had a specialized plug that really only lent itself to being used with E-Z track). The Tech 4 260 works like a charm. The momentum feature is truly cool - It adds such a sense of realism to be able to watch your train speed up and slow down like a real one would do. The brake, on-off switch, and other features also are fantastic. It connects to your track through the use of two input screws in the back (you place your connector under the screw and tighten it down, like most electrical items). It also has a spot on the back for accessories as well. All in all, worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usage","review":"I found that the controller was very useful and had the features that I need.

It is disgraceful he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Gene Hackman too shines bright as do, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, Marlon Brando, Marc McClure, etc.The special effects still hold up and are still breath taking when seen. No wonder they won an Academy Award for Visual Effects. The best part of the DVD are the two versions of the film we are given. Disc One features the Theatrical Version while Disc Two features the 2000 Extended Edition.

The music only option works for the title sequence and hearing the extra tracks on Side B adds to the genius that was John Williams soundtrack.The audio is remastered and put on a surround sound system instead of the setup I have at home would shake your house to the core. The extra scenes were a good touch as well. Behind the scenes added the great touch of mystique that was Superman. Having Marc McClure host the BTS stuff added a bit of credibility.Until Spider-Man last year and Batman in 1989, this was the film on which Superheroes were judged. The Hulk disappointed and Daredevil and X-2 were moderate hits.Superman still stands the test of time, no matter what your views."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame","review":"This comment is aimed at the Studio/distributor, i.e. Warner.Why oh why do you encourage consumers to buy only half finished products. It is not as if this film is a recent blockbuster, but it was at the time a great film and even more so when you consider that it\`s sequel was even better. Together Superman I and II were excellent pieces of entertainment. Forget III and Quest for Peace (not bad but nowhere near the same calibre). I along with many others would have thought that the first 2 in the series should have both been re-mastered etc. All I can imagine is that Superman II will be re-mastered due to public demand, then those poor consumers who bought the box set will be agrieved. This happened with Laserdiscs and also with DVDs (re-Kubrick). Greedy Studio is all I can say of Warner. Unless Warner announce a re-mastered Superman II, I will not waste my money as I consider the 2 films to be combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great package","review":"Got this four disk set on Amazon at a great sale price, so it was a bargain.

From beginning to end the attention to detail and editing are superb, with excellent direction by Richard Donner. However, the stars of the show are Christopher Reeve and John Williams, whose score is perfect and which will always remain a classic. A DVD release will really showcase this stunning film and I hope that Warner Bros. have a release in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time","review":"Christopher Reeve made me believe a man could fly. This is probably the most anticipated DVD for me since I started my collection. The story of Superman, masterfully directed by Richard Donner, restored to its original glory and with additional scenes, more of the beautiful John Williams soundtrack and commentary is a comic book fan's wet dream - the story of Kal-El, the last son of Krypton, journeying to Earth from a dying world and gifted with powers and abilitiies far beyond mortal men.Batman, X-Men, Blade, Spider-Man... *this* is the standard all the rest have to measure up to. Even though III and IV were mediocre to stunningly bad, this movie and the sequel (filmed back to back) were top notch. I can't wait for Superman II to be released in the same manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical plot spoils Superman The Movie.","review":"I remember going to see this movie in 1978.You could feel the anticipation and excitement in the audience just before the first flying scene.You can believe a man can fly,but can you believe the illogical plot?Lex Luther(Gene Hackman)is going to create new beachfront property by separating California from the rest of the USA with nuclear weapons and Superman reverses time by reversing the rotation of the Earth(come again??).This movie has superb production values and good performances,but is let down by a ridiculous and campy plot and villian.If it had stuck to a serious plot,like Star Wars,it would have done much better.An over-rated film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for an older film","review":"I remember superman since I was a kid.

I was not disappointed. For a film of its time, I think it looks fantastic in HD.It will not have the clarity and sharpness of today's HD films, but seriously this movie is as old as I am, and back then a Sony Trinitron was the best you could have.I think its worth the money and definitely worth having in your HD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fast","review":"I received my movie weeks before the expected delivery date.

Christopher Reeve was the perfect choice for the part of the handsome young man from the planet Krypton. Reeve was virtually unknown at the time but producer Alexander Salkind and director Richard Donner took a chance that his looks would overshadow any potential lack in acting ability. Boy did they make the right choice and yes he can act too!Surrounded by a stellar cast and a big budget to boot this film defined the process of how to translate a comic book superhero into a highly successful film.A true classic in the genre of superhero movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's SUPER, man","review":"Rather than a critique of the movie, which is fairly entertaining, but has some flaws, this review is based mostly on the quality of the DVD. Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Ned Beatty are enjoyable in this film, and worth watching.Surprisingly clean, the careful transfer of this 23 year-old film to DVD is a lovely sight. The Dolby 5.1 audio track sings, and the music of John Williams, featured by itself on one of the audio tracks, is as powerful as the main character.There are plenty of additional features to enjoy, including screen tests, special effects tests, and an enjoyable commentary throughout by director Richard Donner.The movie has some shortcomings- Margot Kidder was roundly criticized for playing Lois Lane, as one reviewer wrote in 1978, \\"like a reformed hooker.\\" But this movie has become an icon, and this DVD provides a clear (almost X-ray vision) look at an American classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"super-duper...","review":"A great movie from start to finish, with great acting, photography, and an outstanding score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumps over ALL movies in a single bound!","review":"First of all I want to say this to the punks who are writing bad reviews for this movie...

The remastered sound and vision blowed my mind. What annoyed me was the 'added parts of the film integrated into it'. Well- when I was a kid, those SO CALLED integrated bits where in it when it screened on Australian T.V! Granted- not when you hired the movie out on VHS. Secondly, the two scenes with Lex luthers 'babies' were integrated into it when it screened on Australian T.V. On the DVD its put onto a section called 'deleted scenes'. How can they be 'deleted' if I remember seeing them as a kid. Why couldn't they have been remastered and integrated into the film! Pity, this movie is a 5 star movie.

One, the opening with young Clark just drags on for far too long. I could deal with that, though. The thing that kills the movie for me (spoiler alert, assuming you've been on a deserted island for the last 25 years) is the end. Not only do I think every show/movie that uses time travel to undo some tragedy is a cop out, it was also performed in the most unbelievable way possible. The world is not a big tape!! You can't rewind it! Even as a kid when I first saw this, I realized that spinning the earth backwards would not reverse time. (It would cause some good ol' fashioned world wide devastation that would have made Luthor's scheme look like nothing in comparison.) Also, if he can fly that fast, why couldn't he catch the missles in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, Very Corny!!!","review":"I saw this movie on TV a few days ago.

I bought the most expensive VHS I could find online, which was this clamshell version, to try to get widescreen (this was before you could get full descriptions). I left it in shrinkwrap until I was ready to see it again. What a disappointment! The video quality of this copy was washed out and has so many dust spots, scratches, and other flaws that it looks as though someone went to a second run theater and just videoed a tired old screening.

I admit that I return to the essays often, because they read with immediacy and offer encouragement, hope. A few essays are meditative and stretch from the United States to countries such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Pakistan among others.

Looking back, I have to say that I'm very glad I started the process of learning how to write a screenplay by reading \\"Screenplay 434.\\"I found a certain magic in the book. It provides just enough information to keep you learning yet not overwhelmed. And the author is encouraging and positive, which I believe is important. Of course, the reality is that only one of thousands of people who read their first screenplay book will ever earn back even the cost of the book from their screenplay writing. So it is critical that the PROCESS be as pleasurable as possible. I believe that \\"Screenwriting 434\\" is an excellent way to ensure that your process is pleasurable, while ensuring that you do begin your growth as a screenwriter.Of course, Screenwriting 434 is only a primer.

It's small, it fits perfectly where I need it (I will be using it inside of a small \\"closet-like\\" storage area in my bathroom which is hidden behind a nice curtain). I'll be primarily using it to hold hair products/supplies.

The other brilliant tracks are God Is A DJ , which has an awesome, exciting sound and a great rhythm , and Take The Long Way Home. Why Go features Boy George on vocals and is a mid-paced song, while Dido appears on the tune Hem Of His Garment. I also like opening track The Garden , an organic slow techno instrumental.

All the action leads up to my favorite fight scene at the end.... DO NOT PASS UP THIS MOVIE!!!!! If you are thinking, don't!

After recently reading several U.S. histories and several founding-father biographies I pulled this out for some lite reading. While an interesting read, my copy is going in the trash.Most of my thoughts have been expressed by other reviewers. True to the title the book is mostly a fast-paced debunking of one \\"myth\\" after another, many of which are generally accepted as myth or are inconsequential to american history. The work is footnoted (loosely at best), but many references end up being someone else's opinion rather than a primary source. Since Mr. Shenkman is going out of his way to debunk American history it's hard not to take a lot of his debunking with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good compliment to the \\"Myth America\\" TV series.","review":"As with most TV series you get statements with out support. So I tracked down the Richard Shenkiman book to get some background to the statements about American myths. I was not disappointed. It is as if he was reading this book on the TV with more graphic representations for the different media.The book is worth reading. However the format may not be to some peoples liking as it is short choppy statements and the chapters are divided into subjects as, Discoverers and Inventors, Presidents, Sex, and Art.There is a fair set of footnotes to lead you to further reading. You may need this as he sometimes stretches a point.Final analysis, you are better off reading this to give a better perspective on reality. Read it to your kids and save them a lifetime of \\"Legends, Lies & Cherished Myths of American History\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism","review":"Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards.

It is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say it ain't so, Joe","review":"Good, succinct destruction of historical myths, as we know them.

Even though no one dies or gets eaten up, it still is a violent book. I think this book could have been better if it did not have a house crush the police officer to the ground right before he was on his way to help the pigs. And the wolf being steam-pressed in a huge hot waffle iron and then smothered in butter-- ouch!I feel it's important to teach children to have empathy for others. Even though the people in the book are cartoonized animal characters, children identify with them. I do not think that the violent situations in this book will teach children fellow- feeling. If this book is read to any child over and over again, the child may get descensitized to these hurtful situations.

Each week a new theme is introduced by a catchy song & dance that is played at the beginning and end of each episode. Different sketches throughout the episode cover simple math, music, rhythm, imagination, language development, etc.Having said that, if you love the show, you'll love all three of the DVDs which contain three episodes of their respective theme. The \\"extras\\" aren't really great - a karaoke singalong one with lyrics and the other with only music and words on the bottom of the screen. I'd have liked some more background on the making of the show or a little extra addition to the episode.

The color was very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for understanding and releasing anxiety","review":"This CD really helps you to get out of your comfort zone, which it has motivated me to do. The cognitive aspect of it gets you to understand fear and anxiety and ways to counteract these feelings in a positive way. A combination of discussing fears and anxiety while playing positive affirmations after each track eventually finds its way into your subconscious because you find yourself during the day repeating these affirmations in your head. The upbeat music and tunes can be a bit dated, like from the 80's but it sticks in your head and helps you to remember things from the CD more easily. I'm just happy it works as well as it does and I try to play it at least once a week to keep these affirmations and understandings of anxiety fresh in my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Nonsense","review":"Wow.

I bought the purifier because my Vornado fan has been going strong for 5 years... but now I seriously doubt I will ever buy from them again (at least anything that uses a consumable item, such as a filter).

Pete's styles on this CD run the gamut from blues to new age to folk. While you can hear the influence of tappers like Michael Hedges and Preston Reed in his playing, Pete doesn't overdo it as is the case with so many in this genre. He uses it only to the extent that the tunes require it, always making sure to put the focus on the music.

The actor who played Louis's trainer Jack Blackburn was a young guy in a ridiculous bald wig. The movie begins with Marciano beating Louis up, then goes to the happier, earlier days.

This gets especially complicated when she has to use up several of the wishes to save her friends. The ending came as a complete surprise, and I have to admit, it was more than a little disturbing. Did Morwenna learn anything? I guess that's for the reader to decide. I had expected something redeeming to happen and for everything to turn out all right for everyone but I was wrong.

One thing that bothers me is the fact that one wire is longer than the other. I guess this was designed so that the line could run down the side of the body, not the front. When I run with these earphones, sweat has no effect on sound quality. The bass isn't great, but overall the sound quality is excellent. These really help me run those extra long runs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is O.K, FIT and Hardware blah","review":"The earphones does not fit all. I can tolerate it and I think my ears has gotten used to it, but I've had my fare of rashes to get to that point.Also the cord sheating is not as durable considering it's a sports earphones. My cord ended up having cracks up and down the whole thing. The wire inside started showing. I bought it because I hear sennheiser was pretty good with sound and I wanted to hear my audio while working out (gyms can be noisy) and the sound did end up being pretty decent. But it seems like the hardware is pretty flimsy and fragile. I treated it like any normal earphones and cheaper ones didn't get cracks in it's cord.Oh yeah and the pads for the earphones kept falling off. I'd sometimes lose it without knowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Really Do Fit","review":"They really have a unique design that not only keeps them in your ears but positioned for best sound. I have a few others but they don't offer the bass response after they slip around. The volume control is a small slider the perfect distance from the earphones so you don't have to fumble around with adjusting volume at your MP3 player. There are a lot of extra fitting adapters, actually more than I could even figure out but I'm happy with the way they came. They even have replacement \\"name strips\\" if you want to change colors. They are the best I've found thus far anywhere near this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"It is not worth it to buy these headphones instead of $15-$20 Sony, Nike or Koss headphones. I was looking for an upgrade over that basic level and I thought this would be it. I was wrong. Yes, the sound quality is better but the headphones have many downsides. First, I've owned the headphones for 7 months and the wire covering is already frayed. Second, the length of the cord is insanely long and incredibly annoying. And finally, they only do an average job of staying put in the ear while running, especially that they claim to have the twist to fit system.

My ears hurt for the next 20 minutes.These are by far the worst design in earbuds possible. The \\"twist to fit\\" protrusion is so big that the designer must have had ears the size of an elephants to come up with this disaster of a design.Further, the construction is CHEAP and plasticky, the rubber attachments only make the earbuds more and more uncomfortable. The length of the cable is quite short compared to regular earbuds. The changeable colour panels keep falling off the earbuds and the mesh covering the earpiece is very very flimsy.The best part about the earbuds is the case in which it comes which is stylish and good quality. Too bad the earbuds dont do the case justice.Shame on Sennheiser for producing such a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green is Keen","review":"Bought the item as a gift for my daughter who is a student in Boston.

I was incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, utterly useless.","review":"Sound quality is decent enough. Bass production is pretty much non-existent. My main gripe with the pair, however, is the fact that they are all too fragile. They saw very light use from me and even despite that they started falling apart very soon after purchase. The ear pieces have many components that are removable, and that is the problem. They are not secured well enough. They are constantly falling out. I own a wireless Sennheiser headset that I couldn't praise enough. But the pair in question is of very shoddy quality. I can't remember how much I paid for the pair, but if the current price is of any indication, I thoroughly got ripped off. They sound like a $10 pair and are of the quality of a $5 pair. I'd suggest buying them only when they fall to that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears must be too small...","review":"I had trouble getting these ear buds to go in my ear then stay in once I start sweating. I'm not trying to push them in my ear so I don't understand why this is happening.

With the enclose foam covers they wedged in perfectly and I found them to be very comfortable and they stay in place on walks or working around the house without having to constantly push them back in.The cord is a bit long but I hang the wires down my back so that doesn't bother me.The sound quality is not the best but for the $15 price tag you can't go wrong.The last thing was the description seemed to indicate there was a volume control but mine didn't have that. Otherwise, it looks pretty much like the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best earphones for the price.","review":"Best earphones for under $100.

Great pair, will buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbud design","review":"I bought these headphones specifically for running. The standard white earphones that came with the iPods would stop working, I guess because they get wet with sweat. I had never used this type of design before and it is simply great, the earbuds stay in place perfectly and are very, very comfortable.For a while I could not understand why the chords connected to the earbuds had different lengths, and the longer one was kind of a nuisance while running, flapping around my neck. I recently realized that if I placed the longer chord behind my neck and into the ear, the fit would be perfect and the flapping problem was gone.One minor problem is that the chord does not lose its coiled shape, and it tangles very easily; it took me several minutes to unravel the cables before a run until I decided to wind it around the iPod.Sound quality is very good, at least enough to enjoy during a run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"This is my second pair of these headphones. They lasted about a year (5 days a week use) before I needed to buy new ones. I like the twist and fit action that keeps them in my ears when I run (even if I get really sweaty!) The only thing I didn't like was how flimsy the cord is,(I used the clip and if you slide it too much it will split the casing of the cord.) And the ear buds were a bit hard to get used to in the begining...Other than those two things I would buy a third pair when these go out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Quality Control","review":"I received these as promised from Amazon, however, Sennheiser apparently doesn't do any quality control on their products. The cable on the left side was only about 4 inches long while the one on the right was about 12 inches and there was no way to adjust them. Effectively useless right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-priced","review":"These earphones are junk. Cheap construction leads to horrific sound with tinny base that bottoms out at high volumes, lots of distortion, and the rubber ear pieces all fell off within a month. The twist and fit design is a novel idea that does secure the ear buds for active pursuits, however they are uncomfortable when worn for a long time (e.g. plane rides) and useless once the rubber parts fall off. Two stars are given instead of zero because they do play music, so are slightly better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"very misleading reviews!....the bass in these is hardly worth mentioning and the poorly designed cord? why would you make one side longer than the other?....these are horrible don't waste your money on these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"Sennheiser MX55VC Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Headphones w/ Volume ControlExpensive --- VERY expensive for such a shoddy product.Sound quality --- Dreadful!

Earpiece cords are uneven lengths --- even more annoying, especially since it sets the in-line volume control off to one side, making access more difficult.Ear buds --- The so-called \\"twist-to-fit\\" is a joke. I played around with them for a half-hour and couldn't get a better fit, no matter how much I tried.Carrying case --- Pathetic!

I wear them on an average of 45 min - 1 1/2 hours per workout session and my ears never get sore.I give it 4 out of 5 stars only for the annoying longer length of the right ear cord.

And for some reason, that I cannot figure out, the wire on one side is more than twice as long as the one on the other side. I don't recommend them to anyone that has a good ear for audio quality.

First, both of the decorative plastic pieces fell off. Then the rubber discs fell off that form part of the twist-to-fit system. Then the rubber rings around the speakers themselves fell off.

I tried to contact Sennheiser about the warranty but recieved no response. I was disappointed, but I gave the product another try - mainly because the fit was nice. I bought another pair. Today, after about 6 months use, I noticed that the green coating of the cord is splitting near one of the earbuds, revealing the wires underneath.

I really like how they fit and stay put, but I wish they hurt less (it's bearable though).

The cheap phones that came with my iPod fit better.

They have an excellent fit, excellent sound quality that you would expect from Sennheiser, and they don't fall out like most other in-ear sets.I wear them at the office and at the gym, and they are a perfect set for both places. However, I would STRONGLY recommend putting on the foam earpiece covers for office use. My building must be the static electricity capital of the world, and the metal shield over the speakers on these headphones will kill your ears if you move your feet around under your desk with only the rubber earpiece covers on. Ask me how I know this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so nice shock","review":"The first few times I used this earphones, it was great. It is a little tricky getting them in just right (I had to switch to the smallest nubs; maybe it's easier for those with larger ears). Then while on a treadmill run, I felt a little snap in my ear. I didn't think anything of it. Sometimes the satellite reception isn't that great so I changed to another machine. I started running, and there it was again. There was no mistaking it, I was feeling little shocks in my ears. Well that was it for me. I definitely wanted these to work, so I was sad to have to return them. Maybe it was a bad pair, but I won't chance it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"This is definitely a low end product. It is not that much different from the standard issued headphones that comes with your IPOD. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap...cheap...cheap","review":"I bought these headphones thinking they might be nice since they stay in your ear. Well it turns out that if your ears are small they don't fit, you can twist until they get jammed in, but then you have a sore ear for 5 days. Not only are they extremely uncomfortable but they sound quality sucks. They do not block any sound from the outside, so on top of listening to poor quality music, you also have to hear everything around you......Then on top of everything else you cannot get a refund because the item have been used...Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit, low durability, fair sound.","review":"I love Senheiser and have several of their headphones. But, this one is questionable. The design is not as good as one would think, although it is intriguing. Sound is so-so, bass is weak. After a year of use the plastic coating came off, and the right ear bud stopped producing sound. I am a runner and use my headsets several times a week for an hour or two each time. This one does not hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"goodCbut not as expected!","review":"the price is competetive!shipping is fast!the package of the item is graceful and beautiful!it deserves the famous big brand SENNHEISER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really different!","review":"I must admit, when I first saw these, I questioned the design and the principal. However, after wearing them and changing the way they fit in the ears several times, I found the sound amazing. There is an excellent base response for such a small driver. Also, the fit never changed with movemnent once fit was set. The fact that the price on these was dropped since they are no longer an active production product, made the price to performance hard to beat. Very cool. Keep up the good work Sennheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser MX75 Do Not Attach/Fit as Described","review":"I bought MX75 \\"Twist-To-Fit\\" hoping that they would stay secure in my ears as I ran. First, there were no instructions with the package describing how to \\"twist and fit\\" into my ear. I finally found a video with a few frames on the Sennheiser web site showing how they are to be inserted (no description). I repeatedly went in front of a mirror to duplicate the \\"Twist-To-Fit\\" process as shown in the video clip. It must be my Spock-like ears - I could not make it happen. They just fell out. I found that they were more secure when placed in my ears upside down to what is shown in the clip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid headphones for training","review":"The headphones have worked out very well so far. The biggest problem I'd had in using in-ear style phones before was having them move around or slide out of position while training. This was especially true while running. I can say definitively that the MX75s are not giving me the same issue. They are comfortable and remain in place during long jogs and even interval training.One thing that has been slightly annoying is the cord. It's a good length, comes in its own carrying case, and is designed with an offset cord to keep from placing stress on the ears. All that is very nice, but the cord itself maintains its curl from being packaged. The constant curl (like a phone cord) means that it ends up bouncing and hitting me in the neck while running. Sometimes I don't notice, sometimes it's annoying.Other than that, very solid. Nice to have an ear bud where I don't have to worry about poor sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average sound, substandard construction.","review":"The sound is 'okay' for a cheap pair of headphones but not stellar. No matter what I do, I can't get a decent comfortable 'fit' with their design. After a couple months, my pair started falling apart (the bud covering, silver plastic piece on the back fell off and won't stay on). I guess you get what you pay for so I shouldn't complain too much. But I wouldn't recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my teenager and she is quite pleased","review":"So far no issues with these at all. Bought these for the daughter that has a knack for destroying or losing headsets she uses with her Sansa E280. She likes them enough that she is being very cognizant of where they are and not leaving them. And so far she hasn't found a way to damage them either. Of course part of that could be that she had to pay 50% of the cost out of the money she makes dog sitting/walking etc and she was told if she needs another set it's entirely out of her pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for most people","review":"These headphones are just as everyone has said... excellent. It just takes a while to go through all the combinations of ear pieces to determine your best fit. Unfortunately I have one ear that none of the pieces fits well, so my wife uses them and LOVES them. I think I am the exception to the rule, and that most folks can find a good fit with the pieces provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best jogging/workout headphones yet!","review":"I purchased the headphones for myself and really enjoyed them. As a matter of fact I am using them right now! My wife stole them for her workout because they stay in the ear so well. I was so tired of having to retrieve them that I purchased a set for her! Final input, if you are using these for sport and workout you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Found For Running","review":"They took a while to get use to so take your time trying the different size ear pieces that come with the headphones. Best pair I've found for running. The right bud has a longer cord than the left which took a while to get use to. Once you get them set up they are no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but worth it.","review":"I have bought these headphones for as long as I can remember. They usually last me about two years but their value was proven to me when I was a janitor at a vitamin company. I was a janitor and I usually came home caked with all sorts of crud. These sound great, look decent, but that 'twist-to-fit/lock\\" design is awesome! They are really hard to jostle loose, which is great when I go on bike rides. I use these pretty much everyday when I bike to and from work and or class and they perform. I am about to go onto the two year mark, and my current pair will definitely need replacing in a bit. The biggest downside is due to the waterproof outer wire coating. It is waterproof, but it seems every single pair I've owned (Which is now up to four, soon to be five) seems to strip straight down the middle. I just use a little bit of packing tape and look dorky for my music. Overall, If found on the cheap, or under 50 bucks, snag em. They are awesome. I hope Amazon sells them again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headphones","review":"I absolutley LOVE these headphones. I have tried 3 different styles of headphones before I finally found these and couldn't be more pleased. Used them this weekend for a 7 mile run, great sound, stayed in place, and were very comfortable. I would definitely buy these again. One note, my daughter has smaller ears and was not able to get a good fit with her ear shape.

However the Sports version includes a clip which helps eliminate the sometimes 'thud' you hear when the wires bump against you."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Great for Athletics","review":"These are meant for athletes, and with that in mind, they're great. They really are very comfortable, especially when you attach the properly-sized adapters (which are included). They feel very secure and I'm confident that they won't fall out.No, the audio quality is not the best. I compared them to Apple's new in-ear headphones (which, by the way, are AMAZING in terms of audio quality), and the Sennheiser's bass response is noticeably weak. But the point is that Apple's headphones -- while I love them -- are awful to go jogging with.Again, these are made for athletics, and in that regard they perform wonderfully. Also, the carrying case is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, bad construction.","review":"My pair fell apart after a few months of use. The ear pads and green bands come off easily and so easily lost in any gym bag. Although they come with different sized bands, there are no replacement bands. So if the original bands were the right size, you're out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I ordered the street headphones b/c I didn't like the green sport version.

Sound quality is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!","review":"A complete waste of money!! The earpieces didn't fit in my ears and ouldn't stay in place no matter what I did. I threw them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent functionality, horrible quality","review":"I bought these earphones in July 2008 to use while cycling. I had tried several cheap headphones, and they died with 6 months. A higher quality earphone should last longer and perform better, I had thought. I have now had these earphones 3 months, and they are now completely dead. After month 1, the left earphone had ripped out of the cord when slightly snagged on my messenger bar. After 2 months, the rubber gasket and earphone cover had fallen off the remaining right earphone. By month 3, the right earphone had pulled out of the housing and would dangle loose. All of this happened just be using the headphones while road cycling. Road cycling is a fairly benign activity, and these earphones failed spectacularly. The sound quality was great for the month that both earphones worked, and that is the reason for the 2 stars. If they stay in piece, they do work fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ergonomics","review":"The earphone buds are too large and consequently cause pain after about 15 minutes, even when using the smaller fitting ring. The twist-to-fit is okayish, though it causes pain after a while, as the length of the twist-to-fit portion is fixed and may not match with your ear.NOT recommended unless you have really large ears. May sound stupid, but that's the way it is.Sound quality is good. But you dont care about sound quality if your ears hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Goodness!!","review":"I bought this product because the ear buds that came with my I-Pod kept coming out of my ears even if I walked. I am a runner and the other earphones that I have used (even the ones that wrapped around my ears) always came dislodged and I was constantly fixing them while I was running. I reviewed this product on Amazon and the product had great reviews. It also had a great price...I think I paid 29.00 for them and the shipping happened to be free! So I bought them. I am sooo happy that I did. These ear buds stay put and feel secure while I'm running or doing whatever. The smaller piece helps the bud stay in your ear. I read where other people found this small part to be uncomfortable after a while but I have never experienced this. I say to all of you who are runners...these are the best I've found!! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've found at staying in place","review":"I've tried all kinds of earbuds, and these Sennheisers are definitely the best I've found in terms of staying put, even with fairly vigorous activity. Sound is good, too. Unfortunately the design, which helps lock the buds in place, also put a little pressure on the ear, meaning these are not the most comfortable I've ever used, But if you're tired of constantly repositioning earbuds, these may work well for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"All ears are different","review":"Seemed like a smart design... until I tried it in MY ears. This is the risk of purchasing something you cannot try before you buy. I found the headphones just couldnt sit comfortably in my ears for more than about 20 minutes, albeit a \\"smart\\" design that apparently stays firmly in place better than others - I took them out after a short while reverting to my older \\"in ear\\" soft type. I'd recommend buyers just be sure they know their ear - which can only be after trying out a few designs, and losing some - then looking at finer features like sound quality etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch!","review":"I have used these headphones for over a week now, and I must say, they HURT!!

I use them while I'm running or working out with my ipod. I coiled up the excess wire and fastened it with tiny zip-ties so that it isn't flopping around and getting in the way. I tuck the wire down my shirt neck, out my sleeve and into my ipod which is in a bicep band. This arrangement works really well, I've never yanked out the ear-buds and I can do any acitivity without restriction. The ear phones sound great and come with a number of pieces so that the fit can be adjusted to the user. The set also came with a tiny aligator clip to fasten the wire to your clothes. I highly recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Headphones","review":"Second pair of these ... which is why they get 4/5. One ear bud fell apart after about 7 months but they are worth a second shot.Fantastic for true sports training ... I ride (cycle) with these and place only one bud in my right ear; love the alligator clip to keep line close to my jersey. Wonderful for running with the longer side to wrap 'round to the back and stay out of the way, especially when doing hills, etc.Quality sound so ya just gotta get over the color ... who cares? Especially if you are using these for training ... might make you go faster if you don't want to be seen with them on. Maybe Sennheiser will make a nice simple gray color. As far as the extra cord length, keep it coiled and use the twisty that comes with the package. Works nicely.I found if I twist the bud properly, they don't hurt my ear after long usage ... but that was a bit of trial and error and then reading these reviews! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid headphones","review":"good headphones. my only problem was the rubber pieces that your supposed to \\"twist to fit in\\" fall out very easily. sometimes when i take the headphones out of my pocket it has fallen off of the headphones and i find it in my pocket. they have extra ones but so far i have lost 3 of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earphones for working out","review":"These earphones are great for what they are intended to be used for, working out. I would rate the sound quality as very good, not great, and not quite what I would expect for Sennheiser. That being said, I would still reccommend these to anyone looking for something that will stay put while working out, even while running.They do take a second to get in your ear at first, and I probably wouldn't recommend them to anyone with somewhat smaller ears.Bottom line, they are a great product, they will stay in place, they hold up well to abuse (bouncing around, sweat, etc.), and they sound very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earphones that finally fit!","review":"I have never had pair of earbud headphones that were comfortable and actually stayed in place - until I bought these Sennheisers! I no longer have to adjust my headphones every 2 minutes at the gym or while running. While sticking anything in your ear will hurt after awhile, these are the most comfortable ones I've tried. My only minor complaint is that the flexible carrying case doesn't seem like it would protect the headphones all that well, but overall I am thrilled with these headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earphones","review":"These are awesome earphones for the price.

A couple of combinations seemed to be OK to start, but over time became painful. The little nub that extends atop the bud only added to the discomfort. They do provide the openness needed to hear conversation and traffic sounds while working out. That feature, however, points to the lack of bass response and poor fit. The Basswind system is lacking at best. I have owned and worn the pads off of other Sennheiser headphones. I am very disappointed with this product. The Twist-to-Fit system is a gimmick and I would not recommend this headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sport Headphones for the price","review":"Great sound, powerful bass and crisp highs, waterproof, perfectly adjustable to your ear, nice set of accessories, great price (way cheaper than other online stores).

Therefore, I bought these 'twist-to-fit' headphones & they work great. They're hard to put into your ears at first. I needed a lot of practice to finally get them in right. There's definitely a twisting motion that you have to master to get them securely into your ears, but once you've got that nailed down then these headphones definitely stay in your ears. Maybe it's just because I have small ears, but the headphones left my ears pretty sore after the first few days. If you don't mind some achey ears for the first few days, then go for this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"These are crazy. I really enjoy running with these headphones.

I am considering returning the MX55s, but for the price I wonder if it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound - a little scary","review":"I purchased this product to listen to music / watch videos while on my bicycle trainer.

More importantly, after working a good sweat I am sorry to report I got shocked. The headphones started buzzing and I felt a minor, but very clear, electric shock.

I really wish they would've fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE the Coiled Cable","review":"The sound coming from these headphones is great, and so is the twist to fit method of keeping the buds in your ears. But the cable is absulutely the worst one I've ever seen. I guess the coiled cable idea is ok in theory, but uncoiling the cable every time I use them is awful. Every time I put them in it takes at least a minute of untangling the cable to be able to use them. And I don't understand at all why the left cable (about 12-15\\") is so much shorter than the right (about 30\\"). The left cable is so short that the left ear bud keeps jerking at the shirt clip, which means I have to adjust them several times to stop the jerking. Except for the earbud, the iPod approach to the cable is MUCH, MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"The twist to fit concept intrigued me. Thought it was the answer to my problems in a decent fitting headphone for my ears. I thought wrong. If you have ears of size you feel is a little different don't buy these. Couldn't tell you about the sound quality. Since they didn't fit properly I sent them right back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound. Questionable Design.","review":"The sound is great. Ear fit is perfect (and adjustable). No slippage during hard runs. Durable. Design is a bit weird. After wire splits to earbuds one side is longer. Kind of makes it a pain and you can only use and armband on one side because of it. Also the wire is too curly. It literally takes forever to straighten out. Mine still isn't straight and I've had the headphones for 2 months. If you are more concerned with sound quality and slippage then these are for you. If logistics around the body are a priority another pair is probably your best option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to expectations","review":"I have another pair of Sennheisers (PX100) and I love them. Wear them all day at work. I wanted another pair for the gym and bought these even though they're super-green. The worst part is the curly cable that keeps getting tangled. So annoying. None of the adapters made them fit my ear, and after 30 min they start to hurt. Sound quality was okay, but not as good as my other pair. Overall, I'm not that impressed and wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming: Save your $$","review":"I don't get the positive reviews. I've had my MX75s for several months and find them to be merely adequate. In other words, they really aren't an improvement over the ear buds which came with my iPod Nano. They don't fit my ears or stay put any better--irrespective of which of the included silicon sizing rings I use; they don't sound radically better than the original ear buds; and the cord/wire is too stiff and is sometimes awkward as a result. My recommendation is to either stay with your original ear buds or spend a bit more to get something with a greater WOW! factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good sound quality","review":"I use these headphones at the gym and like their sound quality very much.

The only downside is that the little disks that keep them in place out side your ear fall off easily and you could lose them if it were loose in your bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality workout headphones","review":"After ruining many earphones while working out, I finally got the MX75's specifically for that purpose and so far they have fit the bill nicely. I tend to sweat a lot, so the fact that they are sweat resistant is a big plus. The little nubs that help hold them in your ears seem to work reasonably well, but you do need to select the nub size that's right for your ear (I used the biggest ones, though my ears aren't really that big). The sound quality is quite decent though not outstanding. I still keep other headphones around for when I'm not working out. The only problem I have with them at this point is that since they are made outta rubber, the cord doesn't like to straighten out like. It tries to stay in the wrapped up position and can get in your way. The solution I came up with was to use the shirt clip to reduce the amount of slack in the wire, which mostly solves this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buds but not as comfortable","review":"These are perfect for running or other vigorous exercise. I constantly use mine in the gym or for running outside and they stay in your ears regardless of any perspiration or movement. This was my main reason for purchasing them because the standard iPod earbuds fall out too easily during running. I'm not a sound expert so as far as I'm concerned, they sound good enough to listen to while working out.Cons: They are not as comfortable (in my opinion). They do come with a few different pieces to fit your ears but they way they twist in your ears to stay can become uncomfortable after having them in for 30 plus minutes. My ears hurt after having them in for 30 plus minutes. My other complaint is the different lengths of the right and left ear cords. I'd prefer them to be equal length. The cord also tends to become tangled easier because it doesn't hang perfectly straight but in a semi-coil instead. This can be a bit cumbersome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist-To-Fall-Out","review":"I bought these headphones to wear at the gym based on reviews here, and I'm sorry to say they did not work for me at all. Maybe my ears are misshapen, but I could not get them to stay in securely, and the sweat factor only made things worse. I was constantly checking to see if they were on their way out of my ears, which was annoying. In addition, the cord drove me crazy. I was so perturbed by the fit and the cord that I cannot even speak to the sound quality. They are better than the ear buds that came with my iPod (how could they not be?), but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Runners","review":"After trying many other styles and brands, I believe I have found the right set of headphones that will stay in place while running. Without slamming any other brands, let me just say that these are the best I've tried out of at least 5 others. The twist-to-fit feature keeps the ear phones in place during intense workouts, which is a blessing while running.My one problem is that after sweating profusely, the sound in the left ear-bud seems to almost dull out completely.

Well, the volume controls on this this unit are useless. They have a really short range. So you can't turn the volume all the way down (in case you need to speak with someone or listen to what's going on around you) So you need to pull the damn ear pieces out of your ear or use the controls on your ipod or whatever mp3 player you're using - so why bother having a volume control."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but nothing to get excited about","review":"This is the third set of Sennheiser headphones I have purchased and I have been disappointed in all three. I don't even know where the Twist- to-fit set is now. I used them the first day and I just don't see where all the excitement about them comes from. You can twist all you want but the things still won't stay in your ears. The last set of fit-in-your-ear type I bought were so large you would need ears as large as a jackass to put them in. They were Wayyyy toooo big for my ears, and people say I have large ears. The sound quaslity of all three is no better than much less expensive headphones.

I am ok with the asymmetrical part, but it is so goddam coiled its extremely irritating and difficult. Secondly, I don't know if it's just me, but it takes a while to get these in correctly. I have to adjust them multiple times to do it right and its much more hassle than I want to deal with . Overall the hassle of the cord and getting the earphones in correctly pissed me off too much so I returned them.

Even the ones that hang around the ear weren't working. After trying 4 pairs of various brands of earphones over the last 2 years, I have finally settled on the greatest pair, thanks to reviews posted by other runners in Runners World Magazine.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking quality-","review":"The cord is very thin and does not lay flat it is like a plastic tube with a piece of dental floss in it and has zero heft and the sound quality is not very good. The ear clip is very unique but lacking comfort for my ears. I will not use these for running again I was pretty disappointed in the performance and comfort. I am keeping them for my sea-doo because it is not worth the time to return them but if I had it to do over again I would not have purchased them. I think I am going to try an over the head headphone system for running these just aren't the solution I was looking for to keep the ear buds in my ears while running. I recommend keep on looking! And the color is pretty awful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best earphone value so far","review":"Whereas other earphones have become uncomfortable, even painful, after an hour or so, these had a nice light feeling right out of the box.

And they stay in place better than anything else I've tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, secure in the ear, but adaptors fall off easily","review":"I bought these headphones for workouts (running, sports, the gym). The twist feature does secure the buds in your ear well. The sound is very good with surprisingly good bass response. The big negative is that the earbud adaptors come free from the earphone and are easily lost. I have only had my headphones for a few weeks and already three adaptors have come loose and two of those were lost. The adaptors are required for these headphones to fit comfortably in the ear, so I can't recommend these headphones overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice headphones","review":"I just received these and, as others have noted, the cord to the right ear is twice as long as the cord to the left ear from the point on the cord where they split.If you wear them under you chin like a standard headphone it is a bit irritating because the cord is sized so that you can route the cord to the right earbud around the back of your neck. If worn this way it uses up the additional slack in the wire and is very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice indeed.","review":"I Just recieved these very slick earbuds.

From the first time I used them it was painful, but the pain dissipated after I started working out ... or so I thought. When I took them off, my ears remained painfully sore. I continued to use them nonetheless, why I don't know, but think it's because the maintain a sturdy fit. But still the sound quality was just okay as they had a hard time handling low notes. But I decided I'd had enough when I realized that sweat ruins the friction fit, and they consistently slid out of my ears during my long runs. I'm going back to my behind the neck headphones, that are clunky but sound great and stay on my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones for runners","review":"The color is a bit severe but most runners will not care when they experience the twist fit of the MX75 which allows you to run without fear of the headphones falling out of your ears as many ear buds do.Sound quality is decent.

I cannot figure out the twist to fit system. There is no illustartion in the package or at the Sennheiser website. I passed these around my office and asked a bunch of tech geeks if they could figure out how to fit them properly into my ears and no one could. My ears are pretty average looking too. Also - the cord is about 7 feet long. This is absurd!

This book by Judi Mccoy will entice anyone that is a fan of such stories. Attractive female alien, Zara, is sent to Earth in search for a human male chosen by the elders from her planet in an effort to continue the life of her species. Her chosen mate, Daniel Murphy is hiding from his dead wife's parents in a smalltown in the BIG state of Texas with his son Will due to custody issues. The situations the characters encounter throughtout this story are fun and exciting enough to keep the reader turning the page. Judi Mccoy really has an interesting way of weaving romance, action and sci-fi into one great adventure. Even those that may not find this book to their liking finishes the story - and writes a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty far fetched","review":"This is my first Judi McCoy book and it will most likely be my last. The set up was great and I enjoyed the first part of it. Then it just goes flat. I didn't feel the chemistry between these two characters. The hero is way too nice. So nice that he's boring. There was no conflict between the two besides the lies they kept from each other. When Zara confesses that she's an alien, it's no big deal...no one even disbelieves it for a second. I got through half the book and then didn't pick it up again for about 4 days. That is not a good sign for me. The epilogue was just a sneak preview for another book I guess. I wanted to know what happened on the spaceship. I guess I'll never find out since I won't pay money for another one of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this book....","review":"Could this story have been any lamer?

I'm willing to go aways with paranormal romance, but give me a break.Ridiculous premise with tepid sex scenes.

The heroine is from another planet where men can't make any babies and she and 7 other female aliens are sent to Earth to get pregnant by certain males who were picked out by the alien elders. It has all the typical alien subplots with government types trying to capture the alien, etc. It is laughable to think if these aliens can travel throughout the universe what is so special about an Earthman's sperm to help populate their planet.

I run the Vornado humidifier 24/7, as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly, especially when changing out the wicks. There is never any gunky build-up to blame the short life-span on. These are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks. My ancient Duracraft, which is no longer manufactured, but is the best humidifier I've ever had, easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes, with no deterioration in performance.

After moving to a home with a humidifier on the furnace, I gave it to my mom who has radiators, and she incidentally has dry, brittle skin as well. The humidifier itself is fantastic and puts a lot of real, breathable moisture into the air without dousing everything in dampness. The wicks do the job, unfortunately, they have to be thrown out if they ever dry out (so keep the humidifier full!) and they will also collect a lot of dirt, leading to bacteria.That said, Amazon's price and delivery are by far the best deal you will find. I find that 2 sets of wicks handles my mom's apartment for the long winter, and she keeps the unit in her bedroom which is at the back of a 1100 sq foot apartment. She has good air flow through the apartment and that one unit improves the entire apartment.

I am submitting a review on a textbook I don't have, even weeks past the Estimated Delivery Date.Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for \\"The Singing Detective\\"","review":"This is an amazing made for television series by the BBC in the 80's. Very complex theme with characters assuming different roles in the mind of the main character writing a detective story in his mind while confined to a hospital bed by a crippling skin disorder. At times very funny, but also poignant while the patient/writer/detective tries to solve a murder mystery as the characters shift in his head from childhood memories during WWII, to fellow patients and staff in the hospital. The background music fits wonderfully with the story. Michael Gambon is wonderful as the author/detective, surrounded by a cast of characters that are so very British. The only downside is that the dialogue is sometimes hard to follow with \\"American\\" ears not tuned to British regional dialects. Adult themes, language and some nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original BBC Series: The Singing Detective","review":"This is magical work. It reeks of originality & excellence. British humor has its own reason for being. Michael Gambon is just flat superb! The original writer Potter is no longer with us - what a pity! It is a combo of suspense, wit, pathos all rolled into one. I did not see the movie with Robert Downey Jr. I could not bear to make a comparison to this gem of a production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The main character is Phillip Marlow, who is a Private Investigator in every movie I've seen. The British version is the only one in which he is a hospitalized writer. The movie also drifts from his hallucinations, to the story he has written and then to reality and back to his hallucinations. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing To Sing About","review":"I'm a fan of Dennis Potter and when I first saw The Singing Detective I thought it was nothing short of brilliant. I bought the dvd when it came out and put it on the shelf to watch some rainy weekend. That weekend came a day ago and I sat down eager to revisit a much loved classic. Good Lord was I disappointed. It dragged its foot in lamed fashion and I heard myself screaming \\"Get on with it\\". Spare yourself and if anyone is interested I've got a perfectly good copy for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful, Very Overated","review":"A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD. I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here. Reviews that called this flawless, brilliant, the greatest TV program ever, etc. I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away. It is extremely disturbing. The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing. If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art, then you will like this show. But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics, stay away from this one. Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal \\"brilliant and entertaining.\\" If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too. Otherwise think twice before buying this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gunfight in a Hospital Ward Ever!!!","review":"This series operates on so many levels at the same time it's hard to keep up with it...but well worth the effort. The tragic predicament of a man whose soul is as mascerated as his skin, who wants and needs to be healed and fears what the healing will reveal slowly unravels through flashbacks, the pages of a dog-eared detective novel, a screenplay and feverish hallucinations. Dennis Potter's TV series delves deep into the human character and human predicament. You may discover yourself as Philip Marlowe finally finds out who dunnit. The sex, nudity and violence are integral to the plot and do not detract from it. The best television I've ever seen, and I remember Ernie Kovacs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best TV production ever!","review":"Like others here, I taped this, too, but that won't stop me from buying it. There's never been anything like it on TV (or in the movie theater, either). Like great literature, you can view it at various levels--as psychological drama, as a pean to the power of memory, as an journey of physical and psychological recovery, as a deconstruction of 1940's culture in general (and film noir and musicals in particular). Yet, its drama is achingly, unrelentingly human, thanks to Michael Gambon's astounding performance (that he didn't win an Emmy for this is a crime), supported by a great cast of BBC regulars, and Potter's amazing script (yes, I have the book, and you can't have it!). You haven't fully comprehended what the medium can do until you've seen this. Buy it--before it goes out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sinning detective","review":"the best sucks you in for the best ride great detective thriller and musical I prefer this version over the american remake"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Easy","review":"This one requires some effort on the part of the viewer/participant.

I thought that TSD was in somewhat the same jaundra. Well, I was plesently surprised. It's not a \`Mystery' but a psychodrama of the highest caliber.A gripping plot, much of it autobiographical to Dennis Potter this IS the best thing that has ever been on television!Wouldn't it be nice if television aspired to all the crafts that brought us \\"The Singing Detective\\". Find out what you've been missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seminal Landmark in Television History","review":"Though not for all tastes, this six-part BBC series represents an historic occasion when television rises above its creative abyss to produce a work of seminal artistry. Written by Dennis Potter, \\"The Singing Detective\\" (1986) is one of the most fascinating and innovative murder-mysteries ever developed. For 392 minutes, viewers are taken on a multi-layered journey through musical fantasy and harrowing reality. Directed with exceptional verve by Jon Amiel, the series is akin to a compelling book that you cannot put down. In the pivotal role of pulp-fiction writer Philip Marlow, Michael Gambon has a difficult and, at times, grotesque challenge that few performers would undertake. Gambon brilliantly makes the character his own - perhaps the veteran actor's finest 6 hours in any medium. Rarely has television displayed the vivid imagination that can be found in Potter's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing Dectective - DVD Edition","review":"One of the previous reviewers commented unfavourably on the image quality of this DVD set - it almost kept me from buying it. Almost... I did get it though, because I remembered it as one of the greatest things I had ever seen on television. Bearing in mind that this is a production for television, I can not find anything wrong with the image quality. The quality of the transfer has also been praised elsewhere. So don't worry, this is a great set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery and sickness","review":"Despite the accolades from the \\"right\\" people, this series is in fact one of the sickest, most disgusting, most lewd productions of the past several decades. If you're into loathing, self-disgust, childish fantasy, physical torment, and blasphemy, this is your film. If you aren't ready to vomit after the first of the six installments, you should ask yourself why. If this is an artistic masterpiece, then Western civilization is closer to extinction than many of its severest critics suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Horrid Recommendation","review":"If this were a serious production , it would have closed 100 miles outside Boston.There is nothing clever , nothing new , and no genius in this one.

No, these are not Burt Bacharach originals. I wish the actual musicians were listed, however, because the band has very good arrangements and excellent players. Part of the Bacharach magic is that his songs connect so passionately with the heart and soul that they inspire great performance out of many lesser known artists.

I searched online at found other sites recommending this same DashMat model number and this is the model number I kept getting for my car.

Chac contrasts the ancient mythology (drawn from the Popul Vu) with contemporary village life of the Maya. It is a film for adult viewers.

It's time for the Christian to do whatever it takes to get back on the right track, even if you have to go back to basics.

To one unfamiliar with the movie, it's a mishmash of rock, pop, and country mixed together, but to one who's watched the movie carefully, it all makes sense, From the raucous \\"Timebomb\\" to Jimmy Wakely's \\"Moon Over Montana\\" and all in between such as \\"Everybody's Talkin' Sara Evans \\"Almost New\\", Don Gibson's \\"Sea of Heartbreak\\", Sister Hazel's \\"Let Your Love Flow\\", even Pat Boone's \\"Moody River\\" and the title song.As a matter of fact, those who think they don't like country, or don't like rock, or don't like older pop music, will find their musical tastes expanding as long as they listen to the music in relation to the movie itself.

That song is great... quarky, but great. Mike Garrigan has been playing that kind of music around The Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) since 1993, and since forming Collapsis it's only gotten better. I'd highly recommend not only this soundtrack, but \\"The Chartreuse EP\\" they released in Oct. '98. I think their major-label debut will come out this Fall, too.So, yes...

The scene was when Lester was in \\"Vixon's\\" kitchen getting a beer & he eyed the butcher block on the counter.

Her book is a must-read for every young woman in search of direction for her life. I encourage everyone to read this book. It will keep you engaged from the front page to the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"I love my music chilled, but this put me to sleep. Its boring and old fashioned and sounds like everything else you have in your music library, been there done that.... don't bother. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring. Sorry, I was actually expecting to love this.","review":"Based on all the \\"this is the best photo book ever written\\" reviews and what a few photographer friends mentioned to me also, I trusted that I would love this and went ahead and bought it. I forced myself to get about one third through it. This was just tedious and boring and hard to read, with a few very \\"on the money\\" remarks. A few times I felt \\"ah haaa, now its picking up\\" just for it to get tedious again. I would like to edit it down to about three interesting pages.He needed to apply his understanding of editing photographs to his writing also. I have no pressing desire to try to make myself get through the remaining two thirds just to see if it gets better. If it actually does, the book should just start there.Sorry Galen, I'm sure you were a nice guy and everything. Nothing personal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galen Rowell laid his first egg here","review":"I have read all of Galen's books, God rest his soul, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's a collection of things about how good a photographer he is. I already know he was a great photographer but what I wanted is some ideas how I could get better. After 200 pages or so, I gave up reading the rest. Some info. is useful but 90% of the 280 pages were just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving, preachy, little info","review":"This is a book in which Rowell attempts to convince us how wonderful he is. It did more to describe how super-duper his shots were without telling us much about the thought process that went into creating those moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Inner Passion\\" of Galen Rowell","review":"If you're a serious photographer (amateur or pro) and find your interest in shooting lagging occasionally, Rowell's enthusiasm might be contagiousness enough to provide a cure. This man was passionate about photography and went to extraordinary ends to get the shots he visualized. The majority of the book deals with his philosophy of photography and how he accomplished what he did. There's also much excellent technical advice. The book's only shortcoming, from my very personal perspective (take it for what it's worth), is the undercurrent of Rowell's ample ego. Were the personal pronoun \\"I\\" deleted from the book, its page count would be reduced considerably. Nonetheless, I still strongly recommend \\"Inner Game\\" for the highly passionate and very personal account that it is - an extraordinary photographer's testimonial to a life totally devoted to the art of photography and love of nature. It makes you want to climb a mountain and take pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Insight","review":"The best book I have ever purchased and I have read a lot of books. Have read this one four times in the 2 years I've had it and actually found more useful information each time. I think this is due to the fact that it seems you can only unlock in your mind the sense of what Galen is saying once you have taken something, applied it to your photography, seen a dramatic improvement and then gone back to check you haven't missed anything. It is then that the magic occurs and what appeared on first reading to be a simple statement is now laden with meaning not visible before. I expect to learn from these passages for some time to come as my photography evolves. The first half is particularly insightful and ultimately very applicable, despite first appearances.A true look into a highly creative mind, it is a pleasure and somewhat of a privilege to take this walk with Galen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to mine for info","review":"There is plenty of philosophy in this book based on his own experiences. If you're looking purely for a techniques book or how-to or teachings of his techniques, you'd might be disappointed because it's not organized as such although some good techniques and info are in there. You just need to do some information-mining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Galen Rowell was a great photographer, but he blathers on in this book, which I did not find at all helpful. Plus, many of the photos are tiny and the book is poorly designed.I found Brenda Tharp's Creative Nature and Outdoor Photography much more helpful, with larger photos and a better designed layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for older cards","review":"I have used this card reader for a couple of years now and had mixed results. Typically, it will simply not read any of the newer high speed card types so it is growing more and more useless for me. It does read some of my older SD budget cards, but the Compact Flash Platinum 80x sitting in front of me is not recognized. I would recommend it if you have older budget speed flash cards and do not plan on upgrading, these readers are so cheap you can find better alternatives with a wider support range now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong pop production from Paolo Meneguzzi","review":"This is a strong album - it contains the powerhouse pop ballad \\"Musica\\" which, according to Wikipedia, is the best selling single in Italian history. But, the other songs are strong as well - there is no placeholder material here. It's a great mix of uptempo songs and pop ballads, but it has just enough of a clubby edge to not sound like the standard stuffy pop music you get from a lot of latin artists. His background as a DJ may be what helps him out in this regard. I'd opt for the Italian version over the Spanish version of the album - when you listen to both, the Italian versions just seem to have more life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A KID AT 66","review":"Purchased additional tracks for G scale Christmas train for under our Christmas Tree. My grand kids love playing with the train and I love playing along with them. In respect to the tracks I had to have two sections replaced. Company was excellent to deal with and prompt shipping. they didn't even want the unuseable tracks. In connect the tracks you had to ensure not to force the connections which can and will result in the metal portion of the track bending. The rail portion of the track is made of plastic and that is/was the main problem. the tracks from the 40's and 50's were all made of metal. Nothing replaces quality. However today their is a price to pay for quality.

The final chapter reveals that as we pray, the one most changed is us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been waiting for these","review":"I'm giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it appears that this set does not contain the \\"Legend of the Rangers\\" movie. Not that I especially liked that movie, but in the interest of completeness it really should be there. I mean, they're re-including \\"The Gathering\\" and \\"In the Beginning\\" though those had already been released... why not get it right and make it complete?As for the movies... \\"The Gathering\\", \\"In the Beginning\\", and \\"A Call to Arms\\" are the ones to pay attention to as they are part of the canon and overall arcs. \\"In the Beginning\\" is especially stellar, having an epic quality in and of itself. Of course to any newcomer, it is a severe (and I DO mean SEVERE) mistake to watch it before watching season 3 at least. The fact that the remaining movies had little to do with the seasonal arcs and themes, something with which Strakzynsky had addicted me, is what made me like them less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5","review":"I love the Babylon 5 series, so of course I am going to like this. Of the movies, \\"In the Beginning\\" is fabulous, with backstory for many of the characters from the series. \\"The Gathering\\" was the pilot for the series, and unfortunately not all that great, luckily they still picked up the series. The special effects in Thirdspace, and River of Souls is good but the story is a bit lacking in Thirdspace. And \\"A Call to Arms\\" is just a bit odd, but gets us started on Crusade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon 5 the movies (packaging)","review":"The content of the movies is great no problems there, but getting a full set that isn't damaged seems to be a problem for Warner Brothers. Something in the way that they package the dvd's shakes movie disc one and three loose in the case. They then tend to get scratched by the center piece that is supposed to hold them in place. After two sets arrived damaged, I'm still waiting for a good set to be shipped to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointing quality","review":"There are some quality issues at various places through out the seasons. They appear to be quality boxes, but its like a bad after market rip of the original DVD's. The artwork on the DVD's looks quality (what I would expect), but overall made me wonder if these were all legit from the production company.. I would steer clear of these, as I do not remember the quality being this low when I originally watched these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5: The Movie Collection","review":"DVD arrived on time, was exciting to watch all five movies in a row. Movies answered questions that the tv show didn't and had more adventures to continue the Babylon 5 world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon 5 The Movie Collection","review":"Turns out that most of the movies were not very good, just the one that shows how things started."},{"rating":"1","title":"B5-Movie Collection","review":"One of the movies - 'In the Beginning' got to me all scratched up. I tried playing it but it froze up on me toward the end of the movie. I gave Amazon 2 stars for this because at least they promptly refunded me my entire purchase back + the shipping. I don't know what happened but it's kind of wierd that only one of the DvDs was damaged. It was in the socket when I got it too so I don't think it was caused by shipping. Oh well, buyer beware I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"I received my order and the hinges and or casings for 3 or the 5 seasons were damaged. I could see one, but three?! Since I couldn't return the damaged ones. I returned them all. I may re-order. I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some lousy","review":"Loved In the Beginning and Third Space. The other three were duds. We own the complete 5 seasons and dearly love B5. Two stars because only two movies are worth watching. And Martin Sheen is TERRIBLE. Gawd, who cast him in this? He walks around like his contacts don't fit and can't decide what kind of accent he should have. Painful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"BABYLON-5-AHOLIC !!!!!","review":"What can I say, if you really like B5 this collection is a must have!!!! All the movies are very enjoyable and the case the dvds come in is made out of plastic(NOT PAPER) and is one of the NICEST cases EVER!!!!The whole collection will be a great addition to anyones collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Blu-ray versions????","review":"Where are the blu-ray versions of this epic sci fi series?? They need to release the the whole run and the tv movies all in blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another visit to a favourite place","review":"The quality of these movies varies from average (Thirdspace) to excellent (In The Beginning). But that is not why I am giving this collection 5 stars.Babylon 5 is a story told over five seasons. In this story we grow close to characters who grow and change like real people. The Londo and G'kar in season five is to see characters with strengths and weaknesses shaped by extraordinary circumstance.These movies give us an added treat. JMS has given us the opportunity to step out of the regular schedule and learn in more detail about some of the back story we can only infer from the series. The Babylon 5 universe is of enough depth that I wish we could have had even more of these special movies.As a bonus, we get commentaries by JMS. While it is always interesting to learn what he had in mind, Babylon 5 speaks eloquently even without commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan","review":"My husband got me to watch the series and I bought this for him for part of his birthday present.

If you haven't seen it, it's defintely worth watching this set and the series. Many of the \\"movies\\" here ran on TV. Movie 1: The Gathering was a review of the characters for me. Movie 2: In the Beginning is the best of the five. The remaining three were fairly weak, in my view. They were OK, but I won't watch them again.One major weakness is that none of these movies contain the shadow wars. I will have to find that somewhere else, b/c I want to see the classic battle scenes and the good/evil contrast again.Overall, these 5 movies were good. Three or four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5 Movie Collection","review":"I thought the movie collection was very insightful. It helped to answer many questions I had about the TV series.

These are pre-HDTV recordings so don'r expect the clarity to be like todays tech. They are a little grainy but not too distracting. If your a BAB5 fan, I would recommend them for your DVD collection.The cover had a small piece gouged and torn on the lower rear edge, that's why I gave it four stars Plus the recording quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Babylon 5 series, but wish this had been complete","review":"I would give 5 stars to the Babylon 5 series and world, but I am giving this set a 4 because it is missing \\"Legend of the Rangers\\" and because the packaging seems cheap and I would have preferred it if it had had hard plastic cases for the dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 movie collection - much better value than the UK equivilant","review":"5 movie collection - much better value than the UK equivilent,although you run the risk of UK import duties when buying it in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon 5","review":"loved the TV series and own all 7 years of the series.The characters are well developed and well portrayed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, though not essential","review":"Of course seeing the pilot is tremendously good background on how the original vision was transformed. And the other movies are pretty good. Particularly strong are ITB and ACTA.I'm a bit disappointed the Legend of the Rangers movie wasn't included - to make a truly complete B5 Movie DVD set, especially since AFAIK this is currently unavailable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Having purchased all the Babylon 5 related DVD's it's going be awhile before I have the time to view them all.Having said that delivery and the added viewing material and commentary to the DVD's are fine and I'm happy with that, however the actual copies are very disappointing. Screen pixilation and dropped frames from the video are a real shame. Whether Warner Brothers were trying to save money or compress the video to fit the series on less DVD's I don't know, but the result is, as I said, terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong side of history as usually for the intellectuals","review":"This is an awesome book which helps the reader understand why intellectuals always seem to be on the wrong side of history. They loved Communism even when it was obvious that Lenin & Stalin were exterminating hoards of people! They are defective in their thinking and they stick to it. The author has a quote at the beginning of the book. \\"A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLEGENCE CAN BE INVESTED IN IGNORANCE WHEN THE NEED FOR ILLUSION IS DEEP.\\" (Saul Bellows) . This book walks you through the 'needs' that these intellectuals seem to have which continually seems to cause them to deny the stark realities around them & cling to their 'ideologies'. I am so glad I read this book as I just laugh now when I hear so much of what is on the news. I GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tote Tray","review":"These tote trays are great, the only ones I have ever seen with a drawer below.

The English speachdistracting me from focusing on the vietnamese part.I didn't buy thesebook and CDs to learn English. Major disappointment. I tossed themaway after listening to the first few tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do full justice","review":"This isn't the best recording of the Brandenburg Concerti available. The performance is plodding, overly technical, deficient in energy, lacking a real sense of the \\"ensemble\\" a good Bach performance needs, not as graceful and uplifting as the music demands. Background \\"clicks\\" can also be heard occasionally. The \\"bonus\\" piece, the Concerto for Harpsichord, Strings and Continuo in D major at the end of the disc, comes on too forcefully with the downbeats -- a bit like the opening chords of The Who's \\"Tommy\\" -- and the harpsichord is too dominant throughout the piece. Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 is given the best treatment, and the Berlin Chamber Orchestra is to be commended for including the full-length Adagio Cadenza as the second movement, which can be rarely found. But don't be swayed by this disc's low price. Invest in the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice by Anna Kavan","review":"When I first read 'Ice' (from Brian Aldiss' published recommendation) I enjoyed it but didn't think it was great. It seemed to me to be about Kavan's struggle with drugs - a struggle she couldn't win. But this was a bit remote for me since I have never taken drugs. Some years later I read another Kavan novel - 'The Eagle's Nest'. This is a hot novel in comparison to the coldness of 'Ice' and, perhaps, more akin to my own personality. Anyway, it encouraged me to read 'Ice' again and now I saw it as so much stronger because it's (to me anyway) not about a futile struggle against drug addiction but something much more cosmic - the futile struggle that we all embark on against death.I have read more Kavan since then - 'A Scarcity of Love' is great. 'Let Me Alone' is something else again. Will I ever dare reread it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, haunting, complex","review":"As the product description states above, this score mirrors the film by being appropriately understated and nuanced. The title track is both melancholy and haunting, a feeling which runs through the entire soundtrack. Other parts have quite a bit of tension. One gets the feeling that there is always something bubbling under the suface here -- nothing is as it seems, which of course, is the intention of the film. Alexandre Desplat did a stellar job."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those that enjoy military SF...","review":"While the author's style adds little to push the edge of the envelope in SciFi it is, when action is presented, a fast paced exciting read. This helps to cover the logic inconsistencies that pop-up from time to time. His character development leans too heavily on sterotypes, but that doesn't get in the way of the story line. One petty observation, my First Edition had far too many typos, errors and word ommissions, which I hope will be corrected in future editions. I make enough of these myself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This book is a prime example of the pitfalls of self-published books. All it takes to be published is paying the listed fee. Quality and accuracy are not a requirement.A little checking has turned up the fact that author has never been employed by NASA and was never on the shuttle investigation team. The inconsistencies and ramblings grow from there.No redeaming value as either a commentary on the space program or entrepreneurship. I suggest looking elsewhere for a real book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Launch Fever","review":"After reading Launch Fever I felt as if the author truly let the reader inside his personal world. Tim's easy going writing style was most fluid as he took the reader on a journey through life and entrepreneur-ism to the real world of business. I especially liked the NASA insider's view and the lessons learned. A timely read with great advise from the guy on the street with his ear to the ground and his mind in the heavens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery still unsolved","review":"I read this book many years ago and just re-read it last year. It is a chillingly mysterious story of a man driven by circumstance into a plan of deception that ended in an empty sailboat found floating in the Atlantic. It is almost like a story of morals. Mr. Crowhurst sets out to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat race. Finding himself not up to the task he decides to \\"fake\\" his voyage and does a remarkable job of it - until, apparently, the strain of it all drives him insane.I found it a fascinating book, well done, well documented, and as thrilling as any fiction novel. In fact, I suspect that because it really did happen makes it a more compelling story. I am a fan of all sailing adventure books and this one has all the elements of a global sailboat race, plus the mystery of Mr. Crowhurst's last days of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This needs to be a movie!","review":"This is a fascinating true story. Stories about a lone man fighting against the odds...man against man, man against nature...or, in this case, against his own failures, can make one think about one's own weak grasp on reality. This story ranks right up there with \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" I seriously think the story of Donald Crowhurst should be made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Story","review":"A page turner. Well written story about a rather unusual fellow who created a fantastic ruse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather Fascinating","review":"Hmm...I was on the fence about this book to begin with. I got it thinking it was the story of some heroic maritime feat, only to find it was about a colossal HOAX. However, I followed each small decision until Crowhurst had maneuvered himself into a situation from which there was no way out: suicide...ruin...or death? A documentary has been made about the same subject, called Deep Water. It's not much good as a stand-alone DVD, but is a good addition to the book. I ended up being pretty fascinated by the whole affair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The other reviews said it all. Great book. I like the true-life adventure genre, and this one is near the top of the list. Crowhurst really lost it at the end. Wow.If you liked this book, you might try Adrift, by Steve Calahan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine study of madness and a great see story to boot","review":"This is a classic study of a psychologically broken man drawn into fraud by his emotional needs. It's also a sea story and a detective story in one. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates yachting, human weakness, and mysterious happenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best FRIENDS!","review":"This book is hilarious! It has Friends trivia and little tid-bits here and there about the show and guest stars. One of my favorite parts was Gunther's foreward. This is the book for any huge Friends fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I checked this book out at a local store before plunking out my cash for it... and decided it was completely not worth it. It's nothing but a lot of trivia questions that are a) insulting to a true fan or b) too obscure for a casual viewer to know. I expected behind-the-scenes stories and trivia, not this thrown-together mishmash.The only thing halfway worth getting the book for is the essay written by the man who plays Gunther (can't think of his name right now).So unless you're a huge Gunther fan (or an obsessed 'gotta have all merchandise' Friends fan), don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the War on Drugs needs to end","review":"After Prohibition makes the excellent argument against the U.S Government's Un-Constitutional War on Drugs. Experts like former Governor of New Mexico Gary E. Johnson(A strong contender for the 2012 Republican Presidential Nomination) make the economic and moral case for ending a War that currently imprisons well over 1.5 million members of the U.S Population, most of whom are minorities.This book clearly illustrates that we can end this war against personal consumption choices, and still teach our children how to stay away from destructive substances such as Heroin and Methamphetamine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil DRM","review":"This is NOT a Compact Disc: this is \\"Copy Controlled\\" which means you can't play it on your portable music player and you may or may not be able to play it on a CD player.I'd give it more stars, but DRM sucks. Why can I not listen to music I paid for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small cages","review":"I wish this product had measurements listed it much larger than it looks.

She took to sleeping in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"I was hoping to get the item pictured in the description. Unfortunately I received a different item with the same item number. Apparently the manufacturer must have replaced the older model with a newer one. The photo should be updated to reflect the model that goes with the item number.Sadly, the litter box went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"The litter pan is not as pictured. As another reviewer commented, the ones being sent have curvy, higher sides. My rabbit is used to the one shown in the picture and cannot jump from the side into the one being shipped (the one with curvy, higher sides). Therefore, she hates this litter pan and will not use it. I agree that Amazon needs to display a picture of the actual product being shipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe how good this box is!","review":"I've been listening to rockabilly music since the 50's and have been collecting 45's, LPs, and now CDs for almost 50 years. I thought I had heard it all, but I was wrong. Sure, some of the songs in this set are familiar, but many of them were totally unknown to me. On top of that, the sound quality is amazing, so even old favorites are exciting to hear. As if that wasn't enough, there is an excellent and informative booklet with great pictures. If you like this kind of music, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my collection!","review":"Paid a premium price for these discs, but it was worth it. Despite a few mainstream hits that could have been replaced withmore 'dangerous' songs, maybe by Gene Vincent for example, most of these songs are keepers - stuff I didn't know existed, and would be very hard to find on their own.All in all, an excellent addition to anyone's 1950s music collection. For the most part, this is the stuff parents didn't want their kids listening to. Some of it was banned from the radio; a few songs the record companies would not put out. If you want a taste of the 'underground' music of the 50s, get this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 50's Rockabilly Collection!!!","review":"If you're looking for a box set with nothing but early rockabilly, this is it. From Gene Vincent's Woman Love, to Don Willis' Boppin highschool baby,from Johnny Powers Long Blond Hair,Red Rose Lips to Joe Clay's Ducktail,this set absolutely rocks.Plenty of echo and great guitar leads and most of these tracks are unknown.I have Buddy Holly on vinyl and I'd never heard Down the Line, or Rock around with Ollie Vee. Freakin' Sweet!! Not quite the same as his top pop hits, but like everything else he did, he did it well. You can almost see the tailfins and jukeboxes while you spin all these great tracks. I highly recommend this set,and with over 100 tracks, (and a few movie trailer tracks thrown in between a couple songs),it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockabilly At Its Best","review":"Every song on this four CD set is excellent. I enjoy listening to all four CDs. The CD set comes with a book with information about every song and artist and lots of photos. This was a great suprise when I opened the package.

This can't be accomplished easily. You must remove the entire apparatus from your belt, and pull the phone out. The case is so tight that when you take the phone from the case to use the keyboard, the case pulls the battery cover off. If you do not use the keybaord on a daily basis this is your case. If it is used daily, find something else. It also has plastic over the screen so to use the stylus it must be removed as well. If you are using the phone only, then get this case, otherwise, this goes in the box with the other 20 unusable cell phone cases I have aquired for this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowie is the only real star here, has good message for kids.","review":"So your search for anything Bowie has finally led you here. The story seems like a resurrected after school special with silly adventures and dialogue that just doesn't exist for kids. But then David (Mr. Rice) starts speaking... and things don't seem so bad. Uh, then again. A 400 year old man you would think wouldn't require kids to let's say, exhume a corpse! There is a message to the movie, very predictable, but this movie doesn't get past it's simpleton plot.

It is sometimes eloquent, but seems to just describe the human experience of falling in love, without drawing any interesting conclusions or making any hypotheses. I kept waiting for something to make me think or go \\"aha!\\". But after a few chapters I found myself wondering what the point of the book was, and getting bored as it drags on describing.Its style is also not my style, launching into a lot of description without enough examples. Those examples that are used are from literature and bible stories, which to me seem to further separate the book from reality. I would have been much more intrigued by stories or examples of real people.Maybe I missed something, but I just didn't see where it was going, and got too bored to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A banal book about love...","review":"Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, but I found it so boring I could not get into it.

A lot of work and analysis has taken place since this was written, so something like Fred Anderson's \\"Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America\\", (also a great book) is very useful for bring the facts up to date.

While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies.

The author gave a suggested book list, does it mean he wants us to buy and read the other five or six books and then take the questions? I am quite sure I will pass the clep by doing all these.

I took the CLEP exam two days ago, and thumbing through the book just now, the questions in the book just don't seem to coincide much with the content of the computerized CLEP exam. Perhaps the questions are from old test banks, or it could be that the author just winged it. I dunno.So is this book worthless? Well, no. It could be of some value in preparing for the CLEP exam. Still, I largely agree with other reviews on this page, and I don't think the price of the book is worth the modest return a reader is likely to get back from it. I'd suggest buying the official CLEP guide instead, and following the exam outline to prepare. ....

Aspects of them all make thier way into the the show's inner most working, and Jana Riess guides you along as you explore how and why. It is my favorite Buffy book by far.

The shoe guy at the mall asked if I liked them because he wants to start carrying them at his store in the mall. Hopefully he does, but I'll probably still buy them here because they'll be 20-30 bucks cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect hardware","review":"There is absolutely no excuse that this product would ship with incorrect sized bolts. Four of the six mounting bolts were 1/2\\" but all six washers and nuts provided were 3/8\\" as were all the mounting holes in the plastic and the metal reinforcing plates. I mean, I expect this kind of poor quality control from say Harbor Freight, but I did not expect it from Rola.

Filling up with water took about 11 hrs. Our pool tilts towards one side where it is also abt 8\\" deeper on one side. The filter works well and is quite powerful. The volleyball and net that come with it have been a hit with the kids. Ladder is a bit shakey but works. The only thing is that we discovered a tiny pinhole halfway up the wall. Of course this was after the pool was filled so although a repair kit came with it, we couldn't use it to stop the leak. We covered it up with duct tape which gets wet and doesn't quite stop the leak. We'll just fix it whenever we empty out the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk junk junk","review":"The major problem withthis pool is the pump/filter system. Cartridge filters are inferior to sand filters to begin with, but this pump is too weak to circulate the water properly. It works fine if the water is clear to begin with, but if you leave for a couple of hot days and you come back to a green or cloudy pool, good luck getting it clean. You absolutely have to leave the pump running 24/7 and many of these pumps burn out in less than 2 seasons because of that. I would not be surprised if you have to shock the water 2 to 3 times per week, and that wreaks havoc on the vinyl. This pool is far more expensive and time consuming to keep clean than a regular above ground pool with a more powerful sand filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Status Quo - 'At Their Best' (St.Clair)","review":"A great 24-track anthology of the long running UK band Status Quo.In ways,it's even better than their 'Singles Collection,1966-1973' 2-CD(see my review)because it's more direct AND to the point.Especially for the price,you simply cannot beat this deal here.Plus,there's at least seven cuts here that are not on the 'Singles...' 2-CD release.Most of these are quite good,like the Lemon Piper's cover \\"Green Tambourine\\",\\"Lazy Poker Blues\\",\\"Do You Live In Fire\\",\\"Daughter\\",the psych gem \\"Elizabeth Dream\\",\\"Need Your Love\\" and \\"Spinning Wheel Blues\\".For any fans who believe the Quo were simply a one-hit-wonder,you're half-right.In the states,they were.However,in the UK,they had a string of top ten hit singles.So there!Definitively a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, old-fashioned, and whimsical.","review":"This story by Jarrell is gentle, mythical, and stands the test of time. A short story about a solitary hunter on an island, who meets a mermaid, and together form a family with animals they meet. The tone is warm and soft, kind and at times bittersweet.While perfect for bedtime, cold or rainy days, this book is appealing to me even as i grow older. The subtle lessons about companionship, newness, differences, loneliness, loss, and joy are not forced to the fore. Rather, an old-fashioned sense of creating an environment as a way to tell a story is key here. Inviting wilderness, homely relationships, and just enough magic and mystery to compel the story forward.One of my most treasured books since i was a young child, the is a timeless and infinitely re-readable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Magic","review":"No one gets away from me without my reccomending this book to read.

Chapter by chapter, the author discusses the right's attack on federal judges, the teaching of evolution in schools, secular society, and women's rights to choose. There is a very scary segment within our population that has a firm hold on the Republican party and the people that Goldberg reports on are it. Goldberg achieves a good balance between first-hand reporting and anecdotal chronicling of this rising movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dated but so disturbing it should still be read","review":"I have had a long interest in various fringe groups and extremists amongst the religious right in America. This book details the rise of militant christian groups intent on \\"taking the land\\" and remaking America and the world in their vision of theocracy.The author is mostly fair and balanced although her secularism is never questioned, she gets as far inside these movements and what they mean for America as she can. She is at her best when describing the process of how fundamentalists have accumulated political power to themselves, often under the radar of the political establishment. The only flaw in this book is that it firmly dates itself to the George W Bush era rather than taking a broader view.

The author doesn't just predict the end of our civilization, however. She does a good job of identifying organizations that can lobby our governmental representation to reject the broken philosophies of people like James Dobson and Leslee Unruh, and how we can participate in the process.

It offers nothing new, but rather reaffirms the preconceived anecdotal ideas of the secularist.Goldberg should limit her writing to opinion pieces, because the lack of research and knowledge she displayed in this book is evidenced by her confusion over theological ideas and misconstruing political movements in history.This was not a book that deals with honest research, rather Goldberg wrote a propaganda piece that vilifies a group of people who oppose her ideological beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Young Woman from Outer Space Visits Middle America","review":"This book is a left-wing, ultra-liberal polemical diatribe that was written by a young woman who, while a college student at SUNY Buffalo, seems to have overdosed on Hannah Arendt's book about the rise of Nazi totalitarianism in Europe and thinks it is happening here because of the Bush Administration. She did not, apparently, take American History 101, with the result that she exhibits no knowledge or understanding about religion in American history and grossly exaggerates the importance of today's Christian fundamentalist movement in America politics. Her suggestions about what the liberal left must do politically to prevent America from becoming a Christian Nation are truly hilarious.

Really, this book is a gem, and it marks a turning point in Peanuts history. The preface with the interview to Whoopi Goldberg is also remarkable: it gives an unusual insight in Schulz's strip and characters, and it celebrates Schulz art as being universal and profoundly humane: although being a conservative, Schulz never pressed his points in his strip, and humanity prevailed on political bias, and Whoopi Goldberg recognized that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great ending to a fabulous series","review":"In this book Emily, Adriane, and Kara go on a quest to find Avalon.

There are elements of the classic drama of gothic southerners, the powerplays and gossip of a small town, and the romance that blossoms despite itself. Elyssa Henry shows that love is part of the circle of life, and that everyone is subject to its law. The seeming coincidences that everyone notices when first in love are highlighted in this book, life-like in how people are drawn together by forces that could split them apart. I enjoyed the author's attention to detail, and vivid descriptions of the setting. No one could doubt that the story takes place in the South, and the tense confrontations between the traditional Old South and the \\"yankee-fied\\" New South are especially accurate.

The same density of language which charms the reader in the beginning becomes an irritant as hundreds of pages pass and almost literally nothing happens. Characters are well drawn, but in gloomy colors which evoke no sympathy. Not a single character stands as a hero; few are even likable. The narrator is a long-winded bore. In many respects, Adrian, the subject of this fictitious biography, remains inscrutable to the very end. Having loved THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN, I persevered to the end in the hope of finding something to make the time invested seem worthwhile. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books you've never thought to read!","review":"Forget preconceptions about this book. This is not a dry, stylistic, modernist retelling of the Faust story, but rather, and more effectively it is an investigation of evil, how it seems to strike everywhere and when least expected, from the minor deceptions committed daily to a country being led to ruin by a megalomanical leader, and how evil is often inexplicible, random, hardly satanic at all. Mann is an author of ideas but he is also a master of description. The novel is filled with wonderful, dark, and thought provoking images and scenes. And although the devil seems to abound, a sense of hope rings throughout Dr. Faustus. Reading this book gives insight into the seduction of evil as well as the need for evil to be explained. A difficult book with great rewards, many of its images will remain long after the last page. An astonishing creation"},{"rating":"2","title":"great and dark novel","review":"Thomas Mann was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and this was his last and perhaps his greatest novel. Reading it is a daunting challenge as it merges history with philosophy and religion with music history and composition. This novel requires great concentration. Sustained reading is however greatly rewarded. I am still mulling over much that is in this novel. Written and presented against the backdrop of the closing years of World War II and the horrors of Nazi Germany, the novel is also clearly a statement against Hitler and the Nazis, and Mann from exile was a determined opponent of the Nazis. A very important work of literature on several levels!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video is the most intruiguing of its kind","review":"I found this video to be the most complete documentary regarding Roswell.

It's not worth the money. The unit leaked profusely from the onset from the male hose connection that attaches to the inflow tube on the reel. I swapped out numerous washers, applied teflon tape, etc., to the connection to try and stop the leaking, but to no avail. I had a suncast reel prior to this one for a number of years that was much better built and more durable. This replacement was basically the same model, but I can only echo the sentiments of the others that the quality has certainly diminished. It is flimsy and made with cheap plastic parts with a very limited lifespan. Maybe be o.k. with use for lighter hoses, but not the heavy duty ones. I'll be looking for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality plastic that doesn't last","review":"The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"Unbelievably bad quality. Crappy plastic hose connection stripped while attaching hose to reel.

The gap between the sides of reel and the sides of the cart is just wide enough to allow the hose to flop over the top of the reel and get stuck between them. Often when I pull the hose from the cart the hose gets stuck in the gap forcing me to walk back to free it, often times more than once. The short supply hose that came with the hose reel cart was defective, for it had a bad spraying leak where the male brass end is crimped to the hose.

Punnett squares are done wrong, and images of cells in interphase stained to visualize the Barr bodies are supposed to show the Y-chromosome.

It gave a detailed look at one of our most obscure presidents. I've been interested in him ever since. Perhaps the only flaw of the book was the forced omissions of the letters between Mr.Harding and his mistress in Marion, Ohio. This tragic presidency was brought to life with the fascinating writing of Mr. Russell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even-handed despite sensationalism","review":"I feared a muckfest driven by author's urge to sell copy by mining poorly researched intonations of Harding's mixed-race heritage. Not so - a comprehensive review of the man, the character and the foibles are well presented. Excellent weave of the inscrutable strands of political fate that lead such an ordinary individual to presidential office. Especially revealing are the facts of his romantic dalliances (altho some text deletion due to lawsuit injunction) which reveal a simple-minded hedonist at the core. Very engaging read."},{"rating":"2","title":"IrishYankee","review":"I am a Yankee fan, so what more could one ask for.

The video and audio are about the same as all other Heart vids. Just very disappointed. I think it should be a personal choice as nothing is really wrong, but I was hoping for different material. Hoenstly what I would truly like is one or more DVDs from the OLD DAYS with the original line-up. I've been able to piece together one of their first televised performances from clips posted on YouTube. THAT was a great concert, and why is it that Heart can't do this themselves, or is Mushroom Records (now long time defuncy) still got some control over all that terrific material?

This album is a loud psychedellic heavy blues album. A very classic 60s album and great for anyone who loves loud acid rock music.

Actually, it is the real beginning of heavy metal. But, it is better than any heavy metal I have heard in the last 20 years. There is not a bad song on this album and you don't have to like heavy metal to like this album simply because it sort of takes over your brain. Dicky Peterson is fantastic. You will wonder how three guys could have made all this sound. There was no overdubbing on this album. This is it. Best when the volume is cranked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I CANT go back.","review":"I bought this cd thinking I remembered just how hot the band was, and how they were the progenitors of something that has since evolved into a wide genre of hard, loud, faster-than; I guess that all the drugs I did really colored my perspective.

I wish I had been old enough to check these guys out back in '67 '68. I can only imagine the impact Blue Cheer had on audiences with their dirty RAW grungy thick wall of guitar and thundering bass. Not to mention the brain bashing highly percussive drumming style.Blue Cheer were WAY WAY, did I say WAY? ahead of their time. To say this album withstands the test of time would be an extreme understatement. This music is heavy plain and simple. Sure you can hear the obvious 60's blues, psychedelic influences from the era. But Blue Cheer created music that you could head bang to like any Metal band from the 80s. I can listen to Vincebus Eruptum sandwiched between Slayer, Judas Priest or Black Sabbath any day. if you like Heavy rock/Metal music, YOU NEED this album now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"Reminded me of when I was in 5th grade riding the scool bus home and the driver had this song blasting on the radio system.

Hendrix may have fused volume with blues and jazz, and the MC5 may have staged a punk insurrection. But no one rocked harder than Blue Cheer.\\"Summertime Blues\\" turns Eddie Cochran's rockabilly into a mosh frenzy. \\"Out Of Focus\\" is a head in the vice fever dream, and \\"Rock Me Baby\\" may have been the heaviest take on the blues in rock yet.Blue Cheer were not the kids marching, or going to college. They were the guys that would have worked in a machine shop, smoked lots of weed, drank lots of beer, and grown their hair, stedily. This was music for the kids in the steel towns, doomed to factory jobs, and the songs punched as hard as these kids could,No politics, no protest, no power flowers.

When I purchased the LP back in 1971 I amazed my friends with its incredible trio. Tony McPhee is nothing short of godlike in his wielding of the ax, and Cruickshank and Pustelnik stoutly back him up. The title cut is in four parts, each obtaining increasing levels of volume and dexterity. The lead into \\"Split-Part Two\\" is especially eye-opening. The four other tracks, including \\"Cherry Red\\" are loud and fast acid blues.A special bonus in this package is a live concert of parts one, two, and four of the \\"Split\\", plus \\"Cherry Red\\".

While some films noir suffer from being overly stiff (cf. The Big Combo), this one's fluidity is definitely in evidence. John Ireland is the standout here, but the two female leads--Sheila Ryan and Jane Randolph--are almost as good. A real plus, plotwise, is the 'good girl' falling (at least temporarily) for the bad guy.Similarly, the 'bad girl' ultimately turns good. These reversals, coupled with the bad guy's peculiar behavior (the infamous perfuming of his bullets) and an unusual shoot-out in a long-after-closing bar full of upside-down barstools make for an interesting film.Hugh Beaumont's good guy cop is a well-matched foil to John Ireland's Duke Martin, whose occasionally drunk girlfriend meets with Beaumont, near the end, to rat out what she thinks is her two-timing boyfriend.Definitely one of the better films noir on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"What a wonderfull book.

Once I got it home and set up, I realized how impractical it was - the bumper wouldn't fit due to the solid \\"headboard\\", as well as the thickness of the legs (the crib mobile that I purchased wouldn't fit for the same reasons); it's pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to change the sheet without having to take the mattress completely out every time, and when the mattress is at the lowest setting and you're 5'3\\" like I am, it's extremely difficult to put your sleeping 23 month old in the crib!

WELL...These things I didn't realize before we made the purchase. 1.The front rail doesn't go down and as your child grows it is a pain in the @!! 2. It's almost impossible to change the sheets. 3. The bumper can not be tied onto the headboard because it is 1 solid piece, so we put velcro strips to hold the bumper. when we moved the matress down and attempted to take the velro strips off the headboard it pulled the wood right off the crib!!! Leaving splinters. According to the sales person at Babies R Us in Everett,Ma. the bumper is only supposed to be use till the baby is 4 months, and anytime you put tape on something there is a chance the finish could come off. \\"Oh Thanks\\" for that information sir.Anyway, don't waste your time putting this together or your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It will bring back pleasant and fond memories of childhood. It also gave me alot to think about. The book focuses on the role the father in the child's life.

It is a good book for everyone especially mothers and fathers. The stories were so real that I coulld emphathize with sad stories and was emotional over the happy stories.

Then in late February 2009 I noticed that it wouldn't plug in anymore. When I examined the mini-USB end, I saw that a little piece inside was sunken in and caused the metal inlet to be pushed inside the rubber body when plugging it into the player. I tried to use tweezers to pull up the metal form inside, but it was no use. I threw out the charger and am buying another one to see if it happens again.

It makes Varg Vikernes (Burzum) sound like the Tallis Scholars in comparison. Too bad that Zak Stevens left before making this album. If you like metal that is driven by melodic guitar playing, with lots of counterpoint, rather than overly catchy pop vocal melodies singing maudlin stories, get Savatage's Edge of Thorns, Gutter Ballet, Hall or the Mountain King, or even Sirens and The Dungeons Are Calling, instead.

There was very little action and what little there was was over way too quick (like 10 pages of talking, 1 page of getting attacked by tentacles, then another 10 pages of talking about said tentacles). There are also too many in-jokes. Lots of \\"nudge, nudge, did ya get that name I just dropped?\\" That's fun occasionally but every other paragraph it gets old fast.

However, an overt bias against Billy is apparent from the outset. Carr attempts to guide the reader's reactions with overstated adjectives to describe the shenanigans of Billy and his minions, and I found Carr's style to be simplistic, biased and insulting. In short, Carr's hack job on Billy is extreme and undermines an otherwise well-done sypnosis on Whitey and his vast legion of enablers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Detailed","review":"Carr provides a hit-by-hit detailing of every murder in Boston over a number of years - many committed by James (Whitey) Bulger. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Billy, obtained a law degree, became involved in countless acts of patronage, etc., rose to President of the State Senate, and eventually was appointed President of the University of Massachusetts.Too long and detailed.

I've been a long time fan of Howie's radio show and his railing against corrupt pol's and the Brothers Bulger in particular. He's done an excellent job compiling the vast amount of information contained in this book. I've been around Boston my entire life and have always been fascinated by true crime stories. The way that he's weaved all the sordid details together will astound and amaze. It will also kill any faith you may have had left in the political class in Massachusetts. A great read, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitey's not the only one who got away with murder","review":"What is really surprising about Carr's book is the lack of contact between the two title characters. Rather than being an expose on the links between the worlds of politics and crime, what we have instead is essentially the same character in two parallel universes. It is almost eerie how both individuals concurrently rose to power, facilitated by a similar set of circumstances and enablers. The book moves back and forth fairly easily between these two worlds, though the political side of it tends to be the easier read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howie ain't no fat bastard!","review":"I listen to Howie everyday on my way home from work and he is the man!

Seeing the semmingly good (Billy) and evil (Whitey) being basically the same - evil, greedy and corrupt. It is a great story about how people in positions of power may be just as criminally minded as the ones behind bars, just with a bigger expense account and showcase (Billy's St. Patrick Day's annual breafast).I confess I got a little lost with all of the characters in this true story. For future printings I would hope that there is a chart of some sort to show the different players in this real life drama of crime, corruption and politics in Boston.Highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in politics. Interesting at the end, Howie credidted Mitt Romney for the outsting Billy from the UMass Highly Paid Post.

It makes the re-recitation of 'facts' appear as an effort to cast every conclusion as foregone, and that readers should just let the author do his thinking for them. And the \\"weighty\\" thesis that these brothers are one in the same is just this side of the \\"Weekly World News\\".If you want a serious read on the matter, then the book by the Boston Globe reporters on the topic is an option.

But the book is just a long tirade. His confusing, rambling detail shows the reader just how far Mr. Carr needed to stretch facts to meet his hysterical opinions. He gives us absolutely no understanding of what could be such an interesting story because his inflammatory accusations are so unbalanced. Ugh, more of the same one-sided talk show nonsense from a man who's obviously got a grudge for some reason and now wants to make money from it. If you're really curious, borrow it from the library.

Those who are used to his brutal ridicule of Bulger et al. may be surprised to find that this is mostly a work of straightforward reporting.

I also bought BRUTAL by Kevin Weeks and was amazed at how much I learned. That book is worth the money for sure. It's funny but Carr is a journalist and Weeks is a criminal (I saw the 60 Minutes episode with both of them and thought Carr looked like a little sneak) yet Carr has written a dishonest and inaccurate book while Weeks at least told the truth.

But I guess when you have your own radio show and newspaper column, you begin to believe that whatever you say or write has to be correct, without following through on your journalistic mandate to get it right! Aside from gleaning his facts from previously written articles by his fellow Herald scribes, Howie didn't even seem to bother to check the transcripts of all the court cases over the years. My advice--skip this clip job and read BRUTAL by Kevin Weeks. At least the stuff in his book was vetted by 3 juries, the DEA, the DOJ, the Mass.

Where is his proof? If that is so then why wasn't the agent indicted and found guilty? The answer is because neither of them were corrupt....PERIOD! I have known both of theose agents for many years.

Another reviewer notes that some of the poems may be difficult for children, and I second that. Few rhyme. Now, whatever your stance on rhymes and poetry, I think most folks who know children will agree that rhyming is key. To a child, it's what makes a poem a poem. And for the most part, these poems don't rhyme, and are sure to baffle the young, would-be poetry fan. Aside from that, the majority were written more than a century ago, and the wordage is awkward to a young modern child's ears.A children's poetry anthology can be many things, but a young reader ought to be able to hole up in a corner somewhere and read, understand, follow, be delighted and tickled now and then, and generally come to realize that hey--I like poetry!

In my case, the crack I was repairing extended beyond the covering material.2. The clear epoxy was mixed according to the instruction. However, when brushed over the repair material, it was thick leaving brush marks and then when dry was cloudy rather than clear.End result, I need to figure a way to remove the application without damaging the lens and try another product, or spend all those big bucks and buy a replacement taillight (which was the reason for seeking a repair system in the first place)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insane price!!!!","review":"You are insane if you pay $35 for this media guide.

Neil Postman's writing styles rambles quite a bit which is very distracting. Also, the reader has to assume that his seemingly random string of facts that he brings us to agrue his case are true. But once you get past that and stick with it, his occasional gems of insight show through (especially in chapter #9 entitled \\"Scientism\\"). Neil Postman's reminds me of an eccentric professor that you would have in college: while he is very perceptive and enlightening in the classroom environment, you soon realise when class is over that he is dressed as if he didn't know it was 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Pointless","review":"I do not agree with many things in this book, I never really found a point to it.

It is carelessy written, its arguments are logically shaky to say the least, and it contains glaring factual errors.I was all the more disappointed because I had previously read Postman's excellent book \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\". Furthermore, Postman's topic in \\"Technopoly\\" is a serious one and deserves a serious and lucid treatment which, alas, it does not get here.As I read this book I became more and more exasperated by its shoddy thinking, but the \\"last straw\\" which made me bang the book shut in disgust was Postman's statement that a Turing Machine is a computer which can pass a Turing Test."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STUDENT'S VIEW OF POSTMAN'S TECHNOPOLY","review":"What was Neil Postman thinking? Having been forced to suffer through this book for a college class, I feel dirty and violated.

If you can keep your attention on it long enough to make it to the end of chapter 2, then you've pretty much read the entire thing. He says the same thing in every chapter, just in different words. The worst part is that he rambles, boy, does he ramble. On and on he goes about absolutely nothing in particular. We get it, he hates technology, but the fact that he wrote 240 pages of the same thing over and over is a bit much. I will never read this book again. It's going in my fireplace soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolishness from academia","review":"Information can be lethal and so can lack of information be lethal ...

These are much more in-depth, better written, and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology's hold on culture examined","review":"This book presents a good overview of the state of our culture, with it's worship of technology. Postman does not deny that there are benefits of technological advances, but that there are incredible losses when technology is placed at the center of society. Postman uses wit and humour to make his points, which helps the lay reader to keep engaged. His recommendations at the end show that he is not cynical, though realistic about what can be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Control","review":"While I totally disagree with Postman's view that Technology is somehow a hulking stalker-in-the-night creature that is stealing away our values and culture, his point is though-provoking, if overly dramatic. While Postman has an entertaining wit and humor, his information is often awry and misguided. Though his point that technology must be examined, questioned, and taken control of by humanity is one that should be taken up and heralded by us all, the idea of technology on its own taking over our lives is entirely off base. Read this book if you want to ask questions about the ongoing technological \\"advances,\\" but don't expect any clear answers, or, for that matter, any real information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas that have little to do with technology","review":"Postman discusses things that he finds wrong with the world, but there is very little connection between these ideas and technology. However, if you're interested in these things, then parts of this book might be a good read: * why opinion polls are not useful (Chapters 5, 8); * why efficiency and progress are not worthy goals (Ch. 3); * why human qualities cannot be ranked or measured (Ch. 1, 8); * why statistics do not often reflect reality (Ch. 8); * whether or not social science is really a science (Ch. 9); * why you should distrust medical doctors (Ch. 6); * why traditions and religious narratives should not be thrown away (Ch. 3, 9, 10); and * how education could improve society (Ch. 11)."},{"rating":"1","title":"FireLite are JUNK!!","review":"I've purchased three Smartdisk FireLites and two out of the three have failed on me.

The plot revolves around surly pizza-delivery-guy Mooky. Mooky exists in two words with one foot in the white-owned business world of sal's pizza and the other in the almost entirely black neighborhood of bed Stuy. In the end, he must make a choice between the two worlds. The beauty of the film is that it is not clear if Mooky ends up feeling he has done the right thing - and we are not sure either. It is the crime of the century that AFI left this off of their top 100 films of the century. Racist AFI - for shame!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Film","review":"I watched Spike Lee's \\"Do The Right Thing\\" last night and was terribly disappointed. Nobody changes throughout this movie. In fact, Lee's one-dimensional characters live up to the stereotypes that Lee is desparately trying to give them. You have Pino, the racist Italian; Lee, who himself is the protypical lazy black man and racist himself; Aiello, was is the fiery owner of the pizza place, etc. Lee starts the riot that leads to the pizza joint's demise, and we don't know why he does this. Pino was right all along, according to Lee: people in this neighborhood CAN'T be trusted, can they? Question: who WOULDN'T have smashed Radio Rahemm's radio after he walks back into the pizza place blasting his boom box? It seems like a perfectly logical solution. It's not Aiello's fault that Raheem is killed by the police. Kind of a witless ending to a somewhat promising premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine American Masterpiece","review":"Spike Lee's \\"Do The Right Thing\\" is the best film about race relations ever made in America. Powerful, funny, heartbreaking, truthful and a complete visual extravaganza, this is an extraordinary film, Lee's best. Set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn during the hottest day of the summer, the film starts as a humorous slice of life story about the people who live in this neighborhood. I do not want to reveal too much of the film because the first time viewer should experience this film on their own. I will say that as events in the film progress, it slowly builds to a shattering climax that is unforgettable. Lee has never been as assured a filmmaker as he was on this, because every element from acting to cinematography is calibrated to perfection. The fact that Criterion is producing such a nice set for this film is truly exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO THE RIGHT RIGHT THING","review":"I WENT TO THE THEATER TO SEE THIS AT FAMILY REUNION IN ST LOUIS AS A BLACK MAN I KNOW RACISM EXISTS BUT I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE VERY OFFENSIVE IT WAS GOOD BIUT I DID NOT LIKE IT BECAUSE I HATE WHITE FRIENDS ITALIAN FRIENDS ASIAN FRIENDS HISANIC FRIENDS I CAN UNDERSTAND IN CERTAIN WAYS WHY PINO WAS RACIST WHEN HE SAID WE ANIMALS IT INNER CITY CRIMINALS THAT MAKE THE POSITIVE BLACK LOOK BAD AND GIVE US A BAD NAME WE MAKE PEOPLE HATE US WE ARE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY WITH SELF DISRESPECT AND IGNORANCE RAHEEM WAS A TROUBLEMAKER HE DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE BUT HE HAD IT COMING SO IF WE START ACTING WITH INTELLIGENCE MAYBE OTHER CULTURES WOULD RESPECT US MORE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.

Visually stunning and smart. This is Spike Lee's best film. Mookie is immortal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Things Were Done","review":"\\"Do The Right Thing\\" is the greatest, most important film in the history of American cinema. It is better than \\"Citizen Kane\\" and even better than \\"The Godfather\\" films. Roger Ebert called it \\"a perfect film\\". At the Oscar ceremony, when \\"D.T.R.T.\\" was NOT nominated for Best Picture, the presenter briefly criticized the Academy voters for not recognizing the film that told the biggest truth, the truth about the disease called racism. And this is in ADDITION to the visual beauty and power of the film, the humor, the music, and, of course, Ruby and Ossie. There is no more \\"American\\" film than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spike Lee's Masterpiece","review":"Every filmmaker has one truly shining moment above all others, and I daresay Spike himself would admit he'll never top this film.That this film passed by unrewarded by most moviegoers at the time of its release (certainly by the Academy Awards), the joke turns out to be on them, as most films from '89 have aged beyond belief, while \\"Do The Right Thing\\" remains as powerful and vital as it was then.The casting is brilliant, including John Turturro, Danny Aiello (and a young Martin Lawrence), Bill Nunn, Ruby Dee, and Samuel L. Jackson, the screenplay is excellent, and the direction is without peer. Spike would go on to use the same techniques for subsequent films such as \\"Jungle Fever\\", \\"Mo Better Blues\\", and \\"He Got Game\\", but never with the same effect as on this one.If you're building a video or DVD library, it isn't complete without this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why You Should See \\"Do the Right Thing\\"","review":"I admit it. The first time I ever saw this film was in my Film class, and it was being taught by Mr. Webster: \\"Do the Right Thing\\" worshipper. So maybe I am a wee bit biased when I say that this is a supremely superb movie. But it is indeed a supremely superb movie, and I encourage you to see it! Spike Lee does a masterfull job directing, screenwriting, and starring in this film. The basic summary is \\"a day in a predominately black neighborhood in Brooklyn\\". It incorporates every racial tension you can imagine, and every small conflict is leading up to the heartstopping climax at the end. See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Well a lot of the movie is about racism but my favorite part was Radio Raheem giving the story of love and hate. How love is always battling hate all the time and here comes love and back comes hate and bang boom love comes back and KO's hate. Really made me think.Like during the course of a day....when you go to work....you put a fence of hate around you and also lets say if youre an employer you hate on an employee to make them go. 'Do your job or youre fired'....its a heck of a motivator. On the other hand....I think its FAR more dangerous to love than to hate because if you love you make yourself more vulnerable and theres always the danger that could be used against you. But like radio raheem said....love always triumphs over hate.Great movie, go pick it up, one of Spike Lees best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the Right Thing and see this movie","review":"This movie is very confrontational, and not really a movie. It's a pissed off guys way of telling the world \\"HEY WE'RE ALL THE SAME YOU MORONS NOW LET'S STOP WITH THE RACIAL HATRED AND BIGATRY AND GET ALONE!\\" That's pretty much the message this movie sends. The ending will have you astonished. It's sad that we as people are biggots because of skin or nationality differences. So take this movie's advice and \\"Forget ABout It\\" okay! We're all the same! All equally created. No one person is better than the other. So see this film cuz it'll make you wanna kick the crud outta some KKK member or some Nazi punk. Not saying you should, cuz we need to understand each other, and love each other regardless if they have an opposing view. That is what this film comunicated to me, and I strongly recomend that every boy and girl should see this movie. Whether you're black, white, or an off color green, just see this important film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea sadly realized","review":"Unfortunately for Mr. Lee, I think this film backfired in a lot of people's eyes. I am a Latino American, but by the end of the film I had way more respect for Sal and the Korean family than I did for the black characters unfortunately. Radio Raseem and Buggin' Out where violence instigators and harassing troublemakers who had no business telling Sal who he should put on his wall. Mookie is nothing but a degenerate loser who deserved a beating, as well as the mentally challenged half white half black idiot walking around stuttering about Malcolm X and Dr. King.Sal was only defending his business and the right to be proud of his heritage. The wisest words come from the Korean store clerk who tells a bunch of racist old farts \\"You...me...we same!\\"This film wanted to delve into the roots of racism and say that no side is guilt-free, but this is unlikely to happen when Lee is the director. He obviously favored his character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard not to like","review":"A great movie with a simple setting but a serious theme. What makes it so great is the dialogue and characters. They really seem as colorfull as the street they live on.

I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.

Simply put, this is great film making! Pay no attention to the naysayers. This film breaks barriers like we rarely ever get to see anymore and it's exciting to watch it multiple times because with each successive viewing you see how Lee is blazing trails for another generation of writers and directors to follow. From the use of the 'Greek' chorus to the incendiary ending to its honest and eloquent depiction of race relations in the crumbling infrastructure of the inner city, this film exceeds on so many levels, one truly marvels at it. Not many films have made me applaud in public for an absent film maker -- this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing: A look into American Racism","review":"Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a riveting look into the life of a multi-cultural block in New York City. The film's theme song \\" Fight the Power\\" is the repeated point that reveals the true meaning behind the movie. Characters weave in and out of the film leaving the audience with a sense of knowledge and caring for each and every one of them. The hottest day in NYC serves as a colorful backdrop for the group of diverse characters. Lee's portrayal of Mookie, a lazy pizza delivery man, allows the audience to follow his struggle to co-exist in the tense world. The climax and finale of the film is a heartstopping sequence that thrusts a multitude of hatred at the audience. The film leaves one in a slight state of shock and gets it's point across very clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 1 on my top 10 movie list","review":"Spike Lee is a genious because of how well he put this movietogether and on my movie list it is number 1.This movie wasput together so well how the charecters,the setting,andthe whole movie were.To me I think it's the best flick ever in mywhole life because I am a big fan of Spike Lee movies andI do not think that there was a movie just like this one.Plese watch this someday and I am sure you will think it'sa classic of your whole life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman","review":"I own Canoe Craft and went to Ted Moore's school for building a canoe.

In short, it is a journal of Fulghum's thoughts--on everything from a deaf boy raking the leaves in his backyard, to watching a man setting up a Valentine's display in his store window.The one thing I didn't like about the book was that it didn't focus so much on kindergarten, which was the reason I bought it.

Each \\"Uncommon thought\\" is really a little less than a page long. The editors just use half page blank spaces to make them appear longer. The book is probably only about 10 pages long! If you really want some life changing philosophies, try something along the lines of Buddhism, which reflect actual thought. Fulghum was quite correct in stating that all he needed to know he learned in kindergarten. From his writing I would wonder if he made it past 3rd grade. How about the descriptions of the 500 hundred uses of a dandelion!? Did it throw you straight into enlightenment as well?

Milk and cookies are not good for the large number of people who suffer from lactose intolerance and struggle with obesity. Flushing five valuable gallons of potable water each time you use a toilet is not necessary or recommended in every situation, as well. Taking naps in the afternoon can disrupt one's sleep pattern at night and is hardly recommended for young, healthy adults.

The rules laid down in this book have created the modern democratic party, the moral standards by which the modern liberal cannot discriminate were learned in kindergarten and carried through into their adult lives in order that all human history is evil and to eliminate the evil in society we must eliminate everything that is good.

While I agree that you may or you may not like this book (or any other book for that matter), I can only think that those who insult the author for his writing didn't understand a word of what he tried to communicate. Did he fail ? No, I liked the book a lot for its wisdom, common sense and humour.

It isn't. The text of the play is paginated so poorly that footnotes are now interspersed in the text (footnotes are helpful for reading older plays) and line numbers are now embedded in the text and the indication of who is speaking what lines are often jammed together.As I said before, a supremely lazy effort that makes the kindle and e-book concept look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gospel music","review":"Excellent Cd of Gospel music.Thank you so much.Received promptly in Great condition.Thanks.RustyMindy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but hardly 5 stars","review":"I agree with the two previous reviewers that this is a good recording of Scheherazade but it is not 5 stars in my humble opinion.

So if you like Lady Gaga as much as I do, then I think you will like this dvd. But just know you will only see bits and pieces of a few of her videos during the documentary.

Too many people chime in about her in negative ways rather than lauding her hard struggle and success. One sure sign of success and backhanded acknowledgment hinted at in the film, was that negative remarks are usually made just to get your own name in a news item about her.

Solo Cosas Imposibles tiene algo de coherencia, el resto del disco es fallido intento de estar a la supuesta última moda (electrónica), lleno de mal gusto y de pretensión. Los temas arrancan de forma atractiva para despues deshacerse en una nada, que lleva al todo por debajo de la mediocridad.En los early 90's Cerati tuvo un momento de brillantez que se apagó ya hace tiempo."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks big time","review":"Except for the first 2 or 3 songs, the rest is pure uninspired trash, trying to be trendy in terms of sounds, but totally empty musically.Cerati was good up to and before the split with Soda.

Voy a tener la fortuna de verlo en vivo que es la mejor forma de pareciar al artista pero se que de ultimas que el Siempre es Hoy es un gran acierto a la musica y hace que artista de la talla de Gustavo brillen con luz propia.

Britney Spears came out with a pepsi commericial. Oh, how I'd love to see her hair catch on fire just like Michael Jackson's did when he did his commercial. Britney Spears is trying to be all these legends of pop/rock music,(Jacko,Janet, Madonna, Stones,etc,) and it drives me crazy since I love Miss Jackson, and Miss Spears shouldn't get credit for doing her dance moves. The only good song is Independent Women I, and I won't increase my rating with that, because I have that single myself. \\"It wasn't me\\" was good, but I heard it so much I got sick of it.

Figured I couldn't go wrong with a product with the Bicycle brand. I was wrong. With a fresh 9 v battery the machine's left side mechanism was frozen. It was assembled (In China, go figure) with the left card moving device jammed against the card platform. I turned it upside down and loosened the dozen or so screws and actually got the mechanism to move. But the cards all jammed ~ every time, during the shuffle. If I put 1/4 of the deck on each side of the machine, I got it to work ~ sometimes. Again, you get what you pay for. The silver lining was the amazing and simple procedure amazon laid out to return it. Hope they burn it. Can I give it no star? Ps~ Really? Anyone liked this product? Really?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shuffle Miracle","review":"I suffered a debilitating injury 4 years ago. I had an accident and I became a quadraplegic. I'm described as a functioning quad, which simply means I have some movement of my arms an legs. Although I am very lucky in that respect it didn't help my small motor reflexes. I became interested in bridge and moved on from beginner bridge to more complicated kinds. The problem was I was unable to shuffle. Although in duplicate bridge shuffling isn't necessary, in order to become more efficient one needs to practice.

Wrong! One side of the shuffler was always pretty sluggish, making the shuffling process uneven. After two months of only occasional use, the other side quit working altogether. We actually took the thing apart to see if it could be repaired (because how many card shufflers does a person really want to purchase), but the plastic gear had slipped and couldn't be moved back into place. Now it's going to the recyling bin. Sure, it was inexpensive, but that doesn't justify the fact that it's basically junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic, noisy, not well thought","review":"This product is made of a very cheap plastic.

It is my first automatic shuffler, and I was trusting that since it was sold as a Bicycle shuffler, they would have the operation mastered. Unfortunately, almost all of the problems had already been listed by former reviewers, and I did not read them all. Oh, well!The shuffler is noisy. The cards hang up inside the shuffler as the tray is removed.The right hand side of the shuffler does not feed all of the cards into the chamber, and the last cards need to be hand fed.Most discouraging, I sorted by suit, and found, as I suspected, the cards are not being well shuffled. I am a senior citizen with rather severe arthritis, and had hoped that this product would be helpful.Amazon made it very easy to buy; I hope it will be equally easy to return. My advice is: Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and ineffective","review":"When this arrived I tested it for actual random shuffling. If you put the two decks through multiple times you still get big hunks of one and then a hunk of the other. It is also REALLY loud and feels cheaply made. It jams up easily and you have to keep pressing the button to get it finish shuffling. I am returning mine. It's not even worth $2.00. I guess I could stand the irritating and loud noise if it actually randomized the cards, but it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound","review":"Good idea, but definitely this needs to be improve.

They're one of my favourite chapters of space marines, so I was really looking forward to this book. However, I must also confess that I was disappointed and even a little frustrated whilst reading this. The problem is not the writing (which is pretty good), and its not the plot (which, leaving a few niggles aside, is also pretty good). The problem is the fact that Swallow's Blood Angels are not the same as mine! I had such a strong image of them already, after all the background fluff published by BL, and Swallow seems to have interpreted it differently.Sitting down after finishing the book, I realised that it wasn't fair to condemn this book simply for being written by someone who isn't me! In its own terms, this is an exciting and interesting read ... certainly worth your time (and a little cash). I'm even going to try the sequel ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad book","review":"The author does not understand the storyline / universe in which the story is set. A reader who is new the Warhammer 40K books may enjoy it, but a reader who is familiar with the Warhmmer 40K story will find the glaring errors annoying. It is as though the author was given a 10 minute \\"overview\\" of the Warhammer 40K story just covering the major points.Additionally, this book (and the sequel) are both examples of amateurish writing. There are numerous internal inconsistencies within the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Effort","review":"I have read many of the 40K novels. I have enjoyed many of them. This was not one of them. Some authors can write books that transcend the fact that they are the intellectual properties of someone else. They can make them their own and transcend the genre. This author is not one of them. Much of the dialouge and details seems very forced and inconsistent. If you play the game that this novel is based on, you get the feeling you are reading bad fluff. Everything reads as if the author is reading directly out of a codex and forces it. A bad book, badly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Brilliant!","review":"Many of the Space Marine books are very similar and it takes a lot to make them stand out. I wasn't sure if novels about the Blood Angels would work with the sort of story that was being offered (the return of Sanguinius), but this blew me away!

A valuable, captivating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak book attempt","review":"When I read this book it reminded me of a seminar that Tom did in Las Vegas. He is full of himself and it is not a secret that he makes money selling books and training, not trading.

First, the author dared tell his dire trading failure in 1987 and the consequent financial and emotional trouble from then till 1992. Second, he emphasized repetitively on the need for one's own trading journal, protective stops and preparaton before any trade. Third, he elaborated plainly his past unsuccessful day trading routine. Fourth, he preached detailedly the importance of special dates and key numbers. Fifth, he respected Jesse Livermore much. I do, too. Finally, I had read four of his seven suggested readings beforehand. Our thoughts should be close. Perhaps the major weakness I can tell of it is that he had talked very little on TA tools, or at least the importance of them on day trading. In short, readable! But not on the top priority list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand all the 5-star reviews.Nor can I understand who this book is aimed at:For the beginner it provides just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Sweeping generalisations and banal observations without any concrete 'how to' advice. For example - sure, we should always employ money management, but what systems? - not one is suggested!!! There are far, far better books out there (check out Alexander Elder or Marcel Link for example).For the experienced trader, there is nothing new here.I read this cover to cover in a couple of hours and learned absolutely nothing new. Sorry, but it is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indicators should not be propriatary in text books","review":"While there is a great deal of interesting and useful information in this book, I strongly resent the author's presentation of two important indicators i.e. the V-Factor and TTICK without providing us the means (program information) to use these indicators. The presentation of results without informing the reader with the methods to obtain those results is unheard of in other fields of endeavor such as scientific research. First class operations and authors do not operate in this fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning the Day Trading Game","review":"Anyone who has ever traded will understand and relate to the experiences of Tom Busby. His twenty six years of trading warfare have given him a wealth of knowledge and wisdom. I am very thankful that he saw fit to share those lessons and techniques with us and pass them on in the pages of his book. The trading methodology explained therein has proven to be priceless information that I refer back to time and time again. This is a must read for anyone serious about trading.

It has some good quality tools in case of trouble and the flashlight is built into the case! Nice.The hard case is really good looking and tough. And the whole thing takes up almost no room at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too repetitive","review":"My only gripe about this novel is that it is much too repetitive. I swear phrases and sentences are used 4 or 5 times too much. I don't understand why Feehan does this - maybe to add more pages.Other than that, the idea is good, I thought the characters were fine, and the writing is fine in some instances as well. If Feehan could just stop hammering the same thing over and over again it the novel would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely tortured hero","review":"I really really loved this book. The hurt/comfort in the beginning was perfect; I couldn't imagine that part any better. What could possibly be better than a really hurt, dark, angsty vampire depending on his healer woman for health and mental stability? Loved it. I didn't want that part of the book to end.I also was completely fascinated by the plot. I love multi-generational stories. The tie-ins to seemingly minor characters in the first book were completely aweseome! I love that the author has created such a rich world of characters.Despite how very much I love this book, there are still some negatives. I am so sick of the macho male controlling his woman thing. It was much worse in this one than the first one. And all the baby talk is pretty creepy to me, but easily skimmed over.This book is a must read for any fan of hurt/comfort, vampires, or paranormal romance. If you're into hurt heroes, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Another absolute winner in the \\"Dark\\" series (the others being; Dark Prince, Dark Gold, and soon Dark Magic). The stories of these Carpathian males and their seach for their \\"lifemates\\" are captivating! In this story, Jacques is drugged, tortured and buried alive. His family has not been able to connect with him at all and think he is dead. Buried for seven years, he makes a mental connection with Shea. A brilliant american doctor and psychic, she can't get the images of Jacques out of her mind. So begins an journey to save a tormented soul.Sheas desire to help Jacques as a patient but not as a man; and Jacques total belief that Shea is his lifemate, make these characters very driven and compelling. I am rereading all of these stories again just so I can stay connected to these characters until Gregoris story (Dark Magic) comes out in July. These books are simply amazing! See for yourself.

Could it be possible? A resounding YES! is heard. Ms. Feehan made the perfect sequel. This tale is full of all the ingredients that make a novel stand out. Not least of all a scrumptuous leading male character, Jacques. How can she keep pulling these great books out of her sleeve? I don't know but i can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Reading these in order, I had expected this to be an improvement on Dark Prince. It wasn't.While I really sympathized with the tortured (literally & figuratively) Jacques, he was so uber macho, that I found him very annoying. Shea was so stubborn in refusing to believe the evidence right before her eyes.The book was very slow, especially at the beginning. Way too much exposition. Eventually, very late in the book, it gets moving, but by then it's nearly too late. Feehan's repetitive use of \\"little\\" endearments really grated on my nerves (I'd already had enough in Dark Prince), and I thought I'd scream if I read \\"I'm a predator\\" type comments one more time. Geez, enough is enough already. This series is definitely not equal to the hype. One & 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much abuse","review":"I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse. Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character. This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books."},{"rating":"1","title":"just couldn't get into the writing style","review":"I felt like the writing just droned on and on. It felt very repetitive. I couldn't even finish the book and was really disappointed. I also felt that the character of Shea was the very sterotypical doctor who is kind and analytical but besides that, she felt very flat to me. Will not be reading anything further from this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read!","review":"From the back of the book...The stranger silently summoned her from across the continents, across the seas. He whispered of eternal torment, of endless hunger...of dark, dangerous desires. And somehow American surgeon Shea O'Halloran could feel his anguish, sense his haunting aloneless, and she ached to heal him, to heal herself.Drawn to the far Carpathian mountains, Shea found a ravaged, raging man, a being like no other. And she trembled. For in his burning eyes, his icy heart, she recognized the beloved stranger who'd already become part of her. This imperious Carpathian male had compelled Shea to his side. But was she to be his healer...or his prey? His victim...or his mate? Was he luring her into madness...or would his dark desire make her whole?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the 1st book i read in the 'Dark' series","review":"This was the first book that I read by Christine Feehan, & it's a very good book.

Anyway, I will continue reading the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Book in a great series of stories","review":"\\"Dark Desire\\" is the 2nd book is a series of stories about the Carpathians. Not evil, but immortal and blooding drinkers, these compelling beings are under attack by true vampires and humans that hunt vampires. Jacques, a Carpathian who is younger brother to the Prince, has been taken captive and torchured by evil men and left in a basement in an abandoned building to suffer for years. He is able to overcome his pain and communicate with a woman who will become his lifemate. This story is interesting and unusually different than the others in the series. I have tried to read the series in order since characters are innerwoven throughout others' storylines. Dark Desire explains a lot about the history of Carpathians, and the physical and metaphysical differences between humans and immortals. Author, Christine Feehan, has a great immagination and writes well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard time liking Jacques...","review":"Even after everything he'd been through, I had a hard time liking Jacques and I wanted to like him. He'd been so sweet and giving in Dark Prince, you just knew his story was going to be an easy one.Boy was I wrong, but pleasantly surprised.

That kept me turning pages.You'll be rooting for him by the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This is one of Christeen's best yet. I love the whole vampire genre and christeen's charcters are so sensual and sexy it is difficult to put the book down.

This book I read twice because it is so beautifully written and engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sequel!","review":"After reading the first book, the only character that really jumped out at me that I wanted to read about was Gregori. I bought this sequel, in the hopes that this was who it was about. Let me tell you, it didn't matter. Shea and Jacques were great! The story line kept you deeply involved and thinking about what was going to happen the whole time. Even though you don't hear much about them in the first book, you really get involved with them in this one. I would like to see Alex's story, But most of all, I want to see Gregori. I hope that she doesn't make me wait to long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Excellent Series Continues...","review":"This is a follow-up book to Dark Prince and if you like romance and vampires, this is the book for you. The begining was very interesting and it was nice to see a continuation of previous characters.

The characters were wonderful and the plot was exciting.

I wish I could give it more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"majority of the book is missing","review":"This does contain 116 pages as advertised.

Good that it came fully assembled with ends attached (ie plug and play). Quality seems good. Thin enough to go almost anywhere and especially under doors (compressor is in the garage). Only negative is the 2\\" black plastic ends which I guess are designed to be stress relievers for the hose ends?

Stays flexible under pressure.","review":"This hose is excellent for use in my confined workspace. It is light and flexible, and doesn't kink and it is easy to coil while under pressure. It came with fittings that matched my tools and compressor, and it is very well made.I use it mostly with brad nailers, staplers and finishing guns and it works great.I haven't tried this hose with framing nailers or other high air use tools, but a 1/4\\" dia hose may not have enough reserve air capacity to run at a desired speed, especially on long hose runs.I would buy this hose again. I am no longer tripping over, fighting kinks and trying to coil the larger hoses I have been using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid hose, very light.","review":"A light, managable air hose. Get it, and you'll thank yourself the next time you're on a ladder and you don't feel 20' of goodyear rubber dragging your tool down. It keeps a slight memory, so to avoid frustration one should stretch it all the way out at the beginning of use and don't turn in circles during use.The only downside is use while roofing. The smooth outer surface makes it slide off the roof deck. It's not so heavy that you can't whip the hose back up, but it gets annoying. I'll break this hose out for steep roofs where the hose will hang anyway, but for the most part, I use the Goodyear on the roof and the hitachi on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered!","review":"I bought this because I needed a longer hose for my compressor for a new project.

The included 1/4\\" fittings appear to be high quality and I couldn't be happier with this new hose. Highly recommended and I fully intend to purchase a couple of 25-foot lengths of this same hose for use inside my little 14x20 barn/workshop as soon as I can find someone who carries that size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hoses","review":"We just ordered two more of these from Amazon (they are significantly cheaper at the moment than the local stores). These are the favorites among our construction company due to the light weight, durability, and the fact that they really don't kink.For those of you who are just working around the house, any old hose will do. But for those of you in the professional arena, the lighter weight will be a blessing in the 8th hour when you're trying to get those walls up before dark so that you can get paid in the next draw. We stick with the 100 lenght because we are building hotels and such, besides going from the 50 to the 100 is only a few dollars difference and is worth it if it keeps you moving.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitachi 100'x1/4\\" air hose","review":"I think this is an okay hose, all 100' hoses are not tangle free and this one is no exception, my beef is that the black end/bend protectors have already come away from the area they are supposed to protect after one week of use (bummer), my American hoses are still intact after five years of constant use, this is a relatively cheap/disposable import from China."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mom loved it.","review":"I bought this shirt a while ago for my 50+ year-old Mom, who loves to dance.

She also went on to star in the original Beauty and the Beast tv series and of course Terminator 2.

It was downright awful. The special effects were prehistoric. My brother was in tears because it was so bad. It seemed like it was written by a bunch of kids. What's worse, the director tried to make it seemed serious by throwing in a bedroom scene, swears, and gore. All this did was make the movie even worse. The only cool scene was when Kong got a heart transplant. They pulled out his heart, which was about the size of a Ford truck, and it was still beating. Cooooooool!!!! If you love King Kong like I do, please don't watch this movie! It will make you embarrassed to be a Kong fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad...","review":"Pointless sequel, they should have left poor King Kong dead.

Then, a hunter found another Kong (a female) so just in time for blood transfusion. How convenient. I would assume this movie has smaller budget than its 1975 predecessor as the special effects are really terrible and cheap looking. With today's movie technology, somebody should ressurect this series and make a 21st century version of King Kong as this 1986 feature is a complete waste of time. Bad Acting, Bad special effects and bad story. Skip it and get the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young instead.There is a Taiwan release DVD of this King KOng lives with terrible picture quality (mastered from VHS) and so-so Dolby 5.1 sound which I would recommend avoiding as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comedy of Tragedy","review":"Serious Comedy:-)Keep that in mind before sitting down to enjoy, one of the most unbelievable movies of all time.

Kong and Lady get down and dirty, resulting in baby Kong.

I personally love the 1976 version alot better than the other two. This movie was not good at all. I was excited when I heard the concept of Kong not being dead, but this was very poorly executed. The characters from Kong 1976 were not at all present in this film, not even in name. The 10 year time frame from his fall off the twin towers to his heart transplant was far too long. I pretend to myself that this movie doe not exist. King Kong was better off dead at the foot of the World Trade Center than to have been in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Kong lives","review":"So they decided to bring King kong 1976 back and it kinda wasnt a very good idea this was a sad sequal King kong falls in love with his own kind and has a baby but kong only knows his son for a few seconds then dies.Give this movie a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How this film was pitched","review":"True story: this guy goes into Dino's office to pitch a few ideas for films.

Theres nudity in the film, hey this is a King Kong movie, not some kind of porno film. The worst part about this film is that they find another 50ft. ape girlfreind for Kong. Thats about the stupidest idea in the history of film. I wonder what the makers of this film thought they would get from this horrible movie. Was it made for laughs or was it an unsucessful attempt to make yet another sequal to the 1933 masterpiece? So, unless your collecting all the King Kong movies ( like me ), dont even rent this movie for $ .99 ( unless you like to watch movies that are even worse than \\"Godzilla vs. Megalon\\" )"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a movie, I don't know what it is.....","review":"First off, I am not a fan of the awful 1976 remake. I only can say that it was a miricle that it did not destroy the careers of Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. Fast forward to 1986, and we are treated to another outing with Kong, this time having been in a coma for ten years (somehow we are supposed to belive that he survived being shot by machine guns and then falling over a thousand feet.) and we have poor Linda Hamilton trying to save the Big K with a new giant heart (how they got funding for all this we never know) and we also have a large female Kong who, when Kong is revived falls in love with and they run away to the mountains where the Army follows them, and well after that I lost interest.

Zeus is, in one introduction, the idealized wolf, in the other he is melded with the Judeao-Christian god into some terrible, murderous patriarch.

However, I found this book of fairytales to be uterly wooden, and repititious in their extolling of how strong and wonderful and save the day women can be.

Roetzel does an excellent job on everything from tips to the history of topics ranging from colognes to evening wear. The background on every subject is very in-depth and interesting.However, the opinions belong more in a magazine, like GQ, not in a book. For example, does Hermes really make the best ties? Is Brooks Brother the best American shirt-maker?

It is quite simply the book I had been intending to write all my life and I cannot imagine how I might improve it in any way. It is beautifully produced, the illustrations are tasteful and appropriate and over all provides even the sloppiest man with a flawless guide to sartorial elegance. It does have a photo of two fellows in smoking jackets which looks a bit tatty but I forgive them that. To say, as one reviewer does, that the book is written from an English perspective is I believe inaccurate. Certainly it does emphasise the contribution of Saville Row and the pastiche of the English gentleman as the doyen of taste but it is clearly written from a wider European perspective. There are more than adequate references to Continental European sources and indeed to the contribution of the United Stated to what we accept as stylish attire.

It seems to me that this is a false dichotomy. Flusser (and might I recommend Antongiovanni's \\"The Suit\\") is a *guide to* men's style. \\"Gentleman\\" is a book *about* men's style. There is a subtle distinction here. I think it could best be described as the difference between a Time-Life book about WWII and \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". The one might be prettier, easier to read, and give you a decent overview of the subject, but if you want to get into the nitty gritty of numbers and details, you want to go with the \\"real\\" book.\\"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion\\" is a great book to keep on your coffee table and flip open occasionally, but if you want real, useful information about men's style and tailored clothing, go with Flusser or Antongiovanni."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This is a lifestyle guide, which is sophisticated.

The story follows Clan Jade Falcon and their descant (invasion) into the Inner Sphere. A good bit of background into the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe makes this a much better read and I found myself checking the mechwarrior wiki page for context.I found the political intrigue of the 'heroic' defenders interesting and the conflicting views of the Jade Falcon leaders Malvina and Aleks very griping as well.The psychology of leadership and warfare comes out in the two leaders. Action Adventure novels tend to glorify war but Victor Milan did a good job describing it as what it is: brutal, ugly, and painful. . . But can also be honorable and just.Five Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for plotting; found plodding","review":"I am an emerging science fiction author. I am also an old fan of the Mechwarrior RPG. I wanted an example of descriptive scifi action to learn from. I made a BAD choice with this book.

It takes him 25 pages to describe three minutes of action - and I use the word \\"action\\" loosely. He get's sidetracked in irrelevant topics of internal politics and sordid details of sex between siblings every other paragraph. Victor! Show us the big picture! What's going on?!

Only a few really get it. Maybe that is why his work is so special. It's unfortuante that the media has ignored this man until now. But as they say'You will miss him when he's gone'.It shamefull that the Wind will become a darling of the music crtics' ,not because its a land-mark CD, but becuase its Zevon's last work.I want two things.1.

Jorge Calderon is all over providing everything from guitar, bass, tres and vocals. Warren gives us some great songs that are biting, witty, personal and real. I've been a Zevon fan for 30 years and this is one of his best. Every song will have you wishing it could go on forever. Be prepared to go on emotional roller coaster that will bring a smile to your face and a tear to your eye.

This being his last outing before his impending death was definitely done the way he wanted it. With his friends. It was like a going away party for Warren, but it's difficult to listen to. He collaborated with many of rock's greats making it not really a Warren Zevon record, but a Warren & Friends record. I prefer to listen to Warren Zevon's other records that reflect more of himself, than this record does. If you put this record into your regular rotation, you'll find yourself getting depressed. I recommend My Ride's Here, or Excitable Boy instead of this record, unless you're going to buy his entire catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to Zevon's Fans","review":"Warren Zevon gives a gift to his fans in THE WIND. Despite facing an imminent death, Zevon's hallmark razor-sharp wit, emotional honesty and punching rhythms are fully intact in this last CD, which is a testament to his sheer will and talent. The rousing \\"Disorder in the House,\\" haunting \\"Prison Grove\\" and poignant \\"Keep Me in Your Heart\\" are especially memorable. The talents of Bruce Springsteen, Dwight Yoakam, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Ry Cooder, Jackson Browne and Don Henley only add to this gift.

(For more evidence, pick up his anthology and crank the stereo up for \\"Gorilla, You're a Desperado).With \\"The Wind,\\" one of Zevon's better albums, Zevon gives the listener a buffett to enjoy.

Then again with Lawyers, Guns and Money. Werewolves of London reeked of pure style and originality. As an artist, Zevon walked his own path. He wrote his heart through and through not giving a damn what others thought. This is a man who held pop culture and the media in contempt. He is a musicians musician, a poets poet. This album is only different from any of his others in its timing and reflections.Warren you will be missed, but never forgotten....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and wonderful","review":"I went into this album wanting it to be good, hoping it was good, and it delivered.

On death's door or healthy this is a wonderful listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun album despite the circumstances","review":"This album was a bit of a pleasant surprise to me. I expected songs about finality, endings and even death, but there is far more here that speaks to life. Mr. Zevon's musical talents have always been appreciated by me in a \\"Wow! That sounds great!\\" or \\"Man, that's gotta be the best lyric ever!\\" kind of way, but in these songs I discover a different kind of appreciation. I'm amazed at how beautifully these songs seem to sum up Mr. Zevon's acceptence of his own mortality while celebrating the things living has to offer. I find a personal message here. It's as if Mr. Zevon is telling me himself that life really is short and we can't waste a minute of it. Through it all his legendary wit still rings through. And while it saddens me deeply to know he'll never write another song, I can't help but smile when I hear him sing, \\"And if she won't love me then her sister will.\\" I'm humbled and impressed by this album and by Mr. Zevon himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rock & Roll","review":"Forgetting the circumstances surrounding the recording of this album you have an entertaining rock album by a talented artist that never quite got the attention he deserved. All the ingredients required for a good time are here. The songs are all full with catchy hooks, the fuzzy distorted guitars have all the right riffs, and the vocals are just rough and unpolished enough. The lyrics are great to listen to and can be taken at face value without knowing their history. If you never knew that Warren Zevon was dying while recording this album you would have a great party album. It's knowing that he was dying that raises the album to a little higher level. You can't ignore that fact, it influences you to listen to it in a different light like it influenced his performance. The album by itself is worth buying just because it's good music, it doesn't hurt that it's a worthy send off for a great musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless you Warren.","review":"\\"The Wind\\" #12 (2003).12th and final album of his illustrious career. Weak, but still with a sense of humor, Warren bravely did one last album. My biggest question was where did all of these fans come from?, after 20 years of declining sales? Warren was dying, but this album is chuckful of good material, the highlights include, \\"Dirty Life And Times\\", the rocking' \\"Disorder In The House\\", with Bruce Springsteen on background vocals and a great guitar solo by Bruce. The Dylan tune \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\", the first single. \\"Numb As A Statue\\", \\"She's Too Good For Me\\", \\"The Rest Of The Night\\", the blues of \\"Rub Me Raw\\" and the prettiest final song \\"Keep Me In Your Heart\\", Warren wore his emotions on his sleeve.

I cannot say any more then has already been said about this great artist 1,000 times already. He is simply one of the finest songwriters of this or any generation. His unique wit, candor, and lack of pretension about his art make him a treasure. That he's mostly remembered for an oddball hit like \\"Werewolves of London\\", is a shame, in that most listeners never got to see the breadth of his talent.If you can listen to \\"Keep Me In Your Heart\\" without weeping, then I feel sorry for you.Buy this album.

Dirty Life & Times and Keep Me In Your Heart can be numbered among his best but the rest of the tracks are--well--lacking. I do note the exception of Knockin' On Heaven's Door--which is well-sung and arranged but still offers nothing more than what Dylan or Clapton had already given it. The much anticipated Disorder In The House has more of a jam feeling to it rather than a finished track. Nothing wrong with a good jam session but you'd like at least one of the singers to be on key. Rub Me Raw has a great blues arrangement but the lyrics aren't much. The rest of the cd is rather bland. You'd do better to look for the good complilations available out there.

For a love story it was excellent, at times it was a bit far-fetched, but the magical realism was an interesting delight. The ending wasn't very appealing, it was an unexpected twist.

I really enjoyed this book and loved the magical realism the author chose to use in this book. I thought that for the most part the book was well written. The only part that I didn't like was how the author didn't make it clear whether you had just read about one year, or 30 years. Over-all I thought it was an excellent book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to use their imagination.

I already tried one. It was delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, but in a good way...","review":"I really had no idea what this novel was about when I started reading it. My book club chose it as their monthly selection, so I went into it blindly. Imagine my surprise...Like Water for Chocolate is part love story/part fantasy that delves into the lives of a Mexican family during the Mexican Revolution. Tita, the youngest of three daughters, is the victim of harsh family tradition--she cannot marry and is subject to a life of taking care of her mother until the day she dies. What a shame for poor Tita, who is desperately in love with Pedro. So Pedro marries Tita's older sister in order to stay close to Tita. What happens after that can only happen in Soap Opera Land.Very mystical, erotic and enjoyable until the last page, Like Water for Chocolate will definitely be remembered for a long time to come. Laura Esquivel has done a wonderful job writing this exceptionally creative, imaginative tale. Now I'm off to see how the movie compares!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical realism in turn-of-the-century Mexico","review":"Recipes begin each of the chapters in this utterly charming book that centers much of the time around life in the kitchen of a traditional Mexican family. Tita, the daughter who has been destined to remain single so she can continue caring for her aging parents, falls in love and must watch as her lover marries her sister, Rosaura. Tita pours her heart and her loving into cooking, and as the years go by, and with each new creation she reflects the frustrations of a generation of Mexican women whose options in life to find personal happiness are limited by traditions. The conclusion is incendiary, apocryphal, and somehow hopeful for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've read this book a long time ago . . .","review":"Ezquivel is a true storyteller. She depicts the tale of Tita, the youngest daughter in a Mexican family, a girl whose lot in this world is to remain single and care for her aging mother, primarily by cooking. Tita's experiences in dealing with all aspects of life (love, family relationships, responsibility, birth, and death) are beautifully portrayed in simple, yet stunning and vivid prose. While I was disappointed with some of Tita's decisions, I felt that Esquivel remained true to her character's personality and desires; she portrayed emotion using original descriptions and comparisons, often related to food (i.e. falling in love is compared to dough being dipped in hot oil). Additonally, the magical quality of this story, while not usually a favorite of mine, was fascinating and engaging.If you are looking for a fast read, this well written book with its enticing plot is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough sorrow for you heart to weep","review":"I found the story between Tita and Pedro a sad and emotional one.

Too much fantasy for this reviewer, recipes notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View on Family and Love, Provocative but Empty","review":"I had to put my two cents in. \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\" is an intersting take on a small town Mexican family. The mysterious happenings that occur to Tita (the main character) are the best parts, from her magic food and strange attachment to her sister-in-laws children. However, the book lacks feeling and surprise. The plot is predicatable, as are the characters. Another downfall is the deaths of the characters who need to be eliminated. This happens when it is needed most- an unrealistic convience. A book worth looking into if you're one for predictable Mexican soap-operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not waste time","review":"I could barely get through this book. The descriptions were great but did not vCare for all the supernatural part of it. Would not recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book when I had to read it for a class. It's just not my style. I usually go for books about depressed male characters (such as myself) like The Moviegoer and The Catcher in the Rye. This isn't one of those novels. Nevertheless, it was good. I should probably start looking for these romance/recipe novels more often. The novel's basically a mythological story about the passionate Tita who, unable to marry the one she loves, expresses her passion through her food. There are some hilarious moments and some really romantic ones. And Tita's definitely a character worth falling in love with. She's one that will drive you crazy (if I were female, I would never go for Pedro, but that's just me), but that really just makes the novel better. This is definitely a great novel for a light afternoon read. And I'm going to try some of the recipes, too. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Feminist","review":"Like Water for Chocolate was an assigned reading for my English class. When reading it at first, it seemed like a good book-- definitely an easy read. As the book picks up, however, it becomes totally obvious that these women feel worthless without a man. All of the women's problems in the novel have to do with men or lack thereof. Tita is spineless as a protagonist, and Pedro is just as spineless as her love interest. Also, the novel is supposedly set in the Mexican Revolution, yet there are, at most, three or four references to this in the entire book. They say how there is starvation going on, yet Tita's family has enough food that she is constantly cooking. If you are looking for an easy read and choose not to take this book for more than surface value, then go for it. But if you're looking for anything that will make you think, Like Water for Chocolate is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"like wasting my time for nothing","review":"This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed. Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic. The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"The characters in this book are in a trance when they eat--just like you will be as you read. Absolutely wonderful, conveying the beauty of tight-knit traditional families in Hispanic culture. I knew when I first read it that it would eventually have to be made into a movie. The movie is very good also (even with subtitles), but of course the book is always better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Water For Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquirel's \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is a beautifully written story of a young Mexican woman's struggles. Tita is severely oppressed by a domineering mother who bars her from true love. The combination of sensuality and the culinary arts allows for an abstract plot that leaves the reader guessing. This novel is not only uplifting but restores faith to any hopeless romantic.As a student of Mercy High School, I read \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" for my English class. The novel's light plot provided for a fun and enjoyable assignment. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantacy, Reality it's all the same here","review":"The combination of mexican soul food and magical realism creates a wonderful experience that would touch any persons hert. Tita De La Garza, the main character of the novel, takes the reader on an emotional rollercoaster as she suffers through life with her overly protective an strict mother, and the marriage of her soul mate, Pedro, to her sister. Each chapter begins with a new month, though the time span of the book is throughout her life, and a new recipe that will somehow tie into that chapter. I especially enjoy this book because of how Laura Esquivel gives it a sence of randomness by giving every day happenings a fantacy like twist to them. I highly recommend this book to someone who would want an easy read or just want to add a little spice to their life, with the steamy scenes Esquivel adds between characters. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystical realism","review":"I will have to admit that I could not put the book down at first. The tragic love story stuff I can get into, but the mystical realism i can not.

Of course i finished the book, but when Tita didn't marry the doctor, I was turned off.

Some of the older Mexican traditions are considered cruel set the boundaries for what the youngest daughter can do with her life.

The author expresses greatly how a tradition kept two people apart however, in the end the tradition was destroyed.The absurd Mexican tradition says youngest daughter cannot marry but instead she will have to stay home and take care of her mother until death. Mama Elena's cruel and strict mother did not exclude her daughter Tita from his tradition. However, Tita and Pedro express their love to each other in most unusual way. Tita would cook fabulous food and Pedro complement on and on her delicious food. After 22 years, the abhorred Mexican tradition came to stop and love found it's meaning of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirdest Book Ever!","review":"I read this in Spanish class. Wow!

Second, the story was TOLD rather than dramtized in scenes. Third, the characters were weak and ineffectual. None of them was striving toward something. Each just accepted his or her lot in life and refused to do a thing to try to change it. Fourth, while I didn't mind the recipes and the symbolism of the cooking, I did mind the way the narrative was interrupted to insert silly instructions for made-up concoctions of food. All in all a dumb book that violated every principal of good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I recently read Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel.

The chapters didnt connevt to each other at all and the author also didnt do a good job of explaining the time difference between chapters. I also didnt like Pedro, a character in the novel.

Since Tita is the youngest daughter of the family, she has to dedicate her life to caring and tending to her mother until she has passed away. I really enjoyed reading the book. It is suspenseful and dramatic that you will want to know what is going to happen next. Once I started reading the book, i couldn't put it down. The book is full of romance and drama that I can relate to it very easily.

I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical. It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else. There's no poetry to the writing.Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.

Later on, Tita has the chance for true love when the doctor nurses her back to health after a tragic blow to her psyche, but instead rushes to Pedro's arms when the good doctor's back is turned. When nothing else is standing in their way, Pedro and Tita still choose not to marry, taunting the doctor for over a decade, showing the reader that they are nothing but lustful thrill-seekers.

Some border on fantasy while others take an almost satirical view, a parody even.Maybe I had high expectations, or maybe the translation didn't do the book justice, I don't know, but I found this book utterly boring. There were a few 'moments' that were interesting, but for the most part, this was a dull read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story in the Magical Realism Style","review":"This novel is more visual than literary. It was very frustrating to read despite the mysticalbeauty of the images. The characters lacked choice and gumption, and other than Gertrude,were somewhat pat figures.The metaphors for food and life were good and the magical realism was stunning. The ro-mance between Tita and Pedro was unbelievably beautiful. Though the book annoyed meat times, I gave it a '4' for the beauty of its narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Times Better Than The Movie","review":"I saw the movie adaptation of Like Water For Chocolate some time ago, so my expectations were not high. The book is very good. It found a harmony between reality and mystical and it was a perfect blend. The characters are rich and the fabric of the story feels real, even when it's surreal. I was also impressed how well the translation held up in English. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tragic life told in food","review":"food has always been a favorite metaphor for writers (and moviemakers). we have to eat to survive. in Like Water for Chocolate, food is the metaphor for the passions of Tita, the youngest of 3 daughters. Forced by her tyranical mother to forsake her true love, Tita watches as he marries her oldest sister. she pours her emotions into the food. in every chapter, her emotions are poured into the food she makes. it is only through her cooking, that Tita can express her feelings. This is a good book about the tyranny of tradition and the liberation of food. i would recmmend this book w/o reservatoionthe recipes are pretty useless to the modern cook. if you want to concot some of the food mentioned, i would check a mexican cookbook for the modern equivalent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dessert for the mind","review":"I read this book after my friend had stayed up almost all night finishing it. So, always in search of a good book to read, I borrowed it from her. What I found was a book unlike anything else that I have ever read. It took me two days of not being able to put it down to finish this short book. The vivid descriptions that the author presents are truely a delight to the senses. Anyone who even has a little bit of the romantic and fanciful in their nature will enjoy what Laura Esquivel has cooked up for the reader. Some advice - don't read it on an empty stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most extinct love history","review":"Where after the true love from one young girl to only man of her life triumph over the tiraned of her mother,the smart of her sister who married - with her man,the confused intent to marry with other man to who unlove,the bihavior traditional and respect meet to end,when is one calvary and suffering all the history develope join to smell of the cooking in the hot kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible, doesn't even provide much heat","review":"Summary in exactly than 50 words: A trashy romance novel with gratuitous and badly integrated recipes. Fantastical elements thrown in for the hell of it. Terrible in Spanish, horrible and cliched in English. Esta novela es para el \\"circular file.\\" Only read it if your Spanish and or English professor forces you to. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disappointment","review":"Unfortunately I returned my copy of this book back to the store so I can't specifically slam it. I thought it was THAT bad. The characters are weakly developed-- they show little depth and intelligence. It's also poorly written or translated. It's emotional and gushy-- would be OK with the balance of depth and intelligence, but that is lacking. If you want good writing try Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude. LWFC is possibly a good children's book? Possibly teenagers might find value in it. but I wouldn't want my kids acting like the characters. It seems like a book for crazy women. I think Danielle Steele can write better than this. If romance is your thing try Wuthering Heights or Madame Bovary. I even liked Bridges of Madison County, but this book is awful aand doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be a good book?","review":"This book reads as though written by someone with a fifth grade education, at best. I found that the writing did not flow, made no sense at all, and placed all of the emphasis in the wrong places. Where there should have been ANY character development, there were uninteresting, tedious descriptions about food. The placement of \\"magical\\" events did not even fit in with the story. In all, this book was a waste of time and paper and if anything, it deserves 1 star because someone would have to try REALLY hard to make something that BAD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story proceeds to take all the happiness away from the main character and it gets worse and worse as you go deeper and deeper into the story. Her love interest says he loves her and marries her sister. But it doesn't stop him from getting the sister pregnant twice. Everyone seems to have a tragic ending love story that ends with death. It's not magical or fairy tale it's just bad and keeps getting worse for every character you hope might be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not at the same level with Marquez or Allende","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am a great fan of G.G. Marquez and I.Allende. They are both amazing authors whose styles are magical realism. When I started reading this book I really wanted to like it but I guess I couldn't help comparing it to Marquez's works and ended up really disappointed. It is more magic than realism. It is as appropriate to place this book in magical realism section as it is appropriate to place Dan Brown's books in history text books section.Overall I don't recommend this book to readers that are looking for the enjoyment that G.G. Marquez's books can provide. I don't mean to offend anyone who liked this book and I truly don't know if I would have liked this book had my expectations not been so high."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tragic Love Story","review":"Como Agua Para Chocolate...A wonderful yet very sad tale of Tita and her family and loved one. For being the youngest Tita must suffer what no other woman should suffer, unable to marry or fall in love because of the awful task of dedicating their lives in taking care of their mother until death.

Tita was not aloud to get married or have and type of love relattionship like that. She was raised in the kitchen and when she cooked all of her emotions were poured into the meal.The story has some racey spots in it were Tita and Pedro secretly share their love for one another, which was outrageously wrong because Pedro is married to Rosaura Titas sister.This book was full of magic realism which holds your attention when reading it. I really enjoyed this book and I recomend that people read it. It shows you the different culture that these people had, the way they handled different situations and how they lived. It was an excellent book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful as a Buyer's Guide.

It does not feature potential problems of certain years which a reader would be looking for.I found more about models info surfing the net.The black and white pics in this modern age of colour also make it look dated. It also took too long for the book to arrive (8 weeks), by the time it arrived, I had already bought and driven one for a month. So if you're going to order a book over the web to assist you in a purchase and live outside the US order early and order wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"This book covers porsche 911 models up to 1995.

Joe Zawinul has brought me much joy through his music over the years and continues to do so. I feel that his music speaks to my soul. Here he sounds great! Great chops and great voice! In this live performance at his club in Vienna, the other band members of the Syndicate are also featured and perform very well: Scott Henderson, Sabine Kabongo and Nathan Townsley, who's able to live up to Zawinul's desire to play fast. (In hiring a drummer for the band after the swift exit of Paco Sery, he asked the prospect, \\"Can you play fast?\\") Most of the songs are uptempo, lively and enjoyable to listen to. At first I didn't enjoy \\"Blue Sound Note 3\\" but it grew on me. I like the original version by Weather Report better. My favorite on this CD is \\"East 12th Street Band\\", which I think is a smoker. I would recommend that Zawinul fans add this to their libraries. Glad to have it in mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Fascinating","review":"Rebecca West was a novelist, biographer, journalist, and critic born in 1892, when women were not liberated. Even so, in the 1920s she began working for the New York Herald-Tribune as a reviewer. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon was her magnum opus, published in 1941, after Yugoslavia had been conquered by the Nazis. This book is not only a travelogue through the Yugoslavia of the mid-1930s but it is a history of the region from the time of the Romans until the fall to the Nazis in 1941. A lot of what she has to say explains the problems that exist in the region today and why there must be a U. N. Peacekeeping Force there. It is a long book (1150 pages) but it is well-written and well-worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"A Classic. Perhaps a little long-winded for the modern reader but full of interesting insights on interwar Jugoslavia and the imminent Nazi threat. Lots of information on earlier history and some amusing commentary on West's relations with her travelling companions who were a Jewish government official and his German wife, particularly considering the politically charged social atmosphere of the time. West has some 'interesting' opinions. In light of the author's background, it might be worth reading earlier works by Edith Durham as an interesting comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but biased historical fiction.","review":"I purchased BL&GF a week ago to read about the former Yugoslavia. I can understand that after the first Great War there was plenty anti German sentiment to go around. The racial and ethnic stereotypes do not stop with Germans but with Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, and Macedonians. The latter which were referred to as either Bulgarians or Serbs. It was well written but historically inaccurate. All we need now is for Oliver Stone to Direct the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the emperor said to Mozart, \\"Too many notes!\\"","review":"Or in this case, \\"Too many words.\\" Among serious books this is the most needlessly verbose and narcissistic I've ever read (exclusive of anything by Proust.) It must be largely fictional since West purportedly repeats verbatim many extremely lengthy and involved conversations and disputes that would only be capable of capture by a tape recorder--and she didn't have one. It is entirely pro-Slavic and tediously anti-German. To West, Gavrilo Pricip is a hero and the Archduke Francis merely a foreign agitator. She includes a vast array of detailed historical anecdotes but leaves one doubtful of her accuracy. She is apparently unaware, for instance, (perhaps deliberately) that the Albanians are not Slavs, that their ancestors were the ancient Illyrians, and that their roots in the Balkans go back to at least 2000 B.C. Some claim to admire her writing style; I found it excessively wordy and personalized."},{"rating":"1","title":"1181 pages too many","review":"This book is a huge disappointment. Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance. At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.

It was widely received as a masterpiece of the epistolary style. It was PRE-STONEWALL, giving lie to the post-Stonewall hype that no novel with a gay theme had been published by any American mainstream publisher. The second edition (after the author's death) was published without his permission in a pornography series. Gay historians note: Stonewall, though important, did not extend to literature with the exception of helping create a sub-literary genus, gay literature. Unfortunate because this movement DECREASED the readership of gay-themed novels and shunted them to a sidetrack to be read only by gay readers. What would Proust say? Gide? What does Vidal say?

A good book/cassette would talk about tips and explain them fully and would not refer/advertise a perticular product. It did have good points like tips for motivating yourself.

This is also a story about people-- and how stories can snowball from a child's tale into a trial. The characters are well painted, you'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding cast and exceptional script","review":"This 1992 made for TV movie is exceptional. The cast is one of the finest matched to the story, I've seen in some time. The story is well written and feels real. It is able to draw you in and get you to invest yourself into the events on screen. It is not racey in regard to nudity but it has profanity so it is not best for small children. It is an excellent tool to educate narrow minds and bring some understanding to, not just the gay issue but also to parents and the expectations they put on thier children as well as what those expectations can do to the children. The film was very well made and I highly recommend you see it. It was an excellant addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lying DVD Description","review":"I am so sick of progay movies being described as 'family dramas' that I think there should be a required notice on all progay movies on the DVD cover.

This soundtrack MIMICKS everything in the actual movie. When you hear the \\"Furies Chase\\" you immediately remember the scene. Barry De Vorzon sounds are all wonderful, the only reason why I purchase this soundtrack. Then you have great music like \\"Love is a Fire\\" by Genyan Ravan. Her voice is definitely up their with Stevie Nicks in the rock world.I say overall 6 out of 10 track definitely was worth buying. There maybe a few other if you're into smooth Latino or a Joe Walsh fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun CD for fans.","review":"If you loved the movie, then you will love the CD.

A must for fans of the cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD and Barry DeVorzon Rocks!","review":"I first saw \\"The Warriors\\" way back in the 70s and have loved this movie and soundtrack ever since! The songs included are from various artists, including the track \\"In The City\\" by Eagles and James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh.

This cd version surpasses the vinyl. And the music holds up pretty well, all things considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"My most wasted several hundred dollars","review":"When the printer worked, the output was fine. However, it has never worked properly. We bought a factory-refurbished unit but it came with 3 problems. The factory tech service gave us the run-around until the warranty expired (partially our fault for not pursuing it better, but even though we had emailed with complaints prior to the warranty ending, they wouldn't consider doing warranty work). Many of the things they expected us to do with it are ridiculous... we're just home computer users and don't expect to devote hours every day to tech support on our printer!With this big, heavy unit it is expensive to ship and techs have quoted us about $300 just to look at it and repair it... so our entire money that we spent on this printer a few months ago is wasted and the printer now doesn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I have used this printer for 1 year and it almost daily crashes and prints ASCII garbage forcing reboot of printer. At least once a day!! Minolta sent tech out and replaced board but it still prints garbage once a day.

I would recommend spending a little more and getting HPs Color Laser which is falling in price fast.I also work in the IT world so not just frustration from a newbie, it's a lemon of product.

Four things that would not allow me to recommend this printer:1) Menu on printer is difficult to use.2) The ethernet port is a problem requiring the computer and printer to be re-booted when the printer locks up.3) The paper going through the printer is \\"rolled\\" and difficult to flatten out because of the heat when prininting.4) The four toner cartridges is expensive to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible printer - I hate mine.","review":"This is the worst thing I have purchased this year. The operators manual is terrible and doesn't tell you anything (but yet it comes in 6 different languages so it \\"looks\\" impressive. It prints a test page every time it starts to help you waste toner and 9 times out of 10 it jams so you have to restart the printer and reboot your computer to get it to work right. When it eventually does print, the graphics quality is HIGHLY overrated by other reviews. The clarity is poor for such a high resolution printer. The controls on the printer to adjust the setting manually are impossible to understand because it's just one circle with arrows that do absoultely nothing when pressed. The installation of the drivers is also a pain due to the multi-language formats it comes in. Save your money and buy a HP -- this printer is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again: noisy, slow & finicky","review":"We've had this printer for 2 years. The end product it good but it has been very unreliable for several months now. At times, for no apparent reason, it will print out an error message and non-sensical jibberish. It also seems to work very hard and slow for even 1 page: makes a very noisy clicking sound 3 or 4 times before it prints anything and then again for each page. I've called Konica Minolta several times, changed the driver, uninstalled & reinstalled it from Windows multiple times but nothing changes.We bought a monochrome, multifunction Brother machine a few months ago and we like it so much, I think we'll buy a color to replace the Konica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also positive","review":"I've also had this printer for about a year, and use it exclusively to print digital photos. It has been a excellant performer, both through parallel and ethernet connection. I haven't seen any paper roll problems, using all types of paper including transparencies and matte photo paper. Toner does seem pricey, but it doesn't dry out like the ink in my old Epson photo printer did, so I figure it's a net savings."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Colour Frustration","review":"I bought this laser model about 2004 and had problems with it from the outset. I got pages and pages of ASCII stuff sometimes at the start of a job and sometimes mid-way into a job.Minolta Support insisted I needed to get forensic diagnostic software to determine the problem with my computer. My computer was brand new at the same time as the printer.The saving grace of this machine is the quality of the output particularly on photos. Skin tones are not too good but probably as good as an inkjet on plain paper.Since OS X Lion the machine is better behaved but it will still paper jam on startup and throw an ASCII tantrum if it feels like. Tons of complaints on US reviews too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price for Good Product","review":"My son is the one that uses these the vanilla is his favorite we ordered both vanilla and choc this time and he said the choc was rich.

It only mentions highlights in passing. For example: Teutoberger wald (15 seconds) Charlemagne (30 seconds monstly about Aachen), Hameln (45 seconds about the Pied Piper story).

The complex nature of this game requires a tremendous amount of time and effort to be an effective competitor. This book provides only a base of general information for the game user.

I'm not old enough to remember Vietnam but the stories gave a nice view of the era that I've not seen elsewhere. The compulsiveness of human nature is a frightening theme I'd like King to return to again and again. It allows one's imagination to run wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS BEST YET, AS NEW FICTION GOES!","review":"I always eagerly await his new books, hardback and paperback, even when I have the hardback. In my opinion, the title story, Hearts in Atlantis is probably one of his most powerful works of fiction yet. Simply beautiful. I loved how he weaved the first story, The Low Men In Yellow Coats, into his Dark Tower series. This book makes me wished I have lived growing up in the sixties, rather than the eighties. And I think I finally learned how to play Hearts from this book, though I still don't like the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the First and Last Story","review":"Loved Low Men In Yellow Coats and the last story, not so wild about the ones in between.

I couldn't wait to finish this one...it was terrible after the first story. The only people who will understand the Vietnam references will be those who experienced it first hand. I was very dissappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good new King novel","review":"Stephen King has an amazing way with imagery and getting readers hooked with a story. I would particularly recommmend this book to anyone who hasn't read any King in a while. This work represents somewhat of a departure from his past style of shocking gore, and might be a pleasant surprise to those who think they can't stomach Stephen King. This book, like Bag of Bones and The Green Mile, weaves an intricate and thoughtful plot with an undercurrent of the supernatural. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed King's commentary on the '60s in Hearts in Atlantis for several reasons. First, I actually failed a semester of college in the spring of 1971 because I played Hearts non-stop instead of going to class or studying. Second, my generation (DOB: 12-18-50)deserves to be held up for examination on the question- for what the hell is it that we still stand? Third, the fluid boundaries of each story within accuratly reflect the extremes of the social and political upheavals that forged, and sometimes bludgeoned, America into her next developmental stage. If you don't mind a little lingering aftertaste to tweak your conscience about what you've been doing since the '60s, this book is a terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Loss in the Sixties","review":"This is not a horror story. This is a story about human strengths and weaknesses, about love and loss. This is King as the dark side of Ray Bradbury.Some will be too old for this book. Others will be too young. I guess I am just the right age. I was a sergeant in the US Army during the 1960s, and I cried when I reached the end of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself through this one.","review":"Usually I enjoy Stephen King novels, thrilling, on the edge of your seat reads, some have made me think and come away with a differing thought or perspective than before. This book I had to force myself to read. It took 10 days, which says alot. The stories had some inter conncetion between them, a common point, though I am not sure I know what now. I could not keep up interest in this book. The stories almost seem to be recycled bits from previous stories. King is a stand out writer, one of the best we have today, and I still look forward to his next book. I just hope it is better than Hearts, though I think it would have to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This book is extremely good . . . but you might want to read the Dark Tower series first, so you understand more of the first part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very good","review":"Like other reviewers,I really wanted to like this book,but was unable to do so.It is becoming apparent that Stephen King peaked somewhere around 1983,with only a few bright spots\\"Misery,\\"\\"The Green Mile\\", since.I say this as someone who once waited eagerly for each new king book to come out.\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is king's attempt to come to terms with the 60's,and specifically,Vietnam,but I feel that he has failed.The stories were uninteresting,the characters unlikable,and if it hadn't been a Stephen King book,I doubt that I would have continued reading.I know that in the past King has mocked authors who take 5 years or more between books,but maybe it's time for him to take some time off,recharge his batteries,and come up with some stories worth telling.Go back and read \\"Night Shift\\" or \\"The Dead Zone\\",and then tell me \\"hearts in Atlantis\\" is the best that King can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always","review":"While not the best king book, I wanted to read this because of its ties to the dark tower. This is a book that will need to stew. Perhaps in a couple weeks I may have more perspective but for now it will be king induced oddity to my dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spellbinding Masterpiece","review":"As an avid fan of King and an '80s baby who was formerly obsessed with the Beatles and the Sixties, I was eager to get his view on that important time as well as our most painful war. The excellence of his writing and his connection to other cultural tie-ins (I read Lord of the Flies right before this) helps me to understand what is must have been like to live in that time, which seems so far away (although I wasn't even alive then). I hate to sound pretentious, but I can really picture the Sixties he described as though I \\"remember\\" them (a past life?). One comment: I was disappointed after read Low Men in Yellow Coats (a true masterpiece) to read stories that slowly dwindled down. And why was Blind Willie so unconnected? Quite possibly because it appeared in Antaeus Magazine. However, Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling tied up the book in an excellent way. It is a modern classic which fits into a nice (albeit 525-page) package."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Stephen King?!?","review":"Like many of the reviewers,I am a huge SK fan. I belong to the SK library and eagerly await his newest book,but I have to admit that the last couple of stories he has put out don't have the throat grabbing suspense that all previous works had. Bag of Bones was ok,it had it's moments. The Girl who loved Tom Gordon was just very uninvolving and his latest,Hearts In Atlantis was just plain boring!! The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for title story. I at least got through that one quickly and it actually had some merit. Please Mr King,return to the kind of novels that made you who you are today. Give us something that will scare the hell out of us and keep us on the edge of our seats!!!!!!!!!!!! I look forward to your next Dark Tower book with great anticipation but as for your next novel,I'm just not too sure anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"HI Friends,I have read many of the reviews here. First, some say that is a book of 5 short stories that may be read independently. I don't find this to be true of this book. If it was a book of short stories, first, it would have a table of contents listing them.I saw it as a novel. Yes, there where various themes explored throughout 5 different, chapters, I guess you could say. But I feel that the \\"stories\\" read independently would have made no sense.I was an avid fan of Stephen King while in college, and now I am in my mid 50s, and have not been as into him in years past, although i have always found him to be a brilliant writer, not only in his writing but in his brilliant insights about human nature.this book is fantastic. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down!","review":"I'm normally not a King fan, except for The Stand, but Hearts in Atlantis is great. I started it on a Saturday and contemplated calling in sick to work on Monday to finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of incomplete stories","review":"I'm baffled by the reviewers who rated this book highly, it makes me wonder if we read the same book.This book is a collection of stories, that loosely tie together, but not in any overall plot system. In fact, none of the stories particularly has a \\"plot\\" as youd typically define it.When I approached the end of the book, I developed a sickening feeling as I realized there were too few pages left for the book to develop anything of interest for the end. The book fizzed out with no climax, but then there had never been any build up of anything TO climax, so that wasn't very surprising.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of King","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is definitly not King at his best. If you have the time, and only if you have the time, you should at least try to read it. Maybe you'll like it.Hearts in Atlantis is about three best friends and their story growing up. Learn how you should stand up for what you believe in and that life shound't be wasted doing things you may regret later in your life.If you don't read this I don't blame you. The first couple of sections were pretty well done, but through the rest of the book I had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better and keeping the edge","review":"Just when you think there's nothing distinctively different, and diverse coming from Mr. King, here comes Hearts In Atlantis. Of course, if you say this to Mr. King, he might disagree. But, the people reading his past books, and short stories might say this. I would say, Mr. King,You Really Are Astute. But, of course, what would you expect from the master!!!! elane sanks @ color-country.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem","review":"I read Hearts In Atlantis over the Labor Day Weekend and the only part about it that I didn't like was that it had to end.King's strongsuit has always been his ability to develop characters that you actually feel/sense/recognize. He doesn't fail in this book. I also loved the way he wove the different characters throughout the different stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Airplane Read...","review":"This book was pretty bland and disjointed, but moderately entertaining. The Green Mile was the first Stephen King book I had read in fifteen years and I loved it, so I was excited to pick up Hearts in Atlantis as another \\"non-traditional\\" Stephen King novel. It seems like Stephen King had multiple disconnected stories that he then went through unnatural acts to join together in Hearts in Atlantis... It's a stretch to bill this novel as a brilliant meditation on Vietnam when the first half of the novel is a poor excuse for a science fiction/mystery story -- I thought the wrong cover had been put on the book. I was left very disappointed after the hype. Go in with \\"low\\" expectations (no pun intended) and expect a mindless, beach book or airplane type read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same formula","review":"I have just read thru some of the other reviews for this bookand people seem to love or hate it. I must be the odd one out as itleft me feeling neither one way or the other. I agree with a lot of people who said the first section of the story is the best, very straightforward King. I felt the book lost the thread way half way through and never regained it. I was waiting for a revalation at the end, some point to the story and it never came. I might be missing the point myself, but I don't thnik so. I have been a huge fan of Stephen King since Carrie & Salems Lot, but I'm finding his books increasingly formulaic and predictable, almost repetative in style if not content. He seems to be leaning more towards 'normal' stories these days, I think Insomnia was the last King book I really enjoyed reading. By normal standards Atlantis is a good book, but for Stephen king just good is well below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This book was some what of a let down after reading Bag Of Bones and The Green Mile. Stephen King said \\"He was a child of the sixties and wanted to write about it\\",I grew up in the fifties and sixties and I could not relate to anything in the book. I got half way through the book and just put it down, it just wasn't going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I have been on the other end of the spectrum, having read some of Kings books but never being real impressed. This one changes everything. being of the 60's everything relates Youth,Vietnam,protest and all the rest. I know Mr King is a great horror writer, but he is equally as good with factual fiction. 5 stars for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of Stephen King's horror books, but this wasn't a horror book. It seemed more like adult contemporary fiction, the kind of thing you hear on Oprah. The first story was great, but it all went downhill from there. The first story was the only one that had a \\"boogeyman\\" or any element of the supernatural. The rest were just about sad misfit people lamenting events that happened in their childhoods. If this book had been by a new author, I wouldn't have read any more books by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, see the movie.","review":"I saw the movie first, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Kings books always seem to translate very well to movies, but I have always loved the books more because of King's meticulous attention to creating a character through subtext. His characters cannot always be conveyed on screen with the same sense of three-dimensionality that he creates in the written word. So what a disappointment to find the shallow and lifeless characters who populate this book. I slogged through it, always hoping that the next page I would understand who these people were, and why the did the things they did. The plot was jointed, the tone of the story has awkward shifts and transitions. I got the sense that this book was a hurry-it-to-the editor effort. Too bad--I wouldn't recommend this one, but it won't make me skip the next King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great story; Terrible audiobook narration","review":"I'm not crazy about King's work in this book, but my real complaint is with Hurt's narration in the audiobook. (King and Hunt split narration duties. King narration work was wonderful as always.) Hunt's reading for large parts of this book sound almost as if he had been half-asleep or drunk. I thought the book was misrecorded at the wrong speed, but then I heard King's sections, and it seemed just fine. Hurt's \\"style\\" is more than distracting, and I regret this purchase. I do not recommend the audiobook version of Hearts In Atlantis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder...","review":"This was my first Stephen King book and I enjoyed it. He made me care about what happened to all of the characters in each of the section. Being born in 1972, I was not alive during the Viet Nam War. Reading this book makes me thankful that I was not, and also makes me wonder what side I would have taken had I been alive back then.This book does not rely on horror and the supernatural for its thrills, but instead relies on pshycological drama in each of its characters. A good book to read for a first time Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"hard to put down\\" Novel by Stphen King","review":"Hearts of Atlantis begins in the inner city with a single mother raising her only son Bobby. Bobby befriends a mysterious elder gentleman while struggling with lifes difficulties as a semi picked on pre-teen. Bobby becomes our hero (or does he) in part one of this novel. The start of part two leaves you in suspense of what happens to Bobby as an adult... A must read that is very hard to put down, so put down the vaccuum and the dust rag because once you pick up this novel the chores will have to wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching","review":"I'm not fond of every King's work, but this book is really worth it. Not only the plot is amazing, but the characters seem to be so real, and so rich, that the book causes all sorts of feelings in the readers mind.There are five stories interconnected by characters who were previously introduced in the first one. Encountering them throughout the book made me fell nostalgic. The same sentiment comes along when the author describes the end of one's childhood, going to college, or fond memories of someone who played a very important role in your life in the past, but is no longer present.What I also found very nice about this book is the way King relates some of his ideas with classics such as Lord of the Flies and Of Mice and Men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of his best!","review":"I have been a long-time, devoted \\"dear reader\\" - yes, even through the good and the bad; there truly have been enough of both. I approached this work as I do all of Kings'; with anticipation but a careful wariness. I have always felt that someone as prolific as he can't possibility hit the mark each time. Yet I keep coming back for more. This time I was rewarded! What a wonderful story....told in typical King fashion filled with the kind of insights that ring true over and over again. I especially like the way in which he folds his characters into seemingly unrelated parts of the book and thus ties them all together over time and various settings. Thanks Mr King for a really enjoyable experience. More, please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two books for the price of one","review":"This book starts out with one story, tells another, and incorporates both. After this book, I rented the movie and was deeply disappointed. It starts with a story of a young boy and a friendship with an older man who has a supernatural connection. You start to wonder as the book seems to end half way through. You are then introduced to new characters and events. Some of the characters are continued in the second half and tied into the rest of the book. The main character of the second half gets involved in a card game addiction almost causing him to flunk out of college. I felt myself identifying with the \\"one more hand and I'll go study\\" ploy. Around this character the Viet Nam war is happening. The book ties all the characters together at the end, some rather loosely. King narrates some of this audio book which adds to the enjoyment. After reading the book, don't bother renting the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a typical King \\"scare your pants off\\" novel","review":"I read this with some doubts at the beginning, hearing and reading mixed reviews, but as I got into the first few chapters I began to enjoy it very much. When I read the synopsis, I thought 'well maybe the negative reviews were right.' Good thing I chose to ignore them! Certainly not his best work, but not bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - King reads half the book!","review":"Nowhere on the label does it say Stephen King is reading any of this book. If it did, I would never have bought the CD. The first story is read by a very good reader. The rest is not -- at least so far as I can tell. I listened to King read for 5 more disks and that was all I could stand. I don't know how much of it he actually reads. I feel this was trick labeling of the CD and I will never buy another Stephen King audio book for fear it will not tell the truth about who is reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I loved the movie so much that I wanted to read the book. The book had dark and creepy undertones, where the movie didn't show that at all. The movies made growing up in the sixties look fun, the book was strange, for example cars weren't really cars, they were alive. Movie was great, book not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn..........","review":"I just don't understand the hype about this one.This book was a big yawn, and I realized this early on, but I continued reading all 700,000 pages (so it seemed), hoping for an eye opening ending. I never got it.First off, maybe somebody needs to help me understand the need for splitting the book into two completely different stories? Stories that had no climax nor reason, and where the 1st 'story' had no ending!!I would not recommend this to anybody who likes a page turner. Maybe you just truly have to be a King fan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEARTS GETS FIVE STARS!!!!!!","review":"King's HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is one of his better books. I've read six novels of his and this one has a great plot and awesome character development. I would recommend it to King or nonKing fans.There's another novel out there called 'THE FIST OF GOD' by A.T. Nicholas. It's a phenomenal supernatural thriller!!!!!! The plot has some cool twists and the characters are realistic. The angelic character is real awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Tower Teaser","review":"This book must've neen written in a hurry, but King has done it again!! \\"Hearts\\" was a surprise around every corner. Although the book was just a tease for the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, it was very good and recommend it to anyone who loves Stephen King but not demented literature!!Ha-ha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy!","review":"I love how these five stories are related by both major and minor characters; the reader is forced to remember the minute details that make Stephen King such a great suspense writer. He constantly collides the real and the fantastic and makes one realize the possibility of all things good and evil. The reader is afraid of both the monsters and the men who they unhabit---the monsters being the Vietnam War, paranoia, and even one's own parents. What a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story, beautiful (and ugly) descriptions","review":"After finishing HIA, my daughter caught me crying and asked why? I had to tell her that this book made me remember guys who couldn't escape the draft by grades or being too young. King's story telling will make you fall in love with a character, even though they are never truly, physically described."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh great another \\"horror\\" story from King","review":"I fell asleep reading this. As i did with bag of Bones. I suppose when you've made a qaudzillion bucks you can get away with not dealing in horror anymore.oh wait - it is horror. Just a differnet kind of horror. Umm ok...I suppose I'll give it one star then for \\"horror\\"Hope he gets back to writing what made him rich in the frist place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me mad","review":"Having read more than a dozen King books over the years this book made me angry. I feel like I was ripped off on this one for two reasons. One, I lived through the period he wrote of and to have the character who gets the most space in the book have no bigger problem in his life than getting addicted to hearts and falling behind in his studies at the University of Maine is slightly rediculous. Two, the book reads more like a collection of short stories than a novel. The characters in each story are tied together by the flimsiest of plot inserts, so that a character who is barely fleshed out in one part appears in another part as a wholly different character. It seems to me that King must have gotten addicted to hearts while he was writing this one. I give him a C-. It holds your interest but at the end it was all cotton candy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Contains every demeaning and ignorant cliche there is about the Vietnam war and those of us who fought there. If you read this thing, please buy \\"Stolen Valor\\" and \\"After Tet\\" and read them for some balance.Mr. King, you're cordially invited to come and stay with us as my guest in Cambodia so you can see the results of the abandonment of the people of Sourtheast Asia due to the antiwar protests you find so neat and cool...you should be ashamed of what you have written."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an effort for me to complete. I wqnted to put it away many times, but forced myself to stay with it. It did redeem itself somewhat, but I can't say i enjoyed it. King seemed to be reaching for something but was unable to find the right words. I have lived through this era, also, and I found his characters to be unbelievable and boring. I had a hard time trying to remember Pete's name (hearts in atlantis) I'm not really sure what King's message was in the book. It was plodding and overdone. king's writing has usually been entertaining and well paced. This was not the case in this try. His voice so strong that it is a distraction. In his effort to try for a depth in his writing he seems to have lost his way and wallows around in verbosity. I'm sorry I wasted my precious summer reading time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say this... but it definitly could be better...","review":"The first half of this book is very, very good. I really like King's novels (GET WELL SOON) and have read nearly all of them. I'm proud to say.But this one... I frankly didn't think that there is a need for the entire Hearts thing. A good chuck of the book is dedicated to how addictive this game is to college students. I was once a college student, our game was pool, I understand. I just didn't need to read pages and pages about it. This may be a thing about Vietnam and that's great, but that deserves it's own book.It got to the point where I was frantically scanning for the names of the three kids that were in the first half of the book. I was severly disappointed when they didn't show up again till the end.I heard that the movie rights have been sold to Castle Rock. I really don't think I'm going to spend money to watch a bunch of kids play cards. That is not going to happen.Defeinitly could be better Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"I THINK KING PHONED THIS DUD IN.","review":"Nothing much happens in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS during the 60 pages I read. I have a life, and 60 pages is all I plan to invest in this door-stop.I suspect King forgot how to write horror/thrillers when he was hanging out with Peter Straub. Stevie? Get with Thomas Harris for a refresher course.But I love King's first books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Stephen King Book?","review":"This story started out with promise with Low Men In Yellow Coats. After that it quickly loses steam. When I buy a Stephen King book I expect to be frightened if not that at least to be entertained. This book did not fufill either desire. I am dissapointed that King did this to his fans who expect a lot more out of him. I wonder if he thinks because he is so succesful that he can just crank out anything he wants and people will just lap it up. Mr King please stick to horror what your good at if I want to read about the sixties I'll read a history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's HEART in Atlantis","review":"THIS is the Stephen King I've been waiting for! Mr. King, unquestionably an extremely talented and prolific writer, had begun to oversaturate the horror market with too many books that were sounding all the same. He lifted himself out of that rut with BAG OF BONES, and now has surpassed himself with the wonderful HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. Five separate, yet interconnecting stories tied together by the underlying themes of the 60's and the Viet Nam war, HEARTS is King at his very best. An obviously autobiographical work, HEARTS is engaging, full of humor, heartfelt introspection and a poignancy all too rare in his earlier novels. If, like me, you'd been burned out by King, read this book...you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I hate parroting what sounds like a jacket blurb (in fact, it may have been a blurb), but after reading this book, I had to say \\"Wow... I never knew King could write this well.\\" I stopped reading King several books back after a growing feeling that the narrators may be changing but the voice stayed the same; in other words, a feeling of commercialism and formulaic writing. With this book, King steps over into the arena of literature, not merely popular fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture is not always worth a thousand words.","review":"Excellent novel, thick with imagery and wonder-- unlike the movie of the same name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low men, high moments. Not to be confused with the Dead Zone","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an endearing nostalgic book, a pleasure to read. It had frightening moments and nightmarish situations but there was a change in Mr. King's writing style. It would be difficult to explain this subtle change. Nevertheless, it is there and personally, all his fans will feel privileged if this change becomes part of his permanent style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An avid Stephen King fan","review":"I have read almost all of Stephen King's books. In \\"Hearts\\" he has developed a rather different, but appreciative style. A small section was developed towards his surrealistic dark side, but the majority was a well done story based on \\"slice of life\\" set in the flower child era.I have almost given up on King until I read Atlantis. For people new to King, don't view this as a stereotypical scary, ghouls and goblins book. Its not. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Stephen King book ever!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It brought back many memories of the 60's era and made me keep one eye on my Viet Nam vet husband. No sign of a Zippo lighter but....! I only wish there was mention of what happened to \\"Blind Willie\\" and did he ever get revenge on the cop? And how did the glove get from Willie to Sully? Although I know Ted had something to do with this. It was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different and great!","review":"I used to read Stephen King a lot when I was younger, The Shining, Cujo... I kinda stopped reading it. But I liked Bag of Bones, and it seemed different. I just finished reading Hearts in Atlantis, and it was totally different from any other King book that I've ever read- and I loved it! It was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I thought the stories dealing with Vietnam were very touching and strong and the ending brought tears to my eyes. It was wonderful! I would recommend this book, even to people who haven't read much Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted is back..","review":"Ted's adventures as briefly described in the Dark Tower series.Yay! Great read, lots of 60's references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Great, William Hurt was awful!","review":"I loved this story but I couldn't stand William Hurt reading the Book on Tape. I don't understand why another reviewer said he was so good. He was so monotone and he constantly emphasized the wrong parts of the sentences. He rambled on and on without taking a breath; I couldn't tell where one sentence ended and the next began. He didn't change the voices for the characters like a good reader does. He was the worst reader I have ever heard and I have listened to quite a few books on tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For your information: Hearts in Atlantis is a winner!","review":"For one who swore off Stephen King after Gerald's Game, Hearts in Atlantis brought me back into King's fan club. The combination of William Hurt's narrative coupled with King's imaginative descriptions made \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" my favorite. When Stephen King's voice began telling me about college life at Chamberlain Hall in l966 I was hooked like Pete Riley and the card game. King's Foghorn Leghorn imitation alone is worth the price of the audiobook. I remain confused with \\"Blind Willie\\" and hope someone will explain it to me. Perhaps I'll \\"start to understand it in time\\" as Sully John did the old mamasan. Hearts in Atlantis is 21 hours of entertainment and years of thoughtful enjoyment. This review refers to the unabridged audiotape version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"This is Stephen King at his best. If your looking for a book that will keep you up at night, this is it...but not because of vampires or creepy monsters; the subject matter hits too close to home for that. I finished the book a week ago and still find myself thinking about the ending - a superb blending of all the previous \\"sub-novels\\" (five in all) contained in the book. These characters will haunt you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is pure Stephen King. The first section, \\"Low Men....\\" reminds me of The Regulators. Just as intense, though not as frightening. The second and title section was my favorite. It helps the reader to understand the different viewpoints that the Vietnam War inspired/created. The last three sections pull all the characters together in a way that only King can. Stephen King and I have matured together. Hooray for making us think as well as making us look over our shoulders!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the old Stephen King","review":"Is there any way to give less than 1 star? King used to be fun (and spooky) to read. Not so anymore! It seems as if he's used it all up and is now selling us political diatribe under his name. I will buy no more King \\"stuff\\" nor will I read anymore until he returns to what got him where he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"My heart just wasn't in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS!","review":"Hey! What happened to King? This story made no sense. It failed to connect the Regulators and the Dark Tower, which apparently was the only reason I could see for Mr. King having wanted to have written this book.Trivial story, problems and characters made this a waste of time. I'm glad I borrowed this book, like all his others since GERALD'S GAME (another annoyingly stupid story), from the library. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING, ALL OVER THE MAP","review":"I like Stephen King but I couldn't recommend this book to anyone. The first part is alright but it really leaves you hanging. I don't know if S.K. was trying to write \\"The Great American Novel\\" but he sure did jump around a lot. You will not come out of this book with a good feeling. King's short stories are great. When I finish them I wish that there was one more in the book. Hearts in Atlantis is one weird compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is lousy","review":"king couldn't decide whether he wanted the book to be a horror story or maudlin ,rambling tale of life in the sixties. Very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"As a big king fan I was shocked how bad this book was. I really wanted to like it but I started, put it down, started, put it down.... All that vietnam stuff bores me to hell and the story is not even entertaining.

In this case, before King knew how to write INTERESTING books. With this book, take King's own advice, \\"read the first ten per cent...if it isn't giving more than it's taking by then, put it aside.\\" After 52 pages you will be reading a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down!","review":"I'm beginning to wonder if King is imitating Bag of Bones' Mike Noonan's technique for writer's block, publishing older books stored for rainy days.

None of the stories really caught my attention, and none of them was interesting enough to make me rush through the pages, like many other Stephen King books did. The first story, \\"Low men in yellow coats\\" is the best one, but only because of its link with the Dark Tower series. Someone who doesn't know those books won't find it as appealing. As for \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", is also a little bit interesting, but it doesn't justify its excessive length. The same thing happens with \\"Blind Willie\\". As for the two final stories, \\"Why we're on Vietnam\\" and \\"Heavenly Shades of Night are falling\\", well... they just bore me to death. I guess even the King can fail sometimes. Better luck on the next book, Stevie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping me to understand my Step Dad","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a book that every slacker college student should read. For me, you could substitute playing hearts for playing Quake II. Mr. King does a wonderful job painting a picture that relates to today's young adults seemlessly. So you mean to tell me that the baby boomers once felt as rebelious as the youth of today? I guess the seed really doesn't fall that far from the tree. These stories are engaging and provocative, provided you can open your head to the concept of the Dark Tower for one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"King finally lets me down","review":"In which Stephen King writes a \\"Wonder Years\\" episode. Well, more like the whole series. Ugh.Hearts in Atlantis is not a horror book at all. It's been out a while, and picked it up for cheap used, and didn't know this about it. It follows the life of an uninteresting kid from the Northeast leading an unremarkable life in the 50's, becoming a rather timid \\"radical\\" in the 60's, and an aging boomer father by the end. In the mean time, we meet the mundane people of his life, childhood bullies, bad influences in college (why study when there is money to be made playing Hearts?), friends who go to Viet Nam; some who suffer from debilitating illness. I didn't care about a single one -- for the first time, King's power of character creation was utterly lost on me.Other King books have started out slow but managed to generate SOME interest by the end. This never did. I kept waiting for a justification that I did not waste 19 hours of my life listening to this, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King is a fine, talented author, but Hearts in Atlantis was not my favorite. A few of the segments were good reading, but I found myself skipping over pages...the book held little interest for me. Bag of Bones was excellent; one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost gave up half-way through","review":"I have never before almost given up on a SK book, however, Hearts in Atlantis almost did it for me. Honestly, I am wondering what has happened to the old Stephen King style. In Hearts in Atlantis we are introduced to drivel such as \\"cars that aren't really cars\\" but evil entities, more mind-reading and other non-scary, non-compelling ideas. My next Stephen King book will be borrowed from the library and purchased only if I have had an enjoyable reading experience. My favorite book is still Misery, a book that is horrifying because it is something that could truly happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the first story was good......","review":"don't get me wrong, i love SK. but this book sucks. the first story \\"low men in yellow coats\\" was great, but that was a result of the connection to the Dark Tower series which i LOVE. wizard and glass was one of SK's best books ever! but this book went downhill after low men. i do appreciate SK's attempt at literary acceptance, or whatever it is he wants. but i miss the old, big, huge, monster books he wrote. ones with plots, many characters that you know better than you own parents, etc. hell, the green mile was one of the greater books of the 90's, and different seasons was an excellent collection of stories. if those cannot grant literary acceptance, then SK will be hard pressed to write something that will. and if he outdose those books, i'll be in heaven enjoying every word. SK, finish the Dark Tower! and get well soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King is back on track","review":"While I had enjoyed King's last few works, they had not grabbed me and pulled me in like some of earlier works. Hearts of Atlantis,however, got me hooked and I spent a number of nioghts reading well past midnight because I couldn't put it down. Glad to see he is continuing his Dark Tower/Gunslinger theme - that plot line alone will ensure I buy every book he publishes from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I work in a bookstore and was thrilled when we got in the advance copy. I read it in two days and can honestly say that I couldn't in good conscience recommend it to anyone. The first story intrigued me with Bobby and the neighbor, but then it got into the more minor story lines and tied together way too neatly at the end.

If u are looking for a good introduction to this side of King's story telling then look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books","review":"This is my third time reading this book, and I still love it.A very good read about life in the 1960's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey worth taking","review":"My husband is a huge Stephan King fan and finally talked me into reading one of his books. He chose Hearts in Atlantis for me because it is his favorite. It's not what I consider a typical \\"Stephan King book\\" because it is not horror or scary, but does have a touch of sci-fi. The book is broken into pieces, each focusing on a different character, the last of which is focused back on the first character to tie things together. It is a very interesting story, some sections more exciting than others. I still do not fully understand it, but I'm not sure the reader is meant to. It is certainly worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best book since It","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I got the book on Friday night and finished it Sunday at about 4:00 a.m. This book was SO gripping and poignant and meaningful. It's just amazing how Mr. King can scare us AND bring tears of joy and sadness to our eyes (as he did here -- in a fashion somewhat similar to the story that Stand By Me was based on.) I give this book my highest praise and have already encouraged others who had been a little disappointed with Bag of Bones and Tom Gordon to read it. I'm sure they and you will be greatly impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"I was wandering through Meijers late one night with a friend when I decided to buy a book. King is about the only auther whose books I actually buy. I don't think I've read another book so quickly in my life. The first two stories were great! The characters were easy to relate to and the story flowed superbly. I found myself rushing through the third and fourth stories to find out what happened at the end. I regret reading them so quickly. King depicts human nature in a way that makes you lie awake wondering at night. This was not his best work, but definatly good enough for him to be proud of just the same. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer to King","review":"What a great read! This is a novel to get into the depths of the complex people of the 1970s. Hearts in Atlantis would have been even better without the horror aspects. If anything it detracted from a story that kept me reading for its shear humanity and closeness to those seventies years when America began to grow up.If Stephen King wrote more like this, I would look to his books, as books to read and reread again and again. The only other book like that was 'Salem's Lot, which also has that same humanity and loss of innocence and bonds of limitless trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book I've read in months","review":"Finally I found a book I could get lost in again. Every once in awhile a book just grabs you from beginning to end. Of course the switch between two stories in one book is always hard (I wanted to learn a lot more about Bobby Garfield, actually!) but easy to get over. Also, the red line that seems to run through a lot of King's books, The Dark Tower, is fascinatingly woven in this book. I WANT THE DARK TOWER 5! But if he keeps writing books like this one, the wait won't be that long..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEARTS shows little heart here for me.","review":"I love Stephen King and I can appreciate when he writes a \\"non-horror\\" novel -- Hell, I enjoyed EYES OF THE DRAGON -- but HEARTS IN ATLANTIS just didn't do it for me. As per the book jacket, there is no mention that it is made up of several short stories that don't really connect so I kept waiting for the pay-off. Also, I didn't read THE DARK TOWER series (which the Men in Yellow Coats section pertains to) so I didn't \\"get\\" the significance of their existence in the book. I don't want to trash this prolific author because of his importance in American literature and because of his humility when talking about his own level of writing. King knows he's not the best and I admire that. And someone who has written as many novels as he has is surely allowed a \\"stinker\\" every now and then ... I just think this is one of them. I don't believe (as some do) he's lost his touch, because BAG OF BONES was truly a great read. Here's hoping his next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome beginning - Disappoiting ending!","review":"Hearts in Atlantis starts out like a true Stephen King novel. Vivid characterizations,intriquing plot and all the supernatural elements that keep us reading till 3am! But what happened to parts 2 - 5. Gone are the horror and suspense to be replaced by two dimensionel charactors and political rhetoric. I felt cheated out of an ending. And though part 1 makes reference(s) to THE DARK TOWER series, I never read those (tried to - but found them plodding and uninteresting!) Did I miss something? Is the real ending somewhere in THOSE books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearts of Atlantis","review":"Another \\"wordy\\" King book. The first part was ok but nothing else happens that would warrant all these pages/words. The stories are related, but big deal, they go nowhwere. I wonder at how King can come up with excellent stories (Shawshank, Misery, Needful Things, The Stand to name a few) and then come out with wordy go nowwhere stories. I've started to check him out of the library before I invest...not something I use to do with King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good but....","review":"I have read several of Stephen King's books and was anxious to read this one. I found the beginning to be pretty interesting. The story about the boy and the men in yellow coats and the interesting new neighbor were pretty good. I just kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. The last half of the book seemed to really drag. I was waiting for Bobby to walk in somewhere. It was almost 4 totally different books combined. It just seemed to drag on forever. I never really got into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Viet Nam","review":"O.K. we baby boomers eventually go back to the 60s and Viet Nam - but hey who could tell it better than King.

It was a little too sprawling, but the stories were quite engrossing and there were many nifty threads that connected them all together. You have to work a bit to get there. but when you do, it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Story Pawned Off As One","review":"Very disappointing. This is really a book of 3 stories VERY loosely linked togather by one or two overlapping characters. The first part of the book is very good and typical King (though the movie did not do it justice!) Unfortunately, the second part is about an entirely new character with a secondary character from the first part as a secondary character in the second part. The third part was about mostly about another secondary character from the first part of the book and some almost unrelated new characters.Confusing? It is as if King had 3 short stories in mind but wanted to write a lengthy book. I felt somewhat deceived. He does, rather weakly, try to tie the parts togather at the very end.Net, net. Borrow the book and read the first part and the last several pages! Sorry to be so hard on a writer I usually love.. but not this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing for a Stephen King Book....","review":"I enjoy reading Stephen King and was very pleased to receive this book as a gift for my birthday. Right away I bonded with the main character Bobby and then Ted, the old man who befriends him. What a delightful story full of imagination with a little bit of real life thrown in this was. I was very disappointed to get 322 pages into Bobby's \\"adventurous\\" life only to be taken away to a college where all the guy (who was not related to Bobby but knew Carol) did was play cards for 300 pages! I never read the back of the book first so I had no idea this was three stories in one. The third short story took us back to a grown up Bobby but it just wasn't enough to draw me back into the book and I can't get over how poorly it ended. Buy it for the first story if you enjoy Kings books and skip the second chapter unless you're still in college and can possibly relate to whatever is happening for those 300 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lady in black","review":"This book is a really great Stephen King book. He writes non-horror books as well as he writes horror and fantasy. I have read just as many non-horror king books as I have read horror books, but I am a new King fan. In order I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The Green Mile, The Shining, Hearts In Atlantis, The Gunslinger, and now I am on The Talisman. Hearts In Atlantis was good because all of the stories mentioned the characters from the first story and showed how they experienced the 60's. My favorite stories are Low Men In Yellow Coats and Hearts In Atlantis. Low Men In Yellow Coats is so good that a lesser author could get by with just that. I gave it only 4 stars because in some places it can get a little slow and some stories aren't all that great. My third favorite story was Blind Willie but I didn't get why Blind Willie did what he did. It was still pretty good though. I can only hope the movie is half as good as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It left me crying and wanting more","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was an excellent book. I throughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great story. I liked how all the parts flowed together. Though I found the middle section to drag a little, I am obsessed with the Bobby/Ted/Carol plotline. I haven't read the Dark Tower series yet and now I can't wait to start. This was a really emotional book that leaves you feeling satisfied, but yet craving more. I know that's contradictory, but many things in life are. This a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent storytelling","review":"In Hearts in Atlantis, Stephen King gives us his usual - brilliant storytelling. The first two stories in particular are excellent. I found myself losing interest toward the end, although my attention was held by trying to find out what happened to Carol Gerber, the only character who is relevant to every story. As a college student who spent several months playing cards instead of doing schoolwork, the second story has me hooked. I really relate to the protagonist of that story, Pete Riley, as he struggles with girls and college life. I've read it half a dozen times already, and still can't get enough of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of great storytelling, and, lets be honest, if you're reading this review you probably are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts In Atlantis","review":"I will just have too say how blown away I am by this book. First, the concept of the whole thing was intiguing and I just coundn't wait to get into it and see just exactly how these four novellas would read like a novel. As I got into the story I was just mesmerize by the writing. Stephen King just gets better and better. I loved the way that \\"Low Men In Yellow Coats\\" tied into the \\"Dark Tower\\" series. The exact way it ties in might be a little confusing though if you have not read any \\"Dark Tower\\" book. The novllas (I'm sorry to say) do not get better as the book goes on. Like some other reviewers have said, I have to say it does go \\"down hill\\". But it is a huge hill that its going down and it doesn't even make it a tenth of the way down. Very compelling and realistic characters throughout the whole thing. I can still picture the disgustingness of the pimple-faced Ronnie Melanfant. This is really a great read. I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best","review":"I loved the book and bought the CD to listen to while on long drives. It's one of King's best restrained writings, with no stomch turning descriptions of blood and gore and very little off the wall, meaningless intrusion of aliens which characterize some of his other novels (Dreamcatcher, Regulators etc.) The only thing off-putting was the extremely poor diction of William Hurt. He routinely pronounced t's and d's as \\"tha,\\" which may come across as laid back in a movie role, but in a reading sounds just plain sloppy. I would have given it five stars except for Hurt. I sincerely hope he is not used in readings again, at least until he receives some speech therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Less horror and more drama, I would say this book is, although there are still a couple \\"weird\\" parts. The first half could be a book by itself--that's what the movie is based on, anyway. An engaging read, as is Stephen King's custom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, boring story","review":"Starts out great and then gets progressively bad, just like many other King books. (Remember the awful endings to Needful Things and Tom Gordon)? Also, it seems as though King is starting to recycle material--the relationship between Bobby and Ted is remarkably similar to that of the young boy and former Nazi in \\"Apt Pupil,\\" one of King's best stories. Anyway, King should leave the Vietnam stuff to Tim O'Brien, a writer who was actually there. (Incidentally, he's also a MUCH better writer than King.) I have read almost every King book, but this one is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stories - A Star for Each Worth Reading","review":"Please rename the book, \\"The Men Who Loved Carol Gerber\\" as it is about as exciting as \\"Tom Gordon\\".

SP4C James \\"Les\\" Moreland's remains were identified in January 2011 and were buried in Brierfield, Alabama the following month. SGT John D. Early is incorrectly listed as MIA. He was WIA (wounded in action) and survived. The only two Green Berets who remain MIA (although declared dead by the Army in 1978) are SFC James W. Holt and SP5C Daniel R. Phillips. Holt was last seen running over to the ammunition bunker to look for some hand-held Light Anti-tank Weapons (LAWs).

Longgrear, who had come so lately to the camp and knew nothing of the background or of the Green Berets involved in the history of the camp.Parts of the author's descriptions of certain events contrast sharply with those of the Team Sargeant, William T. Craig, who was not trapped in the Command Bunker but was on the run outside the Bunker, along with several other Green Berets.The author digresses repeatedly without making the effort to complete the subject matter thoroughly.The book gives the reader only part of the story, however, as so many years have passed, it is no doubt impossible to ascertain what and why this particular event is still such a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of Dreams and Stars","review":"Stumbled across this CD and purchased it for no other reason than the cover art and titles of the the songs intrigued me. I'd never heard of 2002 before but was delighted with the serendipity of the purchase - this CD is amazing. I've since bought \\"The Sacred Well\\" and plan on aquiring their earlier works in time. Their music is like a \\"music lasagne\\" - layers on layers of misty melody and counterpoint, complimenting each other but soulful enough to stand on their own.

To me, that's the highest praise I can give. Eisenhower (the author) writes as an historian ought to, with no axes to grind in describing Montgomery's actions, etc. His firsthand knowledge of Army ways and wherefores holds him in good stead: the reader is being shepherded through the material by one in the know who always provides a down-to-earth rational perspective. The story he tells stands on its own as, alternately, a mystery, an excellent character study of the participants (particularly the commanders), and an exciting tale of an event that represented, in my mind, the climatic event of World War II in the European Theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF BULGE","review":"Eisenhower has a way of bringing you right into the fight. He covers in great detail the extreme conditions the American GI faced in winter battle. I have read over 25 books on WWII and this is a good one. My one complaint is the book uses so much military jargon that it can be overwhelming for a non military person. He should at least explain in the beginning some of the military terms used. For example, how many men in a platoon, division, etc...(I have the same complaint about most WWII history books). Overall this is a good read for anyone interested in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on the Ardennes Offensive","review":"After reading a recent novel The Commodore, by John LoweThe CommodoreI have once again picked this book up along with others.

It did this in such a way as I have not yet seen written that it brought me back to this detailed book which I consider one of the top two books on the subject and the second one is not by Ambrose.

My child has many lift-the-flap books and she's gentle with every one of them.On the very first page, the arm \\"swings\\" to point to a nose and my child always expects it to fold open like all other flap books (it's barely hanging on now). The next page has 10 toes that \\"wiggle\\", but the flaps are so tiny they are impossible for little fingers to pry up (do we expect our toddlers to use their fingernails?). The \\"pull the ears\\" page is the most ridiculous. The mechanism makes it look like there's a flap under the baby's chin, so of course, my child lifted that flap and proceeded to tear the page by accident.I'm definitely a proponent of children learning new motor skills, but this wasn't what I had in mind during storytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites","review":"My 22 month old daughter loves this book - it has been a favorite for a while now.

He is very fit and trim. Finola Hughes is gorgeous and very elegant. Cynthia Rhodes is a knockout and portrays her character, Jackie, with so much emotion. I think this is a fantastic movie. Since I was too young to see Sat Night Fever when it first came out, I didn't really understand all the ins/outs of Tony Manero. Having seen SNF as an adult, I really didn't like it and I thought that Staying Alive could have stood on its own.

Travolta had just been involved with a couple of flops (the romance movie with the wonderful Lily Tomlin, which I cannot remember the title) and I thought this would be the last we would see of him. I was wrong and to his credit he has had staying power.

What came out of this mess was a hit single \\"Far From Over,\\" which strangely enough came from a struggling singer named Frank Stallone. Any relation? You betcha! Travolta went through a great workout and had a sculpted body. I guess it was Rambo: the Musical. The sloppy story is predictable, and the finale production number makes \\"Showgirls\\" finale an outstandiong piece of theater. This could have been more. Fever was the ultimate film of the 1970s.

You know things are wrong when the Bee Gees play second fiddle to Frank Stallone in the soundtrack department. Leaving no cliché unturned, Sly handles the backstage drama in predictable \\"Rocky\\" fashion. The climactic bump-and-grind production numbers look like MTV run amok. A well-lubricated Travolta gives it his best shot, but cannot overcome Stallone's ham-handed approach.

Evem Travola should be \\"Tskked\\" over his acting, much less his involvement, in this pitifully conceived, horribly written movie full of going through the motions acting. I suppose Travolta does his best with a rotten script, but this movie doesn't answer so many questions from the first movie that could have made for an excellent story- in spite of a pointless acting bit by Manero's mom from the original. Terrible music doesn't hold a candle to \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack. The \\"Rocky\\" theme song would have been more appropriate during the audition scenes.

Of all the movies to make a sequel to, they had to pick the perfect snapshot of the 70's disco scene, 6 years later, and run it into the ground. The original had all the flare and excitement of the still-fresh era, and should have been left that way: fresh and exciting. Stayin' Alive bares no resemblance to the original other than the final scene and Tony's character. This movie takes the original and puts that special \\"80's touch\\" on it, turning the 2001 Odyssey into \\"Cats\\" and Tony Manero into \\"Rambo.\\" You don't believe it? Look at the box!

The Broadway show \\"Satans Alley\\" was so silly, it was more comedy than great dancing. It nearly reaches the \\"so bad its good\\" status, but not quite.

If you can imagine taking the movie \`Rocky' and flipping it on it's ear from a boxer to a dancer, than I need explain no more.

Can Live With.","review":"My opinion is this game's going to be the better than the two first Harry Potter video games, even at the risk of combining the first two.I've heard from other sites the game's going to follow the book more closer than the movie. I also hear the game will be released in Q2 of 2004. You will be riding Hagrids pets, including Buckbeak. You will be learning 10 or more spells than the second Harry Potter, and possibly more than one class a day. EA's adding much more to the game, than the second and first. The game will also be longer. This time possibly a few months to beat. It will be realistic just as the second, as in day and night. It is even a rumor there will be more than 30 days in Harry third year! Keep in mind it's only a rumor. Little is still known about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because the game has yet to come out. I'll keep you updated with the third Harry Potter Game. B-Bye!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Compared to Harry Potter 2 Game","review":"This game was a complete let down. All challenges throughout the game are exactly the same and did not vary in difficulty - i.e. moving boxes around and pushing buttons. Game play was only about 12 hours - compared to over 30 hours from the second Harry Potter. The story did not follow the book at all and it was irritating to have to switch between characters to use the various spells. Also, by only allowing two place holders for spells or objects, you have to continually switch back and forth to the menu page selecting the spell you want for that particular activity. Overall, this game was an utter letdown - especially after all the fun and challenge of the Chamber of Secrets game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great music. Both CD's are worth having.

'Precious Cargo' is an unreleased collection of seven cuts that the band,had apparently created during a rehearsal / jam in 1970. The main factor that drew me to this disc is that Simon House provides the violin playing and the vocals. House's vocals are better than one might expect. The rest of this CD's line-up is: Tony Hill - guitar, Peter Pauli - bass and Roger Hadden - drums. The tunes that I enjoyed the most were the nine-minute epic \\"Exploration\\" and \\"Rock Me In Your Wave\\". Probably best described as ahead-of-it's-time progressive with elements of psychedelia tossed in. Even if you're a new High Tide fan OR just curious looking for new music, 'Precious Cargo' is worthy of a place in your CD stack. Better than their self-titled disc, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the road with Shakespeare and Co.","review":"One of my all-time favorite childhood books, this is just as delightful a read for grown-us who still have the occasional daydream about running away, taking to the stage, or living in Elizabethan times--or all three! As is the case in nearly all of Sally Watson's historical novels, the protagonist has a significant character flaw--here, a vicious temper--that she learns to overcome, in the course of which she also manages to do some good and find chaste romance. Okay, it's a formula--but a formula that works, and is bedecked with lively prose, believable characters, and plenty of humor. FYI, a small publishing company has reissued this and other Watson novels in paperback, so there's no need to pay the exorbitant prices of the used-book sellers unless you're a collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Italian","review":"Recently got this to learn some italian.

Big waste of money for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I used these for 1.5 months before I left for Italy and I learned a lot. I did get lost on a few things (sometimes they will jump ahead and for the true beginner you're LOST!) and there were parts I skipped over (I didn't need to know how to ask someone if it was their grandfather's birthday, per se).

There are four CDs in this program. The first CD is really slow. A child could follow along. Then, the following CDs are really difficult to follow. They speak really fast and don't repeat anything. The phrases are too long. They don't break them up. Another thing that bothers me is that the Italian accents on the CD sound a little off. They roll their Rs as if they are speaking Spanish.

Only first CD is good.","review":"First CD is wonderful. I felt like I was really learning. Everything was paced well, they sounded out words. Then I was completely lost on the second one. They do not sound out new words, everything is too fast. There's no time to repeat after they say things. There's no way you can learn this without a book to see what words they are actually saying. Everything rolls together so fast you can't tell what the words sound like. It's quite ridiculous actually. Going back to my Pimsleur discs. They are much better. I really don't understand how this got rated so high.

CD numbers 2, 3, and 4 have native speakers speaking way too fast. For beginners, we need to hear each word said distinctly first. Then they could speak quickly.

My main complaint is that this book lacked coherence, though it seemed to have done thorough research. It did not clearly articulate ideas, but rather used every opportunity to quote fragments and attribute random details rather than clearly get at the heart of Ashbery's poetry. I found no useful arguments and it was very difficult to get through to what the author was saying. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoptaw - On the Outside","review":"I am alas an ordinary reader and I was curious to see what this Ashbery fuss was all about. I found Ashbery's poetry to be quite obscure and thought Shoptaw's book might help me make some sense of it. I was greatly disappointed. The book was clearly a tour de force of rank archanery. Shoptaw seems quite impressed with his ability to dazzle us with obscure jargon but it left me baffled. In the end I was no closer to understanding or appreciating Ashbery. To write that the \\"cryptographic process is indecipherable\\" is itself on the very face of it patently indecipherable.

The challenge is in getting the film off the backing paper.Once the backing paper splits and tears along the edge where you're trying to seperate it from the film, there is NO peeling it away from the film. If you try, the film itself will tear along with the backing paper.I did get the job done with the materials at hand, but...I WASTED MORE THAN 50% OF THIS FILM BECAUSE THE BACKING PAPER WOULD NOT PEEL AWAY FROM THE FILM WITHOUT TEARING.50% waste (at least) \\"built in\\" to the product makes it cost double the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"easier to work with than I thought","review":"I bought this for a small project, and I have a lot of it left over!

I looked around for different products and ideas to frost this glass on a light fixture and this was the one I purchased because of the price and ease of use. The directions say not to use it where it will be in contact with heat, but this fixture I have is large and the glass is not at all close to the lightbulb, so I thought I'd try it. It is fine. The adhesion is tight and it looks very nice. It is holding up very well, too.

The etched film is much easier to install than the tint and blocks the direct, blinding sunlight from glaring in through west facing transom windows, but allows for the bright natural light. Only complaint is a defect in the film about a foot into the roll caused the first cut to be wasted and unusable as it wasn't visible until I peeled the backing. If you want natural light and don't need to see out (or in) this is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"The overall positive reviews are accurate. I got the film to cover the see-through glasses of the front door (main and two sidelights). Two suggestions to add: (a) Cut the pieces before applying it to glass. A sharp utility knife and a long edge (I used a 4 ft level) will do. Cutting it straight on glass is difficult. (b) Leave a margin of around 1/8 inches on all sides (the instruction indicates so but doesn't emphasize). It turns out that when one squeegees the air/water out, the film expands a little and having the gap is necessary to let the air/water escape while achieving a tight seal (otherwise the film will butt against the glass frame). Don't know how well the film will hold up to temperature/humidity variation but it's a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.

In addition, the novel doesn't advance the plot of the the series overall. I am 140 odd pages into the novel and that is as far as I will get.

It would work just as well as life alert or some of these other products that you have to pay a monthly fee. I had to use mini washers under neath the sensor bars to raise the ones on the door to meet the ones on the door frame. So you can't see them.

I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Everything about this speaker device is great. It's portable, obviously (just about twice as long as an average wallet and the same width when closed), and the sound is great. It's sleek and shiny. Works perfectly in a small room and very well in a mid-sized room. I use it with my Zune (which is better than ipod btw) and it's just a joy. It's simple to set up and use, and the sound doesn't wash out when you turn the volume up (like the past 2 speaker sets I've gotten).The only problems I found were that it doesn't work with the A/C adapter if you have the batteries (AAA btw) in it at the same time. That's kind of weird, but not much of a problem. Also, the way the cords hook up to the back/bottom of the device is a little awkward, but still not a problem. Lastly, the bass isn't all that great, but depending on the music device you're using, you can turn the bass up anyway.Overall, great buy and great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Price","review":"I can't add much to what's been said, but I'll confirm most of it. This is pretty much the perfect little speaker for your iPod or other mp3 player. The sound is good and true, the design makes it attractive looking and it is very portable.

I can see why that makes it a nice and neat aesthetic design, but practically speaking, it's kinda dumb. I still like the product though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, clear and power sound.","review":"Got it with $39.99 from Amazon.Agree with most of reviews that the speaker is small but it gives out clear and powerful sound that has no problem to fill in a 20x20 room. The bass is kind of weak but that is expected given its small size. And you can improve the bass with the EQ on your MP3. The small size make it's pretty portable. Yes, the pouch can hold the speaker only, but I use 4 AAA rechargeable batteries. So there is no need for me to carry around the AC plug.I take out 1 point because the protective plastic cover does not seem to be strong. So, special attention is needed when sliding the protective cover. I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for a small speakers","review":"These speakears are trully portable and the sound reproduction is great. They are much better than my previous portable speakers (Creative Travelsound 200 has less volume and terrible bass reproduction...).

No problem when using battery power."},{"rating":"1","title":"JBL On Tour Poor Sound Quality","review":"I purchased these speakers based on amazon reviews, many of which are positive and some of which are negative. I was looking for speakers for my Sansa e280. I definitely had higher expectations for these speakers than perhaps the $40 price would suggest. If you like listening to clock radios (I am not talking Soundwaves!), then these will probably do fine. I was not happy with the overall sound quality and returned them.

Once I got this black beauty I plugged it in and WOW!!!!!! From the very first song I played on it I was hooked. It really can fill a room.

I used other peoples reviews for my decision. Got it -- loved the size. Perfect for the carry-on traveler. Then I had to review some mixes but the studio speakers went out. Used the JBL on Tour Portable Speakers with a cd player attached. The sound was fantastic. I could catch all the tracks to make my notes for the final recording. When the studio speakers were fixed went back and listened again to see if I missed anything. It was a perfect mix.I liked the quality and size so much I just bought 3 more for my kids away at college. They use it for their Ipods, Cd players and tv's for better sound.We use a travel bag (free from an airline) that stores the speakers, cable and charger. It would be nice if JBL supplied a bag that would accomodate all three.The price is absolutely amazing for the quality you receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was hoping for some good quality speakers for my Ipod, something that would give me good sound.

Equally amazing is the linkage to Whitechapel via a series of very similar murders that occured in South America and New York. The globetrotting Tumblety appears to have been in the limelight consistently in the 1890s and it is intriguing that the British press virtually ignored his importance in the case, giving some support to the authors theory on cover-up and conspiracy by the Yard. The authors convey the frustration of the case quite well, including the competitive nature of Scotland Yard and the USA authorities. Anyone interested in the Ripper murders should buy this book. It is far more credible than the rubbish published by Daniel Farson or the laughable accounts concerning James Maybrick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and a must read for all interested in JTR","review":"I have read most of the well-known books on Jack the Ripper and I think this is probably my favorite.

Perhaps the mystery is solved at last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Respectable Ripper Theory","review":"This is a very respectable Ripper book centered on a certain Mr. Tumblety, a recently discovered contender for the identity of Jack the Ripper. The two British authors can really write and reading their work shows us, among other things, how superior the Brit school systems still are.

Those opening lines can almost be scanned as poetry because Capote has breathed his life, his unique talent into them and as you read on, you'll see all the words of this true crime story transcend ordinary writing. It is the difference between a great writer and a mediocre one, that special life-breath, that rare life- force that is the hallmark of only a few. Writing sublimely is a gift that cannot be acquired, it is incorporated in the genes. It's there, from the moment of birth. And Truman Capote had it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid, beautiful, horrific","review":"I took this book with me to St. Thomas and was so engrossed that I sat around the hotel to read it rather than go to the beaches. I felt connected to the characters and I talked to my friends as if the Clutters and Perry and Dick were people I knew. Capote's ability to construct a vivid scene is uncanny. I saw each location and heard each voice as if I were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great True Story","review":"Great book, book is written well. He is a classic that will live on and so will this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I got this book as a recommendation and I am glad I did. It does not count among my top genres but I enjoyed the story. The story has a fascinating premise and a good opening prologue. Well observed characters and a smooth flow of the story come with good dialogue and prose. The descriptions are vivid and colorful. Overall, a story that will strike a chord with its target readership. In Cold Blood and Triple Agent, Double Cross are my recent surprise reads. I am glad I picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"All for next to nothing!","review":"Good book. I had seen the movie many years ago, and of course the movie Capote, who himself was an odd man. Took me a little time to get use to his way of writing so it started somewhat slow for me. I just can't grasp a human being (yet alone two) doing this to anyone and having no remorse.

The pacing is taught and compelling. Yet it is the glimpses of humanity, both in the killers and their victims, that makes Capote's work so unforgettable. \\"In Cold Blood\\" is one of the few books I have ever read that I simply hated to put down, even when I was deeply disturbed by what I read. To this day, I can't hear the word \\"clutter\\" without referencing this book in my mind. Truly haunting.(On a personal note: I read this book and \\"Helter Skelter\\" one summer while living alone -- I don't recommend it. It made for many a sleepless night.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"My second Capote novel, the first being \\"Music for Chameleons\\". I have recently fallen in love with T.C. thanks to a very close friend. The book in an enthralling account of a quadruple murder and the unlikely circumstances that led up to such an event. Capote provides a fascinating glimpse inside the head and into the past of each killer. The way in which Capote presents the story really makes you feel remorse for everyone involved, even the two killers. This is definitely a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Reader","review":"I don't like to be critical but Scott Brick's reading ruins the novel. His bizarre inflections and mid-throat waverings sound like a frail main on the verge of tears. Not the voice for this type of hard-boiled nonfiction. Very distracting. He also did major damage in his chapter readings of Bolano's \\"2066.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"In cold blood","review":"When I finally recived the book I was really pleased, but I was a little upset that it took longer then they had told me so they had to send another copy which came right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Reviews? For this book?","review":"... The book I read was long, drawn out, boring to the point of tears. I literally had to put it down for a couple of weeks at a time, or I'd have never finished it. There was too much detail... way too much detail. If I had read one more instance about a pie being baked the day of the murder I would have screamed.Capote is more than sympathetic toward Perry thus the book is not written objectively. He comes to the point of almost saying that the Clutter family was responsible for their own deaths. But even HE can't cross that line. Perhaps this would have been a better read had Capote not gotten the hots for Perry Smith. He tried so hard to make Perry look misunderstood, pitiful, and less culpable than Hickcock.For all the hype ..., I was sadly disappointed in this so-called Classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"After seeing Capote the movie, I was anxious to read the story behind the case. I found though that the book spent too much time on what I felt was unneccessary to the keep me interested in the story. Too much fluff. I had a hard time staying in the story, and eventually gave up half way through. I am not even curious to read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capote Makes Murder Boring.","review":"I like a good murder story, but I was ready to chuck this book across the room several times.So much of this book is useless and has nothing at all to do with the murder. I don't know how many times I read that one of the killers had issues with his kidneys and wet the bed as a child. How is that relevant to the story? I was honestly going to scream when at one point one killer's sister sends him a letter and starts telling him how tall each of her children is and how much they weigh.By the time you actually get to hear about the gory details regarding how the crime was committed, you don't care anymore, you've had to go through so much useless filler to get to that point.In short: bored me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman Capote at his finest","review":"In Cold Blood is another masterpiece by Truman Capote. Capote uses his excellent style of writing to capture the reader's attention from the first page. He uses such language to set the plot that the novel seems to be of a fictional account, but is based off of the true events of the November 12, 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. Capote's incredible use of imagery allows one to see the places he is describing vividly. With the painstaking detail that he uses, one follows the story from the two perspectives, switching back and forth between the Clutter family, and the murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, almost move by move. With such great detail and a compelling story, In Cold Blood is one of the best true crime novels written, and a reminder of Capote's creative brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best non fiction novel ever","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is the best book as far as a narration technique. Narrator is teasing a reader and do not let him to choose between right and wrong and even though we know that murders are wrong we are feeling pity for Dick and Perry."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a simple robbery goes horribly wrong","review":"While In Cold Blood has a chilling, gruesome an twisted plot in itself, the only thing more twisted than this plot is the minds of the charachters themselves. Not only was the crime heinous and horrifying, the psycological reasons behind could have filled a book twice the length of this one. Thankfully, Mr. Capote knew exactly what the right blend of physical evidence, (plot), and psycho-history would draw the reader in, yet not confuse the average Joe's mind. And the depth and description of the actual slayings is horrific, yet fascinating. I give this book a 9 only because of the extensive background of every single other inmate on Death Row with the two. It really detracted from the story. It was kind of like saying after 20 pages: \\"Oh yeah, back to the main charachters.\\" All in all, however, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pageturner","review":"Never before have I been captured so much.I couldn't stop reading and ran into people as I was not able to put down the book on my way to work"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Justice","review":"The problem with this book is that it tells the story Capote wants told, which differs significantly with some important facts. The cable TV series \\"American Justice\\" did an excellent documentary focusing on the Clutter murders. Hickock and Smith were far worse characters than depicted in the book, especially the latter. At his execution, Smith still was complaining about his sentence and had to be dragged up the scaffold steps. None of those interviewed who personally were involved in the criminal investigation and trial liked Capote's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Though this book is well written, I just didn't have the stomach for it. If you love to look at the morbid side of life, however, this is your book. It forces you to look at ugly brutality, and even to empathize with nearly every character in the story including the killers. Truman Capote can write so well that you nearly feel you are them. But who wants to do that? Anyway, the book gave me nightmares, and I'm glad to be done with it, and now I will retreat into my nice happy place. Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, etc, I admit it I'm a wuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"The book is a little dry, hard to read at times. If you are from Kansas and like history you can get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive, confusing and dull.","review":"I am relieved to find other reviewers had the same problems I did with this book. I am constantly confused where I am in the book. I alternate between feeling I already read a part, to feeling I missed something. Skipping sections and searching back occupy most of my time. Also, I would have liked some suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Cold Blood","review":"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote4 is a book about a family that was murdered. Truman Capote explained how the families grow up, and the background of those around them. THe story takes place in Holcomb, Kansas, in 1959. The author also goes in deep of the killer's background. I could never image how much these people put into planning a murder.The Clutter family members killed in 1959 was father Herbert William, mother Bonnie, daugher Nacy, and son Kenyon. This was a good well known family. The book talks about how they grow up and there relationshiips with others. This family was a good well known church going family as well. The relationship between herbert and Bonnie was very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ignore this book!","review":"I've always known about this book, and I knew it was considered a classic, but somehow I ignored it. Don't ignore this book! It is a flawlessly written true account of the brutal cold-blooded murder of a family of four in 1959. There are certain chapters of this book that are absolutely mesmerizing. Perry's confession may be one of the most harrowing accounts I have ever read, fiction or non-fiction. And what makes it more compelling is that it's true. In retrospect, I can see the influence this book has had on the mystery and crime genre. It adds credibility to all of the fictional criminals that you read about in your favorite mystery novels. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first few chapters were mesmerizing","review":"I read it six years ago and haven't read it since, although I would like to again. The most I remember about the book was its first few chapters, on the murder of the Clutter family. How Nancy's friend ran out screaming, \\"Nancy's dead!\\" About Nancy's stuffed bear. How the teacher who entered the Clutter house and recognized Kenyon even though he had been shot in the face. All of these were hauntingly descriptive. The second half was about the trials, but I was more hooked on the first half. Even though it happened more than 40 years ago, I know the Clutter family are at peace and so are the people who knew the family when they were young. The Cold War ended, Vietnam came and went, techonological revolution took place, but the story of the Holcomb murders will never be altered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Intense Read","review":"This book is highly engrossing, and the way it is written allows you to sympathize with the criminals and even feel a little sorry for them. This book is a definite must read. Capote is a genius writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT OF TYPE","review":"The most impressive thing about this book, aside from the events, which are true of course, is the absence of \\"style\\".Capote realizes that an evident style (as F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemmingway for example) would detract from the power of the events and add a surface covering of soapoperaness or the point of view of condemnation or justification that makes Malmud's \\"The Fixer\\" less than the work it could have been in the hands of a genius. Capote shows a kind of genius, or at a minimum very keen judgement in his writing. The movie made from the story was good. It lacks the sense of brilliant detachment that makes this book special. The closest modern author in English I know of is Joseph Conrad. I recommend Capote's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GREAT!","review":"If you are looking for a book that is exciting and also chillling, In Cold Blood is your perfect match. In Cold Blood reveals the story behind the murder of four members of the Clutter family during the 1950's. Capote is able to recreate the night of the murder so accurately that you also will be able to remember that murder scene, even in your sleep. Capote makes you feel as though you were there the night of the murder and the days following, and you will find yourself utterly distraught while you follow the assailants on their cross-country spending spree. This book is thrilling and gives great insight into the criminal mind. If you are looking for a book that will not cause you to fall asleep, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a very good book.","review":"It is just so breath taking, you get to know the characters so well. Definitely a good read and it based on something that actually happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"In Cold BloodI read the book many years ago and reread again. Good writing style and novel like reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough","review":"I once read that \\"cold blood\\" referred to Capote's eyeview of the situation he wrote about, more so than the style of the crime described here. An interesting conception, but after my read, I don't yet see it. Capote first fills a landscape with a loved and admirable family, gradually inching in descriptions of the characters who will threaten them, without divesting the perpetrators (particularly Perry Smith) of their humanity. Even though one would have to live on the dark side of the moon for the last fifty years not to know how the plot thickens, the prose still keeps one on the edge of the seat. A solid time capsule of midwest mores, culture, the justice system, and even race relations in the late fifties. The restraint Capote shows would be welcome in today's sensational treatment of the day-to-day stories about runaway brides, kidnap victims, or some of the tragic murders in which shock and awe seems to outweigh the journalistic quest for fact or justice for those affected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Journalism - Superbly Cold Blooded","review":"Truman Capote manages to weave a tapestry of factual information, notes from interviews with the assailants and those of its many victims into a gripping story of human emotion at every level. The killers emerge as people who commit murder with hardly more emotional investment than a trip to the dentist. Yet their story is just a small part of the effect that the murders had on all who knew the victims.This is a gripping book, written in a prose style that is rarely equaled by the popular authors of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Cold Blood - 1997","review":"This is a remake of the original black and white IN COLD BLOOD. The movie is much longer and really not necessarily so. But I liked it any way. I'll never stop liking the original version over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord, I appear to be in the minority","review":"As much as this book has been trumpeted, I found it rather tedious. Capote's stab at ambience journalism, while not irresponsible, rather leaves me cold. I suppose that Capote's tangential characters were well fleshed-out, but so unnecessary to the continuance of the story, I wondered if they weren't a bit overdeveloped. I should point out that, unlike the other reviewers, I did not use this novel as a springboard to develop opinions on the death penalty, so perhaps the major charm of the novel was wasted on me. I enjoyed \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" a tremendous deal more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling to this day ...","review":"I read In Cold Blood many years ago but ordered the paperback with my last book order (now reading True Crime genre much of my time). With the order, I received Goodbye Natalie Goodbye Splendour and finished both books this week. I suppose my review may not see the light of day here with the astronomical numbers of reviews, but I hope it does, because the top review here claims that no true crime book is as well written. I agree, but the Natalie Wood story, read immediately after In Cold Blood came in a close second if not even matching or surpassing at intervals.In Cold Blood gave me chills, all these years later. What that innocent, terrorized farm family, living in a remote area suffered is beyond comprehension. That is what these two books have in common. Terror beyond comprehension. Same kind of chills.The two ex-convicts of In Cold Blood were arrested. That's where these two books differ."},{"rating":"2","title":"In cold blood","review":"A must read!!

I didn't really enjoy it very much for two reasons, one reason is because it was based on a true story and that those characters in the book were real and they didn't get to live. The people who did it seemed smart for almost puliing it off but were stupid for the action that took place. the second reason is that I usually read books that our gross and bloody with a lot of Blood spilling and slaughter and have a lot of murder mystery but this book was nothing like that , it took placce in a small town in kansas and it talked about the family that was savagely slaughter, they were shot in the face.

And it is a genuine classic, no question about that. If I had read it when it first came out, I'm sure I would have been stunned along with the rest of the country. Reading it now, after the genre has been taken to new heights by the likes of Tom Wolfe (The Right Stuff) and others, it didn't pack quite the punch I expected. But it still packs a punch, no question about it. It still has the power to make you sick to your stomach as he takes you through the last hours of the Clutter family.

Not only was it the sprout of a whole new genre(what we now know as \\"journalistic novels\\" or \\"creative nonfiction\\") but it's well-written and provocative. This novel is a news report; it reads like one of TIME Magazine's better feature pieces, yet it captivates like good fiction. The basis of this book is unique and creative, and journalism at its highest creative point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I decided to read this book after discovering that the author was a childhood friend of Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mockingbird. I had read that Ms. Lee was instrumental in researching this work of nonfiction.

Holcomb is a quiet small town in rural Kansas, which is rocked by the murder of a family. The murder is a shock to the small town and sends the locals into a state of fear. Who did this? The murder could still be in the area! The murder could be a local resident. A small town, used to keeping doors unlocked, is now paniced and paranoid.Capote disects the murder, the murders and the victims. He takes you into the lives of the families involved. From the victims, to the murders, to the investigators. It is a fascinating story and Capote's telling graps and holds the reader. 'In Cold Blood' was also a ground breaking book. Now it is common to find a 'true crime' novel, but this book set the stage for the books that followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I really enjoyed this book from the begining to the end, and found it to be one of those reads that grabs you and doesn't let you go. The fact that this novel is based on real life events related to a murder has little to do with the actual lifeline of the novel, the richness of the book lies in the near perfect treatment of the ambiences, the perfectly dissected characters, the way it intertwines seemingly disparate pieces on the lives of the characters back and forth to make perfect sense to the story... those thinking this is in the core a murder novel or detective story would be greatly disappointed as there is not a thrilling or morbid side to this story, and the actual events of the murder are almost tangential. A need-to-read for anybody seriously interested in contemporary American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"I've wanted to read this book ever since I took the Amtrak cross-country. We were having breakfast in the dining car, flying through western Kansas when our waiter leaned over our booth and pointed at a house as we sped through the outskirts of Holcomb. He said \\"Right there! That house! That's where the murders happened in the Truman Capote novel!\\"This was my first Kindle book purchase. I couldn't put it down. It was one of those books that I read while eating, shaving, during commercials, etc. Capote keeps the reader riveted as you get to know the Clutter family and, simultaneously, the accused killers.

However, In Cold Blood provides all the structure and characterization that would expect from a work of fiction. I guess it just confirms that you can't write anything as touching as real life. It communicates what happened so effectively that I couldn't bear to read it alone. Depressing, yes, but some awfully good writing.As a final aside, I'd like to comment on two points that aren't the most important: the title and the cover - but both of these fit absolutely perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have been quite significant at the time","review":"Murder in small town, homosexual overtones, graphic descriptions - must have really shook up the world in 1966. Even today is a captivating read. Capote has a way with words and that makes this story probably more entertaining than it should be. He paints the time very well and as the reader you go back to a much different time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Tale","review":"Written in response to the senseless, seemingly motiveless murder of a family if 1950s America, Truman Capote engages and thrills the reader; while forcing them to question and consider the views and values that they hold dear.Capote draws on his honed journalistic skills to report from a number of different perspectives. Although we know from the outset who will die, it is still a genuine shock when it occurs. At times you may also be disturbed by feelings of sympathy for the two murderers.Making no excuses for anyone, \\"In Cold Blood\\" challenges the legal system, when it becomes blatantly obvious that no semblence of a fair trial was observed - and when both men are given the death penalty a strong sense of injustice becomes apparent. We are also left to question why the authorities chose to target these two specific men when there were other horrific crimes occuring across the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best books I've read","review":"In Cold Blood is extraordinary.

I had never read this book, but was prompted to purchase and read it after hearing just enough about the story to interest me. This doesn't read like the majority of true crime books. It reads like fiction. It is so easy to forget that what you are reading isn't just a story, but that it happened to real people and the actions of Smith and Hickok destroyed a family and a small Kansas town.

After suffering through this one, now I understand. I couldn't wait to finish it - not to see what was going to happen, just so it would be over.

I wish I could have had a different experience.I feel I have been forced to seek out reviews that explain some deep-seeded theme that was completely fabricated by some \\"scholarly\\" reviewer, which the author never initially intended. Maybe that would satisfy me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even finish this one!","review":"I don't know what Mr. Capote was thinking. Early in the book you know that they all die AND you know who did it. What's up with that? So much for suspense! Truman Capote was very amusing in Murder by Death, though. And did you ever see Rich Little's impersonation of Truman Capote as Tiny Tim in his rendition of A Christmas Carol? It was incredible! He does W.C. Fields as Scrooge. Truly an inspired performance. Rich Little is a true master. I'd like to read a book about his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3, none worked","review":"I bought this item (not from Amazon) for my daughter to go with her Disney mix stick. It worked for literally 2 minutes and then the speakers cut out, never to work again. Thinking I'd gotten a bad one, I exchanged it, only to have the same thing happen again. Still determined to make good on my daughter's Christmas present, we bought a 3rd one, which also worked for about 2 minutes. The Mix Stick mp3 player worked fine with a Creative speaker system, so it was definitely the Jam Stand that had the problem. Obviously, there is a design flaw and I wonder if any of the Jam Stands that have been manufactured actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea but not worth the price","review":"I love the MP3 player but Disney really went awry with the speaker system. It is definitely of low quality, hard to use and really bad sound quality. It sounds better when played very low but what kid wants to play music on low sound. It gets screechy and grainy sounding once turned up. Parents certainly won't appreciate that! I would definitely search for a better speaker system that this could work with! Also, you have to push the player pretty hard to get it into the speaker system. I see the potential for kids to break the USB port off when trying to get it in there. The only neet thing about this player is the colorful light show that displays as the music plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has never worked","review":"I bought this for my 5yo, hoping to win back my own mp3. The mix stick worked great for awhile, but it, too has cut out (purchased in July, quit by Sept). The jam stand has never worked- same problem as noted by other reviews. My husband got it to play for a few minutes one night, that's it. This is such a great idea, hope Disney will try again and get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"This is a review of the sound quality only, and I am reviewing the 2004 remaster (mine's from Polystar Jazz Library in Japan).The sound quality here on some tracks is very bad. Tracks 3,6,&14 are definite 'Loudness War' victim (google loudness war for more info). Most tracks have limited dynamics, but on 3,6,&14 there is also clipping and a large amount of distortion. The sound really poor. Basically whoever remastered these three songs has ruined them. I mean this is a Jazz release of all things, why would anyone want to sacrifice sound quality for volume? Do you know anyone who listens to Jazz that doesn't value sound quality, even if only in a small way? or doesn't know how to operate their volume knob?I'd recommend getting the old pre-2004 version on cd, that's what I'm going to do (through the Amazon resellers of course). I'll post a review of that disk once I get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of hope help and reassurance","review":"Written in such a way that it helps people to understand how to overcome the addiction of anorexia and its hold on one's life.

I am 20 years old and I have suffered from anorexia for years. I started reading this book when I weighted 86lbs. It allowed to me to see that I wasn't alone and it taught me a whole new way of looking at my thoughts and body. It doesn't keep repeating the same old lectures that you hear from everyone else.

Instead, I found one of the worst cds that I have purchased in years. I love Massive Attack and listen to them frequently. The only thing that Day One shares with Massive Attack is a record label and hometown. It is a disgrace to even mention them in the same sentence. \\"I'm doing fine\\" and maybe two other tracks are listenable, but songs like \\"I'm in your life\\" were so bad that I was embarassed to be listening to them.

Grove notes that in Lucrezia Borgia we have a dramatic almost Verdian creation and here we have a very gripping telling of the tale. Lucrezia is not sung as flawlessly as she was by Sutherland, but here she is well acted and is always believable whether in the business of poisoning others or grieving over her son. All the cast act well and were well directed and their singing is more than adequate. The sound is good, picture quality very fine, sets and costumes appropriate to the time, and the orchestra well conducted. I judged the time watching as well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"very diappointing","review":"I'm afraid I must agree with the first reviewer about this production. Dimitra is a great diappointment. She has a strange hesitant approach to her scale singing; soft then strident and fadeing in and out. I found it most disturbing. Also disturbing was watching her as she juts out her jaw. In her long scene with husband Don Alfonso I found myself enjoying his singing and recoiled when she would start. I found Iori the be the best singer of the cast. I thought the sets and the production adequate and appropriate. The other singers were fine for this second circuit Italian house. I enjoyed the dances and the banqueting; though I would like to have seen the coffins in the final scene. It would have been a delicious touch. I'll file this DVD away and it will gather dust; my DVD with Sutherland and Kraus does not get dusty. Now there is a real singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps the best","review":"I am restoring a 1960 Old Town sailing canoe that needed a sail, rudder and lee boards. My source for specifications was on line pictures and I scaled the parts the best I could from pictures. Then I found Todd Bradshaw who made a sail and recommended his book. The book provided scaled plans for the parts I was making and discussed the science and reasoning behind his plans. This book is exactly what I needed. In addition Todd's book offered practical advice. For example based on his advice I contacted the Oregon State Marine Board and learned that I needed to \\"title' and \\"register\\" my sailing canoe.

The writing is clear and engaging yet laid out in an intuitive logical order. It is a how to book that doesn't seem like a how to book.

His voice is so soft and there is no singer of merengue that can be compare to him when we are talking about a live concert. When villalona is singing live he sounds the same as the cd.

I also listen to a lot of straight up traditional folk music, so anything nearly folk related I usually like. Ever since I first heard Blood Or Whiskey they have always failed to disappoint. IMO their first cd is better but thats probably because that was the first cd I heard from these guys. Cashed Out On Culture features a new singer and a more punked up attitude then their previous releases, which can be a good thing. I've heard plenty of people express their hate for this cd, not on amazon, but others just can't get over that fact that Barney their first singer is gone. Bands mature, grow, and experiment with their sound as the years go on, putting out the same sounding cd every couple years would get boring and too repetitive, so this is a welcomed release.

I am no fan of the CIA, but the plot line to me was unbelievable. I don't want to give the plot away and spoil the book for others, but this book reads like a failed John Le Carre \\"wanna be\\". It also read like an obvious attempt to leverage off the (to me) hideous Da Vinci Code book, with references to \\"symbology\\" that go nowhere. The significance of the \\"cut\\" is never adequately explained or, if it was, I missed it. I also see shades of Hannibal Lechter here.

It was extremely hard for me to get into the fast reading, page turning, want to know more mode. The story line was well thought out, but I just couldn't seem to follow with enthusiasm. The main reason why is because Hewson used too many adjectives. Every character, it seemed like, had over ten adjectives that described them. It left nothing to your imagination. I couldn't seem to get interested and finally put the book down halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"Nic Costa, the purported hero, must be the least interesting Italian male on the planet. The heroine is an impressively boring and dim American. The appealing setting, Rome during a snowstorm, is ground to death. The interesting plot idea quickly dissipates, the perp being revealed early on. His motivations are repeated, confusingly, ad nauseam; they remain incomprehensible at the end. The fate of some characters, including one of the bad guys, is left unresolved.Another distracting note is that Hewson doesn't know enough about the American language to be writing from our viewpoint. Usage and spelling are wrong throughout. Spelling might be excused, but not usage--when the voice is American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow, hard to connect","review":"Ar some point, a story has to \\"set its hook.\\" You have to get interested.

I noticed that all the feet and the protectors are made of plastic and not rubber. After these two things, I started looking at the details closely. Here are a few other things that stick out:- The edges don't seal completely when closed.

Now if those two are, as I believe they are, Godard's best films, what can I possibly say about the others.

I do believe \\"Shadow and Jimmy\\" proves my point. There is nothing original nor spectacular about their music, which is why they didn't make it big. Conceptually they were precocious, but they are not musicians in the true sense of the word. They make better producers, especially Don. Today, their sound in What up Dog is digitally infantile, but good for 1988. David's lyrics are repetative and lack compassion/empathy. For the most part it was about men taking advantage of women. If, God forbid, they were to release another album, I'm afraid we'd be in for more of the same: Sophisticated digital concoctions and a soap opera, lyrical account of women being taken advantage.

It didn't sell as well, but it is a wonderful 64 minute album of some pop and soul songs just very well performed and done. I love Spy In the House of Love and its live mystery feel. The Boom Boom Shaka laka laka boom chorus of Walk the Dinosaur is still superb. But another favorite is Wedding Vows in Vegas and its humor.

The Goonies is certainly a little dated (I didn't realize how much time the kids spent shouting nearly unintelligible and always unfunny adlibs) but satisfying to anyone who grew up on the film. Beetlejuice still holds up well, probably due to the great art direction and music.

There are, naturally, some differences in the scripts. And, one can't help hearing Burton's voice when reading Becket's lines. The play is a strong, yet not overly sympathetic, portrayal of Thomas Becket. He's shown with both strengths and weaknesses, although the king is seen more as flawed throughout.

I recently came upon an English paperback copy of it in an English-language bookstore in Paris, and I found it to be one of this writer's better novels. It concerns the lives of a sister and brother after the death of their old dragon of a mother, with whom they had been living for most of their lives (they are both middle-aged). There are problems with the house and some adjacent property, as well as problems in new and old relationships, and Helen, the sister and the main character, realizes that the mother was even more awful that she had thought, and painfully also comes to realize her own connivance in the mother's viciousness and in her attempt to keep Helen and her brother under her thumb (even after death). Helen is a likable and admirable character, and one gets a good sense of what modern life is like in an English village."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album for Beach Boys fans","review":"This is a pretty good mix of some of the better tunes done by the Beach Boys over the years, with several real clunkers thrown in the mix as well. Even with a many of the tunes being pretty lame lyrically, I still thoroughly enjoy just hearing those beautiful harmonies again. In fact, it is those wonderful harmonies that still let me overlook not only the lyrics, but even much of the rather awful guitar solos of that time. Having said that, I am still in awe of and never tire of pieces like Good Vibrations, Surfer Girl, Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, Don't Worry Baby, Good Timin', and Kokomo. These tunes let me overlook (and skip over) some of the truly awful tunes that are included on this disk (which I will leave to each listener to decide on). This is definitely a good album to own if you're a Beach Boys fan like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach boys","review":"I think the audio here is really bad.

So many great classics ranging from California Girls to Help Me Rhonda to God Only Knows to Kokomo and much more. Fast or slow these Beach Boy harmonies sound true to my ears.There are a few songs not on here such as Little Saint Nick, Wendy, Sail On Sailor, and You're So Good To Me that possibly should be included instead of some of the lesser tunes. However, this is a minor oversight.In contrast to the previous reviewer, this CD sounds great regardless of whether the tracks are mono or stereo recorded.

Their songs were playing on car radios, on transistor radios at the beach, and on radios in your room. The \\"hit\\" radio versions were \\"singles\\" mixed in mono for maximum impact over the \\"one speaker\\" radios that most teens were listening to.Some, but not all, teens could afford to buy albums, and bought the \\"stereo\\" album mixes of those hits. But, the stereo mixes were NOT the hit versions we had heard (and burned into our memories) during weeks of radio re-playing.The strong point of this \\"ultimate\\" Beach Boys CD is that when two mixes are available, the \\"hit\\" version, often in mono, is the mix that is used. These are the REAL thing, just the way they sounded back in 1963.Thirty of the Beach Boys best songs...an audio \\"time machine\\" that can transport \\"baby boomers\\" back four decades in time...on a single CD at an attractive price.

Find a friend who knows a guy who knows this place where you can get an outline of the book. These notes are the holy grail for AP students. I recomend you use these notes only for the summer reading; during the year, do the reading! This book is not a horrible one for class use and doing the reading is essential for the AP test in may.

It's been done, it's been done, it's been done. But I stumbled on this novel totally by accident, was desperate for something to read, and was surprised. Remarkably surprised. It starts with a stray dog being killed and no one wanting to deal with the carcass and ends with the two main characters adopting another stray puppy. In between, House really sets up an interesting story of unwanted people (strays?) more desperate for love than they realize. He touches on AIDS, but doesn't dwell on it which was perfect for this story. The title hints at the subtle (Harris) and horrendous (Adrian) ways men abuse each other when all they really want is affection. Neither character is stock and House offers no easy answers or happy endings. Instead the end of the story has Harris and Adrian still en route with their new puppy, taking a breather on a shining, white salt flat.Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"This book was very boring to me.

Please trust me and avoid this stinkbomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Grand Attention to Watch","review":"As a whole it delivers the message in the end but the way the film was put together makes it very hard to follow, confusing, frustrating. I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie, I was disappointed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie layout!","review":"This might have been a good movie. I don't know why the directer decided to split the movie into devided boxes throughout the whole movie, that ruined the whole movie. I was very disappointed and would not reccomend this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"(?)","review":"Take away the extraneous/repeated shots the picture in a picture in a picture in a picture shots the long rambling along shots the stuff that makes no sense and you would end up with a movie of about twenty(20) minutes that almost makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a good movie","review":"If the director has not used the dreadfull split screens this could be a very good movie. Ellen Page is extremely good, pity that you must force yourself to go to the end as the split screens make it almost mandatory to stop and throw it away. I disliked the lack of continuity but that is a minor problem compared to the multiple little screens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I had to hit eject on this after about 30 minutes of torture. There is no plot, no story line, just endless multi-screen images of a 15-year-old girl's angst-ridden life. Maybe if you're 15, this film will appeal. It just looks like someone discovered split screens and went crazy with it. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploration of guilt","review":"Ellen Page gives another wonderful performance in a film about 15 year old girl Tracey, growing up in a family with less than caring parents and an austistic younger brother. Her story is fragmented, disjointed and incoherent and movie's direction seems to follow that state of mind. Is Tracey mentally sick, or is something else going on with her young life that is causing her to run away from home and risk her young life to poverty, sexual abuse and street life?It is almost at the end of this film that we learn the full reason for her angst. Guilt is overwhelming her young life and she has no one to open to and relieve that pain. The circumstances of her brother's disappearance (and most likely death) are difficult to accept even for adult let alone fro a young sensitive woman who is taunted at her high school as she is neglected at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"There a Tracy Fragment in most of us.","review":"This movie was painful to watch, because Tracy is a girl who get blamed by adults, deals with rude clerks and gets raped. So if Tracy reminds you of all those things you went through at a young age. Then save your money and your life from the horror"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars Just For Ellen Page","review":"I would give this movie 5 stars because of Ellen Page.

If I were watching this in a movie theater I would have honestly walked out . . . very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellen, what were you thinking?","review":"Way too confusing a film. Stories of teen angst should not be so deep. Not one single frame shot in the whole film. Too much to follow. Excellent performance by Page as always but it was the wrong choice to do this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Multi-picture Loser","review":"I think the best description I've seen of this movie is that it is like trying to watch a movie in the pieces of a broken mirror. Neither my wife or I liked much about it. There is a lot of teen smoking, sex, violence and incessant use of the 'F-word.' The story of guilt by a sibling for the loss of a younger sibling could have been a great story. However the bad language and the 'cutsiness' of multiple, constantly changing pictures makes it not worth the effort. There are many, much better movies out there to waste one's time on this loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull Deborah Chester Book","review":"This was a very dissapointing ending for the ruby throne trilogy. I just loved and enjoyed the cat-fights, hair-pulling, and action in the first book (REIGN OF SHADOWS) but REALM OF LIGHT WAS SOO BORING, there was no conclusion at all. The death and rise of people were bluntly developed, it seemed as though Deborah Chester just sped throught this just to finish the third planned book, so she could work on her next trilogy.

I don't have time to follow who's who on a album I simply like good music, I dont care who does your beats.But sorry ginuwine your good looks only got you so far on this one.I will say that Tribute to a woman is a nice song, but everyone has one of those I-know-time-get-tough-but-keep-your-head-up kinda songs.Diffrences has a nice flow to it,but besides those two songs I don't know what he was thinking.Hit me on a two way???????????? and there's a whole song about this???

Don't get me wrong, the other two are great and I would recommend buying them, but this one is the best. This cd really highlights his incredible voice. This cd has it all: soft jams, love ballads, and dance grooves. I'm definitely looking forward to more cd's from this artist with not so much of Timbaland and more of Ginuwine."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The End\\"","review":"I'm a huge Ginuwine fan but this cd is weak. I knew Timbaland only did one track before I bought it and thought it still would be tight, but I was wrong. I know it's getting old hearing Ginuwine isn't the same without Timbaland but it's true, it's Timbo's sound that makes Ginuwine standout, but i'm sorry to say that Ginuwine fell off with this cd. Seriously not even worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good \\"Life\\"!!","review":"I have Ginuwine's 2 previous CD's and they don't even come CLOSE to this one!!

Other great tracks include \\"2 Way\\",\\"That's How I Get Down\\" and the balled \\"Two Reasons I Cry\\", which is about his deceased parents. The album is pretty long (about 69 minutes) but a true fan won't even notice. What more can I say?? A great third album from Ginuwine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HE'S BACK","review":"once again, he is back with a new album. i've always been a fan not only because of his looks, but he can sing. out of the three albums, my favorite is ginuwine..the bachelor because he came out strong for the first album which i admired. the latest album has some pretty good slow jams. example: track #6. the reason why i like the album is because he has his own style, and no one has been able to duplicate his style, and he produced most of the tracks. i would reccommend this album. the reason being is that you can groove to the material, and he has been through some things which made him put his heart into the album. so if you don't have the album, go and get it!!!!! (of course, this is my opinion) you go boy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good CD","review":"I like Ginuwine and his music but after hearing this CD I was disappointed. I only liked 4 songs; Why Not Me, Two Way. Differences and Superhuman are really nice. I was just not feelin most of the songs on this album, they were kind of boring. I expected a lot better from this CD. Overall I don't recommend this CD because most of the songs did not capture my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life - Ginuine","review":"I love this CD!!! It has a great mix of slow and fast songs that all have alot of bass and a thumping beat. It's great for dancing, playing in the car, or just chillin' to. Try it out, if you love it as much as me you'll want to add it to your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginuwine","review":"This disc from Ginuwine is his 3rd CD effort and it is a decent CD. There is more of Ginuwine's personal side and less of his playa, rockin knockin the boots side. The CD starts off with the upbeat WHY NOT ME and then goes into his 1st single THERE IT IS. The next song 2 WAY shows what changing a modern techonological gadget into a song can do for ya. The 2nd single and one of the best ballads is DIFFERENCES which is not only a song many can relate to but is also a great wedding song. The rest of the CD is filled with various hit-worthy songs such as the Patti LaBelle like ballad SUPERHUMAN; a tribute to his deceased mother and father; and a song called ROLE PLAY which would make one want to role play. The disc could have been better but is undoubtedly better than alot of songs that came out at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end","review":"lets face it, this cd could have been alot better, and what is the solution-Timbaland. this cd has decent songs but definitely misses Timbalands flavor he brought to the table, which made Ginuwines music stick out from any other r&b singer. not worth the money, cause Ginuwine never had the greatest voice, but he had Timbo's beats and influence, sorry to say it but ginuwine fell off."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS LIFE IS TRAGIC!!!","review":"Ginuwine has always been a favorite performer of mine. Even though he gives the false pretense of being an old schooler Ginuwine showed his true colors with this disc. The cd is for mass market consumption and its at its worst. The cd doesn't offer the vocal range I have come accustomed to with G and for some strange reason he chose to only work with Timbaland on one track. IF something isnt broke don't try to fix it should be applied here. The cd just sounds cluttered and it even has a Diane Warren track on it! There isn't the littlest smidgen of the raw energy and sexual nuances we have grown accustomed to.

It's a heavy cord, rated for 15 amps.The reel is lightweight, and hard to handle when winding up the cable. I need to guide the cable with one hand, and I haven't figured out how to stablize the reel at the same time as I crank.This product is priced right, but needs a tweak on design so that long, heavy cables can be retrieved easily while using both hands for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying...","review":"This is a borderline toy. It may hold 150' of zip cord but that's about all. A more realistic max would be 75' of 12/3."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a well thought out product","review":"there is no way to use only the length of the electrical cord needed - the whole cord must be unwound. This is also too small for 150 ft, unless you get a very thin cord - but for normal/heavy duty outdoor cords 75 ft is probably the practical max. Would not recomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayco 150 Foot Cord Reel","review":"Not the greatest reel. Rather flimsy. You have to un-reel the entire cord to reach the end plug. There is not a way to have it exposed and only partially un-reel the cord. The handle doesn't really do much except get in the way when pulling the cord. However it works well to store the cord, and that is where the handle comes in handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"This thing is so flimsy. It flexes when winding and it feels like the handle will break on every revolution. I know this thing is cheap and true to form you get what you pay for. It will do the job with light duty or short cords but if you have any decent weight cord buy something else. Buy a hose reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"Very time consuming and frustrating to use. If you read some of the other reviews they will recommend using a zip tie to hold the middle of the cord so you can wind both ends evenly. While this does work, pulling the cord to use it is way more time consuming than it's worth and after only a week it was starting to damage the casing on the cord - aYellow Jacket 12/3 Heavy-Duty Extension Cordwhich is not some cheapo cord. This product was definitely not well thought out. Eventually I got sick of spending more time trying to wind the cord than I was actually using the tools so I went back to using the over-palm-and-under-the-elbow method. Also, I found this same exact item in L0we's for two dollars cheaper. All I can say is this is a waste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Garbage","review":"Not enough weight in stand to help coil a cord. Pieces fall off if you use it more than once.

This worked very well. First I had to unwind the whole cord and fold it so both female and male outlets are at one end. Started winding from another end. So when I release the wire, both male end and female end gets un-winded.I wish there is a lock of some sought to the reel. When you are using it tends to turn and loosens the wire. When it is time to wind the cord, you got to tighten the loose wire before you wind it.On the whole, I like the product. I will recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked very well.","review":"I used this for the outdoor extension cord. It rolled up very nice withease. The top handle makes it easy to holdand the stand on the bottom makes for easystorage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price. Not the easiest to use.","review":"Price is great.

I was ready to take a sledge hammer to it after 30 minutes of wasted time fighting to free the cord from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I would recommend something sturdier to hold as much power cord as one would roll into this unit.It is too light weight and doesn't reelin very well.

When first winding the cord onto the reel, attach it to the hook on the reel at the cord's midpoint, and then wind both halves together onto the reel; when unwinding it, place the reel midway between the outlet and the device you want to plug into the cord, then unwind both ends simultaneously until you achieve the proper lengths. Frankly, I find it's easier when 2 people are working the reel - one holding the reel, and the other one holding the ends of the cord. I had no problem winding a 100-foot heavy outdoor extension cord onto this reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, it's ok. But there are better else where.","review":"Fortunately, I read the reviews before purchasing this item. And yet, I foolishly was a man and ignored the suggestions and tried to do it 'my way'.

I knock it down to two stars because even if you follow this method, sometimes the cord still gets tangled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Reel","review":"The handle on this reel broke off the second time I used it.

If it was designed for wall mount, it may have performed little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"It's a little unstable when cranking the handle but I usually just step on one side of the base and that helps considerably. The guy who suggested wrapping the cord from the midpoint instead of one end was right on, that helps things considerably. Even after you pull a little hard trying to take out some slack and the cord goes off the reel it's easy to fix because the reel sides go close to the frame. I have no complaints, it does what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect and good quality","review":"Just what I was looking for. I could not be happier and a great price. If you need a easy way to store your extension cables this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly assembled","review":"I wanted a cheap cord reel for my leaf blower. That is what I bought.It appears mine was assembled with two sides that lacked notched spines. Therefore, the one I received lacked any notches in the spines to retain the end of the cord that would otherwise be buried at the center of the reel. Without the notches to retain the cord end, it is VERY difficult to reel up the cord. To make mine useable, I bored a hole in the axle hub and ran one end of the cord out through the center of the hub. That way, I can connect either end without first emptying the spool.Should you decide to purchase this item, look at the image on the product label. It is a VERY badly Photoshoped image of the reel in use with its handle inverted over the reel held in the left hand of the user while the right hand is off to the side in a grasping position but not grasping the handle as it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"The edges all around are not very smooth...which cuts my hands & I worry about my cords.

Only problem is that the reel itself is very light so it keeps falling over if there isn't enough cord still attached to it to hold it down.

Not ideal, not perfect, but works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought one at Home Depot. Notice you need to have the female end of the cord (the end you start wrapping with) sticking out so you can hook appliances into it.

I purchased it to hold the cord for my new snow blower, but I can't use it! It might hold 150' of speaker wire, but that's about it! I guess it's my own fault for not realizing that 16/3 cord is closer to the size of a regular indoor extension cord. Most outdoor cords are 12 or 14 gauge! I guess only electricians (who know what the sizes of cords really are) would have known that I was a fool for buying this for any real use! Hmmm...come to think of it, if anyone needs 150' of indoor extension cord, they might have bigger electrical issues than me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad one","review":"Waste of money. Very light.

It looked cheap plastic.Like a cheap Chinese toy .only a matter of time before it breaks . As for the working , you can not use it as a rewinding reel as you move forward with your device on the one end.You have to unwind the cord first before power on and using your device . If you can wind up both side from middle , you will save some time ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent reel but it hates 12gauge or bigger","review":"This unit is fine as long as you do not try and run the heavy duty cords. The clip in the bottom that you use to start reeling the cable does not handle a 12gauge cable at all so then you end up trying to do it without and its a pain and never works well. The unit weighs almost nothing so it flopps around a lot and the feet are not big enough to stand on to reel it in.This would be fine for thin cable but does not work for the big ones I seem to have everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but plastic is a little thin","review":"This product is fairly straight forward and easy to use. The plastic is a bit thinner then I was expecting, but still seems durable. For a quick and inexpensive way to store those long and pesky power cords, this is definitely a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"I sent it back because you need to unroll the entire length of cord in order to use it the way I planned.

It has made my tool area so much nicer having all the electric cords all rolled up in one place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product","review":"The reel is just too flimsy to be able to use on a consistent basis, or at all for me. I have to hold the reel down with one hand and reel the cord in with the other, and that still doesn't always hold it still. And obviously if you want to use an extension cord with this, you have to unreel the entire cord so that you can use each end. Useless reel in my opinion. I just wind up my extension cord with my arms and will end up throwing this out unfortunately...waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best reel design","review":"While there are several 'tricks' for effectively using this reel, it just isn't as good a design as the steel frame 'S' designs that cost about $5 more.

However, this reel provides no way to actually use the cable while it's being reeled or unreeled. You either have to fold your cord in half, which unreels the other half as you pull on one end, or reel it up with one end in the center.Folding it in half might work if you're doing yard work, but when my driveway is covered in snow, there's no way I can put the cord half way down and just deal with it. So now I'm going to have to unreel the cord before I use it anyway. It's great that people have suggested modifications, but they still don't allow you to unwind the cord while it's plugged in - the cord would twist. Also, it only allows for about 5-10\\" of lead wire, where all my garage outlets are about 3' off the floor. This works great for storing the cord when not in use, but provides absolutely no benefit for the cord while being used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Storing Long Extensions Easy","review":"I like this unit. It is not quite as heavy duty as the Alert Stamping 7000WR unit but I used it to store two 50' extension cords plugged together in the middle. I used the suggested method of putting the middle of the extension cord at the center and rolled up the cords into 1 100' reel. Works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Have To Be Kidding- Terrible Design!","review":"I purchased this reel because it received good reviews. Unfortunately, it has been a big disappointment. The reel is designed so that it is necessary to unreel the entire cord in order to plug it in. The plug goes under a clip in the inside of the reel, and the cord then wraps around it. Hence, in order to access the plug, it is necessary to unwind the cord completely, free the plug from the clip, and then plug it in. The fact that the manufacturer would actually design it this way, boggles my mind. I look at this reel, shake my head, and think to myself, \\"did the idiot who designed this thing actually try to use it?\\" Don't buy this reel unless you are prepared to unwind the entire cord every time you want to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Clumsy to handle and not efficient no matter how the cord is wound.

But Decahedron was the second band to play, and I was very impressed. I loved the energy of the lead singer and how he plaed his guitar. I enjoed the show so much I bought their CD. The CD is amazing, but I still like them better live. Decahedron's instumental side to their music reminds me somewhat of At The Drive-In. The kind of off-set chords and the relaxed feel to the music. The instrumental songs are great, and I love how the singer screams (Drowning into yourself!).

The plot does creep forward with some very \\"artificial\\" twists to complicate the situation. Many long internal dialogues with repetitive and very infantile thoughts impact the flow of the whole story.At the end the male main character's background was left open and the whys of certain occcurrences were not clearly solved.

The writing is sub par, poorly researched from a historical prospective. Worse than that though is the overwhelmingly repetitive story telling. The characters go through the same turmoil page after page, the love scenes are written almost in duplicate. They kissed, he touched her rear.... The book was not a page turner at all, except that I kept hoping it would end. There is no tension, poorly developed plot.

I was shocked that it was love affair about seniors. Very interesting and thought provoking. In the US, we are bombarded with sexy, young Hollywood actors. The characters are normal folks, living their everyday lives. I never think that seniors love and with that, they have physical and sexual needs - the need to be desired and held. As much as I believe the two having the affair loved each other, I could not sense the depth oh their love. I think parts of the movie could have been better explained - like how Inge with whom she had the affair, how she met him. Maybe their passion was not hot enough for my senses. Overall, I thought the movie was enjoyable and thought provoking, I just hated how it ended - leaves ya hanging, looking for more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love affair after sixty","review":"This movie is quite amazing in the way it handles a sexual affair between a woman in her late sixties and a man in his late 70's. The love scenes are shown without gauzy lights and they are both fascinating and a little disturbing.The affair is really the centerpiece of the film. The woman has to decide whether to stay with her husband of 30 years who has grown old and boring but who has been loyal to her and a good stepfather to her daughter or to go with a more dashing lively fellow. The actress is wonderful. Since she is in almost every scene and we see so much of her (!) she has to be marvelous to hold our attention.I subtract a star for the ending of the story. It felt like an easy copout and the very ending was a real letdown. Mostly this film's value, I think, is the frankness and sensitivity with which it shows something that we are not used to seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 1 1/2 stars","review":"I watched this because it was rated 4 stars.

I think there are only three songs on here worth listening to...Desperate Times (though this song certainly sounded better on his cd Bandera), the Preacher (on which he ALMOST sounds like his old self), and the Wedding Song (on which Natalie sounds better than Charlie but seems to have had her mic turned WAY down on the last chorus of the song).

I am not sure if this album could have been written if Transcendtal Blues had not been released to such great Reviews.

I am not adopted, but the author did an excellent job getting across to the reader how Marley felt when she discovered her parent's secret. As the reader, I went through the feelings that Marley went through. I felt myself getting angry for Marley and at Marley. I wanted her to get upset and confront her parents with their secret. I also was very upset with Jack that he only wrote letters, but never visited until he felt like he had to. I really enjoyed how the book ended.

The other actors did their best, but with very little action there was just no saving this film.Patrick Cassidy and the Olsen twins live the big city. The twins mother has died and they've grown up quickly being a team with Daddy. They get a letter from their mother's aunt asking them to help save the ranch she's lived on for years. Mother used to tell them about that place! So off they go and too long, too boring story short, they save the ranch.Very little action and that doesn't come until the end of the movie and even then it isn't what should be considered real action.My nieces 4,5, and 7, stopped watching after less than a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kokushi-ryu Jujitsu","review":"I found this book to be rehashed Aikido/Judo moves done in the older form appearing to look like the original jujitsu waza.

This album is their most pastoral, I think, and owes a serious debt to the likes of Van Morrison and the Chieftains.

Blasted captures the full horror of contemporary war and socks home scalpel-sharp observations about life, abuse of all kinds and extreme despair, yet finds some compassion amid it all. Phaedra's Love is a majestic macabre comedy, a re-working of the Greek tragedy of Phaedra, yet again with serious points to make about obsessive love, extreme boredom and hypocrisy.Sarah's work will live on for centuries, both through performances of her own plays and through the new writers influenced by her who are already emerging.I met Sarah twice, and she was a very lovely lady, so may you die horribly, Colorado, you scum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"They tell me that Sarah Kane made quite a stir in British theatre before her untimely suicide in 1999. Given the undeniable intensity of \\"Blasted,\\" not to mention the in-your-face subject matter, it's not difficult to see why. I think Kane had at least some talent, but the modest technical skill she brings to this play is definitely overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the material. Really, \\"Blasted\\" is just that old Theatre of the Absurd shtick--you know: \\"The world is a crazy, horrible place but it's all we have\\"--updated for somewhat more permissive 1990's audiences; no one familiar with the best plays of Beckett, Pinter, or Stoppard should be terribly impressed by it. The companion piece, \\"Phaedra's Love,\\" is more of the same, only lacking the questionable merits of the first play. In fact, \\"Phaedra's Love\\" is flat-out awful, strongly suggesting that Kane had really very little to say. But that's often how it goes with would-be rebels in the arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming story","review":"This book, written in Louise Marley's impeccable style, is a lovely tale of mystery, musical history, family responsibility and romance Two young girls both of exceptional talent are connected across time by the instrument called \\"glass armonica\\".

The story involves the strong emotional ties to their music and to their brothers which draws them to communicate across the years.

Tuck it into your bag to take along on your next trip. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winding tale full of ethereal music","review":"This book's hard to classify--fantasy or science fiction, mainstream or young adult. It's the tale of two women and the music that binds them. In the 1700's, a young poor girl busks the street playing music from glasses. She's mentored by Benjamin Franklin, who wants her to play his own glass instrument. In 2018, musical virtuoso, Erin, returns to play that same instrument.The story is well-written, if a bit long. To me, the 1700's was a richer venue well depicted and compelling, while the future seems a bit barren and uncertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Compared to her well-done trilogy, this book is like it's written by an different writer. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional. This makes it hard to really care about them. More interesting was the portion of the story set in the 1700's; Eilish was somewhat interesting. Erin seemed too weak and whiny of a character to be the other half of the book. Likewise, it's hard to feel any sympathy or care about Charlie and whether he walks again or not. He's just there.The plot is also thin--I kept thinking \\"When is something going to happen?\\" There's not enough foreshadowing of some of the events that occur towards the end in Erin's part, and a miraculous event near the end seems too convienently resolved.Finally, in the trilogy, Ms. Marley made us a part of the music and in undestanding how it works and affects other people. This one never quite reaches that height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I started this book with high expectation from the previous reviews, but I found the plot to weak and the characters to be very, very...thin...underdeveloped...two dimensional.

The point of the interconnectedness of life in an ecosystem doesn't come across well in the story alone... only by reading the letter from the author at the beginning and the pages of notes at the end do you get the full picture of what the book is trying to say.

There are glaring errors in this book which leads me to believe this author does not know herbs well at all. Cayenne does NOT cause severe kidney damage as the author states.

A vast wilderness where the great grizzly bear still roamed free! The author's memories of northern California pioneer life in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Recounted years later for his daughter, Told with wry humor and wisdom. The stories ring true.The first tale, \\"Bear on Fire,\\" sets the tone. The author is guiding some artists near Mount Shasta when a wildfire threatens the entire party. Seeking shelter he keenly observes the wildlife as it too flees.The second story & third stories hark back to the author's boyhood. The rest can be read in any order. Some of the stories range farther afield to Alaska, Louisiana and Mexico.The tales often speak of the potential diasterous consequences of bad decisions and ignorance. Exciting, yet not gory. Good initiation theme stories for young and old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"bearly believable","review":"The writing style is clear and well structured. The adventures are of human proportions.

Much of his argument rests on the fact that since both words are used in regards to the same relationships (i.e. God to man, Jesus to disciples, disciples to God, etc), they must mean the same thing. Butler is presupposing that phileo and agapao both should be defined as \\"love.\\" This is the fallacy of begging the question. We use multiple words to describe our relationships to other people; this does not make them synonyms. To apply Butler's method to English: If I say, \\"I think about Jane\\" and \\"I talk about Jane,\\" think and talk must mean the same thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These pots arrived today.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the book does contain a lot of useful formulas, however it only derives a few of them. Furthermore, from reading this book, I did not gain any intuitive understanding of most of the fundamental concepts of electromagnetics (which is probably my single largest criticism of the book). Instead, I got through my courses by searching for the right formulas for a given problem, which I hate doing. I've heard other students at my school rave about this book, but I wouldn't purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I am an EE undergrad, and this was the assigned textbook in my third year electrodynamics course. I used Cheng's book before. Cheng's book has a more theoretical approarch and mathematical rigorousness. Ulaby's book, however, is superior when it comes to building an intution or an 'engineering sense' of how systems work and how to solve problems. I would definitely recommend this book for the second/third year EE major whose studying the topic for the first time as the book offers a very accessible introduction and many end-of-chapter problems that are actually doable and can enhance your understading of the subject matter; unlike cheng's problem sets which can get very difficult/challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and easy to understand for students","review":"This electromagnetics book was easy to read and understand.

I had to borrow a number of other books on the topic to complete my work. The presentation of topics is awkward at best, and leaves much to be desired. A book that proposes to be teaching the fundamentals should do that, but this book just lists a smattering of facts about EMF's and wave propogation without any semblance of order or reason. Apart from the shoddy treatment of the material itself, the index appears to be for a completely separate book. Not one item listed in the index could be found within ten pages of the supposed location. There was an average of about plus or minus fifteen pages for most entries, and some weren't even in the book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book in excellent condition","review":"Book arrived promptly and in excellent condition.

She zips all around her life and tells about famous names like Marion Davies, Douglas Fairbanks, D.W. Griffith, Irving Thalberg, Clark Gable, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and other comtemporaries. Even if one has not heard of these people before, which is the case in several bits, a detailed portrait of them will be painted by the time the book is through. Most vivid of these portraits is her husband, nicknamed \\"Mr. E,\\" a manic depressive with a severe need to perform better than his famous wife.Loos lived for quite a long time, so not only does one read about her experiences during the Roaring Twenties, but also about her more modern experiences. What does she think about her films being shown in schools? What about modern Hollywood?

They were unsure the concert would occur because New York City was in the midst of a newspaper strike, hence they were unable to fully advertise the performance. They had nothing to fear.We, the listening audience, were lucky that the relatively new recording technique of \\"stereo fidelity recording\\" was mature enough that the performance was preserved in stereo: Columbia, who produced the original vinyl discs, released both a stereo and monaural version.By luck, I was already a fan because of the famous single, \\"Take Five\\" and purchased the album at the local PX at the Army base in Kaiserslaurtern, Germany.

I rewind it over and over, just to hear songs like \\"ocean\\". This group is better than a lot of those who get onto the \\"WoW\\" compilation CD's. I have no doubt that Ten Shekel Shirt will get picked up soon by someone big, and be able to spread their message far and wide. Their songs have an honest, open message of praise, which reminds me of the original Jars of Clay album, but in a wholy different style. This group isn't bogged down by story-telling songs or symbolism... they shout their faith loud and clear.

This collection includes Service's best known poems from Songs of a Sourdough, including The Call of the Yukon, The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and my personal favourite, The Cremation of Sam McGee. If these poems don't have you booking a trip to the Yukon, nothing will.Service was a man's man, living in northern Canada in White Horse and Dawson. This gives his poems a rarefied feeling that cannot be counterfeited. If Louis L'Amour had lived in northern Canada he would have been a soul mate to Robert W. Service. They both loved the outdoors and loved the men of the outdoors. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Robert W. Service is that his life story is even more compelling than his poetry. To read The Men that Don't Fit In is to get a glimpse of the man who fits.This is poetry for the soul that requires no degree in literature to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Poetry!","review":"As anyone who has read my Amazon.com review of \\"The Poetry Of Robert Frost\\" knows, Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Robert Service comes in a close second. \\"The Collected Poems Of Robert Service\\", consisting of Service's poems up to 1940, reveals the breadth of his work. The \\"Bard Of The Yukon\\" is well represented in this collection, but this collection goes far beyond the Yukon. In addition to the Northern Nature poems for which Service is famous, this collection includes poems set in World War I which reveal the common humanity of soldiers and the inhumanity of war. Poems set in Europe between the wars provide an insight into that Bohemian world. Whatever the topic, the reader will be touched by the poems. Some will provide lines to remember and quote, others insights to contemplate, some just entertainment.Service's poetry is readily understandable, enjoyable and reveals much about human character.Pick up and read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got a copy...","review":"After hearing this on XM radio for well over a year, I finally got a copy in the Amazon market place.

Please be aware that you CANNOT cook with this--though that is only indicated in the instruction book. The cord for this cooker is too short for safety, making it virtually mandatory to use an extension cord. So much for safety. This is apparently designed for the narrow use of keeping dips warm. This might be acceptable, but the temperature is below the 140 degree level considered a minimum for safety by food service professionals. Also, you really have to heat the food separately and then put it in the pot--a real nuisance. The clincher is that it's a real pain to clean. Do not consider this Little Dipper a \\"bonus\\"!

Recorded live somewhere at some time (there is no information on the sleeve), it seems to be very early Connolly, as he is making the transition from folk singer to stand-up comedy. A good amount of the material not only depends on being able to understand a Glaswegian patter, but also requires some geographical knowledge of Glasgow itself. A lot of scatalogical humour, and too many folk singing comedy songs.It is as if this recording company found an old tape of Connolly's that they had rights to, so they decided to cash in.There is a reason the price on this is so low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect shorthand drill book","review":"This is an advanced book.

Suffice it to say that like others, I read this book as a child, and have rediscovered it with joy as an adult. The author's fine paintings and illustrations make it a stand out book, and the in-depth text is also rich in detail.For those who want to know more about warfare in ancient Greece and Rome, this book is an absolute MUST. Enough said.Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and Gray","review":"This is a very nicely produced flood light. While it is advertised as Bronze, implying a brown hue, it is more of a pleasant gun metal gray hue. It is easy to adjust and lock into a flood pattern and the ability to unscrew the lens to replace the lamp is very useful. A functional and easy to install/maintain light at reasonable price. Note that there is no motion or dark activation included, it's a simple direct wired light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product as promised, a bit slow to ship","review":"The product was delivered as promised.

I had it on vhs and loaned it to someone and it got lost. Every time I watch that movie it reminds me of what the christian life is suppose to be like. I used it for ministering to other people. Great item to buy. If you are a christian this is the movie that will make a difference in your spiritual life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I purchased this Toy Chest since it was in sale and got it today and we started assembling. When we put the screws and tighten the wood cracks in several places. I don't know how many days its going to last. I dont know why people use pressed wood for this kind of piece and sell it for $[...]. This piece is not definetly worth the money. Please starting using solid wood or anything that does not crack. I love the look, but that deceives. My son loves to sit on it, but I am worried that it will break someday. By the way the Instructions for Assembly given with the product is should be much more clear and step by step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, so don't expect much","review":"I figured for over $100 I would have received something of better quality. There were minor scratches on most pieces and the graphics were slightly smudged. Nothing major enough to go through the hassle of taking it apart, packing it back up, and dealing with the return process. Assembly didn't go well, the included screws broke (I broke three of them, only by using a handheld screwdriver, the heads twisted right off). I ended up having to drill extra holes since the included screws broke off. Also, the instructions (the usual Chinese wordless instruction sheet) didn't put things together in the right order, so you ended up having to improvise. Parts of it are little more than cheap press board. I have my questions on whether or not it is going to last in my son's room more than a year or two.All in all, just know you're paying $100 for a cheaply made Chinese made novelty item, not a real piece of furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy toy box","review":"Got this for our 15 month old son.

No problems with the toy chest, assembly wasn't difficult although instructions could be more detailed and delivery was good. Minor detail with logo and monogram, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. My son loves his toy chest, so that's what matters most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Gift Experience","review":"This was a horrible experience in gift giving. I ordered this toybox as a baby gift. First, the website did not let me send a message stating it was a gift, from whom, etc. Amazon was absolutely no help in this arena and placed the blame on the website of the seller. Then I found out the package was delivered to my friends in Albuquerque (I live in Atlanta) with absolutely no assembly instructions. The box was void of any phone numbers or other references to figure out how to request instructions. Without my knowledge, my friends finally found a website site and tracked down the manufacturer to request assembly instructions. This was my first time buying anything from amazon.com and it will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turning work of wonder","review":"Mr. and Mrs. Allen have assembled a finely crafted look into the life of a Butler.

She autographed my copy of this book, and when I got it, I began reading immediately. What a find. Not only do she and Chris open up the world of \\"butling\\" with all its traditions, etiquette, and unwritten rules of confidentiality, but they also provide a wide variety of tips on ironing, cooking, serving--skills that a regular person could use in the real world of those of us not well off enough to have someone else perform these tasks for us.

Apparently this book was scanned using (very poor) optical character recognition. The publisher, General Books LLC, did not find that they needed to edit this in the slightest. As a result, your reading experience will be flooded with phrases like this, an actual quote from this book: \\"owner's v legal righL af.-e?eciijig-the occupant.\\" The chapters are also not organized properly, paragraphs are spaced terribly, and unnecessary line breaks run amok.Save yourself the hassle of trying to interpret this machine-scanned garbage, and buy a legitimate copy of Equality from a legitimate publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Introduction to the Basics of Anthropology","review":"This book is great for beginning anthropology students or people who just want to learn a little more about it!

To me this story was unique. The history about the demons living on earth and being run off by humans was intriguing. You'll find the usual commonly used fantasy creatures alomg with some interesting new ones such as the leshies. The characterization was great. Most of the main characters developed throughout the whole story.

She has one of those voices that you just fall in love with. This live CD, Live in Paris 05 is cooking, it is a greatest hits live basically and you will definitely enjoy it. Vivimi, Se Fue, Tra Te E Il Mare, Surrender, E Retiorno Di Te, and La Cose Che Vivi are all excellent, well every song is excellent. This is a must have for Laura fans and I would recommend it anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Concert in ANY language","review":"This is an amazingly well done concert in every respect. I have never seen a concert DVD that has as much quality in EVERY area. Laura Pausini is amazing, and she is supported by a dynamite band, backup singers, great video/audio work, and a audience that is INTO the performance (too bad the one guy with the air horn had to ruin it). Literally, I do not understand 90% of the lyrics, but this performance is musically and technically riveting from beginning to end.

No one sings a song like Sade and no one has come close to capturing the depth of despair and loneliness prevelant in so many of her songs. I can't speak for anyone, but one thing I know for sure- this lady will always have the distinct honor of recording the soundtrack to so many gay men's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooooth....","review":"I work from home and always have music playing in the background while working on computer.

I've heard in a long time. Heavily arranged pop cheese gathered on one disc. The players are good, the singer is good, but the tunes are pure cheese, while the players are held back from playing anything that's actually musical. If Sade wants to be a jazz singer, she should try singing something with some meat in it, and learn to improvise, as well as let her musicians improvise and swing. This is smooth R&B at it's elevator music blandest."},{"rating":"2","title":"BReathtaking RnB at its Best","review":"Sade has always been an Amazing Lyricist with Baby making Grooves!

Songs like \\"Love is stronger than pride\\", \\"Your love is king\\", \\"sweetest tabbo\\", \\"cherish the day\\", \\"Kiss of life\\"...are enough to get this alone. This is good study music, romancing music, chillin, and relaxing music. This one is a classic and if u never heard about sade then this is the one to get.

IT DID NOT LET ME DOWN. IT MOVES THE BODY, MIND AND SOUL.

In some cases, the mixes are *slightly* different (such as \\"Never As Good As The First Time\\"). This is because this disc contains the single mixes/edits of those songs. Since the album versions are still all in print on cd, how nice that Sony has presented the single versions here.As to the material, I can only echo the praise others have posted. Sade has been making good music for nearly 20 years now, though this compilation doesn't include anything from their latest effort. Each of Sade's albums is worth having, even though some of them have a track or two that miss the mark a bit. This cd, however, is something you can play over and over and never tire of."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"As I described most of my CD's, you get a great price, free delivery and a guarantee on top of that.

I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful resource","review":"Brauer's book is a helpful resource for those looking to get a synopsis of what the Lutheran Confessions teach on worship. As worship is the active theology of the church (and not necessarily a specific systematic theology topic) we often don't find clear definitions of worship in the Confessions. This is especially true of what many today in the evangelical culture call \\"worship\\". But Brauer broadens our perspective with this work. I have found it more helpful as a resource than a book to read from cover-to-cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and beautiful version...","review":"This version of the instrumental music of Corelli is played with great finesse and elegance.

Most of the examples are from Author's own experience, but this should be considered a strong point of the book, not a weakness - providing the author is truthful. He shows you what worked and what did not work for him, and it is up to you to extrapolate his experiences to your own situation.

That is right, most of the entire book. If you are looking for ideas as what to see then maybe that can help you. If you already know what you want to mail order I didn't see where this book helped at all.

She was not well enough to go to the reunion in New Orleans.Being named for Danilova, it was humorous to hear so many wonderful stories from the other beautiful ladies.This film was shown in my area on the anniversary of her passing. I was fortunate enough to connect our local film society with Robert Lindgren who was in the company with my mother. He lectured and took questions at all of the showings. Pure Magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best evenings I've ever had with a DVD","review":"A magnificent view of the world created by Diaghilev. Touching, melancholy and thoroughly enthralling, it left me drained and delighted. I truly loved watching these beautiful artists who worked so hard with little recompense. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliriously wonderful film","review":"First up, I am not into ballet, or at least not very much. It's never been an artform that has grabbed me, with occasional exceptions. However, this documentary is one of the most beautiful, charming, witty and moving films I have ever seen (and I'm old, so that says a lot). The performers - some of them now in their 90's and still hale - are remarkable, and the ease with which the filmmaker moves through the history of these amazing two companies of artists is a joy to behold. I saw this on a whim in the theater when it first came out; I laughed at some of the dancers' memories, cried at the sheer beauty of the historic footage, and came out feeling wonderful about life and the magic that is performance art at its very best.At times funny, at times touching, always beautiful, this film is both a loving tribute to an extraordinary time and a consummate work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I love dance history and this DVD was marvelous. All dancers should learn about their history and this would be a wonderful introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME SHOW HORRIBLE PACKAGING","review":"Ok loved the show, but the complete series has all the discs in individual slip covers instead of a traditional dvd holder and makes it incredibly annoying to watch or pick episodes to watch, when you have to be uber careful not to scratch the disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending sucks.","review":"The series was abruptly ended. They never got around to revealing Tela's purpose or introducing She-Ra or even wrapping up the storyline. The first couple episodes were cool, but the series got dumb after that until I reached episode 20 or so. Then, it started getting interesting again. Overall, the animation is very low quality, and the episode plots leave something to be desired, but the characters are very memorable, and this is a brilliant reboot of the He-Man story. When I bought this product, it was only $7.99, so I think it was worth the price. It offered many hours of entertainment and a little nostalgia.Disc 4 includes a comic for episode 40 (show lasted only 39 episodes), but don't think of that as an ending to the story. Episode 40 was merely a continuation of the story from episode 39, but it was a very interesting comic (the art is good), so it is still worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good price and awesome product.","review":"Very good deal.

Needless to say I had high expectations, and unfortunately this series did not meet them.The show seems to try desperately to be epic, to be greater than the original 1983 He-Man. Grandiose and epic music, battles, larger than life villians. I couldn't help but feel the producers tried too hard to equal or surpass the original, and in my honest opinion fails at that goal.Mix that with the less than stellar voice acting (quite frankly I found it terrible), a childish Adam (whom by contrast, even the older young adult Adam from the original was immature, but far more mature than this whiny brat), I have to say that I must pass on this series, and I am glad it cost me only $8 at time of purchase.I honestly cannot recommend this series to anyone, but rather recommend that fans stick to the 80's series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"He-Man needs to come back in adult form!","review":"I have loved the MOTU for most of my life being that I'm 31 years old right now.

I suppose that having a cute blonde go after a guy because he reminds her so much of her fiance could be exciting. I't even possible that a fairly intelligent college student could throw away his dreams as this cute little blonde draws him in to all her bizarre behavior. A group of us watched this movie together and the concensus was unanimous: This is one bad movie. At 95 minutes, it was about 65 minutes too long. The set up was horrible, the plot was tedious and absolutely impossible and the characters weren't even that likable. As much as I like Elisha Cuthbert, I cannot recommend this film at any level. Cute though she might be, this film is one to pass on.

It has a dial on the side to specify the temp, and once done, it keeps it there. Very efficient way to heat a tank, as ALL water must pass through the heater to return to the tank.It's the only way I'll heat my fishtank from now on. I have no worries about an in-tank heater causing burns, or weakening the glass, as this is totally outside the tank, and in the return line from the filter (a Fluval 405 in my case). I confirmed via an in-tank thermometer that the temp that I dialed in is in fact the temp that the heater is keeping, and I've had no problems.Takes a bit of work to get it working with the Fluval filter (I had to get non-corrugated tubing at the hardware store to replace sections of the ribbed tubing that Fluval provides) but once in place, you can dial it in an forget about it.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I used this heater for about 2 years with a 50 gallon reef tank.

Because this is the only in-line heater I have found I purchased a second unit to replace the first one. After 2 months it also developed an internal leak and shorted the heating coils.

Frightened yet? Well you should be. The Vines tread a lot of ground in genres in music compared to other 'New Rock Revolution' bands, but they pull all of this off quite unsucessfully and end up looking quite inferior to their counterparts. I was reluctant to buy this album because I was afraid it would all sound like Get Free. Well guess what, most of the songs don't sound like the single. But it doesn't matter because the album is drenched in filler. The Vines try to pull off Beatles sounding tunes and Led Zeppelinish tunes but they don't mesmerize you. This album has three pretty good songs, the title track, Mary Jane, and Outtathaway. I suggest you download those songs and scrap the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to better music","review":"why would you buy this?the vines are one of these \\"return of rock\\" bands and are they worth it.

Instead, I get a terrible cd that I'll most likely never listen to again after the first time. This one happened to litter their debut cd with boring songs that have little to no thought put into the lyrics. They're just another band I'll forget about in a couple years, unlike Nirvana and The Beatles, who will live on forever.

That's all you can really say about them. They aren't original, aren't good for more than 10 or so listens, and aren't the future of rock. However, few people really care about that. I thought they were fun to listen to for a while, but I found my radiohead and wilco Cds came in much more frequently. I love nirvana, and when I heard \\"Get free\\" I thought the vines were the future of rock. They aren't, as evidenced by 7 or 8 absolute filler tracks in this short Cd. The only other good ones are Aint no room and Mary Jane, which both sound like the Beatles. When the vines are original, they [are bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Lyrics from old rock bands actually made sense. The singer for The Vines is just shouting nonsense lyrics that DON'T make any sense. I use to like this band back when I use to watch Brainwashing America and the world telivision(MTV), but I saw them playing live and they were terrible. What you hear on the CD is artificial.

This band tries to be like all those new rock bands, The white stripes, the hives, the strokes, black rebel motorcycle club. And this is the worst of this brand of music. Supposedly these bands are getting back to the roots of rock and roll, but in reality htey are copying bands such as the beatles and led zepp;in and using this for on music to write simple bad music. The vines are expecially bad, they have no creativity and unorigional repeated lyrics and lines.

You Am I, Grinspoon, Jebediah, The Living End, Powderfinger just to name a few. Why does the world pick The Vines to love? After hearing \\"Get Free\\" & \\"Highly Evolved\\" I don't blame the world for going nuts! These two songs are really good and I love them. But after getting the album, I soon came to realise that \\"Highly Evolved\\" really had nothing else. The other songs were OK, but sound weak & bland compared to the first two singles.And then I saw these guys live at the big day out 2003 (large australian music festival). Oh my god! the vines were absolutly terrible! They sounded weak and were easily the worst band of the day. They seriously need to work on their live performance. And whats the deal with Craig Nicolls accent? as an australian I find this quite insulting. That guy is a wanker.

They have been hyped as the savior which will save our musical universe from the likes of Pop Divas and Pearl Jam Knockoffs. But, this album falls short in so many ways. The first single, Get Free, is by far the most amusing song on the album, despite its simplicity, it is a good song. But, the rest of the album lacks that dynamic and is really quite boring. Some people have said they are like a combination between The Beatles and Nirvana, but they don't realize how horrible a combination that would be. The songs are mediocre, and the album itself is not as good as most people would lead you to believe. The album is good for Get Free, but that's about it. Two stars for the effort, but the last three are only earned through quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Album of 2002","review":"I don't listen to the radio, so for new music connections I rely a lot upon reviews and (in weak moments) occasionally media hype. I should have known better. I like The Strokes, and The White Stripes older stuff is decent, but this album made me sick. I've tried to give it a way so it won't taint my honorable music collection, but it seems my friends aren't the sucker I was. I listened to the album a couple of times but there wasn't one moment of excitement.Honestly, The Vines have been included in the media's \\"rebirth of rock,\\" but there is nothing on this album that warrants repeated listening. Unless you've heard the band and know you like it, I strongly suggest buying a pack of cigarettes and some porn instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unevolved Nirvana","review":"This album is nothing more than a poorly done rehash of Nirvana, Radiohead, and the Beatles. While all three of those are defintely respectable, The Vines however,are not. The music is pretentious and the band leader, Craig Nichols, has been nothing but a clueless lout that feels like it is his duty to be the new CrAzY guy in rock-n-roll. Instead of being a loose cannon he is just another loose nut. I give it one star because the current single Come In is a decent revision of Nirvana's Negative Creep.

The lead singer's voice is a weird, sandpapery yelp, and he is incoherant at all times. I saw them on the MTV awards or some other crap, and they were awful. And what are they saying in Outtathaway? I'm pretty sure I heard 'I'm comin' off that negr* sound' and that might very well be what they said, since most of the song is about people being 'different' and them not caring about saying things 'out of line cause they don't believe in time'. Of course, I've gotten different versions of the lyrics from a few different places since no one seems to agree on what the heck they're saying. OutKast should hunt them down and kick their skinny white asses. And why did OutKast or whichever black person owns that 'Ms. Jackson' song sell it to THEM? Way to sell out, man."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not music","review":"It's a shame that a band resorts to shock value and volume (i.e. noise) to become popular. It's more of a shame that people buy into it.Listen to music because it expands your mind; because a band is doing something no one else can.

Now, don't get me wrong, this record does have its moments of Seattle-like soundz. However, the lameness on this record far outweights the rockin' moments, like when they try to be the next Beatles or something. Trust me, music fans, if they want to try and emulate anybody, it shouldn't be the overrated Beatles. Rather, they should take a cue from strong-rock gods Creed 'n Bush, and mold their sound to fit New-Age grunge, a favorite genre of mine.Another concern I have is this: have these Australian rockers been on TRL yet? If not, I hesitate to take them seriously. Remember this motto: \\"if they ain't talked to Carson Daly, then they ain't the real deal.\\" Steer clear from bands who don't frequent TRL's show, either via countdown or live performance.Alright, I'm outta here, yep, yep.

I guaruntee that a listen (or two) of the title track (or get free, or outtathaway) will make up your mind to buy Highly Evolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please don't confuse the Vines with the Hives","review":"Due to the airplay of two songs, \\"Highly Evolved\\" and \\"Get Free\\" (both very short, high-energy tracks) the Vines are thrown in the same bag as the Hives (and the Strokes, for that matter). Please don't make that mistake. The Vines are their own, and this album shows it.If you go behind those 2 well-known tracks, you will find that the Vines' music is much more than that. There are many slower-paced tracks (such as \\"Autumn Shade\\", \\"Country Yard\\", \\"Mary Jane\\", and the beautifully aching \\"Homesick\\"), even a reggae-flavored tune (\\"Factory\\") for that matter. \\"In The Jungle\\" reminded me of 60's brit-rock, and pretty good at that!The album wanders a bit at times, but it in the end, it really rewards. The last track, the 6+ min. epic \\"1969\\" (\\"It's 1969 in my head\\") sums up the album nicely, a melody and guitar driven song that shows us where the Vines are at. Nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this band supposed to be great?","review":"The Vines have a groovy bassist. I'll give them that. Other than the cool bass lines there is not much to say. The melodies are so similar to the beatles that hardly any credit can be given to The Vines for originality.The Vines blend in some grunge tones into their music. That is when it gets annoying. The singer will be singing then he'll burst out screeching like he has a hot coal in his underwear. The singer often sounds too similar to Marilyn Manson. That is not a good thing if you want to be a indie rock band.The Factory is the only song that I enjoyed. I will warn you not to buy this cd because these guys just arn't top notch. Don't be a sheep that gave into all the marketing tricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future of Rock? I hope not!","review":"How can the future of rock be a band that sounds too much like other(not so good) bands? I am getting tired of all of these whiny little teenage garage bands! Doesn't anyone out there know how to read and write music anymore? If you don't beleive me, look at how many used copies are for sale already on this website!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vines Are AWESOME!!!","review":"This is a great Cd worthy of the praise it recieves! The Vines can make some excellent songs. I dont know if they are the future of rock, but they can make a great album! And at the low price the CD is on sale for how can you afford to miss it! Highly reccomended to people who like the Beatles, Nirvana, or Alice in Chains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverchair II","review":"Australia can do better than this. If you're buying this album for the single \\"Get Free,\\" get albums by groups like Girls vs. Boys first; they had a similar but superior sound in the early 90's. I'm all for this rock revival with groups like The Hives and The Strokes but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"How could you like this band or record? It's terrible. There's no singing, just lots of annoying screaming. The band members seem very young, yet they dress like they're living in the 70's. It's pitiful, and halarious as well. Don't buy this album, check out some real rock 'n' roll like Stereomud, InMe, Primer 55, or the Dirty Americans. Don't waste your time...and please don't buy that ugly Vines t-shirt from Hot Topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saviours of rock? Please.....!!!!","review":"If The Vines are representative of Australian rock to the rest of the world then I think Australian rock is going to slip further into oblivion. This album is downright HORRIBLE! It brings new meaning to the word NOISE... Don't get me wrong i love rock but this is rock at its worst... a pale hybrid of what real music should be: music that is capable of inspiring, that is original and that continues the evolution of the genre into unchartered territories. This album is not \\"highly evolved\\" as it so boldly represents, but a reversion to the primordial swamps. If music were man then The Vines are neanderthals..... Do not waste your time or money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saviours of Rock, hUh?","review":"Calling a band the \\"saviour of rock\\" a strong thing to say, and in this case, it's also ridiculous... not to say this band is bad, because they are not. But I didn't find their music that appealing or anything that I could really call fantastic. \\"Get Free\\" definently interested me and suited my tastes, but the rest of album just didn't appeal to me nor amaze me in any sort of way. However, I'm sure there are people out there who will like this album more then I did.Lots of bands have been popping up, and if you don't particurally like The Hives, then listen to The Strokes. They are, simply, a flat out awesome band and my favorite of the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA HAH AH","review":"oh my god. if you like this album, then i'm sorry.in fact, i don't know why i'm even writing to you. you are beyond hope, and i don't think communication is truly possible.so i'm giving up. i'm abandoning you to the hordes of others like you who listen to the worst music ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Future of the death of Rock","review":"Allright, I gave this album one star to be nice, because I think they tried...I think. I dont get how people can say Get Free is a good song. The only decent song on this album is Outtatheway. This is not the future of rock, but a giant step back. First off, the lead singer needs to put down what ever it is he is on, and pick up his guitar, then learn to play it. Some singing classes could help too. I personally dont find it entertaining to see someone whacked off his mind trying to cause child like scenes and outbursts to sell records. I find it very sad, and I feel sorry for people that walk around with their album in a little cd wallet and argue that this is worth paying for..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Rock at its best! A must buy! I give it 4 stars because there are some songs I dislike. My favorite song on it is, Get Free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising Debut Album","review":"From the opening track, the Vines show you what they're all about. They band is hard, edgy yet melodic. Many overseas critics have have hailed them as nothing less than the second comming of Nirvana. This is mildly true. On tracks such as \\"Outtatheway\\", \\"Highly Evolved\\", and especially \\"Get Free\\", you can easily recognize the influence of the Seattle trio on the young Australian band. But don't be fooled, the Vines are no Nirvana cover band. \\"Autumn Shade\\" and \\"Mary Jane\\" are much softer and complex. Many of the songs on the record utilize a background acoustic guitar, a la Radiohead. Arguably the best track on Highly Evolved, \\"1969\\" projects a Britpop vibe which is very remaniscent to My Bloody Valentine.Overall, this debut record is a very good one which is only a shadow of what's to come. Keep your ears open for this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real.","review":"I picked up this album after a random listen at a listening station. I've never done that before, but that's just how impressed I was with what these guys are doing. One song, they're rocking you in bold new ways. The next, it's soft, beautiful and inviting. And neither suffers for the attempt. See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont me misled","review":"the vines are good, dont get me wrong, but they arent punk, or post punk. they are indie, and this cd only has about 3 \\"upbeat\\" songs on it including get free, non of the other songs sound like that song at all. they are more slow and mellow and relaxing in the sun on vacation kind of music, some have a cheerfull beatlesesque feeling to it. so if your thinkin they are all punk sounding like the hives or the white stripes your wrong, but they r still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana-esque","review":"This is the future of rock, the new wave, the return of garage rock and grunge, right here folks, with the white stripes, hives, and strokes.Anyway, this cd is exellent, and although i disagree with the other reviwer who said its above and beyod nirvana (nirvana is probably THE most influential rock band of all time) its a little short...but to be a little short of nirvana is still damn good.My favorite track is outtathaway....its like...the hives beatles and nirvana all at once. this is a must buy cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie Cutter Corporate Rock","review":"I heard the raves about The Vines (on the radio, Rolling Stones article) and decided to purchase this album. I read how the lead singer wants to compare himself to Kurt Cobain. Well, this album is nothing like Grunge Rock. And the lead singer is no Cobain. The Vines do not sound like a garage band. They sound and appear to be an exact replica of what producers and record execs want--clean, boring, pseudo-angst driven. But then again, the album's graphic designs should hint at that. What do you think the target age group here is?? There's none of Grunge's sensitive introspection and emotion here. This album as well as the whole new 'Brit-Pop sound' is a complete laugh, and so are the comparisons to a former Northwestern Grunge music.If you want to listen to garage-style music, try something else. If you want Grunge, try the Nixons, Replacements, Vaselines, Melvins, Alice, Tad, Mudhoney, Sebadoh, Soundgarden, Nirvana, etc., not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACK","review":"Are you kidding me? I picked this cd up because I heard it was similar to The Hives. Boy, what a mistake. Ok, Get Free is tolerable, but the rest is garabage. They'll be gone in few months, if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no this is not a good record","review":"No, this will not do at all. I have been deceived. The music press hailed the Vines as fresh and interesting. I found them worn out and unlistenable. A tired Nirvana re-tread leaning way more to the Pearl Jam / Soundgarden end of the continum than I can stomach. No swagger or irony whatsoever and very dated. The Vines sound like a midlevel bar band from your town that listen to too much Toad the Wet Sprocket and Stone Temple Pilots. Yawn and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of grunge rock... or is it?","review":"The Vines rock. They are not the best garage band to ever cross the music scene, but they do capture some of that essence in their diversity of songs, not all of which are grungey. I particularly love the guitar riff in the middle of 'Homesick'. It's just a tale of yearning in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowonder Its Cheap Price","review":"They should of lowered its price [even more]. This band has nodirection . The kickoff song had promise,the rest just died. They are out of time,their chord changes were slow and sloppy. They need some work,and their song writing skills need a massive upgrade. Just goes to show ,record companys will signup anybody if you front them the money . Hey record company,I got a Bulldog who snores out a pretty good tune . Save your bucks and spend it on Coors and the twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool, a new Nirvana greatest hits?","review":"Oh, my bad, it's just another wannabee. Please don't buy into the hype. I did, and am regretting my ...loss. I bought this album without a listen, and I vow never to do that again. I could have popped Bleach into the CD player and had a much more enjoyable, and original listen, not to mention saved [money]. Before arguing, please listen to \\"Blew\\" on Bleach, and then \\"Get Free\\", the first single by the Vines, and then talk to me.This is not terrible song writing, but just not original, and not all that exciting. The future of rock 'n roll?, I hope not. In the same order, I spent [money] on the EP by Interpol, and found much more to enjoy in those 3 songs than the entire album by the Vines. Sorry to be the rotten apple. If you don't own it, i'd recommend Bleach by Nirvana before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than One Star","review":"My limited knowledge of astronomy and physics has left me with the understanding that a black hole is a star that has collapsed into itself. As a result, the black hole has negative mass. If that is the case, I think that Amazon should take a cue from the world of astronomy and allow buyers to rate recordings with negative stars, as they would be the rating equivalent of a black hole. Certainly, few recent recordings are more worthy of, oh say, -5 stars than \\"Highly Evolved.\\" (Not to mention the fact that the title is an oxymoronic misnomer of the highest order.) \\"Highly Devolved\\" is more like it - like back to 1994.Please, oh please, do not carelessly lump The Vines in with The Strokes or The White Stripes. Julian & Company and Jack & Meg write and perform songs that are far superior, and The Hives run laps around these guys all day long.The Vines? Try The Withering Vines.Or maybe Silverchair II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative nonsense","review":"I had heard this band a few times on the radio and wondered who turned the dial back to 1995, and that was before the hype onslaught began.But seriously, this band is energetic, but far from original. I have alot of CDs from bands who do this better. Besids who wants rock that is so over-produced. That is one fancy garage they play in. From this past year, if you want something new AND good, check out McLusky or The Hot Snakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many slow songs...","review":"I'm not a big fan of slow songs, and when I bought this CD I was expecting to hear energetic songs like \\"Get Free\\" and \\"Highly Evolved.\\" I listened to it about 13 times and after that I couldn't stand the CD and got rid of it. How can they be compared to Nirvana? The only song that slightly sounds like Nirvana is \\"In the Jungle\\" but other than that.. no. I don't suggest buying this CD, unless you're a fan of The Strokes (maybe). Or listen to it in the store, but I suggest listening to the whole album before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible talentless nirvana/britpop ripoff","review":"This band honestly only has 2 or 3 songs on the album that are listenable and they rip so blatantly off nirvana its sad. Ripping off nirvana doesn't make you a visionary - it makes you silverchair. Half the rest of the songs on the album are slow rhythmless dirges lending a complete lack of cohesiveness to the album. The lyrics make litte or no sense and all the vocalist does is scream on the faster tracks or warble incomprehensibly on the slow tracks. The guitarist is trash and the bassist is worse. THe album sounds like it was recorded in my basement. THE most overhyped album of the year. Noone in this band has any musical talent. Rock is dead. If you want Rock 'N Roll with some balls buy \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" by Guns 'N Roses since that was the last real rock album that had coherent lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding work","review":"Progress and technology start to invade a small New Zeland town in this outstanding work.

Keep up the good work man. Wish he made another solo album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"After all the years Glenn Tipton has played in Judas Priest, I expected something more varied and interesting from one of metal's legendary guitarists.All you get are rehashed, second-rate riffs complete with requisite creepy/goofy vocals. It sounds as though he might have a decent singing voice, if only he'd sung in a normal register. You largely get the same guitar tone throughout and most songs scoot along at the same tempo. A little acoustic guitar or piano (which he does play), would have broken up the monotony and made for a much more interesting album. He's a much better player and writer than this release would lead you to believe.This is not the least bit interesting and certainly not representative of his best work. It's definitely not worth your time or money. Glenn, don't give up your day job..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless masterpiece of dance music","review":"This mix by Josh Wink is awe inspiring. It spans through different genres of electronic music ranging from ambient to serious headbanging techno (no trance) all mixed seamlessly .The feel of the cd is uplifting and refreshing. It's guarenteed to make you dance with your eyes closed or works ok in a car or office setting. I wouldn't recommend it though especially since the latter half of the mix is pounding and relentless and makes you want to pump up the volume and ingest some \\"party favors\\".Just in case you newbies have never heard of Josh Wink, he is a respectable dj that can hang with the best of them, so fans of Louie DeVito steer clear from this one.Don't deprive your ears of sweet sounds and buy the CD now!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A build up","review":"This mix is one that builds slowly to climaxes rather than smacking you in the face right away. It may take some patience but I think after a short listen you'll come to appreciate it in its subtleties and understand that dance music can be complex and still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Wink's most amazing peices of work.","review":"This cd takes you through the depths of deep, progressive house to a new disco vibe and back to Wink's notorious house/trance. Wink is a master DJ, probably the best in the industry, and this CD helps to exhibit his complete and un-parelleled control over his vinyl.

Enthralling plot and likable characters, highlighting the difference between the Inqusiotor game and 40K.

My first foray into 40K novels was the Ultramarines Omnibus which I enjoyed immensely so i decided to expand my library. After going through the entire book I was extremely disappointed at the lack of pull it had compared to Graham McNeils book.The characters in the story were pretty lame and really lacked polish.

A physically deformed mouse rebells against a society and creates his own generic way; all without the means of any plot. It just unfolds.... moment by painful moment. True, it could have been worse with a chorus and a kick-line, but I believe myself to be sufficiantly scarred.This film is full of brain-washing ideas for a rated G movie. I would not show it to children-- ever. Soup is, in this movie, \\"better than Christmas,\\" the portly \\"ugly\\" characters wind up together isolated out of town by the end of the film, NONE of the females seem to have the ability to read and rely on male mice to do this for them, and of course, all father figures in this film have abandoned their children in this film.

It turned out to be a huge disappointment. The movie is far too dark and frightening for very young children. And though it may not have had any swearing in it, the darkness and the violence definitely did not coincide with a G rating, I felt. There were many violent scenes and very frightening images. We ended up turning it off and finding a better movie, but even so, some of our kids had nightmares. It was violent, frightening, and just altogether unenjoyable for our family. Older children may enjoy it, but I would not recommend it for young ones. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, as I didn't enjoy it at all, either. In its defense, the animation is good and the scenery is rich and lovely/gruesome, but I don't feel this earns it a high rating, as it is supposed to be a good family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book: GOOD, Movie: BAAAD","review":"I read the book, and urged my mom to read it.

I have most of these cartoon movies that come out and I don't want this one. The story line just doesn't make too much sense. The lessons are confusing as are the characters and lines.

Neither liked this movie. My wife and I watched the entire thing - good start, to dark middle, to stupid finish. The previews showed the best part - the mouse like no other. The rat, voiced by a dull Hoffman (time to really retire), was never developed. The narration was dark, dreary, and barely moved the movie from one (well animated) bad scene to another dark scene. The end was stupid - the chef, who was told to not make soup, SUDDENLY decides to make soup. This makes the clouds finally drop their rain. The rain makes all the loose ends come together somehow.This dog is not for kids, or anyone looking for inspiration.

I would recommend this to any parent who wants to teach their child the simple moral of forgiveness and rising above their circumstances. Good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story? Interesting. Animation, BLEGH!","review":"The plot of this movie was quite interesting...I know the book is popular. I won't go into the disturbing scenes where the princess is about to be eaten alive by rodents, or the seriously depressing parts, I'll just say the animation is terrible! The mice look...OK but the humans have ultra skinny, long faces and look really, really ugly! Every time they were like, \\"oh, the princess is so beautiful,\\" I was thinking, who? the girl with the thin head? I was really disappointed in the animation, and it just wasn't a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despereaux's desparte tale.","review":"The animation is good in the film, as is the action in the telling of his story.

The charactors are so adorable and endearing. A must for children & adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids, not for adults, not for anybody","review":"I can't believe how painfully bad this movie was. I thought I would like it. I wanted to like it. My 2 kids and I had the misfortune of picking this movie at the Summer $1.00 movies. I am a huge lover of animated movies, but this one and space chimps are the 2 worst I've ever seen. We walked out of the movie theater 1/2 way through because it was so awfully boring. My kids were begging to leave! I would have insisted on staying if the movie even piqued my interest. The story line was so flat, lifeless and uninteresting that all 3 of us couldn't stand it together. My 7 year old put it ever so eloquently when he said, \\"I know we only spent $3.00 on this movie but I think we spent $3.00 too much!\\" I would have preferred to scrub floors, clean toilets or iron clothes than to have sat through 1/2 this movie again. BORING, BORING, BORING!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull movie","review":"As our kids are fans of great mouse movies like Flushed Away, I thought they would like The Tale of Despereaux.

I read the story's synopsis and saw it was rated G and thought that, at the very least, it would be entertaining to her. It was dreadful. Despereaux really becomes a bit player among other story lines that are all dark and sinister. When the princess is bound in the dungeon about to be eaten by rats, I really could not believe it! I also thought (and I have never read the book, so perhaps I'm wrong) that some of it was a rip off from ratatouille...the appreciation of the soup, the rat guiding the human, and the one head evil rat, to my mind, was a rat version of the snooty food critic Anton (?). At any rate, this movie literally made my daughter cry and she spent a good part of it under her blanket. I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIN PARAR DE AMAR!","review":"I just can't get enough of the leading single of this records...A dance epic of love SIN PARAR is infectuos and inevitable to love....the chorus line just catch you.

Horror piled on horror: all of the overtures are incomplete, the order of movements is changed, standard repetitions are not played, and to top it all off, the three oboes in 55:D15 (TWV numbers? Who needs them?) are shamelessly, and ridiculously, replaced by three trumpets. I only keep the thing because 55:D7 is still not available elsewhere. Even if the soloists are good, there is no point in praising them. Telemann is my favourite composer, and to see him treated like this makes my bile rise. - Cheap it may be, but please don't buy this trash CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I thought this might be a vinyl dye (like VHT's products for vinyls claim to be), but no, actually it's just, more or less, a flexible vinyl paint.I used it on some textured, black motorcycle plastics.

I already know algebra, I'm great with it, but I thought I should refresh some skills.I suddenly realized that there were so many shortcuts I could be taking. I got faster at algebra. The hard questions on the SAT became easy for me (on the subject of algebra).If you need practice, use this book. If you don't know algebra, you will learn it, from this book. If you're taking the SAT, use this book. If you're already good at algebra, become better, use this book.Insane book, the Second edition is also on amazon...for about a buck. I've used that too, it's just as amazing. Whatever floats your wallet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems in Accuracy","review":"I used this book to prepare for the GRE and, while it really did help jog my memory on the math, it really bothered me that there were so many typos. I found at least 10 where the sign or number was wrong in the equation or answer. I think in a math book, that is a travesty. I finally quit looking at answers in the higher chapters because I lost confidence that it would tell me the correct result. The book is terrific for what it's geared toward and, if they come out with a corrected edition, I would recommend it. However, the way it stands now, it's not acceptable for many users."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not afraid of algebra anymore!","review":"I have been dreading taking a college math class for years because I felt I had never learned algebra, and what I had learned, I'd long since forgotten. This book has undone years of fear! I've been working in the book for about a week and a half, and I'm almost a third of the way through. I feel very confident now because this stuff is acutally makes sense! Thank you, Barbara Lee Bleau!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use book to re-learn Algebra.","review":"As an adult I am going back to college, and bought this book to study and try to test out of lower level algebra classes. So far it has been very easy to re-learn everything using this book. Brief lessons explain everything very well with plenty of examples and problems to try for yourself. Most of the answers in the back of the book show their work too, so you can easily identify when and where you went wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for refreshing your skills!!","review":"I found this book perfect for refreshing algebra skills 17 years after my last math course! It brought back to mind everything I learned, and the explanations are clear and concise. Moving forward to calculus hasn't been a challenge at all now that I remember my algebra. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"would be 5* except some errors","review":"Excellent book for someone who needs to review Algebra for SAT,ACT, GMAT, and other tests. Very step by step. Easy to self-teach. Easy to follow. The only issue is that as other reviewers have pointed out, there are a few typos that take away from the learning experience.I teach ACT prep classes and I have been waiting for a new edition with the typos corrected. In the meantime, when I use this book, my notes have to suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect.","review":"I'm 31 years old, educated in Louisiana and trying to go back to College in Texas. Those were 3 strikes against me when you consider Louisiana's poor education system. This book not only taught me Algebra, it sparked my desire to learn more. I'm buying the Trig. and Calc. books next. As with others, I'm deducting 1 point for errors. You would think that Barron's would at least have an errata page in the book or on their website. However, I deeply thank them for helping me to make a better life for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"Too much information left out. Notes in the exercise reviews mention short-cuts, but do not detail the how-to's. I couldn't remember a lot of the details, short-cut's and method's. I FORGOT. Hence the attractive title, Forgotten Algebra. Maybe the author FORGOT who the implied target audience was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly forgotten","review":"I must be honest and say that I threw in the towel after working through half of this book. The many errors led me to believe that the author may have actually \\"forgotten\\" some of the math herself. That said, the book gets two stars because of the fact that it forced me to think critically and prove my work, errors and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to jog your memory but be leary of answers given. (3rd ed included)","review":"Background:I am using this book after being out of formal schools for 10 yrs now. The local college suggested it for its coverage of the subjects covered for the math placement test.Pros:Math in general was a strong suit in HS and with the help of this book it has been like riding a bike. I like the way Barbara makes the review process more challenging and covers the pertinent rules with good examples and explanations.Cons:There are too many errors in the Examples and the Exercises that really kicked me in the confidence. On the bright side, I worked 3 times as many problems that I generated myself or found online to exercise what I learned and checked all my answers.Conclusion:This book did a good job of reviewing critical rules and special cases, the lessons were clear but it was very time consuming having to double check if your answers were actually right because of a lack of confidence in the books answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disorderly presentation","review":"Even though this CD has some helpful ideas for learning French, it is put together without paying enough attention to detail. The same explanations of liasons and other pronuncation practices are repeated over and over again with different lessons. In one of the intermediate interviews (third step, Jean-Luc Sibiude), one hears the phone ring and an individual in the background swearing. This is very careless editing (or lack of it)and is not the professional quality one would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"For me, lacoste seems hit and miss. this however, is a very good scent. i had read about it here, and smelled it in real life recently. its much lighter and cleaner than i had expected. i guess the juniper [same berry they make gin with] is the cause.the price on amazon is much better than i saw. at these prices, its worth it in my opinion. 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake?","review":"I still have my 1.6oz bottle of Lacoste pour homme that I purchased from Macy's 6 years ago, and the difference between that and what I received (I got two 3.3 oz) is like night and day. The original I have from 6 years ago is strong, and wonderful smelling. I only need one spray and I can easily smell it on all parts I tagged. I tested both bottles I received against my original, and I can barely smell either of them at all even after three sprays. There's a lingering trace of what Lacoste pour homme is supposed to be, but it is so weak (like it's watered down heavily) that I am better off not wearing it at all.I contacted the seller today and if I hear back, I'll update.In the meantime, I'll check to see if Macy's is still selling it and if it still smells like it's supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle came hot!!!","review":"I just received my bottle today. I took it out of the package and it was hot! Now those of you who are picky with how you store your cologne know that you don't keep them in extremely warm places because it will dull down the fragrance. I know that after it leaves the seller that they are not responsible for what mother nature does. So I've learned a lesson today, never buy cologne over the internet during summer. Next time I'll wait for winter because colder temperatures are safe. You could even store your cologne in the fridge if you want. That's what I'm doing right now to try to see if I can salvage the scent.

But what a pleasure for the reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most In depth and critical handling on Grace","review":"This book is a must read for Christians. It is extremely well written, completely scriptural based, eye opening, liberating, and altogether life changing for me. I will never hear another sermon the same, I'll never read another scripture or book the same, I will never serve or perform another Christian duty the same. All I can say more, is you must read this book. Yes, it is some heavy theology, but it will build a foundation in your Christianity that is essential to powerful Christian living.

While the table of contents is impressive, his discussion of each topic is cursory and usually limited to a couple paragraphs of very broad and general language. The limited industry data provided is dated and the few documents that are provided, mostly arcane excel spreadsheet forms, are so specifically tailored to extremely large studio multi-picture deals as to be useless to anyone other than a major studio executive without legal counsel (unlikely) or a first-time producer of a multi-million dollar feature and a large legal budget (again, not likely ) or an accountant.

Jerry Houser and Sara Rush (Gary and Cindy) are particularly good! I've shown this film to many friends who have come to accept Christ after watching this.

I for one think its a powerful witness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good modern interpretation of classic opera","review":"I should agree that nowadays more and more composers return to retro styles and classics because almost everything has been tried and it's hard to make something new. I should also admit that it's plenty of attempts to re-make classics in order to be comfortable to ears of modern youth. That's right. But not so many of that composers, producers make a really good stuff. Aria's are that rare beauty from all other garbage.Although I can't tell you that I like Aria 2 more than Aria, it's still very good, with more melancholic notes, inlcuding very subtle guitar samples, violins, violas, cellos and, of course, electro textures.Paul Schwartz had made a very good job in this new album. But, nevertheles, I can't not to mention about the lenght of several tracks and strange to me dublication of Sviraj (lullauby)/Lullaby (Sviraj) - the same music, the same voice.Anyway, if you're into modern beats and at least a bit into classics, this music is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for people who like the show.","review":"If your used to watching the show and then you watch the movie, you'll have to get used to the differnt actors playing the parts your used to seeing on the t.v show.

While I can see how this film made such an impact, I did not find it to be a comedy, though I remembered it as being very funny when it first came out. My son did not see the humour in this movie either. I thought the treatment of women was horrific and I hope things have changed for women in the army since then.My husband who was a nurse in Viet Nam said the doctors in his unit must have taken this movie to heart since they tried to act as the doctors in MASH.

Sadly both my friend and I sat in stunned silence through the film, which was (1) not funny unless you find a man stepping on a rake and hitting himself in the face hilarious, (2) disgustingly misogynistic (from the way Hotlips was treated - first as a prude who needed to be brought down a few notches, and then as a nincompoop, to the other female characters (nurses in both the MASH unit and in Tokyo, and the prostitutes in Tokyo)), and to top it all off (3) racist and (4) anti-homosexual.Perhaps some will say I am ignoring the fact that this is a black comedy, meant to be disrespectful and brash.

The worst scene is where they mock the Last Supper during a fake suicide. Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Bored to TEARS","review":"Upon watching this awful film, I was suprised that such a dissapointment spawned such a great sitcom.First, M*A*S*H has NO plot.

Every scene, which was a fragment, was much like Vietnam itself, fragmented, something to get through one day at a time, hopefully. One then hopes they have no recollection of the day before. (I am aware that the movie takes place in Korea, but it is a social commentary on Vietnam). Another thing that strikes me is how sensitive and touched the characters are; even though they try not to feel [or convey a sense of emotionlessness] and comedy is the release for all the emotions pent up during the day. There is no other way to describe it but as a satire of survival, (emotional, mental, physical). The only thing that may have made it better would have been to include another fragment on the end. You must rent it and savor it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the war film that changed the way we look at war","review":"An unusual film that changed the way viewers looked at Vietnam, or at any war for that matter. Whether you agree with it or not, its message is still valid today in light of current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.It is interesting to note that 20th Century produced this movie while they were already working ot two other major war productions, Tora Tora Tora and Patton. Both those movies, in their very different ways, portrayed American military leaders in a positive, even heroic, light.

None of the actors were comedians 'cept for Roger Bowen (Henry Blake). The massively interwoven stories-plotline bothers me more than it delights. Donald Sutherland has been totally outclassed and outperformed by Alan Alda (Hawk on tv MASH). I find it dated, a little wrongheaded in it's anti-USmilitary views (but hey it was the late 1960's), and better than any movie since after the year 1984. I do not think this film was as improvised as one poster here thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the TV series (2.5/5)","review":"though i thought this movie was OK,in my opinion it pales in comparisonto the Television series.i have nothing against any of theactors,most of whom were just staring out or barely known at thetime,and are now well known.but,in the TV series,the actor are a better fitfor the characters.the movie isn't as clever as the TV showeither,although there are some moments of dialogue brilliance.ElliotGould and Donald Sutherland do have good chemistry together though,andthat counts for something.however,something else that really bugged mewas the opening theme song.in the series,it's all instrumental.in themovie,we get to hear the lyrics which to me,overpower the piece,andtake away its impact.plus,the words don't really make sense and theydon't fit with the melody.that may seem like a minor point,but to meit's a major faux pas.as for the movie itself,it's not horrible by anymeans.it's just no masterpiece.for me MASH (the movie)is a 2.5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I bought this movie because my fiance is addicted to the TV show. However, even though it follows the same train of thought...doctors during the Korean conflict, who don't want to be there and drink and don't follow rules etc, it lacks the charm of the TV show by far. Donald Sutherland does nothing with the Hawkeye character but make him kind of creepy. However I don't understand why in the TV show they took out characters from the movie such as \\"Duke\\"??? It is worth watching if you like the TV show because you get the contrast and you have a better understanding of how everything started for the show.

It really is not worth the money and it went back just 1 day after working with it. I am not a contractor, by the way, just a home woodworker. The drills wobble, the collar slips easily, the cut is not super clean. Frustrated, I went to big box store and bought DeWalt set of 3 countersink drills for double the price of this whole set, and all I can say is that DeWalt is worth every penny, although it seems a bit overpriced. You don't have to be a contractor to justify buying good bits over cheap stuff like this.

The maudlin sentimentality of the white and privileged writer thinking that there is something cheery about the light seeping between the logs of the the black tenents' cabins without any regard for the fact that that means that there is no protection from the weather, or his jocular descriptions of the constant verbal threats and abuse bestowed on bowing and scraping servants in a part of the country where lynchings were not uncommon just set my teeth on edge.

Unfortunately, after releasing the trigger, the glue continues to flow from the tip. Some drip is typical of most glue guns however, this gun really releases a lot of extra glue. (I've posted the red pictures above to illustrate this.) At first, I thought perhaps it was the glue stick or the temperature setting, but three different brands yielded the same \\"super-drip\\" at either heat setting.

Put something under it before you turn it on and use it until it's cooled off unless you don't mind hot glue on surfaces you can't or wouldn't easily throw away. That didn't make or break the product for me, but it has to be said because their description is misleading, to say the least.It comes with different nozzles, has two heat settings, stands on it's own fine and the kickstand works well. A built in on switch so it doesn't have to be unplugged to shut if off is nice. It's got a work light, but I think it would have been better to position it over the glue coming out, rather than below it, unless you work with the side of the gun facing you. A red and green light tell you when the temp is optimal. Overall, I'm happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I give this a 2 star rating because, the light at the tip is a great feature and the glue gun is comfortable in your hand. The main problem is that this glue gun uses more glue after you use it than when your using it. IT DRIPS GLUE LIKE NO OTHER.

In my opinion the KA Heavy Duty is better built and I noticed they weighed about the same. The bowl in the 600 rocked around from the force. As I added flour the mixer would stall. The 600 ended up taking more time to make the same amount of dough. I finally realized it would be best to send it back and now have my old \\"stand\\" by back in its place.

I got an unbelievable price via Amazon promotion, but it's just too big for my kitchen. My first use involved the veggie shredder and it felt like the shaft of the shredder was bending as I applied pressure to the potato.

It might have the power but it does not have the cooling capacity to cool the motor.When I called Kitchenaid customer support they told me that I would have to pay for a metal housing replacement and I would have to send the mixer in to have it replaced.If you are stuck with one of these lemons you can get a metal transmission housing from: buy it now 64 store It is easy to replace.I am working on a solution for the cooling issue.Kitchenaid products are not what they use to be and neither is their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't handle bread dough","review":"Returned the mixer as it couldn't handle six cups of flour for a bread recipe.

The gears have gone on this one, just like the first one and the second one the plastic housing broke. This one also has a plastic housing but a little more substantial.They work great when they work but they don't last that long.

However, after cheaper mixers and burning out hand mixers, I decided it was time for something better. We talked it over and decided to go with the KitchenAid Professional 600 Series Stand Mixer, Nickel Pearl. This mixer will do whatever mixing job you ask of it! I haven't really gotten into extra attachments, but I feel sure that I'll be adding an extra bowl and flat beater because I do sometimes have to wash them while preparing a recipe so that I can use them again. I do not begrudge the money spent on this mixer. . . it was money well spent! I would highly recommend this mixer to anyone who does much in their kitchen!

It is not supposed to be a refurbished mixer.( I just ordered it from amazon)I must fax them a copy of the shipping invoice before they send me a new machine.

If you have an attachment on and you want to remove the bowl, it can become very messy, not enough room to get bowl off if it has stuff in it. Also, much LOUDER than other Kitchenaid mixers of this same type, I am assuming that is why it was on a special deal, becuase it is very LOUD.A bit disappointed, not sure I will buy a special deal again, with the experience I have had.

The first I used to make bread almost exclusively and never, never, never used it at speed 2. Always at 4 or more. However, the other one had the plastic gear box and had been repaired several times for other problems until the gear box split and the gears seized up. I must say, Mixing dough at a higher speed gave better crumb to the bread, but that dough was usually more hydrated than your basic white-bread-in-a-pan recipe. The newer dough hook isn't as efficient with wetter doughs. It grabs the top half of the dough mixes it and rides over the bottom half, never quite engaging the whole mass. The old hook works better with wetter doughs. It grabs hold of the dough and turns it fine. Still, the mixing at speed 2 is not as good as I remember it with my previous mixer. I'm still playing with mixing times and will have to try each and every one of my bread recipes to see if Speed 2 can be accommodated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Mixer","review":"I bought this mixer for my wife for Christmas 2010.

I've had to change to 4c white & 2 c wheat because the mixer couldn't handle it. Since then, I've had to take it in two more times & have boon told by the repair tech. to either get a new mixer (he doesn't ever recommend this mixer!) the 5qt one, or quit making bread.

I am glad Ididn't have to pay the cost they are asking for this piece of junk.I wish someone would have warned me in the reviews, but it seems no one does merangues with theirsI suppose.

The machine is a little louder than the old Kitchenaid but is acceptable. I make bread at least once a week and one of my first batches I made a little larger. The machine had absolutely no problem working the dough. The only problem I had was that there was not enough room in the oven for the number of loaves I made. I've made pizza dough and pie dough and I ended up with delicious dough. I especially like the dough hook because the dough doesn't seem to climb up the hook like my old version. Anyway, it was a great purchase and I wished I would have purchased two for my holiday baking marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Great product, just like the wife uses at Chef school. If you make bread, you'lll love it as it's very heavy duty and doesn't strain or overheat.

I think it has good power and does a good job of mixing things up. The one small regret I have is that the head does not tilt back on it. You have to lower the bowl to add ingredients and I just find it to not be as easy as my old one where the head tilted back. This one is way more powerful then my old one though, so I can live without the tilting head. I'm sure once I have gotten use to it, I will be happier with it.

It seems to mix good though & I bought it for about $250 with a $40 rebate (yet to be seen). So, for around $200, I don't think you can go wrong.

I had an old model of a different type before this. I cannot tell you how much easier this is to use. I love how easy it is to change the different mixing devices. I love the deep bowel that is securely fastened in place. I have made bread recipes and mixed different mixes in it. I love the different speeds and how it slowly goes up in strength instead of just 2 or three settings. I have given it a bread recipe with 8 cups of flour and it has no problems at all kneading it.

The new mixer is not exactly quiet either, but haven't used it yet, just turned it on to see how it sounded.

This time, I got speed control #3through Amazon.com for U$ 38.00.The electronic on this mixer is made from the cheapest components money can buy; it seems to degrade slowly by itself even if it isn't being used.....It is a far cry from the rugged unit KitchenAid is marketing.

Which you'll find in your cakebatter after your cake is baked.So I would nog recommend the kitchenaid 6Q. Instead go for the kenwood. You'll pay a bit more but it will be worth it.

I can make so many recipes without risk of splash or spill over. It is a beefy machine and is just an inch too tall to fit on my kitchen counter tucked under the cabinets.One thing I miss about my 4.5qt machine is the tilt-head. The tilt-head allows me to lift the beater out of the bowl yet contain the drips that come off the beater. The 6qt design one lowers the bowl rather than lifting the head and there isn't enough clearance with the lowered bowl to easily remove the beater without disturbing the contents of the bowl. This is the only reason I'm giving this product a rating of 4 stars rather than 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchenaid stand mixer","review":"works great, saves me more time to do other things, Makeing bread is easy, Whips out cakes like nothing.

Classic Stand Mixer. i gave it 4 stars for two reasons; one, i do not like that you cannot take the bowl out without taking the mixing attachment off also. Not a issue with the tilt head. Unfortunately they do not make a tilt head model with a 6 qt bowl. and Two, i guess i was too used to the solid state drive of the older model. the delayed take off of this model leaves a little to be desired. Overall, it is a pretty solid mixer with what seems to be enough power to make my over-sized cinnamon roll dough. So far, the quality is what i would expect from a KitchenAidas a word of caution, i was unable to find a way to let amazon know my concerns about the shipping.

Same model is used in most restaurant and hotel kitchens (I'm a professional chef so I know). I've only used it to make bread dough so far and it has worked like a champ. I wish that they would make an attachment so that it would work with a smaller (like a 3 quart) bowl. There are many times that this mixer will be overkill for the home cook.

I used my Kitchen aid almost daily-- I did not misuse it. I made a lot of bread and other things. After 1 1/2 years the gears have gone out on my Kitchen Aid.

It was replaced but broke the 2nd time after the warranty was up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't handle heavy duty bread dough","review":"I have used this machine to make some twenty loaves of bread over six months. It stuggled with the very first loaf. The machine died in the middle of mixing bagel dough, probably with stripped gears. The machine is outrageously noisey at any speed even with nothing in the bowls. It is a very pricy machine that is not worth a quarter of the price.

I used it so long that the carbons had to be replaced. In those years I had only one repair--of an electrical part connected to the switch. I bought this new \\"professional\\" model because my many attachments for the old mixer will fit the new. Shortly after I got the new mixer I had to return it for replacement. The gears failed. Now after a year of so of intermittent but serious use (nothing that would have strained my old mixer), the gears make a loud click every so many revolutions. Many cookbooks (Julia Child, etc.) recommend speed 4 for bread dough, but the new kitchenaid recommends speed one or 2--a sign, I believe of lesser quality. I'm disappointed, but feel somewhat trapped by all the attachments I have that will work only with kitchenaid. If I were young and buying a mixer, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A symbol of quality no more","review":"My wife has a KitchenAid UltaPower mixer that she bought 12 years ago. It is great, but she wanted more power & speed so we ordered this one. 15 minutes out of the carton and we packed it back up. This mixer is much larger and more powerful but feels lighter that the Ultrapower model and even unstable. The standard attachements are much lower quality. They feel like attachments for a toy mixer. Also, just the overall look and feel of the mixer feels like it was cheaply made. For example, raising and lowering the bowl is isn't smooth. It doesn't move over the rail like it should. The bowl itself also looked very poorly made and even had some small dents. This is still probably a good mixer, but it is not the symbol of quality these mixers were.

When it finally gave up the ghost in early December I replaced it with a Professional 600, which was supposed to be able to manage 14 cups of flour at a time.We have now returned 5 (count 'em FIVE) of these very expensive and beautiful machines because not one of them could knead two loaves of bread. They all froze almost immediately -- we took them out of the box, loaded them up and they quit.

I have to constantly stop mixing to scrape the sides of the bowl. Eggs meld in the middle around the mixing utensil so I have to scrape them off and mix with spoon then turn the machine on again.

This is suppose to be a professional model, it's really just a large home appliance. It's not built like the truck they used to be. This isn't a highly used machine, maybe once every other month.

Unfortunately, it did not fit on my countertop due to the overhead cabinets, so I placed it on a rollaway island I have in the kitchen. I had my doubts about it being too big. I only planned to use it for simple recipes and average quantities (3-4 dozen cookies, 1-2 loaves of bread). After my first use though, I was very happy with the buy! Now preparing recipes is so much quicker and easier than hand mixing everything. The large stainless steel bowl suits average recipes just fine and is very easy to clean up.

But y'know what really ticked me off? In discussing bad machines, they use the phrase \\"failed\\" mixer. In quotes. Like it's not really broken, the customer is just an idiot. Like I can't tell whether it's working or not. Like I can't read the instructions and make the adjustment as indicted. I am not an idiot and I don't appreciate being insulted.

Contrary to what Kitchen Aid claims the Artisan struggled to handle kneading 2 loaves of dough (which is what most standard recipes produce). About that time Amazon had the Professional class mixer (575 watt) in the merangue color on sale for less than we paid for the Artisan. So the Artisan quickly got returned and we purchased the professional. So far I've made about 20 batches of bread (40 loaves) and it does a great job kneading it. The Artisan motor would get over stressed and lock up, the professional just powers on through. You do always want to make sure you're not kneading over dry mixture, you want the dough to stick to the bottom of the bowl but not the sides and fold when the kneading hook works it. Great purchase so far, thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional 600 series KitchenAid is awsome","review":"I absolutely love my mixer!!!

Rewarding but back-breaking work. Somewhat skeptical, I got the mixer to try over the holidays!! Wow--it can make perfect dough (with the dough hook) 10 times faster than I do!! Furthermore, the resulting dough is clearly superior to hand made dough in consistency and resilience.Speaking of motor capacity, I tried 8 cups of flour once (fyi, the capacity is 14 cups), and the motor remained cold, so I guess I can do larger batches. Thoughly impressed in all aspects of the mixer (including the price at Amazon).Also bought the pasta attachment set (roller and cutters); while the 3-piece set is arguably somewhat expensive ($150), they are sturdy and work the way they are supposed to work.Very happy with the purchase, and hope this mixer will continue to live up to its name for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as my 1994 5 qt mixer, only bigger","review":"Power to spare with the Kitchen Aid quality I had expected.

Their product support is horrendous. I will never pay a single dollar to a company that hides behind its mistakes and refuses to acknowledge the problem that it obviously knows about. It would have been so easy to make me a happy customer...but even refusing to sell parts that are poorly designed in inexcusable.

Returning to Amazon was easy and efficient as always. The mixer was obviously poor quality and as usual KitchenAid's service was terrible. I will never buy another product from KitchenAid again.

After using my sister's exact model, I thought I had no need to review the the instructions. Being that it's such a swanky little machine at a swanky little price, I assumed that I can put the beater in my dishwasher. Being that I can put my $60 mixer parts in the dishwasher, I assumed that the $400 would practically wash itself!!! I know, I'm at fault for assuming, but really Kitchenaid? I researched and realized that the beaters for the smaller models have the capability to be put in the dishwasher! #fail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious baking!","review":"I read all the reviews but thought I would take a chance because I loved my previous mixer, the 4 1/2 quart Ultra Power KitchenAid mixer. I upgraded thinking I could make a bigger batch of bread, but this one can only handle 2 loaves of wheat bread. Even so, it is not as well built as my previous model and cannot handle the work. This mixer might be okay if you don't bake bread and only use it for occasional muffins, cakes, etc. I am on my 2nd replacement (yes 3rd mixer of this model) in 2 years. KitchenAid's customer service is still great but the quality is not what it used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for a great product","review":"This is my third and final Kitchenaid mixer.

It chews through mashed potatoes and cookie dough like a pack of piranha on a wounded gazelle. This kitchenAid monstrosity was an upgrade from the tilt-up smaller version for me and worth every single penny. Not to say that the smaller one did not serve me well, but with 4 people in my family, it was either upgrade the mixer to make more bread, cookies and potatoes or unleash a small cannibal horde upon the unknowing masses. All in all a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Limited Warranty","review":"We owned the KitchenAid Professional 600 mixer for a few years and use it maybe twice a month...the point is we haven't over used it. The mixer stopped working and we called KitchenAid and they couldn't help. Apparently, the warranty is only one year and there are no service centers within 300 miles of the 4th largest city in the country. They said they could have us mail it a service center for repair....who knows what that is going to cost!! I would have expected something like this to last a life time. My mother-in-law's kitchenAid stand mixer lasted for years. Apparently their quality has declined.Our next stand mixer will be another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after just 10 uses.","review":"Wish I had read all of the reviews on this before purchasing. I was enticed into paying extra for the \\"professional\\" series with the expectation of more power, better components, etc. We've only used it 10 times over the last 2-3 years and it now doesn't have the torque to mix anything but air. Of course it's out of warranty. Customer service was friendly but not helpful. Referred me to a few service centers. I don't believe in the KA name anymore. For the cost of shipping, diagnostic and repair, I'll just buy a cheaper mixer. It will probably last just as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really professional","review":"I purchased this mixer because it was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated. It is so noisy I could only use it when my family was not nearby. Under light household use the powerful motor overpowered the cast head, breaking off a piece critical to the gearing. The company refused to stand behind the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The real measure of a mixer's strength isn't what it can deal with once, it's what it can deal with day-to-day. And these modern kitchenaid mixers simply can't put up with regular use in any real way. I bought one of the cheap Artisan series mixers and used it to make bread (2-3 loaves/week) for nearly two years, at which point it broke under the strain. Then I bought this model under the idea that it's 14-cup \\"flour power\\" would be more than enough to handle making single loaves of bread with only 2-3 cups of flour. Boy was I wrong. This model has broken under the strain in only 7 months, and I've even been using it significantly less than I did the Artisan.If you want/need a kitchenaid mixer for light duty things like cookies, cakes, whipping egg whites, or the wide array of attachments you can put on them, then go and buy one of the cheaper models. If you want a mixer that will hold up to the \\"strain\\" of baking a loaf of bread each week, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"This was maybe used 5 times in a year. It stops working three days past warranty. Kitchen Aid will do \\"a one time courtesy\\" and replace it with a refurbished one. That's lame and so is this Pro 600 mixer for not lasting at all.

The favorite thus far is whole wheat pizza crust. This mixer works like a charm! It's sleek, easy to clean, and Amazon shipping dazzled again. This mixer is a definite foodie must-have, and a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Beater AND Kitchenaid Helpline","review":"It's nice to have Kitchenaid. They are easy to use and they make baking a cake easy. With this specific unit, though, you have to beware of the attachments. They are covered in a substance that comes off in your food. I have had to dispose of quite a few batters because flecks of the \\"protective coating\\" have come off while I was mixing. To add insult, Kitchenaid assured me that they would send me another paddle, but didn't. I waited over two weeks and when I called them back, they disputed the fact that it was their product at fault. I think if you pay $360 for a product, you should be able to use it without purchasing another item to make it work properly. For that amount of money, my paddle should work! I am not a fan of Kitchenaid helpline. Don't trust them, always follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd bought one decades ago!","review":"FINALLY purchased a stand mixer with a 3 piece pasta attachment kit and I am pleased. I hesitated always because of price, how much space it would take up and how to decide on the size of machine. I have a small kitchen and always talked myself out of it until my remodel. Now with more storage space I splurged and bought a big one. My only complaint WOULD have been that it may not work as well on a small batch of dough as a smaller bowl would and then I found out today I can purchase a 3 qt bowl and whip to use as well! I'm thrilled and wish I'd purchased this years ago. I used the sheet roller pasta attachment for ravioli and it was fun and not too hard. However, don't do as the instruction book says - it suggests that you roll to 4 or 5. That is way too thick for ravioli, so do roll it to the thinnest for ravioli. Downside: really big and really heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixer, some set up required","review":"It has the Horse Power to mix some tough dough and large amounts of cheese spread.

KitchenAid ran out of the refurbished to replace my broken one and sent me a brand new pro 600 instead. That was beyond my expectations so return policy/customer service is great. But in 1 1/2 years, I had to return four (4) of these supposedly top of the line, professional duty. This machine CANNOT support bread making for very long. Like previous negative reviews, I think the plastic housing for the gears is the main problem. Needless to say, my original 4 qt classic mixer tolerated 13 years of constant bread making (and still going), but this heavy duty can barely make it into the 5th month. Its fine if it breaks within the warrantee time period, but if it waits until the year is over, you the buyer is out of luck.I'm really disappointed...I'd edit the stars to three if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gonna wash it","review":"After much drooling and review reading, I finally settled for the Pro 600 KitchenAid. I knew that this machine has sometimes bogged down so I wanted to give it a good test. I decided to try a double batch of a sweet bread dough requiring 10 cups of sugar (well below the 'Flour power' for this model) It started mixing and things were going well... until it stopped. It did not seem to labour, it just stopped. Over heated I guess. So I ended up finishing up by hand...I'll return it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this item. This was a Christmas gift for my wife and wish it would have not been defective. I wanted to return it and get a new one but Amazon did not have this option.

It died while making cookie dough. This is my second 600-series mixer; Kitchenaid (to their credit) swapped out the first under warranty after it started behaving erratically.The primary use of this mixer is to make 4 loaves of bread/week. I never expected miracles: bread flour is hard to knead and I'm careful about kneading times and quantities. This is not a professional machine, it's a home appliance. Nevertheless, it died after only a moderate amount of careful use.So, I have reluctantly come to agree with the Kitchenaid bashers here. Based on my experience, the current crop of mixers is not high quality and my next mixer will not be Kitchenaid, sorry to say.It's sad to watch an iconic brand destroy its reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your pennies for a better mixer","review":"My wife bought me this mixer as a Christmas present. It was to be an upgrade from my trusty old 4.5 quart KitchenAid mixer I've had for almost twenty years.

The new \\"pro\\" model can't even make it through two before switching off from overheating. Also it gives off an odor half way through the first batch. The recipe I use is from an old issue of Cook Illustrated, in the article they state they use a KitchenAid mixer.

I choose this model because of all the good reviews and I wanted the spiral hook for making dough :) As for the people complaining about the machine not be able to handle large batches of dough, this is not an industrial mixing machine, get over it. I can easily make 2-3 batches of dough at a time, which is more pizza dough or bread than my family can eat at once(or a few days). You are able to make more dough than that, but for my needs I do not. I have not tried any attachments yet. This is a wonderful machine.

I was sick about it, and called the Kitchen Aid number that is right on the mixer. I told them what happened... they sent me out a new mixer immediately!

I was deciding between a few brands (KitchenAid, DeLonghi, Viking). I chose the KitchenAid for its value, durability, and great reviews. Seeing it in several bakeries sealed the deal for me.This was my first stand mixer. One of the smartest purchases I've made. I love it. I love it. I love it. It's powerful, easy to clean, and very easy to operate. I've only owned it for a few months. So far I've used it for for mixing cake batters, cookie batters, and buttercreams. I've yet to use it for heavier batters such as bread. It's stood the test for mixing a large amount of cookie batters.Contrary to other reviews, I think it's very quiet.

It ran at this speed for 2 seconds and then just quit, it does nothing if I turn the speed up higher. If I turn it back off and then back to the \\"stir\\" setting it does the same thing.

I've used it for almost 6 years now and it works just as great today as it did when I first got it. It can handle double batches of cookie dough and the dough hook works great for kneading bread dough. My only complaint is that the metal attachments (flat beater, dough hook) are made out of a metal that can't go in the dishwasher. If you do put them in the dishwasher the dishwasher soap sticks to them (even if you use liquid soap, it crystallizes on the metal and you end up having to wash by hand). You can buy the attachments in the typical coated version separately, (I haven't done that as of yet, as the ones I have work) it's just an annoyance that you can't wash them in the dishwasher when the bowl can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I am in the beginning stages of Rheumatoid Arthritis and have no strength in my hands.

I'm not a bread maker per se, but that's one of the reasons I wanted to get this mixer; so I could start. So far though it's worked really well for cakes, etc. It's not the greatest if you have a really small amount of something to mix because the bowl is so big, but for larger quantities it's wonderful. I did have to adjust the bowl height after I recieved it, but if you follow the very easy instructions, it's a cinch. I also bought the ice cream maker attachment and love it!

I have used it a couple of times and am very happy with the performance. It will take some time to get used to the bowl lift, but I am sure after a few more times of using it, it won't be a problem.

I didn't feel like the wire whip was close enough to the bowl to get all the ingredients mixed/whipped together. I did read the instructions about the adjusting screw but could not tell that the whip even moved.

My wife and I have waited for a while to make this purchase because these mixers are fairly expensive for our budget. We are glad we finally purchased this mixer because it saves lots of time and energy. We have used it to make cakes, cookies, bread, mashed potatoes, and other items. One feature that I wish this mixer did have is the ablity to lift up the top of the mixer (like an arm) as opposed to lowering the bowl (some newer mixers have this feature). It is not difficult to lower the bowl, however. All in all, great product (at least in the limited time we have had it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid XP26M1XMR Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer","review":"This mixer has got to be the best. We have owned one for several years now and it is great to use for everything you do in the kitchen. You can even use it on the counter under the overhead cabinets as the bowl itself raises and lowers, rather than the top tilting upward. We love and use it on a regular basis so much , we purchased this one as a gift for our daughter. We purchased this one at a much lower price on Amazon.com than we paid for ours. What a deal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowl Lift Model is very tall!","review":"I can't believe the price I got for this mixer... I could've even avoided shipping costs if I hadn't waited 'til too close to Christmas.This is a fantastic machine. One caution... The bowl lift models are much taller than the other style. Our kitchen cabinets are mounted about 1/4\\" too low for this to fit under our cabinets. That's disappointing. I wish I would've thought to check the height, though I think I might have still chosen this model. The color Meringue is a very nice color. Virtually white, but with almost a pearlized matte finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I bought this model because it had more power than entry level models. It is well-built and works great. I purchased the grinder attachment, and was able to dispatch about 8 pounds of sirloin tip for chili, and the machine never broke a sweat. If there is a downside to this model, it would probably be that the bowl lifts rather than tilts - as it does in the entry models. As a result, the bowl either needs to be filled before the mixing attachment is inserted, or the bowl needs to be filled from the outside after the mixing attachment is connected. Either way, it is probably more messy than just tilting the mixer head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and service!!!!!!","review":"Aside from KitchenAid being a superb product, the shopping experience provided by Amazon.com was customer friendly!

The Kitchenaid box was in great condition and I had no worries about anything being damaged.The mixed is tall though! It doesn't quite fit on our countertop because of the upper cabinet trim being in the way. You might want to check the height before purchasing. I'm sure that we'll find a way to make it work though, it's an impressive machine.I was a little concerned with getting the \\"Meringue\\" color because I couldn't find much information on it.

It will shut off whenever anything hot is being mixed - like mashed potatoes! Steam makes the mixer shut down and renders it useless! (Just what you want when you've got everyone sitting down to dinner.) Upon talking with Customer Service, they informed me that this was a \\"Feature\\" of the higher models. I would have never paid extra money for this \\"Feature\\". Instead, I'd call this a total Design Flaw! My mixer is 4 months old. Kitchen Aid Customer Service informed me that it is working properly, and they will do nothing. They have no Customer Satisfaction policy, and will not allow me to trade in this model for a lower model without this added \\"Feature\\".

Since then I've made baguettes, double batch of pizza dough, and bagels twice. The second batch of bagels was about 7 cups of bread flour / 3 cups of water / 1/2 cup of preferment or about 4 1/2 lbs (2 kilos) of finished dough, enough for 2 dozen large bagels and the Pro 600 handled it with ease. I have found that 4 or 5 minutes at speed 2 with the spiral dough hook is about equal to 15 minutes of kneading by hand (and at 6'4\\" and 280 lbs when I knead I bring the pain!). My Pro 600 is Nickel Pearl which is not a stainless silver but more of a silver-white hot hod looking color.

In addition, it had someone's name scrawled all over it. They offered to let me keep it while also giving me a $100 credit. This would have been fine... except for the fact that the older, USED model they sent me isn't worth what I paid for for the UN-used NEWER model which is over $300 more than what they sent me, even if they threw in the $100!

The faucet doesn't leak at all, which was my main concern since I'll be using it mostly inside. I've steamed lobsters and clams and both types of seafood came out fine. I did 4 lobsters (1.25 lb softshells) and I think I could have fit a couple more in without much trouble.No dents or dings from shipping - the pot was packaged up pretty well by GraniteWare and Amazon put their box in a box with paper padding. A bit too much packaging for the environmentalist in me, but it did the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"factory damage","review":"The steamer arrive with a large dent.

So much of the video is spent either inside the boats (technical-type stuff, which went right over my son's head) or with Dave/Becky goofing around (which I found particularly excessive in this video). I think he would have preferred some speedboats or more \\"out and about on the water\\" scenes.

I came out of the theatre absolutely amazed that I had never even so much as heard about it before.This film is best described a documentary with some great music footage. It's a not a music film. Those who see it expecting mostly music footage may be disappointed. However, director Mel Stuart skillfully weaves interviews with locals from Watts and some comic relief from Richard Pryor throughout the concert footage to make for a riveting film.Highlights are The Emotions' spectacular take on 'Peace, Be Still', Rufus Thomas' 'Breakdown/Funky Chicken', Luther Ingrams' 'If Loving You Is Wrong' and Pryor's take on African Americans in the U.S.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WATTSTAX 30TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION","review":"The DVD was good.

The crib was easy to assemble - in fact its easy to adjust too. I just lowered the mattress the other month as my daughter became much more mobile. As for the bumper issues some have had, you won't have any issues at all with some of Wendy Bellissimo's nursery collections. Since all her bumpers are plush, with just a little support they can stand up on their own; I just tied the ties I wasn't using tightly behind the bumper along the back so that there wouldn't be a strangulation hazzard, tied the bumper to either end, and I haven't had any issues at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CRIB IS DANGEROUS!

We wanted this crib (I wanted it) b/c it is lifelong, but for the next couple/several years, it will be miserable!! I can't fault the toy companies, b/c the straps are pretty long, but almost NOTHING fits on the sides or front of this crib (we won't even mention the back), like mobiles, play light sleepers, etc. Your bumper won't tie on the back, either, and you had better make sure the bumper strings are at LEAST 6 INCHES or they won't tie on the corners.

Had Kapuscinski hailed from the USA or perhaps a more affluent European nation, rather than his native Poland, he would surely have won a Pulitzer by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Kundera in the Third World","review":"I just finished The Soccer War and thoroughly enjoyed it. Like 18th century novelists and Milan Kundera, Kapuscinski rambles where he pleases and you enjoy every minute of it. A reporter for the Polish press during the cold war, his essays cover Africa, Central and South America, and the Middle East during political upheaval and revolutions. His viewpoint and humor are, for me, very reminiscent of Kundera, had he roamed the third world countries. Don't miss this delightful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reporter and an artist","review":"Those who are truly interested in what our world is all about and would like to get profound insights into other cultures don't waste their time on the pulp spewed daily by the popular media. Books and essays by Ryszard Kapuscinski constitute a needed antidote.A Polish reporter whose literary skills have been compared to those of G. Greene and E. Hemingway, Kapuscinski is the only writer I know who has consistently managed to capture the essence of the geo-political realities, misunderstood conflicts, and non-Western mentalities - in all of their complexity - so accurately, with such poetry, and in so few words. \\"The Soccer War\\" is a favorite of mine.

The recordings with Zero 7 and this album just don't even come close to doing her voice justice. She just blew the roof off. She doesn't need a mike. Her voice could fill a concert hall. Some of the reviewers below compare her to Tori Amos, etc. If they could only hear Sia live, they'd really know how original and distinct her voice is. I can honestly say I've never heard anyone sing with such power and raw emotion. Kind of like a Brenda Lee belt with a Billy Holiday vulnerability. My advice: play it loud because she sings live with such power. It's the closest thing to hearing her live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, acoustic-esque style with hints of Dido and jazz/blues overtones","review":"Very satisfying purchase. \\"Colour the Small One\\" has a simple, near-acoustic rock style which, along with Sia's vocals, are reminiscent of Dido's \\"Life for Rent\\" and include many jazz and blues overtones. Guitar, brass instruments, synth organ, and even the xylophone are tastefully blended with both fast and slow percussion in amounts that are often quite complex, yet carefully avoid the \\"noise rock\\" effect. Unlike Dido, the lyrical content avoids any edgy or potentially offensive territory, making this album safe for any casual listening audience. Presently lingering near the top of my playlist rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love!!!","review":"Being a fan of Zero 7 I thought her voice was the best of all of the guest vocals on their albums. I purchased this album solely on her voice. I have alwys thought her voice was so seductive but I didn't know how her music would sound, but was suprised at how well she has done. Looking at the liner notes this was a big production and it shows up in all her songs. I listened a couple of times and seem enjoy it more each time. There's a couple throw away songs that don't really go with the rest of the album, but that doesn't hurt it too much That's key to a good cd. If you are a fan of Zero 7 you will like this. The Ulrich Schnauss remix of Breath Me is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Much as I tried to like this cd, there are really only about 2 or 3 songs that are worthy in my opinion. I was turned on to this one because I heard \\"Breathe Me\\" on the finale of \\"Six Feet Under\\". Coupled with the exiting montage it was an excellent choice and I do like the song by itself, but the rest of this album just isn't as interesting. The repetitive lyrics make it downright irritating to listen to, and if you're gonna repeat the same line 16 times you really better be able to sing the heck out of it. Sia just doesn't pull of the gospelly thing; she exudes a forced soulfulness. The album is just a little too drowsy for my tastes as well. I expected more of a sonic treat, with cooler samples and more ambience than brood, but it instead fell a little flat. At this import price too, it's hard to justify."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't offer it for sale if it's not available.....","review":"I ordered this CD, then received notice that it was not available and no additional copies would be arriving.

I am a big fan of \\"Bird by Bird\\" and had very high expectations. I was very annoyed by this book and wish I had not ignored the one unfavorable review. The characters all sounded like Lamott herself and many of the witticisms came off as just sounding as if she was trying to be clever. Pointless reading unless you just happen to be from a perfectly functional family that is dealing with cancer!

She can be brutally honest and hilarious all at the same time. That she could bring that quality to the nightmarish experience of watching a loved one battle cancer -- something all too many of us know about firsthand -- sets this book apart. One of the previous reviewers found this book \\"distasteful.\\" Well, there is nothing tasteful about cancer and the way it shatters one's way of life. I know of no other book that touches on the confusion and the anguish and the humanity of that experience like this one does.

Although I wanted so much to get to know the characters and enter in to their life, I couldn't get past their lack of nobility and/or dignity with the way they chose to live. And for a grown woman to have such a close relationship with a young girl in this novel? Totally inappropriate, especially in these fragile times.I work with college students and I want them to be inspired, championed, held accountable and victorious over the imperfection that life throws their way. I hated seeing life through the lens of this book; I don't know anyone like the characters in Hard Laughter in the 17 years I have worked in academia, and I hope I never do. It is one thing to write with raw authenticity that propels the reader to live with dignity, and something entirely different to read human mistake after human mistake after human mistake and never change the course of their trajectory.

Given that this album was really a Squire/Sherwood collaboration, this isn't surprising; however, some of the material is just awful. \\"Man in the Moon\\" makes my skin crawl, and the seriously insipid lyrics of \\"No way we can lose\\" are just intolerable.

The album is a travesty of poor arranging, uninspired songs and added contribuions by Howe and Anderson far too late to save this from being a weak album. To me Yes im[loded in 1979 and have never got near former glories, even 90125 was an ok album saved by OOALH itself a riposte to Heat Of The Moment by ASIA. I've seen Yes severtal times, Anderson is rigfht to retire, the 35th Anniversary tour showed time has caught up with them, particularly Howe who hit so many bum notes at the Brighton Magnification show it was sad.

Try listening for the melody on any song (except the title track, which does carry quite well)--the subtle complexities they're known for are missing.Yes' trademarks--and the reason most pieces are still relevant today--are songs that build, that drive emotion, that leave you wanting for more.

Unlike '90125', the pop-oriented song writing on this release is exceptionally poor, and sounds completely uninspired. If you want to listen to well written pop rock, you won't find it here (check out Dave Matthews Band, Sting or something else). If you want to listen to prog-rock, right band, wrong album!On one level, I felt this was like Yes' answer to Jethro Tull's 'Under Wraps', not in term of musical style, but in term of final effect on the listener!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They should've taken the advice of the album title...","review":"...and realized that this album is basically a mess. Written and recorded primarily by Chris Squire and Billy Sherwood, Open Your Eyes shows a confused group haphazardly making an album in order to go on tour and hoping that the music finds an audience. I rarely criticize Yes albums too harshly but nearly three years since I first heard it, it's a challenge to listen to the whole thing all the way through. There are a few good songs (\\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Universal Garden\\") and some good musical passages (bass line to \\"Fortune Seller\\") but there are more than a few out-and-out duds on this album. My two star review is being generous. An album for completists only or fans of 80's AOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is rubbish! Zero Stars","review":"Yes have tried to write a 1980s AOR radio friendly CD about 15 years to late. This is not progressive rock, nor is it good mainstream pop. As mainstream pop it is equally a failure. There is nothing here of currency whatsoever and shows no awareness of current popular music trends.As usual the playing is solid but that is of no consequence when the song writing is pitiful, the arrangements are dull and the direction of the song is so painfully out of touch with everything.Yes as a useful musical entity emitted their last breath of high quality music a long time ago. Living up to their own heritage will forever be difficult. By persisting with recording feeble, weak and pointless new material they devalue their overall artistic worth as a whole.Yes should disband permanently. Give up, it's over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major mistake","review":"This album was an obvious attempt to get some radio airplay and it finds Yes playing some eighties-like commercial rock. It makes you wonder if these guys are even aware of what's commercial nowadays. This is a pointless collection of bad pop songs unworthy of the name Yes. You even wonder if Steve Howe is playing on this album. The songs were mostly written by bassist Chris Squire and new member Billy Sherwood, with Anderson adding his voice later on. A lifeless, overproduced mess, this is exactly the kind of stupid move that has characterized Yes since the late 80's. No wonder they've lost so many fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES DEBUT THEIR \\"NEW STATE OF MIND\\" TO IMPRESSIVE RESULTS!","review":"This album has it all! The memorable melodies of \\"Time and a Word\\". The angular lurch of \\"Big Generator\\". The lovable quirkiness of \\"Drama\\". The spirited optimism and broad sound palette of \\"Going for the One\\". The mildly moody aggression and bold strokes of \\"Fragile\\", in it's darker moments. The crisp production and tight ensemble performances of \\"90125\\". ALL THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS ARE IN PLACE! Sound familiar? It's true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of their best","review":"Not as slick, safe and predictable as the worst of their 80's music nor as contrived and longwinded as the worst of their 70's. And it could use more rocking instrumental jams and fewer neohippy vocals. But this is definitely top drawer Yes with the guys sounding consistenly inspired. There are aural experiments and dreamlike soundscapes of energy and vision. And there's a bonus track consisting of about 15 minutes of chimes, nature sounds and brief vocals that create a cool ambiance.It's unfortunate that old bands can't get any airplay for their new music but at least there's no chance of any track being overplayed ad nauseum on the radio. So if you are open to new Yes music that doesn't sound exactly like their old hits, you may be equally surprised by how good Open Your Eyes sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"At crossroads again...","review":"The first post-Rabin studio album,found Yes in a creative crisis of some sort,very much evident here.Gone are the fantastic interplay of the past,or even the harder edge of the eighties. There are far too few inspired moments,and too much confusion regarding the style,putting their music in a creative limbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money..get The Ladder instead","review":"This was such a disappointing album that I really was afraid I had lost my beloved Yes, whom I have followed for 30 years. But then, BANG! The Ladder came out. Thank GOD, Yes is still here. It is truly amazing that the same group of guys can, after 30 years, produce one of their worst albums and then recover, and on the very next album, give us one of their best. You may want to buy both just to compare them. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Your Eyes...But Cover Your Ears","review":"This has to be the WORST Yes album to date. After Union and Talk I had lost faith in Yes being able to actually come with anything interesting anymore. But then Keys I and II came out and while the new studio material on Keys I was not that great, Keys II offered up the strongest Yes material since Big Generator and 90125.This album, however, does not follow in the footsteps of Keys 2 at all. Instead of songs with substance, we get songs without direction. I literally cannot recommend one good song on this album. The songs are simply awful.As much as I think Trevor Rabin began to swamp the Yes sound by the time Talk came out, I wouldn't mind having him back to restore a sense of power and melody back to the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a dog dropping","review":"nine months ago i bought this cd, i have tried to listen to it and maybe get used to it, and maybe like it. i still hate it. i have been a yes fan since 1970, and sometimes i had to listen to their music a few times to learn to appreciate it, and i love it all,, exept this. open your eyes is trash trash trash.. this is the most noisy yet BORING recording i have ever heard. the fact that is was done by my favorite band of all time, only dissapoints me very much.

The live material definitely kicked ass. Now, with Tony or Rick nowhere to be found, Open your Eyes hits the stores and I thought it was a huge disappointment. Not because of a new keyboard player (I saw them on the VH-1 Hard Rock Cafe thing) because obviously, Igor is a great keyboard player, but Yes seem to be way past their prime. They need Trevor and either Tony or Rick back in the band.

I don't know the member's middle names or birthdates but I have always appreciated their music. Open Your Eyes is not \\"Yes\\" music. It is Yes with the very talented Billie Sherwood. Anderson, Squire, Howe, Wakeman, Bruford and/or White is Yes. Ten and twenty minute compositions are Yes although the short pieces are great too. There was synergy there not created with other line-ups or during attemps at more mainstream rock oriented albums like Open. It's good, it can't help but be good with this talent but it isn't great, which is what I always hope for and usually get with Yes. If you like Union or Talk you will probably like this album. If you think Fragile, Tales and Close To The Edge were the best rock albums ever made you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engaging","review":"I've had this maybe around a year or so and have just listened to it twice.

Well produced, but distant. Strange album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid album, an insult to the Yes name.","review":"I've heard all of the Yes albums, including 'Union' and 'Big Generator' - which weren't exactly the band's proudest moments. 'Open Your Eyes' manages to crash to a level beneath either of those two subpar albums, both of which did have one or two worthy songs on them.This album is a collection of songs that members were individually working on prior to Yes' reunion in 1996. Their latest record company pushed for a new album to be released quickly on the heels of the vastly more interesting Keys to Ascension II album. The haste and non-cohesiveness shows in this work. Jon Anderson's lyrics are drivel, Steve Howe parts are 'cut and pasted' into songs, rather than serving as inspired compositions. As for the keyboardist - well they didn't really have one at the time, so they flipped between session musicians.Your money is better spent elsewhere. Anyone who is used to the 'classic' Yes sound surely won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like YES.....","review":"Other reviewers have said the same thing: There are some excellent songs here, but many duds as well. Unfortunately, there is also some lazy songwriting in addition to 2 or 3 songs I refuse to listen to...BUT, if you are content making a 35 minute YES tape circa 1998, this is definately worth getting. Just because they put in the garbage doesn't mean you have to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ?","review":"After the incredible studio songs of keys to Ascension Vol 1 and 2, we were waiting for something great to come out from their next cd.Surprise ! Maybe the worst Yes album since Tormato or Big Generator.Is the band out of inspiration ? Surely not, their next album, \\"The ladder\\" succeeded where \\"Open your eyes\\" failed, in the same style...The only good track is the opening one \\"\\"New state of Mind\\", the rest is so-so....I am deceive but I forgive them, they haven't deceive me very often :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Die-Hard Fans","review":"I tend to agree that this is one of the worst Yes CDs...OPEN YOUR EYES contains a couple of good songs. The title song is excellent - it's got a good, driving sound. Also, \\"Universal Garden\\" is pretty good. Some of the songs are harmless enough - \\"No Way We Can Loose\\" and \\"Wonderlove.\\" But some songs just drone on (like \\"Fortune Seller\\" and \\"Love Shine\\"). Also, OPEN YOUR EYES contains one of the worst Yes songs ever - \\"Man on the Moon.\\" \\"I am the man in the moon and I hope to shine upon you very soon / Waiting in the night to bathe you all in moonlight / I am the man . . . in the man.\\" Yikes. Much of the writing is almost as trite.This CD isn't horrible. There just aren't any memorable songs. A couple years later, Yes made amends with THE LADDER. THE LADDER was hardly a return to \\"classic-Yes\\" as some claimed, but it was a more substantial effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great YES of old with a new twist","review":"After having purchased EVERY YES album in 30 years and attending over 25 YES concerts (of which I remember about 20... oh to be young again...) I have found the new tunes to be refreshing and still maintain the old \\"traditional YES sound\\". It does sound a lot like \\"90125\\" with the harmonies and great blends of sound. I particularly like \\"Love Shine\\" as well as \\"New State of Mind\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\". The last cut has a \\"Close to the Edge\\" theme, without the real music behind it, 25 minutes of off and on sounds on the last cut was not needed on this fine LP. Keep it up, Chris, Jon, Steve, and Alan. No really fine Steve Howe solo on this LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been EARS","review":"A lot of Yes fans mercilessly thrashed this production, wondering where they were going with new members, guitarist/vocalist Billy Sherwood and keyboardist Igor Khoreshov. You have to understand that even a reborn band gets growing pains sometimes. Although a little lacking in divine inspiration, the songs bubble with energy and conviction. It is in their performance that this album finds its' salvation. Title track 'Open Your Eyes' is a powerhouse but it stumbles a little on its' own sheer business. 'Man On The Moon' is so different from ANY other Yes track and scores points for that very reason. 'Somehow, Someday' is a quality facsimile of something Trevor Rabin would pen. And the nicest moment of all is the plaintive 'From The Balcony', rendered only by Anderson's voice and Howe's acoustic guitar. Sometimes the best moments of Yes are the most simple. My actual rating is 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squire & Howe caught napping","review":"Except for two or three good tunes on this CD, \\"Open Your Eyes\\" disappointed me greatly. I feel it to be Yes' worst album since \\"Tormato\\". While Chris Squire penned some of the songs on this album, his classic punching bass is, for the most part, dormant, as it was on the CD \\"Talk.\\" Steve Howe's guitar wizardry is \\"missing\\" as well. What's up with the CD's final cut, \\"The Solution\\"? After the initial five-plus minutes, there are about 20 minutes of near silence. I'd rather have had more songs. This album does not possess the classic Yes sound. Yes' newest, \\"The Ladder,\\" returns to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Yes dead at last?","review":"With the exception of Close to the Edge (and perhaps Going for the One) Yes's best albums always featured new artists: Steve Howe on The Yes Album, Rick Wakeman on Fragile, Patrick Moraz on Relayer, Geoff Downs and Trevor Horn on Drama, and most importantly, Trevor Rabin with his pop sensibility on 90125. Whether this infusion was happenstance or by design, it was vital to the vibrancy of the music. While Rabin was never my favorite band member, his connection with the pop sound really made the eighty's band sound great. With Rabin's departure, it sounds like Yes is trying to capture his rock magic with with skills more suited to their older style. They need to forget Trevor and find some new blood to breath life back into the band. If they still love what they are doing they should go ahead, but it sounds to me like they are just going through the motions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A desperate cry for the return of Trevor Rabin and Tony Kaye","review":"Is this a joke, or what?

It also provides advice on how to measure each of these stages. I have found the project follow-up questionnaire especially insightful.At first, I found this book a bit confusing about whether it was trying to assess projects themselves or the project management initiative, but after a second look at it, I see it as is really useful if you need to show the benefits of implementing/developing project management in your organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it no complaints at all","review":"This monitor is definitely worth its value. using it for couple of months now, no complaints at all.

But when he was thrown in prison for the alleged death of a policeman, things began to change. Many musical artists such as Rage Against The Machine, Beastie Boys, and Bad Religion began holding benefits and speaking out for him. They weren't the only ones. Many activists, actors, and other artists spoke out for him. Eventually, NPR (National Public Radio) asked him to do a segment on life in prison. He agreed and it was to be heard, but the plug was soon pulled because of what crime he had supposedly committed and because of the extremes he would go to in his articles. He made this record in response to the pleas for him to go off the air. It is really anti-censorship and he really proves what is wrong with it.

Even thought we change our cat litter boxes obsessively every day, we still had a nasty smell. This product works very well. However, it does not clean the air for an entire house, it works for a room or maybe two. And it is not quiet. There are two settings, one louder and more efficient. But even the lower setting is still noticeable when you walk into the room. It does clear the air very well, we run ours when we are not home so the noise does not bother us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well built, but not really efficient","review":"My first impression was great. A well built product, robust, definitely not flimsily. Yes, it is bigger than what I was expecting, but in a positive way (the only drawback can be the electrical socket. You need a firm one to hold the product hanged there in place).However, I was disappointed with its efficacy. It is not strong enough to eliminate the odors of rooms or bathrooms. Actually, it makes little difference even when at its maximum level (which makes a very loud noise). Therefore, after a couple of weeks, no one cares to turn it on anymore.It seemed a great idea, though. I was really hopeful when I saw it at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winner of Costume Contest Halloween 2006","review":"I just want to say this costume fit perfectly..............like it was made for me.

I wanted to dress up last year to take my 3 year old son out trick or treating in style.I even entered a costume contest and won \\"Prettiest Costume\\" so I would have to say this was worth the money.It was also shipped to me very quickly, it arrived sooner then I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I own this flatpanel in OEM version (SGI F220), and I'm extremely satisfied with it.

Individual trooper rotation among our forces while the enemy left veterans in place to familiarize themselves with the terrain. Casual attitudes to construction of U.S. fortifications and over-reliance of artillery support while the enemy maximized concealment and exploited it for movement and deployment. Reliance on unreliable native allies. Lack of communication about objectives. Insufficient manning of positions by understrength units. etc, etc...

Robert Zubrin's book follows a group of very different characters as they execute a difficult mission to Mars, and he does not skip out on either the technical details or on the character conflicts. And that's to be expected-- not only is he a writer, Robert Zubrin is also a top-rate space engineer-- he literally wrote the book on how to go to Mars. This book is great if, like me, you think that science fiction needs both science _and_ interesting characters.Of the novels about Mars trips, I still think that Geoffrey A. Landis' book MARS CROSSING is my favorite, but FIRST LANDING runs a close second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal, boring & shameless","review":"I was pretty excited to get started reading this book after reading the reviews. I am very interested in exploration of Mars, and this book seemed to be a perfect fit for me. Unfortunately I can not say I enjoyed this first attempt at fiction by Mr. Zubrin. The plot is predictable, and shallow. The characters could have been pulled from any number of previous tombs on exploration. At one point there is even a shameless plug for one of Zubrin's non-fiction works.I found this effort to be really lacking in conviction and creatvity, a least two more complete edits were warranted, unfortunately it is the reader who suffers reading through this dribble.About the only positive point I can note is that the suffereing is short-lived, as \\"First Landing\\" is quite short, and requires very little in the way of concentration, as the reader is aware of what lurks around every next corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book By Any Standard","review":"First Landing is simply a great book. It is exciting and dramatic while remaining firmly based on known science.In truth, the political manuevering and chaos on Earth is almost worth reading all on its own.First Landing would make a great movie.The highest praise you can give First Landing is that it is too short. The book could easily have added another 100 pages and still been just as exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Landing Crashes","review":"Imagine NASA puts together a crew for a Mars mission. 5 People will go. Nasa selects Jerry Falwell, Susan Sontag, Alan Dershowitz, a Texan Geologist from the oil industry, and David Hackworth as commander. Thought NASA (or anyone else) would put more thought into crew selection? Me too.This book follows a trend in similar literature that focuses way too much on personal friction between crew members as the most serious problem in a mission like this. It achieves distinction only in how far the author will go in his stereotyping. From a religious fundamentalist continuously quoting the bible to fellow crew members to a Texan literally yelling Yee-Hah!, to a stiff necked military commander that...doesn't take charge?The shame of it is that the author is an acclaimed astronautical engineer that could have made this a very interesting examination of the latest theories in engineering a voyage such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from the Arctic","review":"It is vision, a discussion of why we should go to Mars, just as much as a novel. It is most enjoyable and surprising reading. When you get into it, you keep turning pages.I read in a perfect setting: In the simulation Mars habitat on Devon Island, where I served as a crew member with Robert Zubrin as the commander of the crew and the magnificent view to the mars-like landscape.I warmly recommend people to read it in other places, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Read","review":"This is a classic read for the Mars enthusiast, spec fiction / sci /fi fan. Zubrin brings to life the close reality of a Mars Mission in human as well as technological terms. His imagination makes the story as real as it can get...until we can get to Mars ourselves. A true page turner and great Summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it and I'm sorry","review":"Having read books like \\"The Case for Mars\\" (Zubrin's non fiction offering) I could hardly wait to read First Landing. Unfortunately, this book conclusively proves that Zubrin is a first class scientist but he shouldn't give up his day job. Character development is either non-existent or childish. Plot development is transparent and dialogue is juvenile. The technical aspects were first rate but I guess you can't get everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's no wonder we're still Earthbound","review":"I'm fairly forgiving when it comes to science fiction but this book exceeded my limits. I found myself hoping the entire crew would die a quick and painful death so I wouldn't have to read any more about them. Character development is obviously not one of Zubrin's skill sets. I'd offer that perhaps in time he'd be able to get it right but this one novel was enough of an agony to last me a lifetime. There's no way I'm willing to sit through another attempt in the hopes he'd eventually get it right. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"First landing review","review":"exciting through out, realistic characters and scenarios.

Basically, First Landing is a poorly-written, unedited fictionalization of The Case for Mars (which, incidentally, is a largely coherent and compelling nonfiction argument for the feasibility of exploring/colonizing the red planet). DO NOT read First Landing. Read The Case for Mars instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spreading Life to Mars","review":"After the excellent but technical \\"Case for Mars\\" Zubrin positions himself as a great fiction writer with \\"First Landing\\". The people in \\"First Landing\\" are real, with their flaws and quirks. This is not Star trek, there are no warp drives and teleporters. Life on Mars is hard and dirty, but eventually the people prevail due to their own strength and ingenuity.Going to Mars is not a frivolous idea. Mars is within reach, and it must be done. If we shy from this challenge, ignorance and terrorists will prevail over America, over that country which in distant past landed its people on the Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"superx 12 caps","review":"these caps were not real super x i have used these before and they worked these did not I need my money refunded"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and gives a view of a shrinking belief system","review":"We often forget that the author of book came from an era when science was trying to edge out conventional faith.

It does not sit squarely and firmly but instead is wobbly. It will not tip over but neither does it mate properly and there is this little irritating wobble. When dealing with hot oil the last thing I want is for the pot to be less than secure on its stand. Also, the burner is too large in diameter to be slid in and out of position between the legs of the stand.

She had a unique place in Ike's heart, they shared so many historical and unique situations together, some crucials and some happy ones also. No wonder she was shattered when she realized there was no hope of them being together again after the war. They have been as close as a couple might be, and regardless of what the \\"entourage\\" and Einsenhower himself said of the \\"affair\\" afterwards, theirs was a beautiful love story and, frankly, I just couldn't put that book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected find.","review":"I was looking through Christmas CDs and just happen across this one on Amazon.

That means that certain sections are missing, like the section on the agnosias and a page from the alexias. Amazon has assured me they are looking into it. I also contacted the publisher (the APA) who have also let me know they are pulling this printed version off the shelves of their vendors and that they will only supply the corrected copy from now on (but they refuse to replace my incorrect version).

Sure the 5600 and 6500 have fancier features, but they are still priced too high. The best thing about the Sharp Zaurus running Linux is the enormous amount of free software that has been developed for it. You can make this little PDA do ANYthing! My only gripe is that Sharp hasn't put more effort into making syncing the Zaurus with Linux easier out of the box. It's as if they assumed a Linux PDA would only be popular with Windows and Mac users. How dumb is that? Otherwise, my favorite PDA."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This was my first PDA ... but I had been looking hard at the Palm and Handspring PDA's before I got this one.

So there's tons of room to store all kinds of stuff. Aside from the calendar, to do list and word/excel spreadsheet uses, I also use my zaurus as an MP3 player.. works great with MP3's running off one of the cards.

As a Mac user I learned the pains of living on the fringe, and my advice to any potential Zaurus shopper is, stick with a mainstream device, i.e., Pocket PC or Palm.The Zaurus sports a nice hardware design, something you'd expect from a Japanese company. The software, while stable, is very unpolished and VERY confusing. There's also a lack of clear integration as on the Palm and also Pocket PC. Free software? You get what you pay for...In short, not quite worth the money and the label of an anti-social."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Zaurus","review":"I'd just like to say that this PDA is working out like a champ.

O'Toole is one of the few great stars who can do both drama (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") and comedy (this, and \\"My Favorite Year\\") brilliantly. I think he's the greatest actor ever. If you thought him charming in this, see \\"My Favorite Year\\". People often comment that O'Toole aged prematurely with his drinking and chain-smoking, but I actually prefer him with a bit of mileage on him, as in \\"My Favorite Year.\\" That movie has slow sections, but when O'Toole is onscreen, you'll see the best example of comic genius and brilliance at work.

A masterpiece of melodic Prog Rock which somehow combines old style Yes with 90125 style Yes brilliantly.)PS: The 'unhelpful' voters may want to know that I'm a big fan of Anderson's - see my \\"Olias of Sunhillow\\" review elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID EFFORT","review":"I guess all the Steve Howe fans are happy. It only took 4 efforts since Trevor Rabin left to make a great cd. I am a fan of all variations of Yes and it is time for the Rabin-bashers to realize that if were not for Rabin, Yes would have been done by 1985. \\"90125\\" put Yes back on the map after several sub-par efforts. Anyway, \\"The Ladder\\" is solid from start to finish. Standout tracks are \\"Face To Face\\", \\"Homeworld\\" & \\"New Language.\\" By the way Yes fans, check out \\"SCENES FROM A MEMORY\\" by DREAM THEATER. The orchestration of their songs is Yes-like, but with an edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Positive Move Forward.","review":"An album containing elements evoking their rich past (\\"New Language\\"), while looking forward in the spirit of true progression (\\"Lighting Strikes\\"), this is a fine album by a band who despite their collective ages, do not sound tired or content to go through the motions. There are some misfires, such as tracks 6 and 7, but these are more likely lingering traces of the weaker attempts from their previous album. As a postive, global accents add flavor throughout the album, indicating the band is attuned to global rhythms. For long time fans receptive to a band not content to be an \\"oldies\\" act, this is sound effort and a positive motion forward, exemplified by the wise addition of new keyboardist, Igor Khoroshev, who has infused new vigor into the group, while clearly respecting the tonalities of his illustrious predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes returns to form","review":"The Ladder is a fine example of an album that most pundits thought couldn't be made: an album by a 30-year-old band that has sounds as fresh as the latest upstarts. Yes proves with this release that they \\"aren't quite dead yet\\" and in fact have a lot to offer to their loyal fans as well as new listeners. The songs range from \\"classic Yes\\" style pieces like Homeworld and New Language to the pop ballad If Only You Knew, which actually sounds like it belongs on a Celine Dion record (where it would probably sell a million copies). Lightning Strikes has a bouncy, almost danceable rhythm, and Nine Voices has the famous Yes harmonies used to their best effect. The Ladder will satisfy a lot of music lovers out there who might have said to themselves, \\"Is that band of geezers still around?\\" The answer is a resounding, \\"Yes!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to the Center of Yes","review":"Yes is back. Despite what critics have said that progressive rock is a dying dinosaur, Yes, with this welcome return to what they do best, complex but direct to the heart songs, is demonstrating that progressive rock is at it's highest peak of the last two decades. Koroschev's keyboards are also welcome (after the experience of Open Your Eyes the group needed a keyboardist that sound's \\"like a Yes keyboardist\\"). On the stage they are better than ever (they've been in Buenos Aires two weeks ago, playing the new songs). Thank you Yes, and good health to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Talent!

Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Yes, but not the best or 5 stars","review":"The was label was somewhat right stating the best since Fragile, & CTTE. What was right was Homeworld(The Ladder). This song is the best I've heard since those classic disks. Can one song be worth a whole CD? YES!!!!O.K. well add It Will Be A Good Day, New Languages,The messenger, Nine Voices and you have a solid CD. The rest of the CD is good pop music. It is not complete or 5 stars like The Yes Alblum,Closer To The Edge,Fragile, Going For The One, or Tormato( I know some of you will hate me for including this). This CD is comparable to Anderson,Bruford,Wakeman & Howe which is a CD any who love The Ladder and don't have it should check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES but No","review":"YES has climbed THE LADDER with their new release,but they have not reached the top of their game. This CD has reopened my eyes to YES, unlike their last effort. I can\\"t wait to see them again in Milwaukee next month.I hope they play Finally(especially the ending),and Homeworld.As a YES fan since the late '60's, I'll keep rocking with them. See you in Milwaukee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average!","review":"YES is back, unfortunately it's not with a very strong effort. This album isn't poor by any means, however it isn't a gem either. Instrumentally the musicians, as always, are very tight (in other words outstanding, as per usual). Steve Howe has some of his best moments since the first ASIA album, Chris Squire puts on his typical brilliant performance, and Igor Khoroshev fills the keyboard spot nicely. The problems with this album are mostly lyrical. Some of the songs leave a YES fan to cry out to Trevor Rabin one thing ..... \\"H...E...L...P!!!\\" This album also has the worst moments from the band since the ABWH stuff done on the YES Union album. Lastly, the recording itself is also a little flat compared to Open Your Eyes and the 2 Keys albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? I can only give it five stars?","review":"I have not heard an album this good since... well, I can't honestly remember. I loved 'Talk' from Trevor's Yes, and Close To The Edge is the best album any band will ever release... but The Ladder comes as close to perfection as this cynical decade could ever let it.Transcendental, sublime, an experience of truly great music, who could you possibly compare it to? Just take the second track: three fantastic melodies going at once, and that's just the vocal lines!I'm not an aging nostalgic hippy (and I mean no insult to those comrades of ours who might fit that description): I'm 25, with short hair, and I like all manner of other modern bands. Anyone who doesn't love this album, ask yourself one question - isn't it possible the fault lies with YOU?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the 70's all over again","review":"This is one of the best pieces of music in years. Shame is that no one will hear it, as today's radio stations don't play music. For anyone that grew up listening to Yes, Beatles, Tull, Doors, Moody Blues, Beach Boy's, Stones, etc... this CD will soothe your soul... and make you forget that Brittany Spears, Puff Daddy and N' Sync even exist!!! While so many aging voices tend to lose a bit of their beauty(Sinatra at 60, McCartney, Robert Plant, Ian Anderson), Jon Anderson's voice is as it was... poweful, melodic, enchanting. I hope that it sells enough to give the band the impetus to tour, and continue writing and recording. How sad that FM radio is either all talk or synthetic music, and never gives the appropriate air time to CD's like this or Brian Wilson's Imagination. If only there was a time machine to take me back to when music was music... I'd surely take this CD along, and it would fit in well!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeworld is great, but the rest...","review":"is just a bit too popish for my tastes. Mr. Howe has lost something on this album: presence. New Language has some nice moments and Nine Voices goes over well but the rest can go. After sitting with this album for some time now I find that after being a Yes fan for some 22 years now the band just doesn't do it for me the way they used to. The lyrics for the most part are on the silly side. Jon Anderson used to be accused of writing lyrics that were too cryptic but I will take the lyrics of Close to the Edge and Siberian Khatru any day over If Only You Knew and its like. Even Anderson's voice is a bit grating in spots and I never thought that would happen. Still, they are giving it their best shot and that has to be worth at least two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best?no!....good?YES!!","review":"i see people talking about \\"the ladder\\"....is it rock?...is it pop?...is it prog?.......don't care about it,it's just a beautiful album....and i'm one of those who think that CTTE is the best album in the history of music!if you have to buy some yes albums this is my rating: 1.CTTE 2.FRAGILE/RELAYER 3.THE YES ALBUM 4.ABWH(ok,it's not yes but it's great!) 5.THE LADDER 6.KTA2 p.s:going for the one and TFTO ... .....(ok...OK,awaken is a good song!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vision, Great Music","review":"More soulfood from the greatest popular visionaries and musicians of modern times.I try not to judge YES with my mind, that way my heart can hear all that comes from heart of YES--the heart of us all--ONE LIFE--FREE LIFEChrist announced that there would be a second coming and YES has been announcing that the second coming has arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tormato Part II","review":"The only Yes album worse than this is Tormato.There is nothing here to hold me. Only one decent, Yes-sounding moment in the entire album: \\"so, ascending to the future\\" section on \\"Homeworld.\\"Everything else is filler. Not sure why it gets such high reviews. Certainly doesn't deserve them.I've given this album many, many tries. It never rises above a mundane.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"After some major slumpage, Yes gathers some strength.","review":"After \\"Going for the one\\", the last great Yes album, I discontinued my Yes purchases. \\"The ladder\\" isn't so much a return to form, but they're trying hard to recapture their grandure. The first song is one of my favorite Yes tracks, the wave of euphoria is almost too much. The rest of the songs aren't as good, but enjoyable non-the-less. I might be one of the few Yes fans who like their lyrics. It's not that I'm trying to understand Jon's message, I just like his spirit; I find it reassuring to be surrounded by positivity. If you've never been able to warm up to Jon Anderson's style perhaps \\"The Ladder\\" (and \\"Magnification\\") won't be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrific effort","review":"The Ladder shows that Yes can still rock with the best of them. Older and wiser, this album takes them into the next millenium, and it makes up for the above average Open Your Eyes. Not as good as some of their greatest work, but they have taken the best of what made them successful in the classic 70's and the commericial 80's 90125 era and put them into this album, and even from there they don't hesitate to experiment especially with other music forms. Igor Koroshev has definitely shown he is a terrific keyboardist and successor to all of the Yes keyboardists of times past and has shown it in their concert performances. A very worthy swan song to add to the legacy of the late famed rock producer Bruce Fairbairn."},{"rating":"2","title":"YeSounds - Nicely Done","review":"Producer Bruce Fairbairn did a great job of identifying the sounds and styles that Yes fans like (Howe guitar licks, Squire's bass, and some great keyboad work from new-guy Igor Khoroshev), and encorporating those sounds into 60 minutes of upbeat tunes. The first track, Homeworld, ranks up there with my all time favs. I highly recommend it for any Yes fan out there - particularly those long-time fans who may be wavering and thinking that the band has lost it. They haven't. Fairbairn helped them find it just like he did with Chicago in 1995. Sadly, this will be his last production credits as he passed away just after the album was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure beats the hell out of Ricky Martin and Puff Daddy!","review":"Imagine that, recording artists than can actually PLAY instruments, and that can SING! What a neat idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Again, good stuff.","review":"Take each Yes album on its own, listening to them for their musical and compositional qualities (and not for an idealized 70s lineup which I also loved and miss), and this one will stand out as offering exceptionally good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes go upstairs to a new good era","review":"The music contained on this CD is a mixture of Yes'70's sound with the new talents of younger members as Igor Khoroshev & Billy Sheerwood. The group tried to return to the progressive days of Fragile and Close To The Edge, but many songs are really ballad oriented (but are great songs). The first track \\"Homeworld\\" is great, is a 10 minutes song that returns us to the Yes best moments. Squire & Howe are (as always) play his instruments really well, Khoroshev is not Wakeman but is a good keyboard player, White plays very good his drumkit and the angelical voice of Jon is still in perfect form.This is a hope to the future to the Yes fans, they are again in a good moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I have purchased everything by Yes, even the solo work since they put our Roundabout. Close To the Edge will forever be the progressive masterpiece of our time and I will always feel that Going For The One sounds wonderfully fresh, no matter how old it gets.Other than that it has been the never-ending hope that they would be able to put out something close to the work that they had achieved in the past. Well they have, The Ladder is simply fantastic. For the past month it's all that I have listened to. I love the new Santana but this is truly the best CD of the year. Thank you YES."},{"rating":"2","title":"an acquired taste","review":"Not quite the \\"return to form\\" that is advertised to catch the attention of die hard fans , but this is the best offering since the Anderson ,Bruford , Wakeman & Howe project ten years ago . Like so many of Yes' works,you may need to listen to this one a couple of times before you really begin to appreciate it . Given the current trends in music,it is good to know that you can still count on this band to bring different and exciting sounds , albeit I miss Wakeman's touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANDERSON - Shut up for a moment, will you?","review":"The problem with this monstrosity is that Anderson won't shut up for a moment.

Bring back Rabin; I'm getting sick of Howe's twangy guitar. This CD, as well as the one before it, lacks substance. It's a good fit for the 90s, though - a decade of poor quality in every type of rock. Maybe the next decade will have fans demanding more. Until then, don't expect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spry effort from \\"thirty-something\\" Yes","review":"After hearing Yes' latest prog rock escapade, \\"The Ladder\\" is indeed an infectiously positive ensemble of some greatly resilient tunes. However, I must concede that this CD was only good, but not the ultimate best I've heard from this revered rock powerhouse (especially when compared to \\"Talk\\" and \\"Keys to Ascension I/II \\" for the 1990's). I do laud \\"The Ladder\\" for Jon Anderson's spiritually energized lyrics, something he definitely has a true, unadulterated knack for on every project he's accomplished. \\"If Only I Knew\\", \\"To Be Alive\\", and \\"Nine Voices\\" have to be my most favorite tracks at this point in time. I'm sure in time, this Yes CD will grow on me...their work always breaks on through to my heart, mind, and soul in the end! Happy 30th anniversary to Jon and the gang!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning Strikes More Than Once For Yes.","review":"After several albums in the mid 90's that felt disjointed (Keys To Ascension 1, Keys To Ascension 2, Open Your Eyes), The Ladder is a fresh collection of songs from a band that has been churning out music for over thirty years. Probably able to appease fans of old-school Yes and fans of 80's Yes alike, The Ladder offers some of Yes' best material in quite some time. The first seven minutes of \\"Homeworld\\" can easily be placed aside tunes like \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"The Gates of Delerium\\". \\"It Will Be A Good Day\\" proves that for all its instrumental prowess, Yes is still capable of writing creative, simple pop songs. \\"Lightning Strikes\\" and \\"The Messenger\\" are two examples of Yes trying to remain creative and exploring different musical ideas. There are only a few weak spots on this disc but the strong qualities of disc more than make up for it. A must for any Yes fan and even a good introduction for someone who is new to Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladder Strikes Lightening","review":"Yes, known for dizzyingly complex music, has scored a direct hit with \\"The Ladder\\". Somewhat less esoteric than past efforts, this CD has one of my favorite YESSONGS of all time--\\"Lightening Strikes\\". This tune begins with a most unusual flute and guitar intro and then explodes into a driving rhythm with a fantastic melody. The break contains a short but magnificent bass lick and Jon Anderson's voice takes a new, more intense quality. I have found myself playing this track over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"Mixing and producing is almost as great as Trevor Horn did in earlier days. Sound approaches jon&vangelis which is great. The songs are too much a cliché, in fact more than ever has been. Although I think that there are some great chord progressions, and some lyrics are OK, this is only a shadow of the great music which Yes has made before (from Fragile to TFTO)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new...","review":"If you are a YES fan get it. Specially if you are one of those who like CTTE and the '70s stuff. I don't want that YES change it's music. But I think that's time to review the formula. They did something expressive in '70 with Howe and Wakeman. It was different! In '83 with Rabin, they started a new era. It was different again without loosing the quality. But now! What they are tryng to do? The same kind of songs they did 30 years ago? I think it's the wrong way. I'd like to see a better finish in YES history..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This long-timer likes it.","review":"I've been a big fan of Yes since the mid-70's. I guess that gives my something to base my opinion on. I'm one of those who can find some good points to every one of thier albums, but I wouldn'd say that every album they've done is great. Nor would I say that about The Ladder. But I will say that The Ladder is a good Yes album. Yes for the 90's, as somone else has stated. Buy this CD. Relax and let yourself enjoy it. If it doesn't work for you as first, listen to it again. And again. It's good! And go see Yes when they come to town. That's good, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of a More Focused Yes","review":"After the near misses of the studio tracks on the Keys to Ascension records, Yes returns with a solid album that evokes both the 70s sound most associated with the band and the more modern compositional approach of the Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe recordings. From the first notes of \\"Homeworld\\", an instant Yes classic, to the calypso beat of \\"Lightning Strikes\\", the album is a treat for the Yes fan who has been waiting a long time for this band to regain their head of steam. Whether it's the exhilarating \\"Face to Face\\", the progressive anthem \\"New Languages\\", or the VERY Anderson-like \\"Nine Voices\\" (and is that Yes doing reggae on \\"The Messenger\\"?) there truly is something for the Yes fan to sink his or her teeth into. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing return to sounds from the past","review":"What could I possibly add to the reviews to this point? The Ladder is a very well produced album with wonderful recall to early 70s Yes works like Close to the Edge and Fragile. The addition of Igor has been a noticeable improvement over more recent works. Inasmuch as I am a tremendous fan of Jon Anderson, I felt that this album had a little too much of the world music so wonderfully represented on his album Deseo. Billy Sherwood is a wonderful compliment to Steve Howe, however, I do miss some of the edgier work done by Trevor Rabin. All-in-all, this is a superb addition to the Yes library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Dissapointing","review":"I've been a big fan of Capt. Fingers for years. This album's production qualities are a bit too sterile and syrupy for it's own good. It's fine that Lee wants to get the CD heavy airplay on the smooth jazz stations, but he would be just as well cutting back on the slick electronic drums, samples, and mounds of processing on everything. The two Sonny Rollins tunes are excellent, with more of a B-3/Guitar/Sax melody interplay. It just doesn't come close, however, to matching up with his groundbreaking works like \\"Festival\\" or \\"Harlequin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Junk","review":"This just doesn't do anything for me.

My relationship with the OED has gradually progressed, and now is one of my greatest tools. I hope someday to pass the OED magnifying glass down to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, pirate version better","review":"I purchased this product few years ago and really had a genuine interest in learning words at a deeper level. Looking back, the one barrier that prevented me from doing so is the need for CD validation. Worse yet, the pirated version DOESN'T require CD validation. So I'm actually mad they've handicap US - The actual customers! While others who \\"stole\\" it had a better, more convenient version. This is a pretty big lesson for me, and I definitely won't waste my money on DRMed products any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Authority","review":"If you're reading a novel and come across a word you're not familiar with, you will probably reach for Websters. Or use the \\"define:\\" command in Google.But when you're writing a paper and need authority on your side, the OED is the best you'll find.The Compact OED is heavy, big and not exactly portable. The print is tiny. Even with 20/20 eyesight you will not be able to read it without the magnifying lens. I ended up reading a page and a half in a single sitting, and ended up with eye pain.But seriously, how often do you read a page and a half of a dictionary?The OED is the foundation. I do not regret buying it, and can't imagine having to deal with the non-compact 20 volume set.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost completely customer proof","review":"We all know and love the OED but this disc version is a total rip off. It disables itself after three months because they are so worried to squeeze every buck out of you and then after paying so much money it stops working. I tried following the instructions but they don't work, then I removed it from the computer and reinstalled it and that didn't work either. Don't waste your money on this. The time it takes to manage their security anxieties make the product \\"virtually\\" useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"I'm at the ABs, and I still can't get a grip on the plot.

That's why I am on Amazon right now, to find another program to learn French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with my purchase","review":"I bought this because I wanted to re-engage my French skills during the time I was in the car.

However, it remains on the shelf unused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique narration is the strong point of this book.","review":"This is a great book for a mid-winter read. The characters are not likeable, the images are disturbing and (not often enough) haunting, and there are parts that lag; but the reason I read this book was its unique narrative device. A story told backwards, even if it is clichéd and devoid of any new insight, is worth any reader's time,--simply for the experience. I teach English and when going over the concept of narration with my students I brought in this book and read an excerpt. The kids were instantly hooked and I recieved numerous requests to borrow the book (sadly impossible since many of the book's themes are inappropriate for adolescent readers), but to see them excited about a book was a pleasant experience. I highly recommend this book for people looking for the slight mental exercise of reading a story (dialogue and all) in reverse."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Amis novel","review":"I can't recommend this novel enough. I've spread the Amis joy to all of my smart friends -- the less clever ones I recommend, say, Nick Hornby.Amis requires an effort but is absolutely worth it. If you've never read him, start with The Rachel Papers, then move on to Time's Arrow. Don't read the back of the book or any more of these reviews -- there's a certain plot development that they reveal for you that you'll want not to have revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An enormous disappointment.I have usually greatly enjoyed Martin Amis's novels. Sadly, not this one.The central premise is a neat one but there is more truth & beauty in the single line from Vonnegut describing the bombers flying backwards over Dresden than there is in the whole of this book.Somewhere in the middle of this book Amis loses interest in the central premise. Maybe he is bored by it, maybe he lacks the intellectual rigour to see it through or may be he knows that the first 100 pages simply do not measure up and only the huge advance keeps him going."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but been done","review":"You know, didn't Kurt vonnegut write a dream sequence in Slaughterhouse-Five in which Billy Pilgrim watches a World War II movie in reverse, reversing the morals just like this? Only, Vonnegut wrote it decades before Amis? I like Amis very much and thought that he executed the idea pretty well here, but I wish I could shake the thought that the idea really wasn't too original..."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiresome gimmick of a novel.","review":"if it is one thing i hate in a book it's a gimmick. gimmick writing is almost never clever or interesting or good, it is simply a gimmick. the gimmick here is that mr amis writes the novel backwards. the story, all dialogue, everything is backward. end to beginning, this, like all gimmicks, gets real tiresome, real fast. years ago i read mr amis's book \\"money,\\" which i loved. i have been looking forward to reading more of him, so this came as a great disappointment. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demanding but brilliant novel","review":"While not for everyone, I thought Time's Arrow was absolutely brilliant -- an admittedly unoriginal central idea (he credits Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five in the acknowledgements) is nonetheless played out perfectly. The moment in which the reader realizes why the man's soul has been viewing the life backwards -- so that the atrocities committed during the Holocaust would be bearable -- is one of the most stirring, chilling moments I've come across in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy!","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book after reading the review in the New Yorker. I found it difficult to follow and have attempted to read it a second time to make sure I didn't miss an important element..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"This is a very unique book such that all of the events take place backwards starting from the main character's death. It has a good mix of different elements, mixing in a lot of humor and irony into some very grim events, in particular the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than Vonnegut's concept..","review":"Everything about this book is reminiscent of Vonnegut. The concept, the subject, and even the writer's humorously clever and simplistic expressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hollow book not rescued by mere technical trickery","review":"This book just leaves me cold. The technical premise is interesting (if unevenly done) but ultimately pointless. \\"Tod\\" is the German word for death, and that's what Dr. Tod is - Dr. Death. His horrible life story is, ultimately, one not worth unreeling - backwards or forwards. These technical tricks by writers are great when they work - which means, when they engage the reader. This semi-backwards narrative, however, failed to really engage this reader. Good riddance, Dr. Death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and uninspiring","review":"I make no pretense to being a literary critic, and I do not wish to be uncharitable, but this book is not exactly a page-turner. For me, at least, it was a tedious read, a real bust. Not only did I find reading a story backwards an unexhilarating experience that was totally off-putting and not the least bit fun or interesting but, to top the whole mess off, the story itself was like rowing across a yawning sea of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pathetic little man","review":"Find the Holocaust's gone stale? One of history's great crimes getting dull and need a makeover? No, I didn't think so either.Amis, a brilliant stylist with no feeling for character consistently found anything more than clever lightweight books beyond him. The story of Tod T (geddit?) Friendly is told backwards. Writing a whole book backwards in time is an overextended gimmick. Dragging the Holocaust in (nearest available Great Theme) does not change this into an important novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a comprehensive and fascinating look at the life and art of","review":"This Cannes Film Festival selection takes a comprehensive and fascinating look at the life and art of the legendary Pablo Picasso. During the last 22 years of Picasso's life, film maker Edward Quinn had complete access to the artist. Through a combination of exclusive home movies and intimate photos, as well as over 600 of the artist's works (many never seen in public), a living, breathing scrapbook of Picasso is realized. The film follows the parallel development of the artist's life and work, giving insight into his creative processes. Among other highlights are some of the last pictures ever taken of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giggle Camera bring giggles","review":"Great toy camera for the money.

McLaughlin's music (which I'm really familiar with) got such a limp, whimpy tratment by the Groningen Guitar Duo, and I don't think McLaughlin deserves it. If anything, I would expect the musicians who cover his repertoire to put some fire into interpreting it. This duo is merely caressing the strings, sounding very tentative. Plus, they don't seem to take any chances, which is utterly in contradiction with the original intentions of McLaughlin's music.The music on this CD sounds lifeless, and the players are getting dangerously close to being flatliners. They somehow managed to scoop out all the guts from McLaughlin's music, and I don't think that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This is a great doc.

It definitely has true 10-gauge conductors unlike many Chinese knock-off cords. This allows you to run tools that draw a lot of current on a long cord without suffering voltage/power loss over the length of the cord.Also, the coating is a heavy flexible rubber that makes the cord lay nicely on the ground when in use.

There is virtually no hard information and its' most common theme is that KC did something in the past he now thinks was a poor choice and he expects you will do it too, whether he tells you it is a bad idea or not. If you are looking for advice on how to tune your bike, or when to tune instead of replace, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Serial produced and the worst reproduction","review":"What a shame that possibly the best of all the movie serials produced should be one of the worst available, technically. Except for the annoying performance of Sonny something-or-other, the acting is good, John Davison is superior. What a fine speaking voice. The first chapter has too many loops of the same bomb being dropped, but from chapter two on, the continuity is more than OK.However, the quality of the dvd print is terrible, just awful. The sound track is bass muffled and audio gain control non-existant. I've viewed many old serials from a number of distributors but this one is pathetic in quality.I would pay a premium price for a good copy of \\"Perils\\", if one existed. And if I only had one serial, this would be it.I give 4.5 stars for the serial acting and content. One-half star for the technical quality.

It is a wonderfully elegant, rich book which makes the struggle against apartheid in South Africa real and personal to the reader.What I love about this book is that the \\"heroes\\" of the movement are shown to be multi-dimensional, flawed, people, who are doing their best in their lives, as well as to further the interests of the liberation movement.My Son's Story is an inspiring, moving book.

As my English was refined during those decades, \\"Warriner's\\" is my first choice for grammar and syntax. All this is to say that \\"Warriner's\\" may be out of fashion. In the age of \\"Word Perfect\\" and \\"politically correct\\", all the new adaptations of English are missing.
