The \\"Song for Sarajevo\\" is perhaps the most stirring song in this collection, a holiday story sung from the view point of a young child in a war torn country during the winter season. With war as an \\"evil bird\\" all around, when the child closes her eyes, she dreams of peace, of flowers on a hill, of her mother's smile. The song \\"In the Bleak Mid Winter\\" sung in the style of a traditional English ballad ushers in a breath taking frosty winter mood, simple and humbly performed. Finally near the end is a wonderful story, \\"The Blizzard\\", to encourage all those broken hearted and crushed ones in this season. A light shines in the window \\"after the storm\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"The book offers logical explanations to many of the phenomena occuring in the bible. The authors style of writing also adds to this marvelous attempt to explain the bible as a historical book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original book - Cheap rip-off","review":"This edition by BN Publishing is a cheap, unauthorized copy of the original book. It is missing most of the photos and tables that make the book great. The other reviews are written about the original book and not this edition. My son needed the book for a class. Unfortunately by the time we realized that this was the incomplete book, it was too late to return it. The book itself is great, but do not buy this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this history?","review":"In reading this book you should keep in mind that an earlieredition devoted a whole chapter to the Shroud of Turin. Nowthat the Shroud has been proven to be a mediaval fake, you haveto ask yourself whether or not all the scholarship in this bookis just as bogus."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible devoid the Divine","review":"Bible as History sadly avoids the face value claims of the text in an attempt to demythologize the events of history. All supernatural elemants are reduced to natural phenomena. In an attempt to defend the Bible as historical the author removes God and the miracles which are central to the claims of the text. The removing the supernatural leaves a storyline which fails to be either internally or externally consistent. Case in point, Moses and the burning bush. Keller describes a mideastern plant which secrets oil. He then suggests Moses probably saw such a plant which had caught fire enabling the bush to burn without being consumed as the Exodus story claims. Unfortunately this naturalized version does not explain why Moses, a man wanted for murder in Egypt , would suddenly return."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Convoluted & Contradictory Stuff about Biblical Stories\\"","review":"That would be a more appropriate title for the book. Basically, the system is that the author introduces things that are spoken of in the Bible, he explains what may have happened according to the historical record, then he further explains how there's no way that what he has just presented is feasable. It's a lot of convaluted nonsense that gave me a head-ache half of the way through it; as I had no more strength for plowing through the rest, I threw it in the garbage. I'd purchased it as a gift for a friend, but decided I'd rather keep the friend. If you are a scientist, his inability to commit to a hypothesis will annoy you. If you are a Biblical scholar, the fact that there is absolutely NO representation of \\"The Bible as History\\" will vex you. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense.","review":"This book is full of outright lies and nonsense. As an archaeologist, the misinterpretations seemed obvious. It is very poor science when the author sets out to prove his hypotheses by manipulating sketchy evidence. It would require a low level of gullibility for an individual to accept any information in this book as truth. In this attempt to prove the improbable, the author fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible as History","review":"This edition of The Bible as History has no illustrations and the presentation is not at all like the original edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous resource on biblical history","review":"This book has been out for several years and still remains the ultimate resource for biblical history as it relates to archeology. Very well done. Useful for the casual searcher and for the scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Background","review":"I found this book an excellent historical background to Biblical times, especially its references to Egyptian Dynasties. For the most part, speaks strongly in favor of the Bible as an accurate record to Earth's past, but tends to downplay the miraculous for more natural occurences in nature. Like for instance, explaining away the parting of the Red Sea, as really the \\"Reed Sea,\\" an extremely shallow body of water easily crossed on foot. Or Moses' experiencing Jehovah God speaking to him out of a burning bush, as a plant in the Middle East that actually ignites into flames on occasion. Of course, a shallow passage through the \\"Reed Sea\\" by the Children of Israel, doesn't quite explain away how Pharaoh's entire army was drowned there does it? But I take it for what its worth. Good history, bad theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Everyone should read this book.

Known as the Gold Coast, there were a great many homes of the rich and famous on Long Island, mostly on the North Shore. This small book tells the story of the workers on the estates, the people who made the houses run as if by magic.

This series of books is very informative and I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for Diaz' Story Sun, Moon Stars","review":"Just replaced a lost copy for only one reason: Junot Diaz' The Sun, The Moon, The Stars is such a powerfully written story that I can quote it years later. I remember the pain the narrator feels when his girl, Madga, finds out he has cheated and his spiral downward. I read it aloud to an ex and when I took a break, he requested I finish it. The words flail and then hit hard with their simplicity. This Diaz story is published only here, and reading this story was a blessing...to my juvie students, to my ex, and to me. Buy it for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving. Not the best stories of the year.","review":"As a novel reader, I always look forward to this series because these are the some of the only short stories I invest in all year. This collection was a disappointment. As some reviewers have noted, there is a mixture of mediocre writers with brilliant ones, an up and down ride at best. There are few surprises or stretches of imagination, esp. from the B writers who tend to sound like grad students with contrived, workshopped pieces. Also, I am very tired of first person narratives, another tendancy of beginning writers. Maybe next year we'll see clear, distinct voices and risky writing throughout, not just from the handful of expert storytellers featured here."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Exit","review":"I suppose if you like the tone and style found typically in BEST SHORT STORIES of XXXX you'll like this. For me, I find them--and especially this one--boring. After having read it, I was left with absolutely nothing: no profound revelation, no mental challenge, no rivalry at any sort of level. A sort of hell with no exit, with each turn of the page, each turn to a new story, a sort of rolling of the rock uphill. I finally had to put it down in the middle of THE BEST GIRLFRIEND.... In these stories, people live, people search, people quest...for fulfillment of common desires or exit out of circumstances that are simply silly. And in the end, nothing new is learned, no revelation discovered, not even a glimpse of some shadow of a holy grail. Just time precious time wasted that can never be recovered. Better to spend that time sitting in the corner, watching the spiders hunt. These books enlighten you nil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I am a big fan of the Best American Short Stories series, but this one was a huge diappointment. I like stories that have some meat; they should resonate with depth a long time after being read. This collection offers few such stories. Then again, I wasn't expecting much more from Amy Tan. Try '98 or '00 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Short stories of 1999","review":"I enjoyed Amy's explaination of why she picked the stories she did much more than the stories themselves.

A few of the stories so far have kept my interest, but the majority seem to be overly analitical, and dripping with symbolism. Reminds me of some of the stories we had to dissect in college lit classes. Ambiguous, Ambiguous, Ambiguous Short Stories should have been the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly bone-shaking","review":"Either the editors of these collections are getting lazy, or there are some politics involved that I don't understand. To include a \\"B\\" writer such as Pam Houston with greats like Rick Bass is an abomination. Other than the Bass story and a few others, this collection is dull and uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good collection of stories","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. Okay, there are a few duds -- but there are every year. This is a very good collection, and anyone who says that it is not does not like literary fiction. This is a surprisingly well rounded story-based collection, perhaps a bit slow moving, but rich and rewarding. Nathan Englander's allegorical story \\"The Tumblers\\" is worth the price of admission alone. And then there are excellent stories by Rick Bass, Annie Proulx, Hester Kaplan, Tim Gautreaux and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring BASS Ever","review":"This is by far the dullest collection of the usually high-caliber Best American Short Story Collection. There are so many \\"bad\\" stories here, one wonders what Ms. Tan was thinking. However, the Rick bass story and one by Nathan Englander prevent the collection from being what seems to be an almost complete Junior Varsity element to the collection....next year get a better editor, because boredom should not be a prerequisite for storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"I searched for years for a copy of this CD (before mp3) and was finally able to locate it some time ago.

Sabate's Vegetarian Nutrition does not do this, and is a fair review of the literature. Each area of concern is addressed with a complete review. Does eating meat cause disease or do other factors in the vegetarian lifestyle than abstention from meat confer health protection?

The sample code is broken, meaning they place a few lines of code, discuss some more code, place the code they described, and repeat this several times for the whole book. I found that in 'Teach Yourself C in 21 Days', the code was discussed after the program code was placed (in one piece), which I found very helpful.

No extras though (probably because there was no band input on this release)and over way too quickly. Well, hopefully there may be a better edition years down the line, but get this before it becomes out of print.

If you enjoy low-grade MIDI karaoke recordings... well then you probably aren't a Stabbing Westward fan (low-fi is artistic when done intentionally... this wasn't intentional). So that leaves only one classification of people to whom I speak: the people who will be more offended by the sound of this conterfeit garbage than by the sound of three dollars clogging their toilet.

A week and a half later we recieved the mill, the package was post stamped two days after the phone call, and was sent snail mail. If that wasn't bad enough, no repair/ adjustment had been made.

The drums are great, but the vocals are a bit annoying. Also, it seems they are trying to do a little too much all at once - they need some focus. I think with the right vocalist, they might gain a wider audience. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the guitar tones sounding too 'overprocessed'. Sometimes less is more, and this album is far too much. The drummer is outstanding, but I would not recommend this CD to anyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good selections, bad mixing.","review":"This CD has some pretty good jams in it.

It takes nice pictures without red-eye. The only issue with it is that it takes so long to reset between pictures that the subjects start to walk away after the first shot. Because of that, I am switching to a new camera soon. The Kodak software is good for uploading images to the Kodak website for sharing pictures easily and ordering photos. But, the software tends to be very buggy and takes forever to install and update. The Kodak printer dock makes very nice prints -- when it works. I had to send one of the docks back for repair within the first year. Frequently, the docks are not recognized by my computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"Good book, but seems to be more related to mechanical/aeronautical engineers, rather than structural engineers.

Far better - no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A","review":"With enough symbolism to keep a literary student happily busy for weeks, Sam Shepard's Pulitzer Prize-winning play throws you into a surreal world grounded in the decay of the American Dream. The family centered in the drama is dysfunctional, to put it mildly, and is a microcosm of the hopes and eventual destruction of those hopes in America. The action plays out like a combination between American Gothic and Frida Kahlo - based in reality, but little bits here and there remind the audience that they are not in a world structured realistically. Shepard has stunning skills in the way he paints pictures with words. The only gripe is that the motivations of Halie, the matriarch of the family, are never fully developed or explained. Perhaps Shepard's intention was to keep emotions and feelings as buried as the title implies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring American Theater by an underrated playwright","review":"A courageous work that deserved the Pulitzer. It's American Theater of the Absurd at its best.The familes dysfunction is depicted in a disturbing climax.

Hardin is a town made up of whites and Indians that live on a reservation. Colton begins to follow the girls team around with the permission of Coach Mac. He tells not just about basketball but the players' home lives. He learns about their struggles and the poverty most of the kids live in. Colton shows great insight into this town's love for basketball and their need for something more.The characters in Counting Coup could be stories by themselves. What made the book good was that Colton didn't dwell on one person or issue too long, so it helped the book flow. Reading this book would be a good read for anyone who enjoys women's basketball and seeing people overcome life's obstacles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counting Coup","review":"This book was enjoyable to read. There was not a moment when I wasn't interested in what the author was going to say next. The author, (Larry Colton) took a trip to an indian reservation where he became slightly obsessed with following a women's basketball team and more importantly a certain member of that team, Sharon LaForge.All in all I found this story easy to relate to, and not easy to predict.I enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different slice of life","review":"Reminiscent of \\"Season on the Brink\\", this book presents a world that I'm not familiar with but, in a way, am completely familiar with. The most interesting thing is how bias and prejudice and the debilitating aspects of \\"the dole\\" are universal. In my world, it's black and white. Here, it's red and white.Hats off to a guy who has the courage to leave out the political correctness and just \\"tell it like it is\\". There are no simple good guys and bad guys here. There's just folks living there lives dealing with some really big problems. One nagging question since I read this a few months back: Why did the author sit on this book for several years without finishing/publishing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon the Survivor","review":"Counting Coup is a wonderful strory about the life of the Crow Indians. The interesting life of Sharon Laforge, the star basketball player and her journey to win a state championship. Although a very talented athlete, Sharon unfortunately didn't receive the support that a young girl her age needed to be successful in life. Counting Coup is a great book and I recommend it to everyone. It gives insight of how other cultured live and interact with one another. The author did a great job of introducing the main character and did a wonderful job in describing the games, play by play. A wondereful book to be shared by all. It is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counting Coup","review":"Before reading Counting Coup, I thought it would be just another boring girls basketball story. This book proved to me that there is more to womens basketball then what you watch during a game. This shows just how important working together is if you want to accomplish something great. Towards the beginning of their season, the team was winning with ease as they worked as one. Unfortunately for Coach Mac and her team, they started to play their own individual game and not what Coach Mac taught them to play. Many of the characters in this book, encounter many problems as the try to reach their goal which is the State Championship. I recommend this book for those who are in a sport and need the inspiration to excel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does it mean?","review":"Before reading Counting Coup,I had no idea what the term \\"counting coup\\" meant. Since this book was related to basketball, I assumed it dealt with counting the wins and losses of basketball games. After reading, I found out it was more in depth than just counting wins and losses. \\"There were four primary ways to accomplish a coup: touch an enemy in battle, steal an enemy's horse, lead a successful war party, or capture an enemy's weapon. Of these, the bravest was to touch an enemy-not kill him-but touch him on the chest.\\" To accomplish coup is an honor. The Indians do this for glory and dignity. I engoyed Counting Coup. It is a great book full of basketball, triumphs, victories, tears, laughs, and success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This book paints a vivid picture of life of a Native American teen. The author addresses many of the cultural issues present while weaving in a season with a girls' basketball team. He delves a little deeper than many sports books and explores how this cultural issues are mirrored in the world of sports. An excellent choice for anyone looking for a good story, or anyone interested in the mixture of society and sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess people like Larry Colton got to make a living","review":"Mr. Colton: 1) don't assume all native americans are alcoholics 2) don't assume were all on welfare or get federal assistance 3) don't assume we all live in dirty neighborhoods 4) don't assume we all play basketballSome of us have gone out in this world an proved that we can be successful in government,medical or whatever career we chose. My advice to Mr. Colton is not to judge the rest of us by one individual storyline. Rez life is what you make of it! it can be a good or bad place, just like any orther place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look up \\"hubris\\" in the dictionary","review":"And you'll find a picture of Larry Colton. I'd think 15 months would be long enough to find out Montantans can READ. At the very least he could have changed the names of minors before discussing their intimate lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary book","review":"Larry Colton tries hard to remain objective and detached in writing his account of life on the rez, and of Sharon LaForge's attempts to transcend it by excelling at basketball. He fails miserably in his attempt--getting caught up in Sharon's struggle, telling us about his own life, injecting his opinions about how the coach should be coaching--and the book is infinitely better for it. An objective, detached account would not have been nearly as effective and affecting. We really come to care about Sharon, as Colton did, and root for her, and are crushed when things don't work out in the heartwarming way we've come to expect from innumerable sports movies. You don't have to love basketball, or even like it particularly, to love this book. It's as well written and dramatic as the best of novels, but it's far more memorable than most novels because it's true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homophobic Trash without Question!!!","review":"For anyone who thinks Welsing has a brain in her head, please read Essex Hemphill's \\"If Freud were a Crazy Colored Woman\\" in his collection \\"Ceremonies.\\" Welsing positions herself as a saviour to the black community, yet she will trash black gay men as if it were nothing. If a person of any race or gender said about black women what Welsing says about black gay men, you couldn't nail her down to her seat. This is the most oppressive text I have ever read. It is full of passe Freudianism and obsessive thinking about the phallus. I am a worse-off person for ever learning that this book exists.

A sycophantic author is trying to serve herself, harming at the same time the whole society. It should be sold with a note that it represents ONLY the author's delusional imagination! It is nothing else but a fallacy and -- as someone underscored it already -- a manifesto of afro-nazism. One of the most stupid books ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Isis Papers-Keys to Colors","review":"I thought that the Isis Papers was an interesting attempt to examine the impact of white racism on the mental health of Black people living in America. Dr. Welsings examination of symbols, words and phrases and their use to portray white people as superior to none-white people was also thought provoking. Are these created symbols and images of white superiority really impacting on Black chidren's view of themselves?Dr. Welsing's assertion that there are hidden pychological motives behind why white people have historically oppressed and presently oppress people of color too is worthy of consideration. Though one may not completely agree with the Dr.'s conclusions as to why white's have historically strived to dominate non-white people one cannot not deny that it is a historic reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find the Keys...","review":"Dr. Cress Welsing's book digs into the fabric of White Racism and Supremacy and gives the reader something to think about. Why does society work so hard to keep Black America down? Why do we as Blacks have so much self-hate in a land where we are not wanted and are being systematically destroyed? Why don't Whites give a real version of what has transpired in history? The answer is simple: we must learn the keys to the colors and understand the symbolism that has us as Black people trapped in a quagmire of lies and deceptions that are destroying us as a people. You would not know that Blacks were the first people on the Earth building dams, roads, and ships by the way we act today. The youth are in a worse situation: teen pregnancy, black-on black crime, and unemployment will spell an untimely end for the world's oldest people if we do not learn and teach THE KEYS TO THE COLORS to our people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeeeze!","review":"The absurdity of this book will leave ANY intelligent, educated person completely speechless....regardless of their race.

I don't mean \\"matters\\" in the sense that we shouldn't be proud of who we are. I mean \\"matters\\" in the sense that \\"white\\" is inextricably opposed to \\"black\\" and vice versa. Dr. Welsing sees \\"white\\" America as locked in a strategic game plan to dominate, subordinate, and destroy the lives of African Americans. She expouses the view that African Americans can only improve their lives by realizing this simple truth. This is a \\"truth\\" that I don't buy. If you're interested in a thoughtful approach to racial healing and reconciliation, this book is not for you. If you believe that people, regardless of race or color, should live and work together in harmony, there are plenty of other, better reasoned, and more thoughtful books to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"twisted in every way","review":"one thing I've wanted to know is why do Afrocentric people follow the belief that one drop of sub-sahran blood makes a person black only when the group has done something (alegedly) \\"positive\\"? If the Moors of Spain were negroids as the author of this book claims, and that they are responsible for making the Spainards of Southern Spain darker, then, by the authors logic, the Spanish who comited those terrible autrocitys in South America were actually BLACK men, and the Indians of South America should hold BLACKS accountable, and no one else.

I figured I'd give the book another chance, perhaps my older self will find something I hadn't appreciated before.NOT!This book reads like sci-fi to me. The author reaches \\"conclusions\\" that are in, fact, obvious to anyone living in America: there is racism and darker-skinned people suffer it most. Oh, really?If you want to read a homophobic, woman-bashing, sci-fi pontification on race relations, and would like to be entertained, by all means buy this book.

This is another pathetic attempt to make white people(white men mostly)feel bad about themselves.

Years later, I've finally read the book and it has explained many things and clarified my view on racism. It explains the 'conquering Christians', the systematic destruction of Native Americans, and the sudden appearance of crack cocaine. It explains why after every major pullback in the DOW, several white people take nosedives to their death. If you disagree with this book, you are part of the problem or you can not handle the truth. Point blank, if you are truly superior, then the truth is self evident; you do not have to constantly try to prove your worth, your superiority by death, destruction, and domination. You do not need to make political and scientific propaganda regarding how great you are. You do not need to create weapons of mass destruction bringing a world, that you did not create, to the brink of destruction.

I would reccommend other authors with more integrity from the African Diaspora such as Henry Louis Gates Jr.. Kwame Anthony Appiah, Cornel West, Derrick Bell, among others. Welsing is on the par with Leonard Jffries in her biased pseudoscientific racism that doesn not benefit anyone except those that wish to cultivate perpetual anger and vicious circles of hate in their hearts instead of exploring avenues to solve the current heinous realityof mutual hatred and distrust that has infected many groups in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Timely","review":"It is interesting to know that this book was written in the 70's.

The car never worked properly. I called Safety First, who sent me another car, which I assembled and charged the battery for 16 hours. The girls (excited again about their new toy) jumped in and it made it about 10 feet and stopped.

As a teacher, I know that music is a powerful way to reinforce learning -- the music here is a missed opportunity.There is so much potential for this kind of series, but this one seriously falls short.

I pray to keep it that way and say: Never Again.Though not directly in the film,from a contemporary political perspective, one can only realize the necessity of a Jewish state (Israel), which was formed from the ashes of the Holocaust, to protect its own people throughout the world from such a tragedy.I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the first","review":"The reviews I read said it wasn't as good as the original.

By all means read this if you like Star Wars, but expect to be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and very entertaining reading.","review":"Well written, with lots of twisting plot. This book has it all - from characterization to plot. We gain tremendous understanding of the events leading up to the War on Naboo, insight into many of the major players in Episode I and II, and lots of historical bits about the Jedi Order.The writing style Mr Luceno employs is quite a bit more advanced that many other prequel books, which are mainly targeted at intermediate readers. This is a book worthy of Tom Clancy or Le Carre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of intrigue and twists","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this book, but after reading it, I was not disappointed.First of all, it is not adventure! Very few battles and although the Jedi are involved, very few lightsaber duels. It is, however, the lack of adventure that make this novel intriguing. It moves with a fairly quick pace, and has more twists than a spy novel. It was a joy to read, just trying to figure out what would happen next.This novel also is the perfect set up to Episode I. It describes why the trade federation does what it does, what was the problem with Valorum's leadership, and why Palpatine just happened to be chosen as Supreme Chancellor.I must recommend this novel because it is indeed different from the other SW novels. That difference is refreshing and hopefully we'll see more novels driven by character rather than sheer adrenaline."},{"rating":"1","title":"More plot than people","review":"I have admired James Luceno's work on the Robotech novels and he sets up the situation well, but it just declines gradually from there, becoming needlessly convoluted, melodramatic and predictible in the end. There is not alot of personal investment of the characters in their story. The story does not advance the mythology referring to the main characters--Obi-wan, Qui-Gonn, Anakin, or Amidala--even though they all make appearences. It is just the standard sword-fighting stuff. It could have been better if they would have just focused the main conflict down to Qui-Gonn and Obi-wan vs the antagonist--Cohl and his terrorist cell--to the bitter end. Perhaps they could have thrown in a Fallen Jedi or two on Cohl's side to make things really dramatic with a battle royale at the end. Rogue Planet is the best of the Star Wars, with Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter coming in second. This one is a distant third. Basically, it was more political plot than people."},{"rating":"2","title":"stars wars rules","review":"this book came on time and was in good shape.

There is no neato Science Fiction in this novel. It is almost as if someone gave the guy a template for a story, told him.. \\"This is what must happen, how you make it happen is your business..\\" and he started writing. The book reads like a term paper in the Star Wars universe. We never get a glimpse in depth to the motivation of Qui Gon or Obi Wan. Why are they Jedis? Why do they consider certain people their nemesis? Why bother? Any of the short stories included in any of the TALES FROM: series of Star Wars book offered more characterization, more neato Sci Fi gadgets and ideas, and more alien cultures and even more PLOT than this novel.

To me, this book was a little slow and took me a while to read because there was never really a point in which it \\"grabbed\\" me and made me want to read more.

Yet Father Seraphim is an Elder of Orthodoxy who clearly draws his understanding of the toll houses from true Orthodox understanding, not a westernized rational approach. The toll houses certainly exist. The Orthodox believe that it can take up to 40 days for the soul to ascend through the different toll houses, which is why for centuries and centuries the 40 day memorial services have been held for the departed souls. The great monasteries of Mt Athos have many icons depicting the journey of the soul through the toll houses. Be aware of what you read today that goes under the guise of Orthodox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very convincing","review":"I thought this would be a nice book to compare to the teaching of Fr. Seraphim Rose, possibly to gain a better idea of this particular teaching. Simple fact is this book is not well written or argued, in my opinion, and there are many accounts in the monastic stories that support an \\"Aerial Toll-House\\" phenomenon after death. Of all the wrong teachings why would the author single this particular one out? this is not a teaching that would lead people astray if it werent true.when reading this book i felt like it was more of an attack than a theological argument. i wouldnt recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Armchair Ascetic","review":"This is not worth the paper it is printed on. There are a litany of saints in the Eastern Orthodox Church that subscribed to the toll-house model which serves splendidly to illustrate the Orthodox teaching of further spiritual movement after death. The bottom line is that most contemporary Orthodox armchair theologians (and remember, in Orthodoxy a theologian is defined as one who prays, not as one who studies theories on the interior life!) are in awe of the influence of Father Seraphim's life and EXAMPLE on contemporary Orthodoxy. A brilliant and fearless ascetic who sacrificed everything for union with Christ (something rare indeed in Western culture!) he truly embodied what he taught.

There have been several throughout the years, but E-Ring was definitely in the top 3 along with \\"Tour of Duty\\" and \\"JAG\\".A better cast of actors could not have been picked to play in this series.It absolutely amazes me that a show of this calibur, along with the cast didn't make it through the first year, however, they come up with all of the ignorant reality shows and that garbage stays on tv.I guess there is no accounting for taste.I have been waiting for E-Ring to come out on DVD since it stopped airing.A brilliant show!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure relaxation","review":"This is a CD that i can call a masterpiece.

All the tunes are pleasurable but there are three genuine pearls to the ears: Cory's song, Pardon my appearance(my favorite song) and My love, a inebriant reggae.

The pure, unadulterated and pointless misery of the French soldiers. The inevitable idiocy of the generals who were no shining examples of military brilliance. Packed with great insights that I discovered from reading this book. Why did the Americans not read this before they went 'in country'? Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another book over Vietnam","review":"Really good book about the First Vietnam war, one that tends to be overlapped by the Second one and the massive intervention of US-Forces.

A very detailed history for anyone interested in this historical period or military history."},{"rating":"2","title":"astute observations -a preview of the U.S. Vietnam War","review":"Bernard Fall's unbiased observations and descriptions are right on the mark. The mistakes the French made in fighting the North Vietnamese did not disuade U.S. policy makers into making the same mistakes. Fall captures the average soldiers position as well as could be expected. It is clear that the French were fighting a no win situation. If U.S. Policymakers read the book (which was published prior to U.S. troop commitment) perhaps they could have avoided forcing U.S. troops into fighting a loosing war. A must read for any leader prior to commiting troops to fight an \\"inferior\\" enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Book to Read","review":"Before you undertake the now historical period of America's engagement in Vietnam, read Fall. First read Street Without Joy, then Hell in a Very Small Place. You can't fully appreciate what we got into unless you have a knowledge of the French successes and ultimate failure. Last year was the 50th anniversary of the French withdrawal. This is the book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning unheeded","review":"It's heartbreaking to think how differently the twentieth century might have ended had the powers that be in the U.S. read and, more importantly, paid attention to this book. Bernard Fall describes brilliantly the strategy and tactics used by Vo Nguyen Giap and the Viet Minh against the French. These tactics changed very little from one war to the next yet we, forewarned (assuming we had read this book), walked right into it.This is a classic example of the old axiom that he who fails to learn from history is doomed to repeat it.What I found particularly disturbing about \`Street Without Joy \` is Giap's description of the evolution of his enemies' tactics; an initial offensive, slowing and turning into a defensive war with a growing amount of public sentiment against involvement. Does this sound familiar?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Fall was simply an amazing Journalist, Professor, and man....","review":"This book is the most important book written on Vietnam prior to the direct involvement of the Americans in this theatre of operations. It was never truly employed on a wide scale by the American military and Dr. Fall was literally ignored by both the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. There were of course several officers in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines that did take note of the effects of this book on how they handled the sphere of war within Indochina; two of these officers were Lt.Col. Hal Moore and General \\"Brute\\" Krulak. A lot of Americans could have been saved further had the Administration of the time employed Dr. Fall for recommendations of procedure through the high and low country parts of Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another side of Annie","review":"So you love Rennaissance and Annie Haslam's perfect voice?

He wrote this book during the late Cold War, which makes its general fairness all the more impressive. Don't be fooled by the title, which sounds like some sort of role-playing game--this is a keeper.There are numerous funny stories in this book. Tolley, who spoke (perhaps present tense; word is he's still around) fluent Russian and adapted to Russian culture rather than attempting to bend it into something Americanesque, genuinely liked the people of Russia. He has done a fine job of separating this from his views on the Soviet political system, giving us a very fair portrayal of Russians (and to a lesser degree other USSR ethnic groups).This would be a fine read for anyone planning to visit Russia. While the politics have changed a lot, the culture has changed far less, and this book would help the visitor to appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$$$$","review":"I've always used Avery Glossy or Office Depot Glossy card stock and produced beautiful cards.

It is full of errors, some of which matter little to the overall content, but some matter a lot! There is no excuse for any errors in a book where technical accuracy should be the first priority.Answers to questions in the practice exams are not always correct. The section on subnetting sacrifices mathematical accuracy at the cost of trying to make it easy to understand. There are many errors in the text as well. As a study guide, I found this book entirely unreliable.The included CD-ROM does nothing to redeem this publication. The same errors are present in the electronic version as in the paper copy. The interactive study guide is brimming with HTML programming errors.I wasted my money on this book, please don't waste yours.

There are, indeed, lots of mom blogs on the internet (which one can read for far less money than the price of this book)and hers is certainly not the funniest. I was also hoping that the book would deliver on its title and provide amusing anecdotes about what it's like to be a SAHM in Europe, but she mostly failed me there as well.

The humor in this book made me wince because I knew the author was really trying, and I was rooting for her, but she just was not funny. I also just completed the Happy Housewife by Darla Shine and I laughed and cried through that whole book, so I think that spoiled me for S.A.H.M I Am.Maybe lots of mothers will see themselves in this book, but I am not amused by not cleaning your house. Maybe when you have a newborn, but not after that.

Songs like TLC's \\"No Scrubs,\\" Destiny's Child's \\"Bills, Bills, Bills,\\" and Mariah Carey's \\"X-Girlfriend\\" will make you nod your head in agreement or make you wince. Her frank and honest lyrics don't beat around the bush, and they show that Kandi herself may have had her share of drama in relatiosnhips. I bought the album, hoping she would expand a bit and reach beyond the \\"my-man-is-a-loser\\" lyrics. The album's true gem is \\"Don't Think I'm Not,\\" which is about a scorned lover who gets revenge on a cheating man by \\"getting hers,\\" too.

The book is not, nor does it claim to be, the definitive reference on military insignia during the WWII period. It is a solid secondary reference source though, and contains a great amount of information conveyed through excellent illustrations and interesting text. The major and minor participants are covered in a clear format that makes searching out specific information quite easy, although a \\"beefier\\" index would have helped. All in all this volume is an excellent addition to my \\"library\\" and would easily find a home in collectors and history buff's collections. Besides, where else could you find the rank insignia for a Captain of Engineers in the Finnish Navy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AC adapter","review":"This adapter is bulkier and takes up more space on an outlet than the smaller Nokia brand adapters.

I bought this to supplement my learning and it was not helpful because this cd is actually an intro cd for various languages and not just Vietnamese.

The author makes his case for not medicating kids through personal stories of several students at his school as well as siting some scientific research. He also gives his opinions, and clearly labels them as so. This book is not a how-to book to turn to if you are the parent or teacher of a restless child. However, it is a book that will give some insights surrounding the larger pictures of how we as a society educate some of our more difficult children."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I really like memoirs and I really tried to like this one, but I can't.

For the overall album 85% of the songs are easy to listen, fast moving beats but still easy to memorize the lirics.

(So far I have been to Yosemite... but I still have hope to get to the other 23).Bottom line, Tim is a truly amazing nature and wildlife photographer. His images alone will inspire and motivate you to make a travel plan like I did. What's more, his ability to write far outshines the competition. The book contains useful instruction on general technique, as well as specific advice on when and where to go in each park. His text is filled with practical, helpful tips - the kind of information you would really use. I found myself jotting down notes again and again as I read through his advice and instructions.If you are a nature lover and photography enthusiast... if you find yourself at your greatest place of peace and tranquility when you visit our national parks, you'll love this book. It's a true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide from a popular pro photographer","review":"In addition to being an excellent landscape/nature photographer, Tim Fitzharris is an accomplished writer. This is a very comprehensive book with lots of details on the parks, the best times to visit, and, of course, the best photo opportunities. The only slight negative is that this was written in the days (not too long ago) of film, therefore, there are no comments relative to digital photography. My interest was more in the area of learning about the parks so this did not really bother me. There are plenty of general books and articles on digital landscape photography, if you need that additional dimension. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY! The New Bathory Album is Out!","review":"I've been waiting a LONG time for the new album from QUORTHON/BATHORY and it finally came out. I ordered this the DAY it was released here on Amazon.com and it was sent to me in under 5 days! Needless to say, this new CD is Killer! The songs vary from theme to theme. Some songs sound like Hammerheart/Twilight of the Gods, some like Octagon, some like Under The Sign Of The Black Mark, etc. QUORTHON/BATHORY really outdid himself on this CD. My only real complaint about this CD is that the vocals on the very first song are REALLY low and hard to make out. Also, the very last song (I'm referring to the 13th track on this CD, which is the 13th CD by QUORTHON/BATHORY, coincidence?) ends abruptly, like my CD might be messed up or something. Unsure...? Would like to hear from others that bought the CD to see if their last song is weird as well. Regardless, I HIGHLY recommend this CD!

Just a few feathers at first. However after another month they are now everywhere. I vaccuum them up every few days and there are balls of them under the bed and all over the house. I took duvet off the other day and the feathers are coming out all over the comforter. It is horrible! This is an aweful down comforter.

They get all over my boyfriend's shirt while he sleeps, he wakes up sneezing its horrible! I was pleased at first ive had this duvet for a yr I only dry clean it about every 3 months, I wash the Duvet cover once a week. Now I am on the hunt for a new one and believe me I will not be buying this brand anymore. I do not recommend I paid 215.00 for it and the way I see it , you might as well pay the full 600.00 for a QUALITY DUVET.

Don't buy it if you want it to last..."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice..... for awhile......","review":"It really is a nice warm comforter, that is, for a few months. We've had ours exactly 1 year now; and after just a few months the feathers began relocating out of the \\"true baffle boxes\\" into every corner, and none were left in the middle. We've tried shaking and fluffing back into shape, but shortly after the same thing happens once again. It doesn't leak feathers outside, but it also doesn't act like a $300 baffle box comforter, which is why one would buy this- thinking the feathers would stay in place and not leak out of the sewn in boxes. Hmmm...Trying to find warranty info is a real chore- for royal velvet warranty info you can try calling John at 626-960-6096; Iconix now owns royal velvet and this is the person whom I was told to call.

It's the same feeling you get when you see a pregnant crack-addict. A competition like this is a wonderful opportunity to create something original, memorable and to make an artistic expression. This film was painful to sit through (I never thought seven minutes could drag on so long), the script was cheesy, and the plot contrived.

I respect the logistics behind gathering the vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. However, it reminds me of an interview with George Lucas where he criticized other Sci Fi movies who built elaborate sets and then spent a great deal of the movie showing off the set despite the fact that the story was not progressing. The story of Battaglia was nice, but this movie has been made before. For this competition I would like to see the film makers take more risks. This one did not. The story was formulaic and the dialogue was campy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for war movie junkies","review":"The film was pretty good although I don't have to much interest in war films.

This movie was difficult to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good things here but over all needed more direction","review":"concept was good. acting was too weak for the length of screentime they received. It could have worked if cuts were moved off of them faster. Was the old lady in some way connected--was she rescued..? Dialogue was also weak. The woman was walking along the wall at first--that was beautiful but that made me think that it was going to be her story--her history. Who the man at the memorial was there to honor was not clearly established--that was confusing. If he was looking for the pictures of his journalist grandfather to begin with then we could have connected to the jouranlist when we saw him. Who the \\"hero\\" was was not clear--I get that it was about them both but it is too short for us to have them both be the \\"main guy.\\" Director needs to establish a better sense of where they are going. The story made me want to know more about the battle. Could have been better but was a good start. Battle scenes were the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battaglia Smaglia","review":"I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with WWII, but the subject can never be done justice with a low bugit production. It's great that they found a jeep and a truck but that does not equal authenticity. The silly firecracker effects and cheezy dialogue sucks you right out of the film and reminds you why certain subjects should be left to Mr. Spielberg. It's clear that the creators of this film studied Saving Private Ryan to much for their own good. It was an ok attempt, but next time they should tackle something a little more within their league and not take themselves to seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"From my heart","review":"From my heart I thank The Tribeca Film Festival, sponsors, writers, producers, directors,cast and crew for filling a vast void in my life through the impact of this short film.

But if anyone really took the time to WATCH the movie they would realize IT'S BAD! First of all what in the world are nurses doing having a picnic with children on a battlefield?! And this couple that is touring the museum... why does the guy seem so shocked to find a picture of his grandfather there? Why was he so emotional when talking to the old lady if he didn't know his grandfather died there? And how did this old lady just happen to find that picture the soldier was drawing and hand it over to this guy who didn't even seem to realize it was his grandfather's drawing? And who is the old lady??? Was she one of the kids from the picnic??? The storyline is just bad!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff...","review":"This film reminded me of Brad Pitt--Real pretty to look at--but no substance.

But it's sappy, not very tight, and was obviously cut down from a longer film: otherwise how to explain why it's exactly 6:59 in a contest that allows films only up to 7:00?I guess a bunch of people will like this one, but truly I thought the only film that actually managed to keep my interest was the shortest: Coming Home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battaglia... a MAJOR FILM with substance!!!","review":"Since the talents involved with the making of this short film have succeded in literally every area of expertise with only a very small budget/timeframe to work with...I am excited and can only imagine the incredible outcome with details in place when this becomes a major film experience. This short film explodes with the pressure to be told to the world in a mighty way !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble","review":"Battaglia suffers from Hollywood-itis. Defined as a repackaged tired formula concept film that can not rise above the level of it's maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Minute Epic","review":"I loved this film & was intrigued by a couple of ideas floated out there briefly by the filmakers: did each of the modern day characters also have a grandfather that was in the battle? The woman says, \\"Papa\\" to Cox's photo...and the man's grandfather is the journalist. Interesting coincidence there. But the film was nevertheless touching. I am quite impressed with a war film being condensed into so short a time span, yet losing none of its heart. In fact, I think the brevity may have highlighted its heart, because it didn't get lost in a lot of big battle scenes.Great production values, too. Extremely impressive work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotic Journalism","review":"It is refreshing to see a producer reflect on the seldom recognized patriotic sacrifices of many of World War II's war correspondents.

Instead of an insiders guide to beautiful Baja California, they send a bumbling englishman, Ian Wright, on a trip to Baja. He seems reluctant to be there in the first place and seems to only be doing this trip to fullfill his contract with the Lonely Planet executives. He mispronouces most of the spanish words, and seems to be hung over during the majority of his trip. He's only half interested in meeting the people of Baja and learning about their customs and history. The video cover says the tape runs 44 minutes, but the last 15 or so minutes is the Lonely Planet peddling their other videos. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna travel with Ian !","review":"Different than most travel videos, this is a lively travel experience, focusing on things that I would actually do on vacation. Very adventurous, not pretentious.

Granted, it is a very different approach unlike the typical college foreign-language class. If like me you learned foreign languages previously by memorizing charts of verb declensions and things, this software will surprise you--and if you in fact do enjoy the details of grammar, this may not be a product for you. However, if you give this software a chance, it's very effective. You kind of have to suspend belief that it will work, but if you conscienciously use the software through the first 10 lessons, you'll be surprised at what all you can impress your Japanese colleagues or friends with. I was! I very much recommend it. It's not at all conventional, but it totally worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed after reading other reviews","review":"After reading the other reviews, I was excited about using this program. However, I am quite dissapointed. Perhaps it may be a good program for kids. However, for this adult learner, I found it quite frustrating. It is both too difficult and too easy at the same time, oddly enough. There isn't enough \\"meat\\" to hook one into learning. . .nothing is explained; it's all based on a concept of \\"natural\\" learning which may be fine if one wants to know how to say simple words in a new language.

But every so often the dog will get in a rambunctious mood when she sees another dog. Well there were many occasions she would rather quickly wiggle out of her traditional collars. I found this collar and I have never looked back.This collar actually fit looser on the dogs neck and will only fit snug when the dog pulls. The greatest part of this collar is that it tightens to a limit so the likely hood of ever choking the dog is very minimal. Anyone who has a dog that wiggles out of collars every so often has to try this style of collar. It is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premier is one of the best.","review":"Over the years I've bought and still own many Premier products. We have a couple of strong Bull-Dogs that need products made super tuff, these are! Some people maybe put off by that you have to adjust the collar each day to wear. I find this is better than breaking those plastic snaps. The adjustment insures a good fit every time and that's the part that makes this collar work, a good fit. Thank you -Happy dog walking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks cheep, works very well","review":"If you like to go for fancy collar, it might be better not to buy this. But it you prefer comfortable things, this collar can be one of. Much lighter and smoother than metal chain half choke collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous collar","review":"I had to cut this collar off of my puppy this afternoon. He got the center part of the collar with the ring in his mouth and as he struggled to get it out of his mouth, he choked himself making the collar so tight that I couldn't even take it off. There's no quick release and he was screaming and crying as it was strangling him. We had to hold him still so that I could cut the collar off. VERY SCARY! The collar is a gentle choke collar and a good concept, but without the quick release it is none other than hazardous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collar","review":"This is a great collar if you have a pet that is hard to control. The loop on it is great for keeping the dog close by, like when someone comes to the door! It is also great if they aren't so good at walking on a leash, it keeps them from pulling you around because it tightens up and becomes uncomfortable for them to pull, but it seems more humane to me than a choke collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collar","review":"This collar was recommended to me by a pet trainer.

Walking her has done a number on my husband and I's shoulders. We were using a choke chain to walk her (she outgrew it), which was also trying, but it held her back better than this collar. She is a serious puller, so this collar is pretty ineffective for our situation. We are constantly adjusting it further up on her neck, but with her pulling, it always manages to move back to the furthest part of her neck. We'll give a pinch collar a try next..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Great price, works well. Take it off if you are washing your dog.

Similar collars sell for much much more and this one has the exact same quality.Has held up very well on our rambunctious one year old German Shepherd and was a great fit (we ordered a size Large).We paid for a brand-name Martingale collar and the size adjuster was always coming loose. Our dog was able to pull that old one off herself and chewed it in half. This collar does NOT have this problem. The adjuster slider (whatever you call it) is very firm and the collar has not gotten slowly baggy like the last one. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Webbing too think","review":"Ordered for small (13 lb.) dog for obedience class. Considering the size required for her small neck, the webbing is just too thick. It should be about 3/8\\" or narrower.

It is easily adjustable and the color doesn't bleed when you throw it in the wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collar","review":"I like these collars a lot. The one that I bought was black so I can't speak to the red vs pink controversy but I couldn't be happier. These slip on and it takes a little trial and error adjustment to get it just the right size but once on it stays. The harder the dog pulls the tighter it becomes - but it's has a limit on how tight making it safer than a conventional choke collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collar","review":"This collar allows for a choke collar effect without the danger of hurting the dog, putting the collar on improperly or hurting yourself. A really nice training tool especially for pulling or lunging on a lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best collar we've bought","review":"I really like this collar. My dog's trainer introduced it to me and it has done wonders with getting my dog under control in the park. He used to lunge at people in his harness and now he can't without consequence.

While it's obvious that Cheryl Dow is a professional woodburner - there was nothing professional about the production of this video. This is a home video with Cheryl Dow demonstrating some \\"advanced\\" techniques (i.e. not for beginners). In addition to the poor sound quality and cameral operation, the most disappointing part of this video is that it ends right in the middle of her demonstration - WOW!! We could not believe it - we even checked to see if our VCR malfunctioned because it's not possible to end a video that way.In conclusion, we're extremely disappointed that this video is offered for purchase on Amazon.com.

Easily one of his best songs ever, \\"...Kiss\\" is followed by \\"A Prisoner's Dream\\" (another Baerwald vocal, ragged but moving.)

Oh dear!On the positive side, Rue McClanahan has two hysterically funny scenes and the cast as a whole works very hard. But.........Perhaps it's me, but I just didn't find it that funny (except for the two scenes mentioned above), I thought the sound was dreadful, particularly the echo on one nun's mike during the last 20 minutes or so, the camera work was unexceptional and how old was that audience!

Once again, unless you are planning an all inclusive type of wedding at a casino, chapel or hotel, this book isn't for you. I was expecting the book to present lots of options. The book did give us a place to start with real uncensored opinions from other couples.

It DOES exist.","review":"I picked this album up because of one person --Grant Lee Phillips of Grant Lee Buffalo (and now solo) fame. I had reservations since Grant didn't act as lead vocalist. My other concerns came from the release date. I've never been a fan of much of anything from the 80's. However, I must say WITHOUT A DOUBT that I am continually impressed with this album. Although it has a much more poppy feel than what you would expect from other Phillips' projects, you won't find great songwriting or musicianship lacking. This is one of the few CDs in my collection that I keep coming back to listen to BEGINNING TO END! It's a shame more people haven't heard of Grant at all and even more a shame that HARDLY ANYONE has heard of Shiva Burlesque. This album may be THE saving grace of the 80's.

It dispells forever the stereotype of Hasidic Jews as \\"letter of the Law.\\" This book reveals the heart behind many Hasidic/Orthodox practices, helping any Jew to start where s/he is at and move forward at his/her own pace toward greater lov of God.The title comes from the famous quote by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov: \\"All the world is just a narrow bridge, but the main thing is not to fear at all.\\" Rabbi Kramer tells us how to cross that bridge to greater faith. He explains the heart of daily Hasidic practice in plain, use-friendly language, too.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"My friends and I generally liked this one, though we thought the ending was quite lame and uninspired. There's a really pretty lead actress, would like to have seen her in more films. Every actor did a fine job and the story was good up to the end where it kind of flopped. The picture was pretty good.

I'm guessing friends are writing reviews, because I spent hours watching the shorts that were submitted and truly feel this is one of the worst. My sister, when 10-years old, made a more compelling and creative movie with her re-enactment of the Attack of the Killer Tomatos.

It was disappointing to quickly learn that this was just the tired old theme of battling the devil for a soul...Charlie Daniels exchanging his fiddle of gold for a ping-pong table. I was rooting for this one, so I give it a 2. I just can't vote any higher because all other elements seemed mediocre at best.

Does he have connections at Heineken beer, or did he overlook a mistake that could cost him the contest? The fact that he set up the product placement shot with one of his \\"actors\\" told to stop right next to the Heineken placard tells me that there might be more going on than ineptitude.

But funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film gave me Ping Pong elbow","review":"I understand the choice of ping pong as something so odd that it is the joke itself, however, at some point the film maker seems to be taking the fight with evil a bit too seriously. This is a ping pong movie after all. If you are going to start out with an ironic look at the \\"seriousness\\" of ping pong, stay with that less than serious feeling throughout the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I didn't like this movie. The idea is unique, but I just couldn't connect with the movie. I found myself halfway into the movie still wondering why this precious little girl was inside a rowdy saloon and then allowed to follow a strang man through the woods. I'm glad the cute little thing ended up okay in the end, but it just seems like a weird way to contrive what I think was the message of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing/Acting/Casting","review":"The two stars are for the earnest attempt. But what gives with the editing? I don't care if one of the 4 or five genres this movie claims are comedy or farce or not, I Can't get over the editing, especally of the pingpong scenes. I watched this three times in a row and was never able to gett past the horrible acting in regard to the ping pong play itself. It's obvious these two guys have no clue how to play, but shouldn't at least basic skills have been a prerequesite before the filmaker cast them? It doesn't look like his was shot on film so couldn't the director roll long enough to get better footage than this? Did nobody involved understand at least the basics of pingpong? Know your subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossroads meets Forrest Gump","review":"The best of the bunch, hands down. What a refreshing twist on the \\"crossroads theme\\". And the main actor is pretty convincing as is the little girl. I really liked the part where the red ping pong table comes out of nowhere and slams to the ground. The whole scene with the dangling paddles and the movements of the \\"devil player\\" are a superb mix of comedy and horror. And the end scene is precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero Always Wins...Most of the Time","review":"This film was good as it contains The Hero,The Villian and The Innocent. I found this film to be grab my attention in the beginning and able to hold it through out. It had the unexpected and myterious in it.

Well done for a low budget movie.Mal. StevensLos Angeles, California"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute","review":"I knew this guy back in college. He's the guy (writer, director, whatever) who has cool ideas, has the motivation to produce them, and does so with impressive skill and humor. But that's about it. What was the point of the short?

Because I think that there are songs that are not as aggressive and fast as others (I really like fast tracks). The best songs are \\"Replicas of life\\" and \\"Reconquering the Throne\\".

I gave it a 5/5 (in my opinion) and I don't give a 5/5 to very many albums. I'm constantly looking for that next great metal album to listen to and time and time again I'm disappointed. Well with this album I've finally found that great album in Violent Revolution. Great riffs and well written catchy metal songs. This came out in 2001 and can't believe I'm just discovering it now. I can't believe Kreator has been off my radar since I was in high school when Coma of Souls came out. In discovering this album I went back and looked at all of the Kreator albums from Endless Pain to the 2012 release of Phantom Antichrist and their now one of my favorite bands of all time. If you like heavy metal and your tired of all the crap music (with the exception of a few) that's come out over the last few years, give this a listen.

The case also collects dust pretty easily so you have to open it up and clean it out frequently if you like your phone looking new and shiny.Overall a good, simple clear case that will protect your Pearl (although not the screen, you need some screen covers for that) but durability is pretty suspect so I'm going to try the carbon fiber case this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes in wrong place","review":"The item itself looked like it was exactly what I wanted and needed, however, when I recieved it, the holes for the buttons on the side were in the wrong location.

I read a review and it mentioned that these shocks are the generic version of Billsteins. I don't know if that is true or not, but the ride has improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A controversial but well written book","review":"Remember all the World War II movies where a handful of American or British soldiers mow down scores of German soldiers because the Allies are smarter? Ellis' argument here is that the Allies won the war not by being smarter that than the Germans but by outproducing them in war material by a huge margin. Ellis produces a substantial amount of evidence to support his claims. For example, the famous Luftwaffe bombing of London in 1940 cannot compare to the tremendous number of bombs dropped by the Allies on Berlin. Part of the reason for discrepancy in production is that the Allies, as stable democracies, were quicker to put their economies on a war footing. Unfortunately, the innovations they used to increase production beyond levels previously believed possible did not extend to military tactics. The result were higher casualties and a longer war than might have othewise been the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but is it still current?","review":"Like Ellis'THE SHARP END OF WAR this books is easy to read and provides a lot of incite in what I would call the \\"historical variation of WW2\\" which is the Germans didn't have a chance of winning. The book also points out this fact didn't lead to a quick or painless end of the war but to a long road to Berlin and Tokyo despite the Allies overwhelming material and manpower superiority over the Axis, and our ability to read the German and Japanese codes (ULTRA vs. Germany) so in many case we knew exactly what the Germans were doing and what their forces were and how they were deployed. Despite this the Allies made many mistakes that in the author's view extended the war and Allied lives.

Tampa is home to the legendary goth club the Castle as well the Genitorturers and more...once the home of death metal i would say it is now the home of the southern goth-industrial movement. As with any compilations there are a few lackluster tracks however the quality hangs tough throughout the quantity. Choice traks are from Grim Faeries(worth it alone for their track Love is Hell!), ShadowCraft, Hellon Earth and Butterfly Messiah. Some of these bands actually play live also so it's a great way to see what is coming up form the bowels of the southeastern darkwave scene. The artwork and package is very nice...digipak w/ gatefold sleeve and metallic print make for a wonderful addition to any collector of underground music. bwahahaha..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This is not a book for beginners. It is too full of mistakes, contradictions and academic hubris to rely on. The copy editor of this work should be boiled in oil. For example - the glyph for lasso is called a brazier.

The elemental, streamlined sound of nothing more than two men, one guitar and one harmonica is perhaps best described as minimalist Blues. Alan Hager is unbelievable in his control of the guitar, Bill Rhoades' skill with the harmonica is well-known and well-justified, and both artists provide complementary vocals. If the artists of the 20's and 30's \\"colored labels\\" were to come forward and record on cd, this is how they would sound. The final cut on the album is what CCR's \\"Graveyard Train\\" would sound like if it died and went to heaven.

True Selves is the most sympathetic approach to transsexuality I have ever encountered.

It is informative, unbiased and yet sympathetic to all persons involved in trying to understand and help a person decide what steps to take next after affirming his/her transgendered status. It offers scientific facts as well as personal annectdotes. It recognizes the genuine confusion, hurt and often guilt experienced by loving relatives. In other words, it offers support not only to the transgendered individual but to counselors and family members as well.This is the only book of its kind that I have found, so I have nothing to which to compare it.

The authors claim to be counselors who decide if transsexuals should be allowed to have sex reassignment surgery. They claim to be friends and advocates of transsexuals.

The book cover says \\"For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals\\".It is that and so much more. It is a great resource for learning or teaching about trnassexualism. But, it is also a great guide for those who are transgender or transsexual. It covers personal feelings, the feelings of others and also how to transition from coming out to the ultimate step of sexual/gender reassignment surgery. It discusses coming out, hormones, living full-time and covers every aspect of what is means to be transsexual.I cannot say enough about this book.

He plays beautifully as always, but the sound of the piano is awful. In the \`hi-fi' world of recording there are sometimes strange ideas about how instruments should sound. On this particular recording the tone of what is in all likelihood a beautiful instrument is ruined by a poor job of microphone placement, and the poor taste to include far too much room ambiance in the mix. The end result is that of sonic mud. The piano sounds exceptionally bad in the mid range - clouded by disturbing phase problems, and being nearly unlistenable. One can only hope that someone will have the sense to re-record and release this, as the performances are apparently recorded to a MIDI system that allows playback of the piano without Mr. Hyman present. All in all this CD is a terrible waste of a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Flute Originals Performed by Alison Young","review":"Alison Young, a marvelous flutist and Principle Flute of the Houston Ballet Orchestra, demonstrates her poise, technical security, dazzling precision and virtuosic flair in MUSIC FOR ALL TIME, American Music for Flute and Orchestra, 1998 Albany Records.

Secondly, it's not always easy for a baby to figure out what needs to be done. Get the mouse to the upper left corner? Connect the dots? A baby just wants to push buttons or move the mouse around.Finally, and I know this is my own personal bias, I think the animation is too primitive and the JumpStart Bear's voice is saccharin-y to the point of being creepy -- similar to PBS's Noddy but not so cute.We have several different baby software packages, and Reader Rabbit is far superior to the JumpStart product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Toddler I know wants only Weeder Wabbit Baby","review":"There are many things that I like about this software, but our 17 month old has no patience with it.

The personal portraits of the Chavo (punk rocker), the Tragafuegos (street performers who do firebreathing!) and the Guera (beauty queen so to speak) were beyond brilliant.

Very Fellini-esque in a Mexican sort of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mexicans","review":"At first I thought that Mr. Oster hit the nail on the head with his first couple of chapters but then as I read more I became disappointed with his negative view of the Mexican people. Mr. Oster spent most of his time pointing his finger at all that is bad with mexico and not seeing the country for what it truly is, to bad Mr. Oster wasted his time, maybe the new Knight-Ridder bureau chief will see the beauty in the people and have the sensitivity to realize that Mexico is Mexico and not the United States.

I grew up with his unique and melodic phrasing, and couldn't await the release of his new album...He does not sound like the same guitar player. These songs are predictable with a flat-line delivery. A bit of electronicapercussion and the same sort of flange effect on his voice, on every song gets old. I'm sorry Johnny, you will forever be my favorite guitar player but this new album represents nothing of your days gone by, regretfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Roses B-sides","review":"What a shocking dissapointment. Love the man and his former work, but this is.........really..........weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"I picked this up for one dollar in a used record store. I paid too much. It's terrible. Johnny Marr needs to embrace his inner jangly guy, not run from him. Now we know who the real genius of The Smiths was, and it ain't Johnny Marr."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"Maybe Johnny Marr wanted his name to be added to the long list of musicians who were once great, but inexplicitly went stale either forever or in spurts (Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, Prince, etc.).The perplexing thing about this CD is that Marr wrote some of the best music in rock history, nearly 80 songs in just four years - a vast majority of them excellent and ground breaking. How does a person just turn that off? Even though Electronic was good, I always got the sense Sumner was the real talent behind the show - they always sounded more like New Order than Johnny Marr.This CD may have confirmed what was suspected all along - Marr's best days are behind him. Still, Marr has never totally sucked or hit rock bottom, it is just that when compared to his other work, this CD is pretty slight."},{"rating":"1","title":"plodding, unimaginative, ultimately painful","review":"this is the first recording of his that seems almost completely bereft of that trademark marr magic-the impeccable songcraft, the tasteful guitar fills, the lush textures. instead, it sounds like a callow attempt to copy oasis at their most bombastic. i heard johnny's been close to the gallagher brothers, but musically i don't think his strengths have ever had much in common with theirs. he should go back to hanging out with bernard butler, the true heir of the marrsian tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappintment","review":"I can't believe that this is the same man who inspired so much of my own personal approach to pop guitar playing. I don't know what he's going for, but he should stop. I was so excited to hear this album, to hear Marr without Morissey, having heard Morissey on his own, and it truly upset me with every track. I actually threw this cd into the garbage (something I have never done before). Johnny, think more about your guitar playing than your clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yet","review":"Wow!The words Johnny Marr and Genius sure get tossed around like pennies at a wishing well. He is an adept texturalist with the guitar and a solid writing partner (no doubt) but a genius? I was eager to sit down with this CD because I wanted to hear what he would do left to his own devices. I discovered he has a voice that is easily enjoyed and he has a nice sense of melody. I found nothing interesting about the rest of his band; they seemed distracted or (dare I say) bored. Ultimately I was a bit bored as well with the overall work however there are fine moments, if you think Johnny Marr is a genius try Steve Wynn's music, he's from a similar era and background but is a whole lot better at writing his own material and he plays guitar (very well) too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormously Disappointing","review":"I've been a Johnny Marr fan for years. He's undoubtedly gifted, likes to experiment and seems to be comfortable in the role of the quiet talent behind the flamboyant front man (Morrissey, Johnson and Sumner.)Historically, you could always count on one thing---if Marr is in the works, the album will contain at least one, really solid composition.In \\"Boomslang,\\" you'll find no such animal.This album is simply wretched...tired rock riffs, whining tenor vocals, banal lyrics and unmemorable production.Nothing against Marr--it's just a bad album. Even the best artists produce garbage on occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny, what happened to your talent?","review":"I bought this CD several months ago and I have sincerely given it plenty of time to try to like it. I have listened to it on long road trips, while relaxing at home, and I still don't like it. I am a big fan of \\"The Smiths\\", I own and love all of the albums, singles, and remixes. I also am a fan of \\"New Order\\" and \\"Electronic\\" and the other bands that Johnny Marr has teamed-up with. I had high hopes when I got this album, but I was not impressed with the dull and stale sound of this album. Johnny Marr's vocals are not good, but I don't mind them. The music is not what you would expect from the musical genius of the melodies of \\"The Smiths\\". The music drones on and on like a downtrodden heroine addict song. If you are considering buying this album, and you are looking for music like Marr's previous work, Don't, you will waste your money on this album. So Johnny, what happened to your talent? Did you give-up the musical ghost? Is the music really that bad? YES."},{"rating":"1","title":"undistinctive","review":"A Johnny Marr fan---this Johnny Marr fan---finds himself asking how one of the most distinctive guitarists in history could make such a bland, undistinctive record. There is nothing to set this record apart--nothing that would let you know of the HUGE talent that produced it. One could be charitable and call it 'understated,' but this listener just ended up disappointed. And I'm not asking to Mr. Marr to recreate his---what other word is there?---distinctive guitar work from the Smiths. Still, one expects more from a guy who may be the best all-around guitarist of his generation. Am hoping for more from the follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, I give it 3.5 stars","review":"This is the first proper solo album. Anyone who is a die-hard fan of The Smiths (as I myself am) will be sorely disappointed. That being said, this is a good album for what it is. Marr's guitar work, while not in the same vein as any of his Smiths work, is still awesome...he is still the master, especially when it comes to layering tracks and creating fantastic guitar textures. However, the songs all seem to be in the same tempo and get rather droney, without too much variation in the chord progressions. This is a good, decent album...nothing more and nothing less. For the definitive take on Marr's genius, run, don't walk, to the nearest record store, buy every and all Smiths CDs, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Late","review":"Being a big fan of the Smiths, I was pleased enough to finally see a Johnny Marr CD that I overlooked the mediocre Rolling Stone review. Big mistake. Take a listen to the Smith's song \\"How Soon Is Now.\\" Then play it 11 times, over and over. All of the songs on this album sound the exactly the same--it's virtually the same arrangement, the same guitar/drum/synth sound, without variation. Top that off with the fact that Marr can't sing very well, and cannot write lyrics (no, I didn't expect Morrissey caliber lyrics, but still.) Yes, he can play a mean guitar, but that's not the most unique attribute in the world of Rock n'Roll. Too bad he & Morrissey couldn't hook back up. HIS albums haven't been that good lately either."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much unexplained navy/intel jargon","review":"This is the second Gordon Kent novel, and I found the Navy jargon---MARI, comm plan, etc.,etc.--left me puzzled what was going on, with no explanation, and very distracting for an army grunt.Stopped reading both of them 50 pages in and never finished either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Tot was a big hit","review":"My son is 4 months old and my daughter is 3.

We used it several times a day while my daughter played in the pool and have used it at home since we returned.

She loved it and it is very comfortable to wear. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the baby could sit up higher so that I could be more of the water. I am short, so I did have to be carful not to have the water level to high for the baby. My husband did not have this problem because he is six feet tall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great for little babies","review":"I used this water carrier with my first daughter, and I always felt like she was just sort of dangling in front of me. Also, it wasn't that comfortable for me to wear her this way. I just bought a water wrap baby carrier (baby faces toward my chest) for my second baby, and I am much more pleased with the snug fit. If you have a super active older baby who likes to face outward and can tolerate an awkward fit, this might be your product. But if you prefer a snug fit or have a smaller baby who likes to be close to momma, this isnt' the best water carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks dangerous to me...","review":"You can't adjust for depth of the water. This is semi safe in a pool...maybe ok, and deadly in an open water setting like a lake, river, or ocean. If the water rises or you slip, in goes the baby. Even in your arms you could raise the child over your head. I would never buy or recommend a product like this. Floating seats are FAR safer.

While theoretically the converter reduces voltage from 230V to 120V, my daughter's hair straightener overheated and melted the adhesive holding the heating elements so the straightener was ruined. My only thought was that 50Hz frequency of the power overseas could cause greater current draw for heating devices such as hair dryers, coffee pots, straighteners. The voltage converter cannot modify frequency from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. Most battery charging devices for laptops, cellphones, camera battery packs operate on 120/240 50/60 Hz and will not need the converter but you will need the plug adapter for the wall outlet. Look at the rating label on each device to confirm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - This converter will distroy your hair iron","review":"The description and documentation of this device is inadequate and dangerous. The 1600 watt setting only works with pure resistive devices (and how would you know). When I used it with the Farouk Chi hair iron, the electronics in the handle of the Chi smoked and burned, destroying the iron. There is no guidance or information provided indicating which devices will work with this converter and which will be destroyed.The 50 watt setting worked well with small electronics, but I hate to think what would happen if the switch was left in the 1600 watt position by mistake.My advice is to get a dedicated 50 watt transformer for your small electronics, not this device.I am still searching for a solution for higher wattage devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful, very very useful!!!","review":"i'm an international student in the states and the electricity system is totally different from here and back home. this little piece of equipment helps me use all my things from home without cable hassle or whatnot!

After it cooled off I examined it and the fuse was intact.

But this anything but a piece of yellow journalism or hysteria. Critically, Lyman's book, unlike many others, provides his own firsthand account of the agricultural industry but also -- and perhaps more importantly -- covers decades of scientific and medical research on the health hazards of meat, chicken, and fish, all in extremely readable prose. The book is scrupulously well documented and includes, at the end, pages of itemized citations to the medical and scientific journals referenced by Lyman.

Lyman's prior experiences as a cattle rancher and a feedlot operator give the reader a rare, behind the scenes look at the dirty business of factory animal farming. With an unquenchable thirst for profit, Lyman exposes an industry that shares a mutual disdain for its own employees, the animals it abuses, the environment it exploits, and the consumers which unknowingly defend it. Backed by big budget congressional lobbying, advertising blitzes, and intimidation tactics, Lyman portrays a greed-bent industry that rivals big tobacco in its capacity for human destruction. Fasten your seat belts; this is a must read for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, suprisingly short, to the point. Bravo!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how well paced and thought out the material was. It sets up a point, props it up convincingly and leaves it confidently at that. I was completely engrossed. Even those who mock or poopoo vegetarian living will be sucked into this book. Even if someone refuses to fully read into his straightforward points, it is an engrossing read. I was disappointed at how quickly I drove through it. The first chapter is a gutpunch of naked, unsugar-coated honesty-- Livestock are fed remains of livestock and euthanized remains of pets!!!) It then touches upon some of the grim effects animal products on our bodies and our earth and how shockingly/Unshockingly the FDA stands aside. I audibly gasped a couple of times while reading. Hm.

It certainly is good writing from an otherwise inexperienced (at the time of writing) author. And, best of all, it does come straight from the cattleman's mouth, so you know he has an understanding of the situation - that being factory farming. My personal favorite aspect of the book is how he doesn't foist his opinion on you; Rather, he uses persuasive argumentation and presentation of fact. It's not about the cow or chicken, but human health. I don't agree with all he says, but he certainly does comprehend, in my opinion, the 'nature' of chemically altered flesh and dairy, and how much of human suffering attributed to old age is likely due to diet. However, Cattle Rancher Gone Vegan (like a newspaper headline) would have been a better title, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book.","review":"This book should be read by everyone who cares about his or her health.The author was the owner of the second largest cattle ranch in Montana.

His story is a powerful one that will compel even the most obstinate carnivore to reexamine his/her food choices. What I liked best about this book is that he cites all of his points with solid sources like Nature, JAMA, and the like. This is in stark contrast to most vegan books that are thick on passion but thin on science.If you're tired of explaining to people that your vegan because you're compassionate, you care about your health, and you're angry that animal food production is stealing our future - then just give this book to anyone who asks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Truth from a Mad Cowboy","review":"This book is a real eye-opener about what you are really eating.

Liked the premise, liked the characters, did not like the execution. This book, the 1st of a 3 book trilogy had way too much talk and background info for my liking.

Good premise needed WAY WAY WAY fewer words.","review":"This trilogy could have been written in two, or even only one book. The author was extremely wordy, as if he was trying to fill up all the space given to him by the editors. The stories dragged on and on and on... and as much as I LOVE a good story about xenoarcheology I actually took all three books back to the book seller half way through the second book.The characters were believable, to the author's credit, but it just took too damn long to get anywhere of interest. Going in plot-circles just isn't my idea of a good time. I felt as though the editor and author got together and decided they wanted to make some extra cash by dragging out this plot line and I felt literally hoodwinked and cheated; that's why I returned the books. They probably figured because Q was involved, everyone would fall for it. I almost did.I have been leary of three-parters in the ST universe ever since.

For instance, Q shows Picard that he brought to the Milky Way Galaxy, one of the mostevil and powerful beings of all time. In a battle the Q-Continuum fought in, Q uncovers, the entire race of the dinosaurs is demolished as one of the causualties.

However, something prevented me from really enjoying this story - probably lenght of story and too much 'reference' of old events. Of course I love to recall/newly know those events, but it is sometimes stressful for me, unfortunately. Some of the 'next generation' story is worth reading 2 books or watching 2 hours , but I still love to watch one well-organized program. Hope another 2 books make me more comfortable.

The Enterprise crew was just there to play host but to what? The Q family was more like a weird offshot of the Addams family than a group of omnipotent beings. It was all played for laughs and the ending was more of a relief than a letdown simply because by that time I had grown tired of the whole thing and glad that it was finally over. What a charade!

It's an amazing piece of diverse yet unified sounds. FIF combines the best parts of ska and rock-n-roll to make their best album ever. Every song is amazing - here's my highly subjective list of the album's highlights: EVERY NEW DAY: FIF's best song, no doubt whatsoever. Possibly the best rock song ever recorded. The lyrics are beautiful. WHERE'S MICAH: Fun and hilarious. FISTFUL OF SAND: Incisive lyrics and music to match. Great symbolism, plus the only time Andy has ever sung on a FIF album. LITMUS: More great lyrics, rocking beat. HANDBOOOK FOR THE SELLOUT: A great way to start off the album - rock on. Of course, every single song is amazing, just buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mankind versus me...","review":"This is the best ska rock album ever the be made on this planet )or any other).

The group has found a more polished sound and some really insightful lyrics. Second Season (track 9) the only song on this album sung by Dennis, the trombonist, was also written by him and really conveys the heart of this band.

It's very hard to learn anything from it. All of the pages are someones terrible attempt of trying to draw instructions on how to do wire work. Because there are no actual photographs it's very hard to tell what your work should look like or if you are doing it correctly. The only photographs that she has are of the finished pieces, and there all lumped together on two pages. Altough the jewelry she makes is nice and the two pages of photographs that are there to look at are really nice, you have no idea of how to actually get to that point in creating them. I think this book would have been more worth while had she taken the time and extra money to hire a photagrapher to take pictures while she worked.

It is WAY to thin on the copper. I had a spool of RCA 14 gauge I ended up using instead.The MO for this kit is use thick jackets to make it LOOK like the right size, then use less copper.

They were not crimped, split, etc... they showed me, they stopped working in two weeks and put my amp into safe mode. I'm glad they didn't charge me anything except for the cables I bought from them. My stereo actually sounds better with their cables. I didn't think high dollar cables would make that big of difference in sound, but in this case they did.

Everything looked like decent quality when I opened the package but it was a different story with the install. Why would they sell a kit that is supposed to have everything but it is not all compatible with each other? What I found was the power and ground cable is not 8awg. Maybe with the thick jacket it is but the copper is not. If you use a proper crimper like I did, the cable will just pull right out. It is 10awg for the power and ground and the remote turn on is maybe 20awg. The kit comes with lugs that should work with the cable but they are way to big. I work with DC power for a living so I was fortunate to have the correct size lugs.The price is good but if you buy this kit you will need #10 yellow lugs for the power and ground and red for the remote turn on wire. The accessory bag is about worthless, I guess I did use a rubber grommet and a few zip ties out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing part","review":"It was missing the cable for remote control to turn the amp on/off as the head unit is on/off. Manufacture need to intensify their quality control or they will lose business. Depending on what you use this to connect to, the thickness is good enough for most use, unless those people who are into that kinds of stuff, which they should already know better to order a set the easy way, instead of go build your own set the hard way. Want quality, then be ready to pay the matching price including more hard work. It's target consumers are those of us who just wanted something to work with what we got at the cost we are comfortable paying, nothing fancy. I am not happy with this product because of the missing part, but, the truth is the truth and the truth is more important than any single one of us, including this unhappy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but only barely","review":"Bought this kit for install into a Neon. 300/2 JL amp, 8w7sub.

Some people may have gotten a 10 gauge wire, I do not know, but I feel Boss Knows their wire better than most of the people reviewing this item. I tested it against known 6, 8 and 10 gauge wire, and it was 8 gauge, exactly what it should be (maybe people are stripping off some of the wire when they strip it?). It stripped fine for me in my Craftsman strippers. All the other wires are also correct and of good quality. The power cable just fit from my trunk to me hood ( 94 Buick LeSabre) If you have a longer car you might want to measure how much you need. In the end I had a decent piece of extra speaker wire and extra remote wire. In hind sight I might have gone ahead and gotten 6 gauge or something, but this works just fine for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this kit primary because it promised 8 gauge wiring. When I received the package I was very disappointed that the so called 8 gauge wire is really more of a 12 gauge and certainly not something I would trust to carry 40 to 50 amps of current. The amplifier turn on lead wire is paper thin, again nothing I would trust using and the included speaker wire is also of questionable quality. About the only thing I liked about this kit is the fuse holder which plan on keeping when I upgrade the power cable to a true 8 gauge or even a 6 gauge wire. If you have a small system with one or two amps under 300 watts TOTAL RMS then this kit may be adequate for you. If your amplifiers are capable of more wattage then look else were as you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll need more then you think","review":"Purchased this kit to go withmy boss amp. As others said the power cable is definitely not 8 gauge. I didn't think this would be a issue as I only needed 10 gauge for my amp. Turns out this is a issue because all the connectors that come with the kit are meant for a 8 gauge cable. Because the cable is thinner then 8 gauge the large rings will not crimp properly and even worst neither will the fuse holder. I had to go out and get a large ring for connection to a 10gauge wire and purchase a fuse holder also for the smaller gAuge. In other words what I initially saved buying this kit vs A more expensive one I ended up spending anyway to make this one work. I strongly advise to Spend the extra money to get a better kit initially. With the proper connectors the cables do work so for that I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement!","review":"This kit has al the WRONG sized cable guages. The rca cables dont stay in my amplifier, the speaker wire is not even recommended for door panel speakers, and the ground wire and power cables are missleading.

I did however, expect it to work.I must say even though the wiring is more like 10 gauge rather than 8, the power and ground wire as well as fuse work very well. I have had no issues with those two wires.However the remote and speaker wires are junk. The remote wire is so small that it just stopped working within a month or less. I removed it and replaced it with 16ga copper wire I bought at walmart. The speaker wire finally went out on me another month after that and I have recently replaced it with GOOD 12 gauge copper speaker wire. The quality of sound is much better as well.The RCA cable works fine and seems to be good quality.So recap: good quality power and ground wire, horrible remote and speaker wire. RCA is fine.I would give it 4 stars if I didn't have problems with the other wiring.

I wouldn't trust the cables in this kit any farther than i can throw them. And they're hard to throw, cause they're all dangly and light. The RCA cable seems like it might be usable, and i can always use more zip ties, cable ends, and grommets. After seeing the quality of the cables, there's no way i'm using the fuse block that came with this kit.It would cost me more to return it than to just throw it away.

Everything works great and I would recommend this product to someone on a budget. Like many of the reviews have said the 8 gauge claim is a lie and I can confirm that too. Mine was a little smaller than a 10 gauge. As far as I can tell the sound is crystal clear through the RCA cables, the remote wire works, and the power and ground work for my amp.

If you want to run more than a 100 wRMS amplifier using this wire, it would be unsafe.The material used is copper-clad aluminum, which is less expensive, and less conductive than traditional copper. The catch is that you need almost twice the wire to make up for the conductivity difference.The actual wire diameter is roughly equivalent to normal 10 gauge, but since it does not use solid copper, so it should be rated at 12 gauge.Other components in the kit are of similar quality, just enough to function. RCAs are foil wrapped twisted pair, comparable to most low-end RCAs, but no complaints there. Turn-on lead and speaker wire are also undersized, but are less critical... since your amplifier won't be running more than 100 wRMS.If I had to do it over again, I'd buy Audiopipe or KnuKonceptz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit, worked perfect, everything you need","review":"This kit was a great buy for the money.

This is only 8 gauge wire if you're including the insulation, maybe. The speaker wire it came with is as thick as the wire on my headphones, there's no way I would put it on my sub. Really poorly made too, the power wire isn't even in the center of the insulation. Boss sucks, this product sucks, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I would not suggest ANYONE buy this wiring kit. The wires I got with my kit were very cheap and of poor quality. Without any effort I accidently broke the power lead to my radio by simply pulling on the wire a little bit. This wiring kit caused numerous problems for me because wires kept failing. Everytime I would try to splice a wire about half of what I spliced would just break off from being twisted.(it was THAT brittle). I think just about any other kit on the market would be better than this one. I almost never review products, but this one is so bad I felt that I needed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boss Kit-2 8 Gauge, NOT","review":"They advertise 8 gauge wire and all needed connections. Well it's 8 gauge \\"with the plastic coating\\"! The wire connectors are so lame they should go straight to the recycle bin. The RCA cord is twisted pair, but the connectors pulled off as I was running the wire under the carpet along the door sill's. Had to run and get a \\"Monster\\" twisted pair, and what a difference.

Buy local if you can for your sub needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"I installed this kit in my 1996 Chrysler Cirrus.

The only setback is that the quality of wire and fittings are terrible. I had to go and purcahse STREETWIRES crimp connections because the BOSS connectors supplied were just made of budget quality junk. A big thumbs down to the very skimpy P-Con wire. I decided to purchase a heavier gauge because the outer wire protective coating was very low quality and weak. If you are going to use a capacitor, the power wire is a good length and extra to spare, but the ground wire was very short. Usually I purchase STREETWIRES amp wiring kits because the power wire is already fused 6 inches on the cord battery lead and it's preassembled. The BOSS wiring kit, you have to do it all yourself. I guess I have been spoiled by higher quality amp wiring kits. Next time I will pay the extra for quality and just plain ol' nice looking wires. BOSS is definitely not on my next amp wiring kit list. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ITEM! I did, but I still decided to go ahead and get it. I figured that, for the price, you couldn't go wrong... well I was wrong. The 8 gauge wire looks more like 16 gauge when you see how thick the coating is. The small blue \\"remote\\" wire is so small of a gauge and breaks so easily that it might as well have no wire at all. The speaker cables wire is also incredibly small and difficult to handle (you'll probably need to do some soldering if you want these wires to hold together properly). The RCA's are junk. I plugged them into the back of the head unit and then unplugged them to adjust some of the wiring. When I did this, the male part of BOTH RCA Plugs (the inner positive wire part) broke off and got stuck in the female ends of the RCA Output on the head unit! These items are JUNK! BUY SOMETHING WITH SOME QUALITY! LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS, PEOPLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Like all other reviews, i will say it definitely is NOT 8 gauge, but if you're buying this to power a small amp it will get the job done.

I had read some of the other reviews that said the wires were brittle but thought it was either an exaggeration or a fluke, so I never expected that after I had striped the excessive amount of insulation off that the copper would literally crumble in my hands. I barely got the terminals on, and while the wires work I'm afraid to move them to much. As others have stated the speaker wire is way to thin and the RCA cables are only average. The only good thing in the package was the fuse holder which seemed to be of decent quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!","review":"This is NOT 8 gauge wire, it's 3/32\\" which is LESS than 10 gauge wire....I might has well used a lamp cord to wire my amp!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kit!!","review":"This is a very well put together kit, and it had more then enough of everything that I needed to install my amp and sub combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, not worth the low price.","review":"The tips on the RCA cable that came with this kit broke during installation.

However, a cousin of mine recommended me to change the gauges #8 for #4, just in case. So I had to replace practically the whole kit.

At such a low price I thought I could just use the RCA cables, fuse and holder, split loom, and turn on wire and it would still be a deal. Well I did just that. The RCA's were OK, the Fuse Holder seemed to be the same as all the others, the amp turn on wire was exceptional thin, but since it only carries enough current to tell the amp there is power, I wasn't too concerned. The power wire, though, was no only of poor quality, but just as thin as everyone described. I immediately ordered some Stinger wire(also from Amazon), which was of great quality. However, when all was said and done, I ended up paying what I would have payed for a higher quality amp kit, without the hire quality turn on wire and RCA's. Very dissapointed.

So i orderd this with a 1600 watt pyramid 2 chan. amp. about a mounth later of pulling way more than nessasary power i melted the fuse link and about cault my car on fire. So dont just listen to amazon do some reserch.Even as a noob in car audio I could tell the speeker wire was crap. Its about 90% insulation with like 2 strands of wire down the middle. The hot wire and ground look good but after awile started to oxidise in the fuse link. So then you lose good canection and have to clean your wire. the fuse link is about the only good looking ling in this kit and I managed to melt it too.

However, the supplied fuse is 30 amps which is about right for the wire size.

I purchased the entire set to use for home schooling, and when I started doing the experiments with my son ran into a lot of problems quickly. I took the books to a local science shop and they identified that many of the experiments were missing important components. An example: one experiment in one of the books showed how to make a battery using pennies, litmus paper and lemon juice. The battery never worked. According to the local science shop it never would work without some zinc. This was information was ommitted from the book. I found using these books to be very frustrating and wouldn't recommend them to others. However, I do have friends who like them a lot. So, I guess it is just a matter of opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you enjoy the cactus with the sombrero","review":"Most of the children and teachers pronounce the colors and shapes correctly but then comes the animated cactus with a sombrero on to mess everything up.

Would not recommend this video to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite CD of recent country convert","review":"My husband and I recently started listening to country music and we have been converted to its wonderful lyrics, music, and artists. I already knew some of Travis Tritt's music and had heard \\"It's a Great Day to Be Alive\\" on the radio. I decided to check out this CD. I loved it right away and told my husband, who claimed he wasn't a big fan of Travis', to check it out. Now both of us say it is one of our favorite CDs by far! From the deep, meaningful lyrics of \\"Best of Intentions\\" to the raw, bluesy \\"Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde\\", every song is a hit. Make sure to add this CD to your music collection, if you like country music or not, because Travis Tritt is one of the best and you don't want to miss the songs on this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Rock/Country's Main Man","review":"Another stellar CD from country's new outlaw. Travis has released CD after CD of unbelievable music and this one is not a let down, in fact it raises the bar once again that Travis has set and reset.Bouncing back and forth between acoustic gems, love songs and hard edged country this is a very enjoyable project. \\"Best Of Intensions\\" and \\"Love Of A Woman\\" are terrific love songs. \\"Modern Day Bonnie And Clyde\\" is a drivin' country song and \\"Down The Road I Go\\" is a classic country attitude song. The other 7 tracks are good as well. If I had a complaint it was that time passed too quickly while listening to this CD (a common problem for Travis Tritt CDs).Get this CD and you will certainly not be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD SOUND","review":"This CD of songs while ready for country radio just does not have a new sound for the country listeners. What we get, instead, is the same old Tritt.....putting us to sleep with the ballads. However, A GREAT DAY TO BE ALIVE is a catchy tune which does well on radio and uplifts. All in all, Tritt needs to get with the times. I was disappointed and do not recommend this CD as one of his best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down the road and down the tubes","review":"There are probably a lot of physically repulsive singers who find fame but Tritt wins best of show in any dog contest. Stillhe has an entertaining value when he's working hard. This album is just the sound of an aged artist's creaking bones. On \\"Just Too Tired to Fight It\\" he sounds like he means every word of the title. Aren't there any nursing homes in Nashville -- preferably one with a front porch -- Tritt could retire to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travis Tritt!!","review":"What an incredible album this is!! \\"Down The Road I Go\\" by Travis Tritt is an amazing collection full of entertaining and exciting songs and impressive, expressive, powerful, emotional vocals. This album is definitely what country music is all about. I highly recommend this outstanding CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beauty Milk is Better","review":"This glycerine has the consistency of K.Y jelly, which wouldn't be so bad, if it actually lightened. I have seen dramatic results using the caviar face cream and mediocre results using the beauty milk, but this did nothing for my skin but sit on it, creating this \\"oil slick\\" look that I didn't quite fancy. I developed hyper-pigmentation from a bad bout of hives which I unfortunately scratched to the point where I developed superficial scars. The beauty milk alleviated some of the scars, the caviar cream rid me of all my facial hyper-pigmentation, but the glycerine just appeared to be a very expensive moisturiser"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's really great","review":"It's obvious that this group has a lot of talent and really gives it their all beacause the music, lyrics and overall presentation of this CD are really high quality.

FIF's debut album is one of the best Cd's that I own. I put it on everyday when I make my hour commute to work through bumper to bumper traffic. I love how \\"Upbeat\\" it is and I always get a charge from listening to it. All the songs are great, but of course there are favorites. Anything by the trombonist, Dennis, \\"America and the Flowery Song\\". But don't get me wrong Reese (lead singer) is great and I cant stop laughing at Arnold, Willis and Mr. Drummond. Great bass and guitar work on track 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIF is for me!","review":"I love this cd! FIF sounds like \\"Reel Big Fish\\" and \\"Mighty Mighty Bosstones,\\" only better. The Old West, Anthem, Shut Up, and Combat Chuck are the best songs.I love the sound of Reese's voice, and the brass is excellent!You must buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars, from an alternitive fan","review":"There are many groups out there that started slow (newsboys, d.c. talk, etc.) and then really turned it on, but these guys were great from the start! From the catchy tunes of \\"Old West\\" and \\"Milestone, to the more thought-provoking songs like \\"Anthem\\" and \\"Beautiful America\\", this cd hits hard, and never slows down. With the inclusion of a little bit of humor (track #6) and an old Amy Grant song (plus some lyrics from other songs, such as \\"Third World Think Tank\\") this album is absolutely incredible. And when it all comes down to it, Five Iron didn't forget the most important ingrediant: the inclusion of our God and Father. I usually buy albums by groups like Jars of Clay (my personal fav.) and Switchfoot, but this is definitly the best ska album I own, even though it's a little old. I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than MxPx, or just etter than any band for that mater","review":"This album would be one of the bets purches I've ever made. The styles are very aproprate and so are the lyrics. The styles Ska-Punk are excellently put to gether in this very easy to listen to album. FIF would easly be the best Christian band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most capturing Cd's any ska band can have","review":"This was my first Cd ever, and out of the 300'some I now posess, it's still my favorite. It has an allure all it's own, with elements of most popular ska bands of today. The only complaints I can possibly have about it is that it lacks some of ska's musical roots. It has a stronger pop and punk background than the Reggae that some ska fans may be used to. Either way, it's an entrancing cd, it pulls you in and it'll never let go. This is one cd I'll never give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good ska/ska punk!","review":"For all the people that already know FIF: To me this is the best FIF album up to date. Even though the style is the same and some songs sound similar to songs from other albums I still like this album best - I don't quite know why!For the ones that do not know FIF yet: FIF is a popskapunk band, with lots of energy in their songs and also with a great lead singer (at least I like the voice). What I dislike is, that, compared to bands like Mad Caddies, there is a lack of variety. Almost all the songs have a similar structure, which usually makes a CD annoying after listening to it a couple of times, but for some reason this is not the case. I can listen to this CD over and over again and it doesn't get boring at all.After all, if you like Reel Big Fish, LTJ, Mustard Plug, Mad Caddies or whatever other band playing some nice popska, this definately is the right CD for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Pricey and Bulky","review":"This is not a good item. I purchased this to find the ultimate diaper bag, for easy use. It is very bulky and believe it or not...doesn't fit all that much. It does have the extension but let me tell you...that doesn't make that big of a deal. It is way to big to use on a dialy basis, and is not that easy to carry (I use the over the shoulder way), and doesn't have enough room for weekend trips. The side compartments are so narrow that it is hard to hold an extra outfit in there if you already have diapers in there. It will fit 10 diapers but after that and an extra outfit and a toy it already is over stuffed, even fully extended. And that is pretty much all we are using it for so far...my son is only 5 months and is breastfed so we haven't even attempted to put in bottles or baby food. For the quality of Baby Bjorn and the price that this is I really expected this to be a much better item. I am a big Baby Bjorn fan but this is really poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore?","review":"After hearing good things about these guys and checking out a few live clips on youtube I decided to purchase this album. I have a few issues with this release.1. The first half of the album is pretty much nu-metal. I understand that they went that direction toward the end, but half the tunes on here have a lame sort of Linkin Park feel. If I want to hear psuedo-metal I'll turn on MTV.2. Where are the lyrics? One would think that a band with a message might include a lyrics sheet with their 'greatest hits' album. I grew up on a steady diet of straight edge hardcore and I was really curious to see how the message evolved.3. Things get better as the album progresses. I wish they put the songs in chronological order instead of the reverse.If you are looking for a good harcore album I would skip this one. Buy one of their older releases instead. The good songs at the end of this release do not make up for the crappy ones that lead off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny's still here!","review":"There's age in this great voice and some of these songs emphasize the age. But the essence is still here, loud and clear.His opening cut, \\"I Won't Back Down\\", is the immortal Johnny C., making a powerful statement, followed with another powerful statement, Neil Diamond's \\"Solitary Man\\". The emotion really gets to one in his rendition of Frankie Laine's \\"Lucky Old Sun.\\"\\"I See A Darkness\\" and \\"Mercy Seat\\" do rather send chills, and one wonders it these two are not reflections of Cash as an older man. But there's sure some brightness with Johnny & Merle together on \\"I'm Leaving Now\\".\\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" is a somber windup to this album, but as a whole, this belongs right with his older recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic piece of American music","review":"Two things strike me about this album. First, that great voice: it has more subtleties, shading, nuance, grace and drama to it than any 20 new artists today (and that's not necessarily a put-down of new artists, just a fact). Second, his selection of material: he makes some simply inspired choices of songs, and doesn't just sing them, he interprets them and reinvents them into something his own. I think this trilogy, of which this is the third release, is destined to be a mile marker in American music. And God Bless Johnny Cash, because he did it his way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best collaboration of the Cash-Rubin team","review":"Truly the best album of the 4 American Recordings albums. Cash's versions of SOLITARY MAN, ONE or THAT LUCKY OLD SUN among others are incredible. It's not as touching as THE MAN COMES AROUND album because that was the last one but SOLITARY MAN is, on the music level, the best one. The songs that were picked are really good choices and Cash delivers amazing versions.Truly the high point of his late comeback albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny at his best","review":"The man in Black is at his best in this album. I'd recomend thi CD to anyone who even remotely likes Cash"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash strikes back!","review":"After the first time I listened to the new Cash album, American 3: Solitary Man - it occured to me that actually this should be Cash's American 2 album. In its musical atmosphere it fits somewhere between American Recordings and Unchained. The covers range from U2 to Nick Cave, and though are typically Cash. Very modest instrumentation, and intense emotions. After a long wait - a great album. And a really Cash album, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man in Black is Back!","review":"Though not as awe-inspiring as Cash's previous two releases on American (\\"American Recordings\\" and \\"Unchained\\"), this is another fine album from Cash, with a great supporting cast. I'm thrilled that Cash has recovered enough from his somewhat mysterious illness to be able to do one more record. The first couple of songs--\\"Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down and Neil Diamond's Solitary Man--don't quite fit Cash's voice, but buy the time he hits U2's \\"One,\\"--the album's highlight--he's rolling. This one is closer in style--choosing to focus on ballads rather than rockers--to \\"American Recordings\\" than to the more recent \\"Unchained.\\" This album will be an essentially for anyone who admires Cash and his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Dude, Johnny Cash is one of the greatest, and this album is no exception. It just gets better every time I listen to it. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man in Black Does it Again","review":"Solitary Man is an outstanding album. It is at least as good as anything he has done, including at Sun or on previous American Recordings albums. There is not a single song that is less than excellent. My favorites include One and Mercy Seat. The music of Cash is folk, country, pop mixed into one sound -- in short, just good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"He shot a man in Reno . . .","review":"When I first saw the song selection for this CD I wasn't impressed, but after hearing it I can hear once again how Johnny Cash can take any song and make it his own. While You Won't Back Down and Solitary Man are excellent, the real standout - and the song I had the most doubts about - was U2's One. Cash strips away the original's melodrama and emphasizes the song's basic emotion. This CD makes a fine companion to the first two American Recordings; I read that he and Rubin recorded over 90 songs, and I hope more see the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet music to my ears","review":"My favorite song of all time is Would You Lay With Me In A Field Of Stone and to hear Johnny Cash sing it is lovely. Tanya Tucker recorded it and so did David Allan Coe who wrote it, but Johnny sings it well too and it's so moving. This is a fine record and I also love it when Johnny sings about the Lord. They don't play Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton, David Allan Coe, and Merle Haggard and the other country legends much, but I can play this over and over and my grandchildren love it. Rest In Peace Johnny Cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLITARY MAN","review":"VERY GOOD DISC. ALSO HUNDRED HIGHWAYS & LEGEND OF JOHNNY CASH. I AM COLLECTOR OF COUNTRY AND WESTERN MUSIC FOR USE WHEN I HAVE EUROPEAN VISITORS HERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I loved Unchanined because I felt it was a depature from Johnny's usual formula of singing about experiences he never had and was actually based on his own life. That album was amazing, but this album is choppy and disjointed. The songs are weak, and almost painful to listen to after hearing the power of Unchained, Love-God-Murder or even Storytellers with Willie Nelson. Don't waste your money on this one when there are much better J.Cash albums out there. To me, this was more slick marketing of the cool retro Johnny Cash persona than seriously powerful art. If you like Johnny Cash, listen to Merle Haggard - his work is generally based on experience not fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"the man in black is","review":"This is a very CD from Johnny Cash. His cover of U-2's \\"One\\" jumps out at you. Cash does a great job with the whole CD. Tom Petty leans a hand and two Superstars together make a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break!","review":"I don't know what the people (reviewers) above me were smoking but this is a very weak and feeble sounding attempt at holding onto one thing that isn't there anymore. His voice. It comes across as being tired and old.I have always been a Cash fan but I will not be listening to this disk. This is a bomb and I am sorry to say that good old Johnny has walked the line one too many times with this latest production. It's sad, but true!Love you Mr. Cash. You were one of the best and it's time to take a well deserved rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be American IV","review":"Nothing to say about this incredible recording that the other reviewers haven't already written, except that as my title suggests, it should be American IV. Following the release of Unchained, there was an European release titled American Outtakes, 17 other songs, mostly covers, that Rick Rubin recorded of Johnny and his guitar during the sessions that produced American Recordings. These songs didn't make the final shakedown, though they are of the same quality. I managed to buy a copy of the disc from a small store in the US, and beyond that know nothing about how it came to be released in such limited quantity. Will say that everyone who has written about American III, and everyone who appreciates the American Trilogy, should keep their ear to the ground, and do whatever anyone can think of doing to encurage a wider release of this lost treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master's Voice","review":"If you're expecting the younger bravado of hits like 'Ring of Fire' and 'I Walk the Line,' prepare to be treated to something better. The man has walked the long hard road and arrived at that point where his soul is showing. The bass voice is intact. The timbre is improved with age... and the meaning that is poured into the music is magnified by the fact that all of us are older now. The range in this recording strikes me as wider than usual. Not just a mixture of old and new country, but a blend of this and that. Listen to this one as background music first. Then sit down and really listen. All this one lacks is a reprise of 'One Piece at a Time' for its humor, but I won't complain. Thank you, Mr. Cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well researched, but does not do the title justice","review":"Paxman's analyses of the English is little more than a collection of well-known clich��s. There are historical references (though not always accurate) and numerous quotations, which Paxman uses as a veneer to cover his own prejudices. If you want a book about Jeremy Paxman, this may be worth a read - but please ignore the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Watching the English Instead","review":"Oh, honestly, Jeremy. Moan, moan, moan. You can't soften us up by putting one sentence in at the end about us being 'modest, individualistic' and a couple of other 'ics' having spent 265 pages complaining. I know we like to complain but the key is to be funny while we complain, and this book doesn't do it. Readers, go and get Kate Fox's Watching the English instead. Much more entertaining and illuminating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy read","review":"This book examines the identity of a people that everyone seems to know and have an opinion on but whose history is a bit more complex than that. It's an interesting book in a curious way, and Paxman writes it with ease. He takes us through the historical opinions of foreign travellers and the difficulty the English have had with the 'fall of the Empire'. It is full of little details that one would never think had such an impact. I found it most interesting the notions the English have about themselves had how some if not most of the have little to do with reality. And Europeans accuse the Americans of not understanding that the States may not be 'the land of the free'. The English are just as guilty of dreaming of the beautiful countryside when most live in cities that may not be aesthetically pleasing. If the book had been even more recent I hope that Paxman would have tried to explain the incomprehensible behaviour of English football fans this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Brits","review":"The most I ever learned about British people came from Brit Coms or the ever talked about royal family.This book is entertaining and beautifully written.I liked it from the first sentence.While not necessary reading its like the last piece of chocolate cake:why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"If perchance you're thinking of using this book to get to know the English better but are not yourself English, you're going to have to go elsewhere. This book is written by an Englishman as a sort of sardonic take on the national character. As such, it contains many references to people, places, and events that probably only someone who grew up in England would get.And if you're thinking of using this as part of a cultural studies or intercultural communication course, you can forget it. It's far too literate. The whole level of the thing, it's like it was designed to elicit wry smiles from the crowd of people who read The New Yorker, the Atlantic, Best American Essays, etc.Another problem is the publication date (1999), which means that, even though it's only ten years old, it's out-of-date regarding Britian's problem with immigrants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and enlightening","review":"As a US ex-pat who has lived in Britain for 11 years, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Yes, it is a highly personal and opinionated book, but who wants to read a list of statistics? Besides, it's what Mr Paxman does best. It shows another endearing characteristic of the English - the tendency to declaim on anything without worrying about whether they actually know much about it and often being very entertaining while doing it.The book is chiding without being churlish, funny without being farcical, and at times downright affectionate. It does get slightly repetitive and rambling, but I highly recommend it. It is a great conversation starter and at times made me laugh out loud.Oh - and also - the \\"curiously English geek quiz show, University Challenge\\" actually started in the US as College Bowl before coming to the UK. But it is indeed far more popular here than it was there. Does this say something else about the English perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best books ever","review":"Readable, witty, informative,...probably one of the best books written about the English and everything related to them.

Their online customer service department emails me back within 2 business days, but they will not replace it with a 61-Key piano.

Let me tell you the boys can play! On this album you get to hear the voices that give them the ability to harmonize like Rascal Flatts and to change their sound from Bayou to Soul. I wish the liner notes were more complete, because if you've seen this band you know that they all can play and they stroll the stage exchanging instruments and lead vocals with ease. I can guess who's doing what on each song, but it would be nice to know.They have chosen to stay close to their Louisiana roots for this debut, but they can play rock, funk, blues and soul -- I've even heard them cover hip-hop with a fiddle solo -- how cool is that?!So, I give it four stars.

My first splint of this type lasted me a couple of years after almost constant wear so I know it's sturdy. I purchased this exact same wrist splint (to replace my old one here on Amazon.com) at half the price compared to the doctor's office. I wear this at night and during the day as needed.

When we first watched, my five year old started asking, \\"When does it start?\\" after about five minutes because he expected some kind of narrative rather than mere repetition of different phrases in fairly uncreative ways.

Try Susy Dorn or even Professor Parrot instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows why it's hard to do an IG greatest hits CD","review":"I bought this CD out of a sense of duty.Okay, really I wanted the two new songs. I own the albums with the rest of the tunes on them, with the exception of the studio version of Strange Fire. I can't argue too strenuously with the songs that were picked for this CD -- they're fine -- but they're not the ones that mean the most to me. Great songs that could have been included instead:Love's Recovery, Language or the Kiss, Welcome Me, Love Will Come to You, and The Wood Song.But anyway. For the most part, the songs picked for this CD show the essence of the IG sound, with a nod to the way in which it has evolved over the years. Buy it if you need an introduction to the girls. But do yourself a favor and don't stop with this CD.Get Swamp Ophelia for a sense of the musical complexity they're capable of, get their self-titled CD for a sense of their folk roots, and move on from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the new songs","review":"I usually hate it when bands add new songs to \\"greatest hits\\" albums, but the last two tracks on Retrospective are great. (I know it's not technically a greatest hits album, but these are undoubtedly some of their better known songs.) If anyone's on the fence about buying this album because of the new songs, I would highly recommend it... they are right up there with the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indigo Girl Classics!","review":"This CD, a compilation of 16 of the Indigo Girls' popular hits, is a great addition to any IG collection. In my opinion, there isn't a bad track on the CD. It's incredible acoustic guitar and wicked harmonies through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy and Emily give us another great album","review":"The Indigo Girls never cease to amaze me. I have followed their careers from their first cd Strange Fire to Retropective. Retrospective is a good collaboration of their greatest hits. The first 14 songs have already been released on previous albums. I would recommend this cd to those people who are just now becomings fans. The songs on this album are the ones that are the biggest crowd pleaser's and one's that you just have to have. And to those of you who already own all other Indigo Girls cd's released, I would still recommend buying it. Amy's new song 'Devotion' touches my heart and the beat is new and exciting. And in Emily's new song 'Leaving', the duo harmonize beautifully again. This album is a good demonstration of their musical career over the years and gives us a hint of the music yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Canaan","review":"Fatally flawed for not containing \\"Land of Canaan.\\" Plus, with them collected together like this, it becomes painfully obvious that the songs contain too much earnestness and too little humor.

Jack has moved on to a new level in his life ...which sometimes is not good for other musicans, however his exploration has worked out for him in the long run making this album very successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a letdown","review":"This album lacks the adventurous nature of his previous work. It's still good music but not nearly so engaging or interesting as before. If dancing to the music is your only interest than I guess this will do it for you though... I keep listening in hopes of hearing something that I've missed, but the tunes ARE more simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ambient Beats","review":"Jack Dangers continues to push electronic music foward. What I like most about this album are the obscure samples placed over great breakbeats. Dangers continues to move MBM forward with new and original music, creating eerie grooves that reflect some of Aphex Twin's ambient masterpieces, yet contain enough originality to keep the genre fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mini-Disc CD Kicks","review":"This CD comes with a Mini-Disc CD containing a few tunes and a movie for viewing on your computer. While the main CD is quite good, containing a treasure of samples and wonderful B+D, I like the Mini-Disc CD better. The music resembles the excellent tonal progressives of Eccentric Object and Variaciones Espectrales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good production, but more of the same","review":"Overall, this is a pretty good album, but, being a MBM fan since 1989 I was expecting a little more experimentation & at least SOME lyrical content. It's like Jack just doesn't feel like trying to convey his point of view anymore, because no one's listening. I also thought the inclusion of one of the tracks from his solo EP was a cheap time filler. He really seems to like sticking to the instrumental dub-hop tracks & an occasional bleep techno number, which sound kinda dated considering the huge amounts of such tracks that Warp Records has released over the past decade. Hope this translates well live, & not just a 'laptop' set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not like his other stuff","review":"I've loved Jack Dangers and MBM since Actual Sounds and Voices...and since I have also bought Subliminal Sandwich. I was looking forward to this CD, and not to say I was disappointed (its a really great CD), but I expected just about a few ounces more. He doesn't sing at all, and thats one aspect that I loved about the other albums I own. Also, he sounds more like techno bands today, which isn't a bad thing, but isn't wonderful.Don't get me wrong, I still like MBM just the same...this just isn't his greatest work out there. Still definitly worth the listen; its a great CD to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad dictionary, but...","review":"The dictionary in the back was helpful, but the organization of the book is not very good and it is awful in explaining pronunciation.

The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't fit as snug as I would like around the ankle, so they bulge a little under pants/jeans unless I wear large flares and also slide around a little when I walk.

Still, the supposed queen sizing is indeed at least an inch and a half too short on both sides and four inches too short on the end. Since I tend to curl up at night it doesn't really matter, but I can see how it might bother some. If you want one that fits, you might have to buy a king size one and cut it to size; I wasn't sure that would turn out well so I didn't try it.

That theme reoccurs in almost every makeover she does. While her tips are interesting, some of them are just not really doable in real-life working situations. For example, of you cover your entire mouth in foundation and redraw your lips, it looks like you re-drew your lips. It's not any special effect. But in a photo studio, with nice lights and special lenses, it can look like you had lip surgery. The basic principles behind her suggestions are based on contouring and illusion. It was an interesting read, but not worth to buy it. The before-and-after photos are quite remarkable, but if you can tell in the photo that the subjects have 3 inches of makeup on, how awful would they look upclose and personal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit Lift","review":"The techiques in this book will stop anyone from going under the knife for a small lift.

I highly reccomend this book to teen readers, boy or girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Angel","review":"Green Angel is a captivating book. Beautifully written by Alice Hoffman, who wrote it in 2003, it tells the story of Green, a girl whose beloved family dies in a fire. She loses herself, and can only regain herself through a series of mysterious events. There are many good parts in this book, for example, my favorite is when Green meets Ghost, a dog who happens to look like a ghost, hence the name. There are also a few strange parts. Green cuts off her hair, and gives herself tattoos. She also puts thorns and spikes in her clothes. Although I did not like the strange areas of the novel, they are still an important part of the story.I rate Green Angel four stars out of a possible five. One theme is especially important. No matter what happens, never let yourself stray from being who you really are. Green let herself change into a lifeless being. Then she realized she wasn't Green anymore, and she had to work her way out her despair. Once that happened, she could truly be Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Angel...","review":"Green Angel is a book about recovering and how we can overcome or cope with the disasters that happen in our lives.Green never imagined she would be left all alone in the world at age 16, after her parents and sister were killed; Green had to find the will to survive without them.Green loved working in her family's garden and she never imagined there would be a day that she let the weeds take over. Her mother taught her everything she needed to know. Green loved getting her nails dirty and helping the garden grow. But after the death of her family, she let everything else die too, her garden and herself. Green no longer wanted to do the things that brought her happiness because she felt she would never be happy again.I enjoyed Green Angel. It was a great book about recovering when you feel like there is nothing left to live for.

Symbolism in the story included her acts of self-tatooing, her dreams, and her movement through her loss and grief as mirrored through the garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful language, interesting story, powerful insight","review":"A superb story for parents & teens to share, Green Angel follows 15-year-old Green as she struggles to survive on her own in the aftermath of a terrible disaster.Bringing to mind the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, Green watches as the city over the river burns and worries about her family who is there selling vegetables at market. As she realizes that they will not be returning home she must decide how to survive on her own. Her lovely green world is ruined by the fire's aftermath and thus Green renames herself, Ash. Ash spends evenings tattooing her body with roses and thorns; her strange new world is shrouded in darkness, both physical and emotional.Green's struggle to define herself in the face of change is a journey we will all recognize but Hoffman has also shown us all of humanity - fearing, mourning, angering, healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Analogy of 9/11","review":"Alice Hoffman has created a world that mirrors our own after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The main character, Green, loses her parents and sister in a disaster and over the course of the book, comes to terms with her losses. This is a poignant tale of mourning and rebirth over time. At times some of the incidents seem a little strained but Green's descent into \\"Ash\\" and eventual coming to terms with herself are excellent. There are a few unresolved issues in the story but overall this is an excellent parable.

It seems as if the author spent hours musing ways to put this story in a \\"haunting\\" way, rather than connect the reader with the characters' feelings. Her efforts fall flat.

But the rest of the album is a bloated, grating affair which throws words at you and begs to be understood. Mind you, I like my music to be intelligent and even literary at times, but this album feels like an English lit college lecture from a long-winded professor. Dull pedantry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've grown up with them....","review":"There's some music that I listen to because I like the tune. Some I'm drawn to for the words. Very, very seldomly does a band pull me in with both aspects. The Indigo Girls, my friends, did. For life. I first heard this album when I was eight years old. I had a babysitter (named Amy, amazingly) that loved to play the guitar for me. After a few weeks I had the words to \\"Closer to Fine\\" down pat. It remains, years later, my favorite song. This album has gone with me everywhere. The songs have become parts of me, and marked the minutes of my life. When I have something to look forward to , \\"Closer to Fine\\" begins my day. In those pensive times, \\"Secure Yourself\\" is my anthem. After my first big breakup with a guy, I played \\"Love's Recovery\\" 15 times in a row. This music has molded me into who I am today. For every emotion, every dimema, every tear or smile that goes accross your countenance, the Indigo Girls have a song. Buy this album- it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfectly pleasant","review":"I haven't been nabbed by Indigo Girls but felt brave and picked this up after hearing some of their work on the Lilith Fair albums. I liked most of this although the occasional country flavor grates. 'Blood and Fire' really kicks! Strangely, the liner notes in the CD case are for cuts on a totally different Indigo Girls CD (Rites of Passage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indigo Girls Rule!","review":"This is a great start if you want to begin listening and collecting IGs.

Of the hundreds of other cd's I own from practically every genre, this is the one that I come back to time and time again. Emily & Amy have a gift with their lyrics and music that's unrivaled, and this album seems to capture it best. They capture the essence of the human experience in a way that no one else can.

I purchased Rosetta because it was described as being easy and very effective. The box advertises that this program is used by NASA, well I hope they don't use this version it only gives you 1/4 of the full program. The box makes you think your getting a complete program but your not. After you going through all the exercises just once to get a feel for it you find out you have to go online and buy the rest of the program.

Thank you thank you, I am so greatful and I am happy to say so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so groovy junk","review":"I was quite unimpressed with the lack of content in this albums first disc. In fact it was so bad that i found it somewhat hard to listen to and making it through the entire album was more of a chore than anything. There was this lingering hope that the obnoxious horns and less than smooth beats would evolve into something pleasureable, but it never happened. If you are a hard core lover of Funk then you might find this album good, but if you are expecting some innovative house mix like that of Kaskade's House of Om disc, forget you ever saw this album. The first disc, is what i would describe as absolute trash, however the second disc is exponentially better and I will probably end up copying a couple tracks into my PC.If you are curious about this album and not a prior groove junkie fan, i would recommend buying this cd used. It is definitely not worth the $15 to buy new."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone must like it","review":"I didn't like a single song.

Similar sensibility to Ween or Cake, but with a hip jazz flavor. Much of it is very funny. Many of the songs deal with the creation of tough exterior shells to protect something scary and vulnerable at the core--surface vs. what lurks underneath. Even the songs that could be taken as sincere have an almost tongue in cheek tone about them. The instrumentation is sophisticated and knowing. The obviously satirical songs make use of genres ranging from jazz to psychedelic but without really dipping into parody. But for all that, it just sounds great. The only crime here is that there is not more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistakes","review":"Excuse me but Sabre Dance is not by George Gerswin, Waltz from Maskarade is not by Chopin and Walz from Swan Lake is not by Bach.

It does spray hot water everywhere. I had to be extremely careful each time I used it, because I was burned on the arm just trying to get the steamer head over to the sink. I followed the manufacturer's instructions very carefully. I was afraid to put the maximum amount of distilled water into the steamer reservoir, because of my experience with using lesser amounts the instructions said you could use. The compay that makes this product will not refund my money, they will only try to repair it. I don't think it is properly designed to do what the company claims. Therefore, I don't think repairing it will solve many of it's problems that I haven't even mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Powerful - Cumbersome to use","review":"This product is much larger and heavier that other products in the same category. It takes far too long to heat up and once it does, does not produce enough steam to effectively press the clothes. The water tank is fixed and difficult to fill, much less clean at a later date.

I think NOT. But Tribal? Yes, Definitely","review":"Although \\"House\\" is a overly used label to categorise many kinds of dance music it is certainly recognised now as a very specific genre with its own sub-genres such as tech-house or vocal-house etc. This 2 CD collection is certainly NOT house in that sense...these are CDs of mostly tribal music; fairly repetitive to boot. I would not necessarily purchase it unless you enjoy music that is nothing but pulsing drums with stabs of growling non melodic bass and a cheesy male \\"deep club voice\\" overdub on almost every song. The mix is done live which is good for DJ integrity but shows in mixing weakness. The songs go on for longer than you would anticipate (often 6 or 7 minutes) and are mixed tediously and inexpertly. No Global Underground mixing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael W.

Solid throughout with several gems on each album, Grover Levy's two albums are a must. Every Christian music fan should have this, but admit it you dont, do you? Does that make me better than you? Yes, indeed it does, but you can bring yourself up to par by buying this album and \\"Wrestling Angels\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grover Deserves Attention","review":"I bought this cd when I was 14, and I loved it.

The show started out fairly strong, but by the middle of the season it was very apparent that the plot and characters were going no where. By the end of season I could have cared less about the characters, what they felt, what they thought, where they were going, etc. The story line became very bogged down with minutiae. Even for a Battlestar plot line, the characters acted in contradictory manners. The \\"character physics\\" of the Caprica universe seemed to be ill defined and just not very interesting. I would really like to learn more about how the Cylons started, what was their relationship to their creators, etc. But I am just not willing to wade through all this crap to get there. I deleted Caprica from my Tivo line up, and I will not be adding it back for Season 2, should it ever see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO say we all","review":"I tried to stick with this hoping it would improve but by the end of the season I was rooting for the cylons to hurry up and kill off all of these single dimensional characters.Not a single likable character, you really have to try to achieve that in a show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Unfortunate","review":"The only place it succeeded was when the plot was centered around a society on the verge of long range space flight. Unfortunately that was only a small part of Caprica. That really sucks too because I've wanted the origins and development of the Cylons to be a series for a long, long time.At so many points this show was unintentionally hysterical. You see they're on the verge of long range space travel and robot warriors, have virtual worlds but still use a VCR and rotary phones. Here's the funniest part though. Apparently futuristic Caprica looks a lot like Brooklyn today. Including an Officer Perez.The parts focusing on the Cylon development were pretty good but not enough. It probably should get two stars but I'm taking one off for dashing my hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad let down","review":"As a fan of Battlestar Galactic since the original series aired it was/is a let down to see the series deteriorate to a point where junk like Caprica is the best the writers and producers could do.

It is not clear whether these are the uncut DVD versions in HD, or just the shorter versions of the Pilot that were broadcast. And, their ordering procedures deviate from the rest of their website. On the first click to order, which would normally put an item in your shopping cart, they complete the order without giving you the option to decline. Then, they provide no discoverable means of disputing the purchase. These digital purchases do not show up in your list of purchases; they do not show up in the list of purchases on which you can report a problem. Basically, the site is misleading and provides no means of correcting mistakes. Very disappointing for Amazon, which usually has good customer support.

This was SUPPOSE to fill in the beginning sequences as to how mankind in New Caprica went down the road to destruction. NEVER happened.Instead of the possibility of unfinished story-lines being presented, all you got for your time was 2 families and a idiotic religious cult going at it for 1 season. NO CYLON mysteries being solved until the very end....and that is a BIG maybe. I'd say this 1 year garbage adventure had about 90% family feud and 10% Cylon mystery revealed. This was BARELY watchable FREE, and I have no idea why anyone would WASTE their hard earned money on this DVD/BluRay addition to the series.

Not so with Caprica. Just couldn't connect with anyone in the stories that week after week, just become more depressing and less appealing to watch. Never any redemption that lifted one's emotions. Only a constant path to see how far down in the dark depths they could reach. Great opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Battlestar Galactica","review":"It would seem that Syfy did not give this show a chance. This one and only season is a hot mess. The first half of the season is relatively slow, way too slow. However they changed the show runner half way through, and the second half, and especially the last few episodes, where awesome.At the end of the last episode they show a preview for what is to come, and basically had everyone excited because the story lines looked great. Only, with a bonafide hit on their hands, Syfy does what they do and ax Season 2.If you're a Battlestar Galactica fan, it's worth a watch to get a little back story.

A lot of people were undoubtedly made uncomfortable by the polytheist/monotheist conflict. As a long-time student of archaeology and ancient history, I have no sympathy for them.

Most of the songs on those albums are on this \\"Sidewinders Sessions\\" title.I absolutely love the guitar work. The vocals are very rough and sometimes out of tune. I'm not sure who else sounds like these guys. They're from Arizona so maybe it's desert rock? The songs are raucous yet heartfelt descriptions of loss, heartache and addiction.

If I were to tell anyone about the Indigo Girls, I would tell them to listen to them in the order their music was released. This album shows the girls in a very strong light. Being it was their first, I was impressed by the literacy and the melodies they offered. They are a couple of girls with a strong sense of allowing themselves to grow emotionally and it pours out in the lyrics here. They are not afraid to wear their emotions or their relationships on their sleeves and it shows. Musically it bare bones. Acoustic is the fare of this album and it is quite good.

Simple enough to do, but this instruction is left out.The princess bag...just how far from the edge of the fabric should you sew the piping?Why is the terminology not consistent? Sometimes it's backing. Sometimes it's lining.I have her other book on totes and it's excellent. I am terribly disappointed in this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this pattern","review":"I received this book about two weeks ago and started sewing the shoulder bag first. The pattern was easy to cut out and sewing the pieces together was fairly simple. I'm looking forward to working on the other bags. Zippers are not always easy to do, but she includes a whole section on them in this book. I love Cindy's designs and own several of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"The illustrations are bright and fun, and I love that the notes are on the last page so you can play along if you want.

Love that Raffi songs are in books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Better If You Know the Song","review":"This is a cute and silly book, my 4 year old likes it alot.The illustrations are very colorful!It helps if you know the song to be able to sing along to the book. If you don't know it, download it or purchase a Raffi CD.This is a timeless book with silly rhymes your child will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for English language learners","review":"I bought this to use with a small group of English language learners in kindergarten. They loved it! I overheard them singing the words to themselves on their own. I used it to instill language patterns and to teach doing words and the names of animals by substituting other verbs and animals in the pattern, \\"Did you ever see a ____ (verbing) a ____?\\" This activity also worked to develop a sense of rhyme. My students' interest was highly engaged through the use of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down by the Bay","review":"Book was not in the right order. The first page was not in the book at all, instead there was a duplicated page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't show the feet!","review":"I've got a fair bit of dance experience (although not hip-hop), but I found this video extremely hard to follow. The moves seem great, but she teaches them very quickly, and the camera often does not show her feet. Hard to follow steps just from the torso. After sticking to the lifeline a few times through and watching some bits on slow on the DVD, I'm slowly picking it up, but I'm not convinced this will ever be in frequent rotation for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not feelin' this","review":"maybe i havent given it much of a chance but I dont really like this workout. The instructor is super corny. Lets just say her version of \\"the salt shaker\\" is like nothing you would see in a yin yang twins video. I prefer crunch workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good video","review":"I've taken hip-hop classes before and loved them so I bought this video to do at home. It's not good. In fact, it may be one of the worst videos I have for more than one reason. The music is bad, the moves are bad, it doesn't get my heart rate up, they don't go over the moves. I bought it because of all the positive reviews I read but now I'm starting to think the producers are writing those reveiws.I wouldn't recommend buying this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Fast and Tough","review":"I am 37 and I haven't did aerobics for around 7 years at the gym. I wanted to get started again, because I loved aerobics and missed it. I put this DVD in and was amazed by her moves but I found her going fast and the moves hard to pick up. They were moves that I never did in aerobics class. I feel this is a very trendy aerobics class. The younger folks will love the dance like moves, but for me, I'll stick with Kathy Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO","review":"This is my first video purchased from this instructor. I am not sure about her other videos but this one is terrible. Very hard to follow. Not for a beginner. If you are a hip hop dancer, you may catch the moves but the music is really uncool. So 90s. Don't waste your money. Really disappointing. Trying to figure out who I can give it to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I've been exercising with dance dvds for awhile now and this is the worst one i've bought. The dance moves were difficult and when I finally got the moves down I didn't break a sweat. Not recommended at all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Workouts","review":"I love this workout. It's easy to follow (after the first time of course), and it's great to be able to choose between one, two or three ten minute workouts. Each one offers a different type of workout, and they're fun. With the DVD it's easy to switch between workouts or do #3 first and #1 second if you want. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average uncoordinated person","review":"Don't buy this DVD if you are uncoordinated since the instructor seems to expect you to know the moves before you try them out. It would be nice if they went slower through the learning phases and broke the moves down more. I tried this once and got frustrated and quit. The moves are neat but not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dance workout!","review":"Here's what I loved about this workout DVD- the 10 minute clock count down, the music, the fact that I'd never get bored. Juliane does a great job of teaching you the steps and then quickly building the whole routine up so you don't get bored. The time goes by so quickly. There are 3 ten minute segments plus a 10 minute bonus workout. I'd say this is a good intermediate workout. By making the moves a little bigger, you can get an even greater workout. She's upbeat without being silly. I used to try dance at the local health club. I thought I couldn't dance. Now that I can plug the DVD in anytime I want, and I don't have to drive anywhere, I can workout more often and I can easily pick up the steps within the 3rd try. I had fun getting the routines down. The music isn't pop or well known, but has a good beat and sound. She has two young women dancing behind her, which adds interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"This Hip Hop workout DVD has 3 routines, each lasting 10 minutes, plus a 4th bonus routine (also 10 minutes). None of the workout segments are intense, so if you're looking for a DVD to help you shed pounds, then this one probably isn't the best for you. On the other hand, if you're looking to work on your coordination, learn some dance steps, or have something to do on days when you don't want a hard core workout, this DVD is fantastic.The instructor does a good job of breaking down the dance steps in counts of 8. If you get mixed up you can go back to the \\"life line\\" step, or rewind. I have few Hip Hop dance skills, but was able to pick up most of the moves probably after the 3rd viewing. The dance steps are pretty contemporary and set to good music, which is rare in workout videos. Other posters have mentioned that they find the instructor annoying, but I don't at all and think that she's a great dancer and instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickfix","review":"This video is a waste of money. The steps are hard to follow and the intructor seems completely out of her comfort zone teaching hip hop (and it's not really hip hop, either). If you want a fun dance workout, buy The Crunch. I bought them both at the same time. I only did this video one time and hated it, the other I have done every day since I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it","review":"I was looking forward to a fun hip hop workout and to learn a new routine. The music sucks..it is more like musak and that just killed ot for me right there. The instructer does not break the moves down , there is no counting no right/ left , no real instruction at all...just ok now do this. I wanted to break this cd into pieces , but I will probably just learn the routine with my own music playing over the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating as hell.","review":"Unless you already are a hiphop dancer it is hopeless to follow her intructions. She has NO idea how to teach ... NONE whatsoever. She shows you a move maybe twice, full speed, not telling you which leg or arm to start on, not showing it from the back so you could mimic and then you are expected to HAVE it and she moves on.Ridiculous.A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun for me. Try Turbo Jam","review":"I have about 30 workout dvd's. This is in my bottom 3. I did it all the way through twice and It wasn't fun or much of a workout. I didn't even break a sweat. I am in average shape. I bought it around the same time I purchased some Turbo Jam dvds so compared to them this one is not fun or challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hip Hop Music in this video","review":"I was disappointed in the music - it is ordinary exercise music and is definitely not of the hip hop genre. Moreover, the instructor shows you in detail real small simple steps and then quickly advances to more difficult steps with little or no chance to even watch her do it slowly let alone teach you to do them. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy instructor, cheesy moves, barely a workout","review":"This is not the dvd to get if you have any dance experience at all. The moves are not cool and I found the instructor's bubbly talk annoying. The back up dancers are not anything to aspire to either. I found one of them to be such a bad dancer that it was distracting. That said, I do like the format of the dvd with each dance being 10 minutes so you can mix and match. There is also a bonus dance which I found a little more challenging. But if you are looking for a workout, I think going for a walk would be more exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might very well be that I'm not that coordinated","review":"I wouldn't exactly call it a \\"quick fix\\". I wanted something for a quick workout, and I liked the fact that it comes in 4 segments of 10 minutes so you can have a sort of custom workout. It's a great idea, I wish it was easier to follow. I just don't have the time that it's going to require to learn the moves. I wanted something easier so I can get going and really be able to use it to it's full potential sooner. Also, no hip-hop music in it. It has this cheese beat, that don't get me wrong, it helps me move, but it's not hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never gets boring","review":"great tape - i have never been able to do a tape more than a few times without getting bored. This one is great, I sweat, I feel more toned, energized and it's not as hard on my feet and knees as other dance tapes. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's a Hip Hop Video Without the Music","review":"I used to take hip hop classes and I was a decent if average dancer. When my instructor moved away I bought this video.1. This is a workout video. If you watch it over and over you will get the moves down but2. You may not want to watch it over and over because the music is too out of date and electronic. The instructors voice is friendly but much too sqeaky.3. The general design of the videeo is weak. The costumes are ugly, the sounds uninspiring, and the setting just generally dull. I think the quickfix idea works really well in the other videos especially kickboxing, but it does not work well for hip hop.4. Buy a workout video or take a dance class but don't waste your time and money on a boring workout video masquerading as a dance class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun & Dorky","review":"I watched this (and tried it, of course!) once and never opened the DVD again.I like to dance for exercise, but it's got to be fun, and to me, this one isn't. The instructor's approach was, to me, ho-hum.I'm a beginner, so maybe people who just love dance classes and aerobics classes would like this, but it wasn't enough fun to motivate me, personally, although I also would not call it \\"too advanced\\". Just dull.In buying it, I hoped to have fun dancing, get some exercise and learn some new moves for the dance floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"workout tape","review":"Not a fan of this DVD. It just was too confusing for me. The Biggest Loser tape was much better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"preppy but fun","review":"I like this workout because it is fairly easy to follow and it gets your heart rate going. At first I thought it was kind of cheesy becase the dancers in the video are all white girls, however, the lead dancer is talented and a great teacher. I do think that the hip hop is definately of a more \\"cacasian\\" style but it is still a lot of fun and there are some challenging moves during the workouts. It is a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"When I make time to workout I want to feel like I worked out and I just did not feel this way with this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"I purchased the DVD hoping for a fun and easy way to excersice. I found the video hard to follow. And I quickly gave up !! It was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun challenge","review":"I'm not sure I would do well with this workout if I didn't have dance experience, but so long as you stick to it, the routines do eventaully become easier. Fun from the get-go! The dance moves may be corny at times, but I can always get myself to work out with this fun video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow","review":"I love this DVD. She breaks down the moves really well and once you get the hang of the moves, it is a lot of fun to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what was expected.","review":"i wanted more for excersise. go with jillian michaels for a better work out. goes way too fast to learn the moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"The dances in this video are so corny that I lost all interest in the exercise and had to turn the tape off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"This is one of my three favorite dance workouts. I do dance workouts a lot and have a large library. The pace is a little slower than I like so I have to exaggerate the movements to make it work. I feel like I get a good upper body workout as well as the cardio. I have a small space to work out in and am able to do this in that space. The teacher has a fun personality and the other two members add their personalities to the fun.I also like that there is a bonus workout if I feel like extending my workout a little longer. There is no warm up or cool down but I don't really need a video to show me how to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic concept missed","review":"The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body.One of the few exercise videos that does this is the Firm's \\"Boomers.\\" Too bad it's not available anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 10 minute workout","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. Its a set of 3, 10 minute workouts. They are not complicated, after the 3rd time through you have it memorized. I get up 10 mins early -which doesn't kill me- and pretty much wakeup as I do the video. Easy, simple and it gets my heart rate up enough in 10 minutes that I don't feel it was a waste of 10 mins of sleep. The video is not complicated and not overly intense, so this is the wrong video if you are looking for a hardcore cardio, but if you just want a quick 10 minutes I do recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop Goddess!","review":"I am very please with my new hip hop video. It is easy to follow and very fun! My kids love to do it with me! It is a great exercise video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I purchased this video after reading many of the reviews and thought this would be a great alternative to traditional aerobics while learning some new dance moves to try when I go out dancing at the clubs.What a disappointment. The moves are poorly instructed, poorly cued, and generally difficult to follow. I realize that practice makes perfect, but the poor instruction and cueing leave me thinking I don't want to waste my time... I have other videos that will actually get me a good workout without feeling bewildered and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate.","review":"I was disappointed with this software.

I thought this game was going to be great, i had always dreamed of a star wars game that was like age of empires. And this one even uses the same game engine!!!but after playing it for about a week, it starts to get bad. The replayibility is horrible, and if you own age of empires (age of kings) you will notice that the art in star wars galactic batlegrounds apears hurried and low quality compared to age of empires age of kings. Also, it apears that the game wasent adapted for a futuristic game, it seem exsiting the first time you set a bomber on a building, just as its about to make its expected run though, it stops in mid air and procedes to drop uninspired balls of greenstuff on the target.all in all this game seems slaped together and poor use has been made of the tried and true AoE game engine, i dont recomend this game to anyone but the most avid star wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"best expansion in the world more civelizations more battlegrounds buy it!!!!!! if you ,don't have enough money save and ten by it!!!!

When you buy the original game you get 6 teams for 40 bucks and you get the new game for 30 bucks and there are only two teams.

The graphics are the best outdoor graphics I have seen, and the levels are HUGE! (And you don't have to keep loading like in the awful cabela's PS2 games). The season modes are excellent, and the vehicles are great. Where this game really comes to life is in the online mode. You can compete in tournaments with other hunters around the world. You can also play 2 player split screen in tournaments. The animals look and move excellently and there are plenty of them in the worlds (again, unlike cabela's which has 3 or 4 at the most.)

The only reason I have not sold it is because it has online capabilities which is a first for a hunting game."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have got to be kidding...","review":"This game looks terrible... The sereenshots are some of the worst I have seen. Where are the animals? The deer hunter series has continuously gotten worse over the years, and this looks like it should top them off. The launch titles for the Sony Playstation games, such as SSX, or fantavision have more realistic looking environments than this \\"hunting\\" title does. Online play? Why would I want to play a hunting game Online with 8 other people? Are you going to race each other to bag the biggest deer? what kind of hunting sim is this? and if you're in Co-Op what does the person do who doesn't have the gun? Do you line up and choreograph your shots to hit the animal from different sides at the same time? This just seems silly.If this title were in the 9.99 bargin bin, I might consider it for a coaster. ...an Experienced and disappointed Outdoorsman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Rita","review":"If you think it is only the musicians and arrangers who make this an above average album, just compare Linda Ronstadt's \\"Hummin' To Myself\\" album. Rita brings maturity and polish where Ronstadt doesn't. Rita supports the musicians as much as they support her, and she obviously knows that's how jazz should be. The first four tracks on this CD are terrific. I question a few of the choices of material on the rest of the album, but overall this is better than the productions of most of the '60s/'70s rock stars turned jazz/middle-aged-pop singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Doesn't Gel!","review":"Both the sonic quality and jazz musicianship of this disc were of high caliber. As established before, Rita could sing just about any genre that is American: country, pop, hollywood soundtrack, ballad, soul... But why it didn't work with this record? One thing, Rita's voice was constantly on the flat side, even on her signature tune \\"We're All Alone\\". Another reason might be that most of the accompaniments were recorded earlier, and Rita's voice was added later. As such, there was little or no interaction between Rita and the studio musicians, thus dampened the overall performance of this album <----- my logical guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriging...Suspensful","review":"I read this book by recommendation of a friend.

But it's a shame he's not better recognized worldwide for the fine -- and varied -- pianist he is. He's far more than just another Dixieland pianist. This trio album (with drummer Ed Metz Jr. and bassist Mark Neuenschwander) shows off his talents for well over an hour on tunes by Kern, Porter, Gershwin, Mandel, Mancini and other fine composers. My favorite is his five-minute-plus version of Leon Russell's \\"This Masquerade,\\" but there isn't a bad song among the 15 on this Arbors CD.

I was pruning a crabapple tree recently when the yellow plastic pieces that secure one of the handles to the blade mechanism failed. I assumed that I would be shopping for a Craftsman lopper due to the Craftsman warranty, but first looked on the Fiskars website under \\"warranty\\", and found a place to describe the problem and upload a photo. After I \\"sent\\", a message appeared saying that unless I heard from a Fiskars representative a replacement would be sent. It arrived yesterday.

I'm in great shape now, you'll be happy to hear, but these loppers haven't improved one bit. Live saplings up to an inch were all it was capable of then, and alas, the same now. To really cripple it, try a poplar sapling, This tool can j u s t make it through a 1\\" trunk, but cannot handle the bark and thin layer of wood clinging to it at the end.

And that is what this album is. Although I have never figured out what a red room is, I still love this record and appraise it as a rock n' roll masterpiece. My favorite tracks include Blackout in the Red Room, Fuel to Run, and the kind of hit single \\"Why do you think They Call it Dope?\\". They still play the video occasionally on Vh1 Clasic. Jizzy Pearl's voice is incredible and Skid Rose's guitar pieces although simple are awesome. There is also a lot of impressive bass work, notably on \\"Fuel to Run\\".

Others sound a bit too similar. The gems, however, make up for these drawbacks. \\"The Man in the Long Black Coat\\" stands out for it's guitar work, seedy atmosphere and Dylan's lurching lyrical phrasing. Some people (like me) really like \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\" while \\"What Was It You Wanted\\" is a good song although far from unique. \\"Everything is Broken\\" is a great romp. \\"Most of the Time\\" has to be the best song of the set (even though it appeared on the High Fidelity soundtrack - the same movie that showed disdain for any song used for such purposes). It's the kind of song that will crush your insides if you have someone you broke up with that hasn't been completely expunged from your heart. Overall, there's not a bad song in the bunch. Not his most ingenious work, but very enjoyable none-the-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's most underrated CD","review":"It's great to see all the positive reviews for this CD. I own about 90% of the Dylan catalogue and \\"Oh Mercy\\" is, in my opinion, Bob's most under rated CD. An absolute masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intimate bluesy gem","review":"I was scanning more recent Dylan tunes for a birthday gift of a long time Dylan fan - who only had the early days on disc. I found Oliver Neale's Amazon review \\"Like a brother\\" - and it intriqued me enough to buy. This CD is just great. Bluesy, intimate songs, with a bit of a kick. The kind you want to replay as soon as you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, mood evoking sound","review":"Somehow I had always overlooked this cd until I read Dylan's Chronicles book. In it he describes the sessions in New Orleans that resulted in this recording and I was intrigued since I could tell that Dylan was clearly pleased with this work. Well, the cd does not disappoint. Dylan's songs are solid with a couple of real standouts including Man in the Long Black Coat , Most Of The Time and What Good Am I. The sound mix is really something with the really moody echo/phaser effect on the guitars and when Dylan blows his harmonica,though sparingly, it cuts like a knife. This may not be on the same plane as some of his masterpieces lyrically but man the sound just knocks me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"(3.5 stars) Smooth recovery","review":"After Down in the Groove and Knocked Out Loaded, pretty much everyone thought Dylan was over the hill. Then he saved his career with Oh Mercy, a big step up from those two debacles. No, this will never compare to his '60's work: with the exception of the lovelorn Shooting Star, everything on Side 2 should be skipped. But he makes up for it with great blues-rock (Everything Is Broken; Political World) and two downbeat ballads (Ring them Bells, which literally took a year to grow on me, but I now love it; When Teardrops Fall), so this is far from a failiure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album from Dylan","review":"Bob Dylan / Oh Mercy: This is not one that ranks among his classics, but it is still a very good album. \\"Political World\\" and \\"Everything is Broken\\" are great songs. The rest of the album is well written but his performances of them seem too subdued for the material. Those who believe that Dylan had abandoned his Christian beliefs after \`shot of love' ought to listen more carefully to \\"What Good Am I\\", which is based on various New Testament verses. Overall, a solid Four Star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A merciful album","review":"In 1988,Bob Dylan joined forces with Tom Petty,Jeff Lynne,the late Roy Orbison and the late George Harrison under the name The Traveling Wilburys. Dylan powerfully delivered his vocals to TWEETER AND THE MONKEY MAN,CONGRATULATIONS,MARGARITA and DIRTY WORLD. The following year,Dylan as himself(he and his 4 fellow TW's had aliases),put out this album which is precisely 39 minutes long. The tunes I like best are RING THEM BELLS,POLITICAL WORLD and MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT. This album was produced by Daniel Lanois,who produced albums for U2 also. U2 recorded Dylan's composition ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER. Also Dylan sang background and played harmonica on another U2 recording,LOVE RESCUE ME. Dylan has recorded countless albums on the Columbia label since 1962."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dylan","review":"Apart from the appalling exclusion of the song Blind Willie MacTell, this is a great album from start to finish. One of Dylan's very best. Highlights: Political World, Disease Of Conceit, Most of the Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Been A Great One","review":"If Dylan had replaced \\"When Teardrops Fall\\" with \\"Series of Dreams\\" and \\"Disease of Conceit\\" with \\"Dignity\\", this would have been one of his best albums. Of course, if Dylan wasn't perverse and willful he wouldn't be Dylan. As it is the album's still very fine, with a few standout songs (particularly \\"Man in the Long Coat\\"), great growly vocals and moody arrangements by Lanois."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"I can honestly say that I have every album that Dylan has released, and this one is by far my favorite. A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I'm sorry to say it but this album just isn't up to Dylan par. With the exception of Ring Them Bells, there isn't a truly good song on the CD. Its very forced sounding and the writing is really gimmicky, as if Dylan doesn't actually have much to say so he tries to go back in time with \\"Political World\\" and \\"Disease of Conceit\\", but they just come off sounding phony. If you're a true Dylan fan, buy this album just to have it, but otherwise, you could do better with something from the 60's or 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan and Lanois make for a riveting combination","review":"\\"Oh Mercy\\" is probably Dylan's best release of the '80s, following a decade of inconsistency. Daniel Lanois does a great job with the production here; as all the instrumentation can be heard clearly with Dylan still front and center. Whether it was the production or Dylan himself, his voice sounded better than it had in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This manuscript...this *concept*...should have never left the Internet fan-fiction chat room in which it was spawned.And I say this as both a SF *and* comic book fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Lot of Fun","review":"This is a book that shouldn't be taken all that seriously.

About half way through I contemplated about not finishing it, but it was a short book and I kept telling myself it would get better. Sadly however, it did not. I found the X-men characters poorly portrayed, and did not care at all for the romance between Storm and Picard. In addition, I believe several of the characters actions, both X-men and Starfleet, to be out of character and inaccurate according to their respective story lines. Finally, I must say I was expecting a little more depth to the story line as I found it very predictable and free of any twists. About the only good things I could say about the book would have to be the camaraderie between Worf and Wolverine, and the fact that the nook was in fact short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother!","review":"I am not a TNG or X-Men fanatic, however, I do follow both and enjoy partaking in their respective adventures.

The interplay between the characters is great and what makes it even more intriguing is the fact that Patrick Stewart may one day portray Prof X in a big feature film.

For example, the original Trek movie theme is back and more powerful then ever, and the new themes surrounding the \\"God\\". The God themes sound, should I say, uplifting, it just has that unique sound that is one point in saving this soundtrack from not being bought. Another thing I pointed out was the return of the Trek movie theme which I think is more than welcome. The surprise song on this CD was the last song \\"The Moon's A Window To Heaven\\" by Hiroshima, unlike some people that have reviewed this, I love this song. Finally, the action themes are a welcomed addition too. I love all of the Star Trek soundtracks from the original series crew.

Their game strategies were hilarious (ex: Stealing the cab from the Blondes) and really took the game to a new level. I think they should've won the whole thing.I couldn't stand Gretchen! I was hoping she'd go the first week. Her whiney, complainey voice was like nails on a chalkboard. She talked so LOUD all the time, it drove me nuts.I am impressed how far she and her hubby got, however.I think all of the other couples had alot of personality and they made the season alot of fun.

I was wasn't disappointed! They weren't very liked.This season has some great teams like Meredith and Gretchen who surprised everyone by doing so well to Ron and Kelly who's constant arguing made the game quite enjoyable. And who could forget Lyn and Alex the gay couple who made tv viewers split their sides laughing with their hilarious comments.This season also had some great locations and the detours and roadblocks were the hardest yet. I was in shock when Phil the host revealed the new twist about the Non-elimination legs! This is well worth buying and watching as it is one of the best and most competitve seasons yet. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Release more please!!!","review":"What a great season. Car accidents and injuries. Drama and scheming. Marriages in trouble. It was all there and any fan will love the special feature that allows you to click throughout the episodes for additional footage and interviews. One of the cooler special features I've seen.

Even if you're just a Survivor fan it's worth buying this just to see Rob and Amber back in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Race 7","review":"The Amazing Race 7 isn't the best of the Amazing Race series. Personally, I rank it down the bottom, but if you're a fan, it's probably worth it. The most interesting part of this season was the Rob and Amber stunt casting. I still don't understand why it seemed like everyone loved them, I hated them, but they did make good entertainment.In terms of other teams, there weren't any real stand outs, Ron and Kelly seemed to be a mix up of Adam and Rebecca and Hayden and Aaron from TAR6. Uchenna and Joyce resembled Chip and Kim from TAR5, and so on. But, Meredith and Gretchen definitely stood out, and a lot of the earlier eliminated teams were good entertainment.Either way, it probably sounds like I'm saying it was really bad, but it really wasn't. This race had some of the most exciting legs and closest pit stops, and again, great destinations. More time was spent in South America than before, but it stayed interesting. So, yeah. Not the best season by far, but still worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly an Amazing Race","review":"This season so far has been (I wouldn't say my FAVORITE) But pretty darn close.

This cover looks like another generic version, I'm sure it's not a remastered copy but if it's much better than the one I purchased then I will probably get it.If it was coming out in half seasons and dragged out for years (like Perry Mason) then we would be paying more but the worst is the wait for the next disc.

How disrespectful to this A-list series to have it end up looking like this. The packaging is cheap, negligent, and IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT THE ITEMS. Did someone design the cheap cardboard outer box while not realizing there would be no inner covers for the disc sets? So there is 50% AIR. It doesn't look like any other first-rate boxed set.But I do go on about this tacky protection and appearance. I do confirm the other reviewers' main observations about the poor quality of the videos. Much older, fuzzier series have been digitally remastered with skill and care to look much better than this. There are many, many techniques and tools to produce DVD's from old film and tape. Too bad this producer/distributor did not care to put out a fitting quality tribute to the series.

It's as though someone videotaped re-runs shown on the TVLand television channel, then somehow transfered them to DVD and figured out a way to sell it. Sometimes the idiot forgot to press pause on his VHS player when commercials came on, and many times it's as though the \\"tracking\\" control was in need of adjustment. Most of the discs won't even play, or they'll jam up in my DVD player. I was NOT happy when I began viewing my DVDs, so be very careful what you buy. Surely in this day and age, with enough interest from the public, the original copies could be PROFESSIONALLY transfered to DVD.

With Al Mundy he wasn't doing this because it was the right thing. He was a thief pure and simple. Third generation and proud of it.It Takes A Thief The Complete Series is a great set. Universal did a great job on this set. Loved the interview with Wagner and writer and producer Glen Larsen.

Alexander Mundy was a thief that caught a break, like we all wish we could, and he had all the moves required for whatever job they sent him on.Yeah, White Collar on USA is a great show, but It Takes a Thief did it 41 years ago with all the class and a little but of that late 1960's cool that you just can't buy with a Devore suit.

I had high expectations for the visual aspects of season 3 but found the quality so poor that I could hardly bring myself to watch those episodes.

But any exposure to music will certainly enrich his life, and any classical music will serve to introduce you and your baby to its beauty.Alas, however, this is one of the worst compilations I think I have ever heard, so if you would prefer a compilation, why not spend a few minutes checking around on Amazon for another?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Although this book was obviously written by a former naval aviator, people who are (sometimes) affectionately known as Airdales, since no one in the \\"real navy\\" would ever call a ship a \\"boat\\", this was a fun read.I'm not competent to discuss the book's literary merits so I'll only say it had a logical and fast paced narrative and was hard to put down.

It is clear that Venuti is enjoying himself. Indeed most of the tracks are composed similarly. Tony Romano is an excellent part of these recordings-not simply accompanying Venuti. His talent and beautiful playing is highlighted, and he is an integral part of the recordings.

Not a problem with \\"Rites of Passage.\\" Besides the better-known songs, like \\"Galileo\\" (the first IG song I ever heard), the haunting \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Love Will Come to You,\\" and the rocking but thoughtful \\"Chickenman,\\" there are other gems on the CD: \\"Joking,\\" a rousing, defiant musing on friendship lost; \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" a bare-bones rendition of my favorite Dire Straits song; and \\"Let It Be Me,\\" an uplifting call to shine the light of life in a dark and confused world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Best!","review":"Until this album Amy Ray may have been a little in the shadow of Emily Saliers, when it came to songwriting. It's beyond question that Ray adds a lot of edge (necessary) to the sound of the Indigo Girls; but with songs like \\"Three Hits\\", \\"Jonas and Ezekial\\" and \\"Nashville\\" Amy's songwriting is also beginning to catch up Emily's.In fact, I think that several of Emily's songs on this album are harder to get into than hers usually are. My favourite Emily songs here are \\"Galileo\\", \\"Let it Be Me\\" and \\"Airplane\\".This is one the most consistent Indigo Girls albums, and one of my favourites!Once again the girls are supported famous friends such as Benmont Tench, Jackson Browne, David Crosby and regulars Sara Lee, Lisa Germano and Jerry Marotta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply and always the best","review":"This CD really shows the lyrical ability of these two talented yong ladies.

Good production value. (I'm guessing shot with the AG-DVX100A._ Good suspense. Good use of vfx -- e.g., the \\"real time\\" action in computer monitor = eery. Wasn't crazy about the ending -- seeing the actual \\"stalker\\" get the girl. If you insisted on including him, would have prefered something less traditional/cliche, such as the women getting the best of the predator. [Why are the victims always women!

I'm surprised that's all it took. It shows you that if you set your mind and wallet you can complete a film project in a day with a bare minimum.

Hey, I've been there too chatting away wondering or fearing that I'll bump into a crazy nut, who's marbles aren't all quite there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and Cliched","review":"Just another cliche, IMHO.

Plus, I agree that the man jumping out at the end just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off suspensful enough...","review":"The film maker cites Hitchcock as an influence. Yeah, we get that. I think the thing about Hitchcock that I liked so much is that he did not rely on \\"Supernatural\\" events such as unplugged computers powering up and connecting to the internet. I think that today's movie goer is a little too savvy for that. And that sort of thing moves this film from Suspense to Slasher flick. If you set out to make a Slasher flick, congrats!

So big deal, a student gets attacked. File it under 'dog bites man'. The ending leaves you flat.

She has been addicted to the machine and it has taken over her mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! That was bad!","review":"The girl was great, so she gets the award for best actress. However, this thing went wrong in the middle. It should have had the \\"unknown bad guy turns out to be harmless\\" theme, or some humurous twist like her roommate being in the drawer or something. Instead, she gets beat to hell in the end by some thug; too dark and worn out to be sure. Now it could serve as a great public service announcement for careful AIM useage, but this is no fun. I really was hoping for a cute twist in the end, or at least her boyfriend or someone comes in and saves the day.Bottom line, if you're going to keep making the computer turn on supernaturally, then you need to explain it with some pseudo-supernatural villian in the end.

I've seen so many movies with the premise of someone alone, then all of a sudden is being harassed. Scream? Halloween? Swimfan? Point is, unless there's a cool payoff or smart twist that actually explains what is happening, then it's bad and annoying. I was certainly in suspence, the feel of the movie was good. But the guy just came out of nowhere with no explanation of how he got there or why he wanted to harm her. It was a copout, and therefore, I disliked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"Not a very great movie. I really don't buy the scenes where thehacker is manipulating the computers state.The only thing I enjoyed was the over the shoulder shot where we see her on the screen.The IM sounds were horrible and should really not be used that much.

It's more difficult to create a suspenseful sequence than it looks. I give it points for using ordinary computer sounds (bleeps!) to punctuate thescariness of the girl's predicament. Several holes in the plot(e.g. how does computer turn itself on when she doesn't even bother to turn on a light - shades of Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween! - don't diminish the fact that it is suspenseful.

I got it cheap and the bass solo was worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars but......","review":"I am a major Hammerfall fan but then again I am also a major Iron Maiden fan, when I watched this dvd I felt the power of Hammerfall just like I do with all their studio albums, my only complaint is the overdubbing, not as much as what other people says there is but there is noticeable overdubbing, but the energy they project physically live makes up for it and the song list is very impressive, these metal warriors will be pounding the Hammer for years to come just as their forefathers Iron Maiden, so my star review is this: 5 stars for performance and song selection, and 1 star for the overdubbing, but over all it kicked serious a**! up the irons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and moody","review":"This is Kip's third solo release, if you count his acoustic stuff, and the first one with new material written after the tragic death of his wife in a car wreck. And it shows. The whole feel of this CD is somber and dark, not exactly heavy (the distortion on the guitar is fairly light), but minor keys and reflective lyrics reflect Kip's mindset at the time.He can still pen a good tune, and the songs are mainly strong. I especially like Cross, Crash the Wall, and there's a fantastic instrumental track as well I just love. The mid-tempo tracks are sometimes similar to Winger's third and final CD Pull, but there are also a lot of slow songs, very reflective.I knocked off a star due to the lack of any upbeat material, but to be honest that's just my opinion, and this CD remains a very strong release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"Learning Spanish from former president G. W. Bush would be an upgrade over these videos; he had a better accent when speaking spanish than do the women in these videos. It is clear that many of the kids in these videos have learned the exact same bad accent as the teachers. The other critical reviews are spot on."},{"rating":"1","title":"These videos would be overpriced if they were free!","review":"Fortunately I checked two of these videos out of the library rather than buying them, because they are absolutely the worst I've seen. Not only did they not use native Spanish speakers, so the audience does not hear correct pronunication, but some of the attempts by young children were truly painful. My five year old, who loves most learning videos and games including other Spanish language resources, was bored stiff within minutes. The $1.58 I spent to rent them at the library was completely wasted; they are definitely not worth the price to buy them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor pronunciation by non-native speakers","review":"The pronunciation is the problem with the kids love spanish series. There are virtually NO native speakers in the videos, so children do not hear the sounds unique to the spanish language pronounced properly. I had my native Spanish speaking friend watch and he was unimpressed, even critical. The kids who repeat the pronunciation do it poorly, and the adults at times can be just as bad--how can your child learn proper Spanish pronunciation without hearing a word said CORRECTLY?! It is not immersion, as there is lots of English mixed in. All in all, I'd look at other spanish-language series, like maybe Super Bebe instead. Or if you want a cheaper/free non-video alternative try the coffee break spanish podcast series--AMAZINGLY perfect pronunciation from that series, and nice to do in the car with the kiddos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics but...","review":"why on earth didn't they use exclusively native speakers? Why would you model terrible pronunciation to children, who can learn to speak with no accent *if* given the opportunity? This could truly be a great product line. I strongly encourage the Brock sisters to re-make these with native Spanish speakers for all audio. But I don't want my child hearing these non-native accents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches kids Spanglish","review":"I won't repeat the other negative reviews except to reiterate them: this DVD is of poor educational quality. I was so turned off by the English sentences with the Spanish words thrown in. I also found the pasted-on smiles and robotic expressions of the \\"teachers\\" off-putting. My 19-mo old was running around repeating all the words, so she was hungry for the vocabulary and the experience. But the series is such a wasted opportunity to truly teach language in context and build a rich vocabulary, that I don't want to waste our time with it. I'm returning it and searching for better materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very awful accents","review":"The idea of the classes are great and i really like the energy of the two teaches, but they have the worst Spanish accents you could imagine. Your child will not learn Spanish fluently he or she will learn to speak it with a really bad accent. And they use as much English in the lessons as they do Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible video","review":"We have been using various methods to introduce our twins to spanish. This video is awful. Each video is 30 min. almost 10 min are taken up by the two ladies singing a song at begin and end. My 3 1/2 year olds got nothing out of it. I thought it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsound approach to learning language","review":"I suspect that the creators of this series of DVDs saw the commercial success of Baby Einstein and myriad other childrens' educational DVDs and decided to create their own version in Spanish, with little or no knowledge of effective second-language teaching approaches. It is clear that the creators have a poor understanding of how children absorb and learn a new language, so the way in which they present the material is ineffective. Further, there are no native speakers in the video, and even someone who does not speak Spanish can tell the accents are not correct. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin flare with gay highlights","review":"Juan is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Love the tight pants. Kenneth Cole right? Juan is so sexy.

Each chapter considers a prominent scientist of the past, such as Archimedes, and then presents a synopsis of interviews and discussions with modern-day British academic scientists about the featured scientist of the past. Through the interviews, we gain an understanding of the opinions of the modern-day scientists concerning their academic heroes, mixed in with some of the facts concerning their lives and discoveries. The book is thick with opinions and philosophy compared to the amount of factual information it contains about the featured scientists. If you are interested in what modern British scientists have to say about some famous scientists of the past, then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a book where you can learn something about the famous scientists themselves or a summary of their discoveries, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This outstanding science history is superbly written","review":"Melvyn Bragg's On Giants' Shoulders: Great Scientists And Their Discovers From Archimedes To DNA explores the twelve greatest minds in the history of science and ranges from the foundation of hydrostatics in the third Century B.C. to the discovery of the human DNA structure and gene mapping of our present day.

The standouts for me were the excellent use of music and the slow motion, animiated spinning quarter that was flying through the air. Good cinamatography, good flow and good use of the alotted time space. The story was just a little bit to predicatable though and didn't really take us anywhere we haven't already been 100 times before in other films. It kinda reminded me too much of a Mentos commerical as I was watching it.

I suspect that if the filmmaker had a a really tight script from someone else s/he would be able to come up with something really great, because the visuals were pretty good and most of the shots were well done.

For us, Latin American born close to the heart of the Andes, Andean music was part of our upbringing. Among those who always stood out were Los Kjarkas. The quality of their songs rivals with the emotional mood they give off throughout their tunes. They have been criticized for the innovations they introduced in the Bolivian folklore. However, when you listen carefully, you will notice that the arrangements are extremely tasteful and add up to the beauty of the music. The range of their tunes is just amazing: from sweet huaynos to vibrant sayas. Additionally, the production of this CD is also amazing; in effect the CD displays the genuine respect of the group for their followers.

For what there is of it, the content is not bad.Also, iMac users beware: every time we put it on, it screws up our screen - blanks out other applications, eventually freezing it in strange colors - and we have to reboot to play anything else.

The story is compelling with an old flame reentering Grant's life. He becomes ensnared in the murder of his old friend and must face a sadistic criminal with an old score to settle. Forbidden romance, bloodshed, poison and a body that shouldn't stay buried confront Grant as he races against time to unlock a dark secret, only to face a deadly double threat. This is one suspense novel that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the morning.

But that's not really a bad thing. If you enjoyed the GTA titles so far, then you will enjoy this one as well. Last night I got the second island of the game's storyline. So far it's been pretty enjoyable other than the way too often foul dialog. So far, there are motorcycles, mopeds, choppertype motorcycles, cars, trucks, and now I found some boats to cruise around in as well as some sports cars. I am hoping to be able to fly helicopters as well...assuming they are later in the game. The in-game music barely cuts it though. Just cruising around the islands are still enjoyable. All in all, I recommend this title to those of a mature audience only...not for the kids due to language, violence, and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wait till GTA 4","review":"This game is a step backwards. I bought it because it was only $20, and I didn't want to pay for shipping on my Gnarls Barkley CD. I got it, turned it on, got 3 stars, ran my car off a bridge, jumped...and drowned. Ugh, back to the bad old days. Bear in mind this is a game designed for PSP, not PS2. The graphics are worse than the trilogy, marginally.The main problem for me is that this game didn't have The Magic. I've already seen this map, and I know these characters. I'm waiting for GTA 4.One filan caveat, my rating of this game is based only on the GTA series.

How does that work? Now, to begin, the ONLY reason I'm giving this game two stars is because it is warning to people who have NO clue (like I didn't) what this game is. I was at the store looking to buy San Andreas, but they didn't have it, so I opted for this one title, now, don't get me wrong, this is still GTA material, but, this (and Vice City Stories) is a remake of the PSP version into the PS2 version, which, to me, it doesn't quite work. The fun is still there but the graphics aren't as good and the movement aren't as crip, which, after playing Vice City I had raised the bar high for GTA. Like I said, this game isn't bad IF you know what you're buying, but if you don't have a clue, I'd suggest you rent it first to see what you're getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique style and technical drummer!!!

This book turned out to be one of the most valuable pieces of material I have ever picked up. And because it looks at steroid use through the eyes of a bodybuilder, it puts them in an entirely new perspective that is very hard to find. Most of the other material out there is written in a way to attempt to persuade you away from steroid use; essentially leaving out many of their most important uses. This book takes a more logical approach and attempts to give you all the information you need, good and bad, and lets you make an educated decision for yourself. Although there is one thing about this book that doesn't make it the best for what I was trying to accomplish, it's not a very technical piece of writing. I still have to give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Book On Steroids","review":"I feel that this is one of the best books ever written on steroids.

As far as the information, anyone with any background in steroids research can readily detect that this guy is no steroid Guru (although he tries to play one on tv). Jess Summers is an imposter. His favorite inane line is \\"my philosophy is to get hit, hit quick and get out\\" which is my (Jeff's) philosophy with girls. He got most of his stuff from the internet and I recommend you do the same and save your money. The book projects the personality of this guy too, and that's the injury added to the insult (i.e., the lack of in depth information)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Summers Continues To Impress!","review":"I'm a long time member of Jeff's website and have been taking his advice for a long time now. Because of Jeff, I have completely changed my life for the better. Until a few years ago, I was always the \\"skinny guy\\" and no matter how hard I worked out I could never put on weight. With Jeff's guidence, I have overcome that and now weigh a solid 190 pounds - more than 40 pounds gained in 3 years. My self esteme has never been so high! I have never turned heads before and now I can't keep the women off of me! Seriously!So when I heard about Steroids 101 I got on the list to buy it before it was even available. Now, I'm on my second time reading it and I'm still learning more and more every chapter. Wich is saying something because I consider myself an experienced user. I would certainly recommend it to everyone who is even slightly interested in steroids. Jeff has so much knowledge to share and never writes over anyone's head. He has my support forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Newbies","review":"I hate to say it but the book is not as good as it looks. 400 pages with not much information in it.

This book is definitely for newbies but not at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Money!","review":"Steroids 101 was recommended to me by a guy at the gym. He is maybe 5'6\\" tall and well over 250 pounds and solid as a rock so I figured he probably knows what he is talking about! Especially when it comes to sports enhancement with anabolic supplements (if you know what I mean). He said this book will tell me all I need to know to get to the next level and he wasn't kidding! He was right! This book is awesome! It tells you EVERYTHING you ever wanted (or needed) to know about steroids. And More! And even though it costs $60, it was well worth the money! I wouldn't sell my copy for twice that because I hear that this is a very limited production item. I would be afraid I wouldn't be able to find another one!So, if you want my 2 cc's... THIS IS THE BEST STEROID BOOK ON THE MARKET! BAR NONE! And Im not the only one that thinks this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I cant imagine how anyone could read this book and walk away without learning some valuable lessons. It is a very exciting book that covers many topics. I am happy I got it. Its a great tool if you are thinking baout using steroids and even better if you really are using them.

I guess I'm just one of those people that likes to know what it's all about before I ever take the step to the next level. This book of course didn't answer all my questions, none of them have.

Unfortunately, nowhere in the book does he cite his references or make clear exactly where he found this documentation. Without this vital information, it's difficult to accept Haining's claim that Sweeney Todd actually existed. The book is a work of fiction and should be marketed as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"While I'm grateful anyone wrote a book on the topic, this is a numbing look at the \\"facts.\\" It's hard to believe such a slim book on such a rich topic is this dry and uninteresting. Half the problem is that the three or four antecendents of Sondheim's Sweeney Todd are awash in weak indistinguishable characters and developments that do not benefit from close study. The details of melodramas like \\"The String of Pearls\\" et. al. just do not engage me.Haining himself is tight-lipped and emotionally indecipherable. Just try to figure out what his tone is. It's not a good late-night tale of murder, it's not a crime dossier, it's not thrilling or even disturbing. There is no dramatic arc to his writing. You get the sense that he would have preferred the whole story composed as a giant chart of figures, or that his actual task was to trick readers into belief by sinking them in made-up citations.It was an enormous effort to pick this book up after each pause, and continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work of Fiction","review":"The author tries desperately to convince the reader that the mythical tale that inspired the Stephen Sondhiem musical in based in reality. He relies on fictional accounts of the Demon Barber to support his hypothesis. Still, it makes for quick reading, if only to hear the various accounts of the story of Sweeney Todd."},{"rating":"1","title":"An infuriating book","review":"The author claims to have discovered evidence that Sweeney Todd was real person, yet never once offers any documentation--not even footnotes, in a book purporting to be an investigative work of non-fiction! Todd was \\"born in 1756\\"--how do we know this? No idea. We get \\"we are told\\" this, and \\"evidence shows\\" that, but no cites of sources, leaving us to conclude that the author is pulling this stuff out of his, umm, hat. He quotes 15th-century accounts of the demon barber and his pie-making associate, then claims Todd worked in the 18th century?The frequent typos (\\"candies\\" burning in windows, Dickens writing in the 18th century) are pretty funny, though not enough to nudge this over to the humor shelf.Haining actually claims to have been a working Fleet Street journalist--the downfall of the newspaper is a little less mysterious now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A way to cure insomnia","review":"I found some of the facts mentioned in the book interesting.

Each album by the girls seems to contain a radio friendly track and hear it is Galileo. Although there are plenty of other songs that could have made it, that is what seems to make the girls so intriguing. They don't seem to push themselves too hard or tkae themselves too seriously but rather rely on the fans for their support. The songs here are gorgeous. I am not sure I would say that about any of their other albums than thisone with the exception of some songs off of Swamp Ophelia. The songs here are smooth and catchy and very sing along. Amy Ray does a cover here that is worth mentioning \\"Romeo and Juliet\\"- a cover of the Dire Straits song that is worth the price alone for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent read, not as good as it's predecessor in the series.","review":"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but was notas enthusiastic about this.... the second of what looks tobe at eventually at least a four or five set.

Descriptions of people are not only reused between books but sometimes reused word for word in the same book!

No chapters, just the start of each book. Inconvenient, but not uncommon.Second, and much worse: there are no breaks in between paragraphs (i.e., double space) when there is a change of scene or change of character point-of-view. It's a very difficult read without this simple formatting necessity, because it's seldom immediately obvious from the narrative that there has been a scene change.

This, however, is excellent. It's pretty sparsely produced and restores the focus to the songs and that magnificent voice, which is where it should be. Check out Herbie Hancock absolutely tearing it up on \\"San Vicente.\\" My goodness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I loved this cd!

While the patterns are fairly simple. she leaves out important hints that make recreating her projects difficult if you aren't paying attention. Pay close attention to the weight and type of fabric that she uses but does not mention in her directions. If you use a heavier fabric than what she used, you may need to adjust the pattern to make it work. I wouldn't recommend this for a complete beginning sewer. Otherwise this is a great book full of fun projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"I love the book, and love making all the cute things in it. However, the first time I made the fish, her instructions referred to part C (or maybe D?)of the fish, and the template for the part was nowhere to be found. I was able to make my own template, but it was irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miniature sewing projects with a Japanese style","review":"This book would suit those seeking a range of little projects that nevertheless give a great deal of satisfaction when completed. The pattern set for each object takes no more than a single page so they are quite small. They are all in a Japanese style and are essentially decorative with a nominal use implied in their names. They would make a very personal small gift to a close friend.The book is very well illustrated and a pleasure to own. Instructions are clear but don't expect to complete each project in just a couple of hours.If you have not yet purchased \\"Omiyage : Handmade Gifts from Fabric in the Japanese Tradition\\" by the same author that might be a better first choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manure smell is unbearable!","review":"I always buy huge bags of Miracle Gro potting soil each year for my container plants, especially my tomatoes or new flowers. The Micromax Miracle Gro looks like a bag of bark mulch - lots of big chips and chunks, and smells like straight manure!! It has been three weeks since I planted my containers - adding last years soil and peat moss, and they still smell so strongly of manure that I hate to water them or even walk by them. First Miracle Gro product that I hate. Too soon for any growth apparently, so who knows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I can't figure out what is wrong with these blades, except they are inferior to any other gillette blade that I have ever encountered. They are rough and have actually left cuts on my lip area with a new blade. I thought maybe it was just one of the packets with duller blades. But both packages are the same inferior product. Should have just spent the extra $5 and gotten them at Walgreens. Avoid these."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same!","review":"I'm tired of this game where you think you're buying the same product you buy in the stores but it is anything but the same!

I'm going back to buying them at costco!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Price","review":"I bought these to refill my Gillette M3 Power (the green one), because they're cheaper than the dedicated \\"power\\" refills, and fit just as well.The blades do their job, in the sense that they secure to the bottom of your razor-holder, clip on to your handle, and cut hair off of your face.I've found that they last longer by \\"honing\\" the blade against denim jeans, or the skin of your arm before each shave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the style but one lamp seems crooked","review":"Price was great - looks really goodit is just that one of the lamps seems to be off a bitbut it is such an improvement over what was thereI am really happy with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"I purchased this product for the glass bulbs.

The arms were not positioned symmetrically when first removed from the box, but were too stiff to adjust. Because I had purchased several of them...I ended up having to purchase a replacement of the same light for one bathroom, and it was delivered the same as the first 3. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moen name WITHOUT the Quality","review":"I already read the reviews so I knew it wouldn't be Moen quality and of course it isn't. It isn't made by Moen, just licensed. I wanted it to match my Moen Monticello hardware so I decided to deal with it. It's not an exact match but matches nicely, wife is happy. The finish looks nice now but up close you can see it's a low quality Chinese finish, I don't expect it to last(I give it 4 years and finish will be failing). The nuts that hold the globes really don't fit well but I had no issue with them. The globes are thin and fragile. None of the materials are anything like the quality of the Moen hardware. Basically it's a cheap Chinese light that matches Moen pretty well, I find the price high for Chinese quality.I had to get a second one because the cheap finish on the first one was missing on some parts. Amazon took care of it quickly and one day shipped me another."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Best of late 80's Rock Metal","review":"The band more than met the task of following up their successful debut with this offering. The vocal style is less distracting and not as forced, blending in with the instruments better. The songwriting is a mix of all that is good in rock - a blend of KISS, AC/DC, and Aerosmith. Guitar fans will find plenty of tasteful chops to steal and the solid drumbeats and bass lines are slammin'. It is what it is - rock music was not intended to be serious, just an expression of the youth of the time period in which it was made. Great fun to listen to if you just want rock & roll without the political messages or anguish over being a geek in a Seattle high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Confusing diagrams, odd formula derivations with insufficient explanation as to what's important and what is not. There are many minor typographical errors, though those do little more than annoy. I have struggled for hours trying to glean some meaning from this book and am bewildered at the authors' methods and content organization. This book is almost incomprehensible, and is only useful (sometimes) for its exhaustive breakdowns of concepts. This book throws every bit of everything at you with no regard to helping you understand aircraft performance or design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing remix","review":"I heard one of these songs on KPFK in LA and assumed these were native singers and native performers on native instruments. Not so. The women singers were recorded acapella and then jazz-influenced accompaniments and English vocals were added later, detracting from the ethnic appeal of the singing. This album just seems exploitive. I am returning my copy for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant concept, but ultimately disappointing","review":"I wanted to like this CD, I really did, as I feel the concept is pure genius. Somehow, Robbie Robertson is able to \\"modernize\\" traditional native american music in a way that works (for me), and Deep Forest seemed to \\"modernize\\" African traditional music in a way that worked. But I could only tolerate a few tracks of this well-intentioned CD. Jazz and percussion just don't seem to mesh with the \\"lullabye\\" gist. I would love to hear this re-released without the Western influences and vocal translations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional? Of course not!","review":"This is a contemporary recording, made in collaboration with the singers and musicians from around the world. What results is new art music, not traditional folk music (something it was never intending to be and never became). Let the artists create, and don't try to pigeonhole them as \\"ethnic.\\" This is a unique experiment in cross-continental music and you shoudl listen to the music and hear it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed lullabies","review":"I was slightly disappointed with this CD. I had thought that I would get to enjoy the songs in the foreign language only, but that is not true. Most of the songs have a verse of the original language followed by that verse sung in english. The music that accompanies each song doesn't make any sense. It doesn't sound like lullabies.Still some of the sounds can still be enjoyed. The singers from the various countries are all great with one exception. The english-speaking woman on the first track has a voice so deep i can't listen to that song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lullabies? Not really. World music fans? Possibly","review":"Really not lullabies per se. Kind of odd mix of songs that aren't particularly soothing. If you really want lullabies, try the Putamayo line for multi-culti music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Grimm is no fairy-tale","review":"Very nice book! The edition I own is the 1983 printing, so I am unfamiliar with recent changes. Book has good drawings of leaves (often several), fruits, twigs, buds and leaf scars. Excellent info on summer and winter identification included in text and step-by-step outlines. The step-by-step outline starts at the front of the book and helps you identify the family in which the tree in question belongs. Then turn to the section on that tree family for help isolating which species you have on your hands. There are good text descriptions throughout to aid identification as well as information on history, growth, and commercial uses of the trees. Not a field guide for the size and weight conscious though. Keep it in your living room or SUV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive","review":"This book gives an excellent overview of the trees found in the eastern part of North Amercia. Only way it could be better would be if some of the illustrations were in colour. Great value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Guide on the East Coast","review":"This is by far the best field guide I have ever used for identifying woody plants on the East Coast. I've been using it for an state park internship, and have identified almost ever species in the park. The dichotomous key is easy to use, very complete, and certainly beats flipping through page after page comparing photographs to the tree in front of you. The line drawings are more user-friendly than photographs, as there are no background plants to distract the reader from the tree in question, and the major details of leaves, bark, and scars can be more easily pointed out. While larger than most field guides, it fits well in a backpack; comes with me everywhere. A must for anyone dealing in an outdoors setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEE ZEE 4\\" steps","review":"Ordered the Dee Zee 4\\" oval steps - they installed easily and look good. The install instructions say that the cab bolts are difficult to remove because of the anti-seize compound that GM uses on the bolts - they are right! Using a 2' breaker bar they came out. The instructions are clear enough. Some folks commented on the fact that the bars were not marked Driver and Passenger sides but it seemed easy to figure out. If you are not color blind you'll see that the driver's side mounts are wrapped in green plastic and that one of the nerf bars is in green plastic - also the driver's side.Do be careful on which bars you list in your purchase as the \\"Extended cab\\" bars and \\"crew cab\\" bars differ by only one digit in the item number. I goofed - but the return was easy enough and the correct bars were shipped promptly and my account credited."},{"rating":"2","title":"practical and pretty","review":"were easy to install and they are fully functional, not just for looks.the brackets could have been built better and the tubing should have been alittle heavier.all in all a good product.and as always amazon gets it done quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra at a reasonable price","review":"This is a great fitting bra and comfortable too. After several washings, still looks and feels like brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"my all time favorite bra","review":"I've bought several lightly padded bras and this one bypassed them all. Comfortable, elegant and still looks perfect after being in the washing machine many many times (in a laundry bag or pillow case).

I like it and I'm 23. These are the kind of songs I grew up hearing and I'm even contemplating buying a copy for myself --- and this is coming from a girl whose CD collection and iTunes folders consists of rap, hip hop and R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live CD","review":"If you like Carole King's previous releases, then you will like this CD. It is done in a very relaxed way and she makes you feel like you are there for a private party with her entertaining. A very good CD. Thanks, Carole for such a wonderful recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"This is the best CD I've heard in a long time. Carole King is one of the best song writers around and I always enjoy listening to her music. I love the Living Room Tour. Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Living Room Tour IS the Tour","review":"I bought the discs just before the concert and listened to them completely. Both were just great. The CDs were a wonderful premonition of things to come and then served as a reminder of a truly special evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"I'm into all kinds of music from Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie to Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, George Strait, Merle Haggard, Hank Sr., anything and everything. Basically i love it all! I think this CD appealled to just about every aspect of music in me. the acoustical work along with the soulful passion of her voice make this an essential addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad loss of the crystalline voice...","review":"but the spirit still shines...Who doesn't remember the exquisite quality of Carol's voice in her (and our) youth? That's how I think of her still--her voice encased in amber in my mind--so it was a real shock to detect the raspy and almost hard quality of her voice in much of this album. At first listen, that damage was all I could hear, and it made for some seriously tough going. Glad I white-knuckled it, however, because what's missing from the voice is remedied to quite an extent by the heart of the music and of the singer. They can't do nips and tucks with aging stars' voices the way they can erase signs of age from the rest of the body---and maybe that's not a bad thing. Carol is one 62 year old with a lot of great music to share with us still."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHH Carole","review":"I read some of these reviews & I wasn't sure if I had the same CD. When I see a CD for half price, a month after it is released, I wonder why(?). But I purchased this CD anyway, because I'm a Carole King fan. After the first 2 songs, I realized why it was half price. I now own 2 very expensive coasters. Where is Been to Canaan, or Corazon or Brother Brother or the drums or the sax in Jazzman. I'm sorry, but I had to remove it from my car's player. I almost thru them out the window, but decided not to. Not to be cruel, but this CD stinks. I own her live album from a few years ago & it's far better than this one. DON'T waste your money. I gave it 2 stars because I like her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Living Room Tour","review":"I have always been a fan of Carole King, but I am sorry to say that this album really disappointed me. I wish I could return it, I will not listen to it a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS PRETTY DARN CRAPPY","review":"Wow! Before buying this CD I read the glowing reviews and thought I have to buy these CD's. I am very disappointed, Carole sounds simply awful, I can't believe she put this product on the market. The vocals are awful plain and simple. The sound quality of the CD is no better, BUYER BEWARE THE REVIEWS OF THIS CD ARE WAY OFF. You would find better use for your money by going out into the street and just throwing it into the air, hoping that who ever picked it up would have more sense than to spend it on this poor endeavor. I swear there are songs where Carole sounds like she is dying a slow death."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love her, but . . .","review":"I could not get by the poor vocals. I know she is 62 and it is about the music, but it was too much for me.

Once was enough and I returned it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful recording","review":"I don't know if it was the recording engineers fault, the engineer that set up the show, or just her awful raspy voice, but I was sick in the stomach listening to all the distortion in her voice. Killing me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its To Late...to get my money back","review":"I found this two disc set at a flea market for \\"only\\" $5.00, and thought I had stumbled onto a steal. After listening to just the first disc I was the one who got fleased. Carol's vocals at 62 are so bad you wonder what they were thinking when they put this live disc out. A very disapointing selection from one of the 70's best singer/songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, But True","review":"I was so excited to listen to this live album when I received it. After listening to two songs I detected the vocal loss in this beloved 62-yr old vocalist. There is an unfortunate, but noticable gravelly vibratto in her delivery. Time and tide wait for no man or woman however endeared. I don't have the heart to listen again to this album. I want to remember her the way she was, like my ex-wives when I first fell in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Artist, Awful Recording","review":"The vocals on this CD are drenched with Auto Tune hardware/software from Antares. This alone ruins every single track because it gives them all the \\"Cher\\" effect with too perfect unnatural pitch changes and extended modulated warbles on every held note.Maybe you won't notice it but I did. I sincerely wish they had just let Carole sing and capture it as was without embellishment. The tuning was either done live when it was recorded via hardware or after the fact. It's a common place on many recordings but I prefer warts and all for \\"live\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Living Room Tour","review":"Extremely dissapointed with this new live album from Carole King, She has lost her great voice, the orchestration is very poor, she will be better off if she worked this album in a studio.

I saw the live show at the Greek Theatre in L.A. so a lot of it was memories of that magical night. But the performance of these many beloved songs (as well as some I'd never heard before) is a treasure to be savored again and again. I love Carole King and admire her beyond words. She is a genius and a national treasure. Everyone who ever owned a Tapestry album in the 70s needs this critical update to the Carole King legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piano Songs","review":"I like all the songs and most of all the unique arrangement by Jim Brickman himself. It's just like bringing and listening Jim Brickman to our home. Though it needs a lot of practice to master each songs, I love every bit of it and enjoy playing it in the comforts of my home. For those who are fond of piano songs and instrumental, this is a must have. Also, I would like to appreciate my shopping with amazon.com which has been great and easy for me especially the free shipping. Sure enough, I would be shopping with them again in the future. Thank you.Roen DiazAthens,AL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brickman-like, but not Brickman transcriptions","review":"These arrangements have the standard syncopated Brickman stylings and harmonies. Nevertheless, I was disappointed to find that they are not necessarily note-for-note transcriptions of his recorded versions. While Joy to the World is probably an accurate transcription, Oh Holy Night is nowhere close. In fact, its not even a good arrangement in my opinion. Silent nite is close but missing some harmonic notes that intermediate pianists can probably fill in, especially if you know how to play from a fake book. Fortunately, a more faithful version of Oh Holy Night (albeit simpler) is available for digital downloaded on its own through a separate website.So if you just want to have Jim Brickman type of arrangements of Christmas Carols, you will be happy with the book. If you wanted to actually replicate some of his stylings and capture his sound, this album is hit or miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Brickman Piano Book","review":"Beautiful Christmas pieces.

I have some arthritis in my knees and have lower back issues so traditional situps and bike riding don't work for me. I purchased this DVD with Quick Fix Hip Hop Abs and I prefer this one. I don't have issues with my knees or back when I do these workouts and I love the chance to do just one of the 3 workouts if I'm pressed for time.

I own probably over 15 workout videos, since I bought this one over 2 months ago, I primarly workout to this one. By the end of the workout I work up a good sweat. The best thing about this video is the instructor she is not too cheesy and annoying. The quick fix work out clock keeps you motivatied by allowing you to see how much time you have left. The music is good too. You will see results with time. I have noticed more leg definition in my legs since I started this routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I was looking for a 30-40 min workout that I could do easily 2-3 times a week. I work full time and have a toddler so I don't have much time. This is a great workout and most importantly to me, this woman has great form. She obviously has proper training in martial arts or just in how to throw punches and kicks. So you won't get injured imitating her. She knows what she is doing. She goes just slow enough so that you can pick up the routine but not so slow you don't get your sweat on. The third workout is not as strenuous as the first two but overall this is a great DVD.

There was a bit too much jumping and twisting of my lower back for me... But I did enjoy this workout.I like that it's fast. 30 minutes.

This is a great addition if you don't have time for a long workout.In the beginning-- I thought I was going to have to resell this dvd -- I didn't feel like I was getting anything out of it.

It's good for beginners but probably not challenging enough for advanced people. It's still a good work out and the best workout is the 10-minute bonus total body workout-it really gets your heart pumping. Although the host looks like Barbie, her back-up girls are muscular and ripped (keeps you motivate to look like them!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"This was average.

It would have been better if it had different combinations similar to what you find at a gym kickboxing class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"I bought this DVD years ago & it is still one of my favorite workout DVDs (and I have a big collection). Easy to follow, but still a good sweat. A good mix of kicks, punches, and combo routines.

This is a simple, quick workout when you need a fast calorie burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jambob","review":"I hate exercise but LOVE this DVD,,,,,just enuf in 10 minutes or use up to 4-10 minute segments...your choice..each segment is varied enuf to make it interesting.

I am new in kickboxing, but I totally love this dvd and Janis Saffell. I tried Billy Blanks but his moves don't vary. Janis is very motivating without being over.

Definitely a great exercise that I will continually enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really helpful","review":"This book is really helpful in a way to understand cultural difference. It focuses on new immigrants issues, multiculture team work and communication barrier. Also focuses on why this has happend and how to overcome it. Different countries have different working style and one really understands this when reading this book. It also emphasises all the ideas a technical person needs to overcome all barriers and get aquainted withmulticulteral system.The most important representation for me in this book are pages 69, 91, 93,and 148, as well as the graphs on pages 188, 216, and 217."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid misunderstandings","review":"Based on my managerial experience of working for 10 years in the Far East, this book provides a lot of useful advice that helps avoid cross-cultural misunderstanding.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone involved in international management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed; Cottrell much better","review":"I had high hopes for this book but was ultimately disappointed. Forline's sometimes explains things brilliantly, but much of the time he writes in an inconsistent manner, provides unsatisfactory explanations, and isn't entirely clear.

(Shoot.) It's still worth every penny. Bryan Duncan's 1989 album still holds up musically (except for \\"Don't You Wanna Rap\\" which was NEVER in style - sorry Bry - but after 10 years, I finally got the joke). Notable songs include adult contemporary hit \\"Stand In My Place\\", smooth \\"Strong Medicine\\", intimately jazzy \\"Lies Upon Lies\\", and joyful \\"Hand It Over\\". Every song has an infectious hook and are very sing-alongable.

This information is buried on the support pages instead of the compatiblity page of the manufacturer's web site. I would have given this 4 stars if they had disclosed this.If it had worked with my palm, I would say that it is very compact and light weight. It is similar in size to a white board marker when reeled in. The cable isn't long at 30 inches, but usually that is enough. Highly recommended as a compact alternative to a cradle.The plug where the usb connector is attached to the cable looks like it might not last forever cause the cable is so thin and you usually accidentally push on the connection when plugging in the cable. But if you want compact for travel or as a backup to IR this is the choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised.","review":"The low price on this was great for a traveling charger for my Palm, but it is advertised as a syncer, but it doesn't sync at all.

However, I picked up this book recently after consciously avoiding it for years, and was very pleasantly surprised: if you gloss over the \\"goddess archetype\\" premise, and simply read the different sections, you will find some interesting, useful, well-researched, well-presented information regarding some potential roots of each character they address. The Matthewses shouldn't be the only scholars you follow - the works of Geoffrey Ashe, Norris Lacy, Roger Sherman Loomis, Jean Markale, Ronan Coghlan, and many others are useful and valid for those interested in the topic - but you could do a lot worse than to add \\"Ladies of the Lake\\" to your armory of Arthurian knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on the subject","review":"Overly complex in exposition.

They are MUCH better made than any other organizers we have ever had. The full extension roller guides work smoothly and allow for easier access than the typical 2/3 to 3/4 extension of the cheaper wire basket types. There is no wobbling. The extremely heavy gauge metal rod construction (19 pounds!) leads us to believe they will stand up to much use/abuse and outlast us.They are expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty design","review":"The C6512 has a higher price tag as what was available at the local Home Depot, but the construction quality is much better.

My husband (who claims to be not very handy) did it in under 20 minutes.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is awfully expensive. I believe I paid almost $100 for it because I couldn't find it for less.

It appeared that neither of the latter two allowed you to import actual performed music (not just loops or midi files) and work with them, so I went with Music Maker. Big Mistake. This is the most complicated, non-intuitive piece of software I have ever seen. It is an English remake of an original German product, which might explain why it is so complex. Further it is in its twelfth revision, and over the years, its core audience has gotten so used to using it that the programmers have left out all the \\"small steps\\" that a newbie needs to be able to figure it out.There is no manual, and no \\"Dummies-type guide\\" for this stuff.

Just for clarification, there are no step by step instructions just complete drawings of rigging sequences. All lines are labeled for you on there perspective drawings and there is a set of excellent belaying plans for you near the end of the book. No reading is necessary, just looking.

Well designed and an informative resource.Michael"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning the Ropes.","review":"This book is a must for the modeler of a square rigged ship. When it comes time to pass and secure the fore top clewline you will want this aid. It is so appreciated because of the author's technique of dissection of the rigging anatomy to its component parts in separate diagrams. It isn't perfect since it can't really cover all the possible variations on the rigging elements, but it's a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"elegant, best of breed","review":"There is quite simply no better book of photographs of this part of NY. The author must have spent a couple of decades or more, taking pictures, to get a collection like this. The Mayan temples existed long before Catherwood,The Lost Cities of the Mayas: The Life, Art, and Discoveries of Frederick Catherwood, of course, but Catherwood put them in the public eye, with magnificent renderings. This is a similarly magnificent rendering of Wall Street. It is a joy to look at. It has a useful history of some Wall Street firms, as well. Architecture tells the history of a place, and this tells you the history of lower Manhattan. The anecdotes are fascinating, as well. This is a model for what a good book of architecture would look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Martin Zellar & the Hardaways","review":"Martin Zellar's 3rd album since the demise of the Gear Daddies is another excellent roots-rock outing. Zellar is a terrific singer and songwriter, and his band the Hardways provide great accompaniment for him to do his thing. This is a very organic sounding album, lots of acoustic and electric guitar, organ, and even horns and strings on a couple of tunes. While definitley a rock & roll album, there is a pronounced (in a good way) country influence here. It's twangy in spots, but this is a good thing, not a cheesey, formulaic modern-Nashville thing. It's a crying shame that an artist with such great, honest work doesn't get more airplay (but considering the crap on the radio these days, maybe that's a good thing). This album should appeal to fans of Springsteen, Mellencamp, The Eagles, BoDeans, Wilco, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"No laughing matter--author should attend obedience school","review":"This appears to be a self-published, vanity press type book with all the self-centeredness that suggests.

This same thing happened to the Grundig, earlier model that I bought for him the year before. This replacement proved to be equally disappointing. I have to add that he enjoyed the earlier model before the antenna broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"FR300 Radio Review","review":"I am very pleased with the product.

Thank you for making this product available and at such a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT GREAT, but good for what it's for...","review":"I purchased this radio thinking it would be a little bit better quality than it turned out to be. However, I bought it for emergencies (I live in So. Cal) and use it occasionally to listen to the weather and surf reports (I live 100 feet from the ocean). It works great when hand-cranked and the cell phone charger works very well- my daughters have put it use on their tired cellies. I've taken it camping and have enjoyed listening to local high school sports radio stations and talk shows...and tide, weather, and ocean conditions reports on NOAA.Anywho, the FR300 could stand to be better quality for $50.00, but it does the job as intended and it's kinda fun and my kids love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much for $50","review":"I looked around at what was on the market. This unit looked good. I went with it over the Oregon Scientific products because I wanted to have a regular radio as well. First the unit is much poorer quality they you would expect by the brand name and pictures. It works OK but the design of the front panel controls is poor. I am always bumping on the light or some other function or bumping off some function. The front selection knobs stick out and move easily. I can not recommend another unit that has both weather and regular so I bought this one. Think carefully before you buy this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency backup radio","review":"I purchased 4 of these as safety items for our extended family. Power outages have become too common in the northeast, and response time suffers with the conglomerant power companies. The combination of radio - weather reporter - light and siren - phone charger etc. in a self-powered package, gives a feeling of security in an unsecure world. The analog dial is maneuvered by a smooth vernier tuning mechanism, and the speaker produces clear voice and music tones.. The only doubtfull feature is the cranking mechanism. I also have an original (So.African Mfg) \\"freeplay\\" radio which has a MUCH MORE STURDY crank.. Time - and careful use - will be the judge.. This radio also is available with shortwave - but local weather news seemed more important.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent quality radio for the money. Definitely for emergency use and not much else.","review":"This is no hi-fi quality stereo system. It's an emergency radio, which is fairly durable, has nifty features like a flash light and siren, and can work both on batteries and from cranking. The sound is not going to dazzle anybody - once again, this is an emergency radio. Worth the money and certainly good to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little unit","review":"I have had this unit for a few years now. Like most reviews said, it isnt the best, but it has come in handy. The led light is nice, the speaker is clear and the cell phone charger is amazing assuming you put some effort into it. I converted one of the cell adapters to USB female, with that, i can charge usb gadgets with the hand crank. It requires a lot of cranking but to be able to charge a cell phone (or any usb gizmo I got, which is loads) it is very nice.During a recent power outage I was able to entertain myself with the tv reception (which unfortunately is gone when the digital tv switch happens)and use the light to illuminate the area I was in.Would be a 5 star rating but no AC adaptor, and the fm is kinda poor. I got mine clearance for 20ish So i am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right for the purpose","review":"Not sure I understand other complaints about quality of reception. Maybe its a location thing? I get better FM, AM on this small radio than on any other I own. Also good reception of TV channels and adequate reception of local weather channel. Love it! I may take it out of my disaster box and use it regularly. Besides, it's so darn cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great emergency radio","review":"Eton FR300 Emergency Crank Radio Metallic SilverI got this radio due to the Hurricane season now upon us.

HOWEVER, it does NOT recharge many cellphones! Their tech support group (1-800-872-2228) confirms this. I reported that it won't recharge the Nokia 3595 (for example), and would they publish a list of non-compatible cellphones on their website. They said no, that they just wanted to sell as many products as possible and if the units didn't work, then consumers can return the units. This is a stupid and greedy product strategy. There's no reason that the company couldn't put a list on their website to confirm or advise to buyers if there are known incompatabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eton FR300 Emer Radio - quit working","review":"I purchased this radio in March of 2005. It worked fine for about 6 months. Then it quit working. It no longer received the broadcast of the test emergency signals in my area every week. I found an internet site and contacted the company via email. They helpfully told me how to return the unit and gave me a return authorization number. I returned the unit at my own expense. After two months and no word I emailed again and asked the status. No one answered, but the radio was returned to me about 2 weeks later. It still does not receive the test alerts and the reception is now filled with static. Since I assume I have to pay to mail the unit back to the company each time, I do not believe this is a cost effective transaction. I would not recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crank doesn't work for very long","review":"I purchased this, and used the crank steadily for 5 days, about 8 hours a day up at my cabin. On the 5th day, I had to crank for 2.5 minutes to get 45 minutes of playing. It's been getting less and less as I go along. I am really not happy w/ this product, since I bought it exclusively for the crank. If you're buying it for that reason, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad Upgrade to the Grundig FR200","review":"For both emergency and regular use, which I covet both reasons based on where I live, this Eton FR300 is a minor, but otherwise not bad, upgrade to the dependable FR200. It looks and feels durable right out of the box comparable to the FR200. With NOAA Weather bands instead of Short Wave channels I will never use, I'm kept up to date with any weather emergencies. The T.V. channel feature is also solid; I get my channels for news and information up here. With the crank handle I will never really need an adapter or batteries in the case of an emergency.There was some short comings. Reception on the FM bands are great, but AM is bit cluttered compared to the sharpness of the FR200. The lack of an AC adapter for charging up the battery or just simply playing the radio is missing. However these shortcomings can be overlooked based on owner's needs, which in this case I can.I recommend this if you want something more than just the Gundrig FR200."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is left unsaid","review":"Neither Amazon nor Eton mention that the TV1 and TV2 channels will go silent after February 2009."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-durable","review":"Yes I like the AM reception-- But after using the Eton Fr-300 for thre months. The hand crank generator failed. With an inspection internally I found it was due to a Plastic reduction gear.

So I did not get a chance to try that feature.with my kyocera phone.I would suggest if you want to be emergency ready with this radio. To looking for the Solar adaptor from c.crane radio.com.But myself I have not been very happy with how long the hand crank lasted before it failed.But when it was working.

Now, I've never been to Hong Kong but I have more than a vague feeling that Hong Kong T.V. ads probably look a lot like Wong Kar-wai movies: brooding Orientals wallowing in overbearingly dated French-chic.If all there is to making movies is conjuring up a couple of wacky characters doing wacky things for no rhyme or reason then I guess anyone could do it. Strike that. Only Wong Kar-wai is this contrived. Let's just hope his own worthlessness finally dawns on him before he vomits up more bad ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Standards","review":"One more pretentious exercise in pointlessness.

I actually watched the entire movie, if you can call it that. From the at-a-glance I had thought it was about a hit-man and choices he had to make, but as far as I can tell it is about a few mentally/emotionally challenged people. This entire film is disjointed and jumps from character to character, it has no sense of time, or sense of direction, there is more narration than dialog. You will continually ask yourself what is this movie about, it is not a work of cinematic art. There are so many out of focus scenes you might think you need glasses, it's seems like a bunch of unrelated scenes were spliced together in no particular order. As someone else said the only thing mildly interesting in this movie were the two, fully clothed, female masturbation scenes. Really not a movie to be praised, there is nothing to see here, please move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, Exhiliirating and Inspiring","review":"This movie is absorbing and enchanting without a minuet of boredom which in itself is quite a feat. A follow up to the superb \\"Chungking Express\\" this is like it's darker counterpart. The scene when Leon Lai walks Karen Mok home in the rain breaks my heart everytime...and the scenes with Takeshi Kaneshiro and the ice cream guy has me laughing out loud every time. This movie and it's predecessor are must see movies. These are the types of movies that turn you on to these types of movies. Wong Kar Wai has a rare talent for capturing moments. Perfect music selection especially \\"Karmacoma\\" and the Cantonese song that Michelle Reis plays on the jukebox called \\"Forget him\\" by Teresa Tang.This and \\"Chungking Express\\" are two of the only movies that I rewatch because I fall in love with them all over again each time. The director honestly shows the raw emotions in a way that you can't help but feel them too. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best use of celluloid in the 1990's","review":"Wong Kar-Wai's \\"Fallen Angels\\" is visually grabbing and emotionally powerful. If you have been brain-washed to accept the garbage Hollywood puts out every week, then you will be mesmerized and blown away by what a real director can do.

I have fallen in love with Fallen Angels. A visual tour-de-force that is both dark and upeat, with oddly endearing characters and an unending stream of unique movie moments.

A random page of Green will provide the shivers of recognition and insight that this feeble effort sadly lacks.Thud. 2 stars because it can be bought for a penny used, is portable and, after a page or two of boredom, tossable.Les francais diraient que l'auteur est deja epuise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"Out of the way interesting places in paris- really made my trip richer.

It bored me. I was looking forward to an alternative view--after all, the original flaneurs didn't sit around in drawing rooms, but ventured into grittier corners of Paris. But White managed to do what no one else has done before: he managed to make unfamiliar, little explored parts of Paris dull. I read a great deal of travel literature (I've got well over 1000 travel titles on my shelves); this one wasn't worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely what it seems","review":"This is not your charming, harmless, Hemingway-like account of a flaneur in Paris as you imagine by the cover and title. While it will satisfy some of your cravings of the Paris athmosphere as you read it, its buildings and neighborhoods, it shows so much of the subjectibility or the writer that I didn't feel like continuing to read it. I don't mind what he is but, he too much focuses on that (also showing the reader some of the writer's own prejudices), it comes as a surprise while you read the book and out of context. At least he should have titled the book \\"The flaneur\\" promenades on Paris. I only would like to know better what I buy before I buy it. It deceived me.

It is TOTALLY halloween, so it's very seasonal. It is another of the \\"real\\" movies like Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island. Not my favorites, as that alone missed the whole POINT of Scooby Doo! It's too scary for the littlest ones and the older kids were bored with it. The thread of the story gets lost as they try to incorporate everything ever connected with halloween. It jumps around so much that you are never sure what exactly it was that you are supposed to be hoping happens! We watched it once, but I doubt we will ever watch it again. My vote, as an adult, is pass on this one. It's not clever at all, which is surprising given the cast (the reason I took a chance on it), no fun dialogue, no characters to cheer for, just plain BORING and flat.

I prefer these types of cartoons compared to the new ones-which on TV are completely inappropriate for smaller kids. I think it makes my kids use their imagination more; each one allows them to play a part; They try to solve the mysteries as they watch. Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King was alright to them I know they seen a bunch but it's worth trying.

When i was a kid, the CPS and XP models of the Super Soakers dominated summer. XP guns were smaller, and could shoot at least 40 feet, some reaching 50, all while highly accurate. CPS (Constant Pressure System) guns were for power, shooting a thicker stream from durable nozzles. I myself owned many CPS guns and two XP models, and had tons of fun with other kids. Nowadays, guns have everything from laser pointers, despite the fact that playing with water guns in the dark is just ridiculous; Battery powered internal chilling mechanisms that reduce water temperature? Just use cold water from a hose, what's the point? And useless \\"flash flood\\" sprays that do nothing but waste water. If you want a good water gun, go for the old ones.

The flash flood mode does not work at all. Four days: broken. Leaks. Everytime I pump it now, it squirts a small mist, not enough to soak anybody. And, because of this, it never has any pressure, so the normal gun doesn't work either.

If we as the buying public refused to purchase from such companies - who could (and service wise, should) remove the stickers before shipping or at the very least, find easily peeled stickers. I spent 15 minutes on the mess delivered on this cover. Shame on a company for making its inventory convenience more important than its delivered product quality.

Delivery from Amazon was, as always, sooner than advertised.This is one of those products that you just have to have faith will do what it's supposed to.

From what I can tell thus far they were spot on. The exterior looks like any other CO or smoke detector you might find in the hardware section of a store. The template and screws that are included make it extremely easy to mount. I especially like the LED display that tells you the current level of CO in ppm (parts per million) of the sampled air.

The digital readout takes any guess work out of the picture. Another nice feature is the low battery alarm that tells you when to replace the batteries. This unit should be replaced after seven years ( like most i suppose ) and it even will sound an alarm that tells you when it's time to replace it.

When it first arrived, it worked as intended. After about 1.5 years, the display stopped working correctly and had missing segments on the LCD. Pressing the Test button produced no test alert. Replacing the batteries had no effect. What bothers me is that there was no \\"warning\\" that the device was failing. I never once heard the slightest chirp from it. What good is a 5 year warranty if there's a good chance you won't even notice the device has failed until it fails to save your life. And you die. Does that seem melodramatic? Maybe. But when discussing a device designed to save lives, I think it's a realistic assessment of the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for the buck","review":"No issues so far with this unit.

I can admire them but never afford these iconic art pieces. The beauty of Ingrid Cranfield's \\"Art Deco House Style\\" is that it concentrates on more modest homes and interiors. Nearly every page is filled with period photographs of house exteriors, furniture and other household objects.

The average 1930's kitchen just does not cut it these days. This book showed original Art Deco kitchens but no new kitchens in Art Deco style.

A big surprise and most people do not like complete surprises in the products they are purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lulu you loved as a child","review":"Only when I saw this DVD in a Shopko did I remember my old, worn-out VHS tape of Little Lulu I loved as a child. This DVD includes the only 8 episodes I am familiar with:Chick and Double ChickBargain CounterattackA Bout With a TroutLoose in a CabooseBored of EducationA Scout With the GoutMusical LuluThe Dog Show OffThe cartoons are great but the DVD will leave you wanting. Absolutely no extras and it comes in a paper sleeve. The picture and sound quality are not DVD quality. But if you are a Lulu fan, it's worth it to have these episodes at such a cheap price. I give it a two because the disc has nothing save the cartoons, but they're still great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual and provocative with a sense of humor","review":"The story has been told before, but the way its told here with a Latin flavor, rich characters, and a great sense of humor, it allows for a good deal of enjoyment and learning. There are several mentions of cultural differences and inequalities which are central to the story of many immigrants. A very enjoyable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Startling, yet cliched...","review":"The story is quick to capture one's attention, yet the drama soon turns to fluff in its abundance of super-natural occurances and extreme descriptions. Yes, it tries hard to come across as \\"magical realism\\" in the purest Latin American form; however, it eventually reads like cliched kiosk litterature. By the end of the novel I was simply tired of reading about those magnificent emerald eyes and pomegranate lips...The incestous plot could have been just as interesting without the parties being such captivating beauties and \\"extreme\\" in all their actions. Even the repetitious love-making scenes are described with the nuance of Danielle Steele...The story does include interesting elements of the struggle to be of South American origin living in the US, and the descriptions of the contrast between those who consider themselves \\"exiles\\" and those who remain \\"Cuban-to-the-bone\\" are colorful.Overall a quick, but ultimately unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mangos, Bananas, and Coconuts","review":"This is a great and fascinating read, filled with local color, intrigue and a great plot. \\"Mangos\\" is very fine literature indeed and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Nuts","review":"First got these as a thank you from a friend....we loved them. Sent them to friends....nothing but rave reviews from all."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books will become classics in any owners collection.","review":"I bought the first two of these books when I was 6 at the school book fair and read them over and over throughout my childhood. I'm 20 now, have since bought the last two, but still have my originals and, on occasion, read them. They are wonderful books that would be enjoyed by any cat-loving person, and have a unique, but endearing story. At the same time, they are short and simple enough for a child to read by themselves in one sitting without being bored. The illustrations go perfectly with the story and are softly coloured, fine-lined, detailed drawings which add to the charm of the books. Overall, these are an excellant choice for anyone looking for childrens books that have the quality and timelessness of classics like \\"The Velveteen Rabbit.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"I read this book when I was little, and even today, I still love it! It's a wonderful, charming book, with the cutest illustrations. Although it's directed mostly toward little kids, I think that any cat lover would enjoy this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catwings","review":"This is about the book CATWINGS. There are four cats: James, Roger, Harriet, and Thelma. They all have wings. Their mom, Janet, has always wondered why her kittens have wings and she does not. This book is fantasy fiction.The book has cats with wings I don't think it would be true.In one part of the book Harriet was getting chased by a dog, but her wings got her out. During the book you never know what would happened like, when there was an owl just sitting there watching them, you can find out the rest.I like this book because I love cats. I recommend this book to people who enjoy cats, or like fictional books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful text no pictures","review":"Had hoped to use it as a read aloud but without pictures not good for 7 year olds. Disappointing because it's a cute story with many voices"},{"rating":"2","title":"Six-year-old was delighted","review":"This is a well written, imaginative, and thoughtful book. I enjoyed it, as did the boy I bought it for around the time of his sixth birthday. Looking at the cover, he wondered why cats had wings, but was only mildly intrigued. After we read it once, though, the next two days were dominated by the words, \\"Read Catwings!\\" I'm sure it would continue if I weren't going home tomorrow; we've already read it four times.I definitely plan to order the other books for him. In fact, my preference would be to have them bound together for a cost a little lower than buying them separately, since the first one is quite short to be bound alone. Still, the separate book format makes for more manageable reading sessions; were they bound together, I am sure the plea would be to read the whole thing at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an enthralling book.","review":"All I have to say was that this book, Catwings, weaved an intriguing tale of cats and life in the country.

Overall a very poor support. My last Boxlight lamp is still running after 4 years. This was my first BenQ but surely the last. A strong suggestion, Don't buy BenQ"},{"rating":"1","title":"You are Warned!","review":"Word of Warning. I purchased a BenQ projector and had it for a month before it started to fail and turn itself off. I sent it to BenQ for repair and have not recieved it back. That was over two months ago. I phone them every couple of days and get only lip service, they keep saying it is coming. So before you purchase a BenQ product think about the possibility of it getting repaired...or should I say never seeing it again.You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope Amazon has 0 start option","review":"I confirm that this BenQ projector has either a crappy bulb or bad color wheel. I have used it for about 2 years, only watching movies on the weekends. The recorded bulb usage is 337 hours, and the picture already starts to flicker. At first I thought it might be the 25 feet long signal cable, so I disconnected the cable and just watched the blank blue screen, still flickers! Its promised bulb time is 2000 hours in video mode. If it is only me, I can blame it on probability and statistics. But it does not seem so.I have not yet called BenQ, but since I have used it for two years (I have to check the warranty), and people here already complained about their bad support, I don't have high hope on it. The best thing you can do is not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw you on the Bulb","review":"Low-budget home theatre owner here. Was happy with my unit. Pretty nice picture on a blank white wall. I have a dedicated cinema room that is pitch black so was very happy...until one hour ago. After 300 hours of use my bulb blew. And I never watch more than 2-3 hours at a time, so definitely not a high traffic user. I'm all the way in Hungary and that bulb is about a month's wages for this school teacher. This is a shoddy product, built-in obsolesence to the extreme.

The song has a great drive and is honest about how most people live their Christian walk.Part of Life is one of the best videos I've ever seen. I wish I could find a copy of that somewhere.If You Want to Lead Me To Jesus (which is the song most have heard) is a great lead off for the CD and gives you an idea of how much Grover can rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as described.","review":"This item came well packaged, but had obviously been opened before. It was covered with a sticky substance, almost like it had tape all over it. It was very dirty & tarnished. I have another of this exact light that has hung in my hall bath for 6 years & it is in much better condition than this \\"new\\" one.

She is actually starting to memorise the story and often provides some of the words herself she has heard it that often. She spends ages pouring over each page looking at the detail in each amazing collage. I have visited the Daintree rainforest several times and wondered, as the author says, \\"But will the forest still be here when we come back?\\" I hope it will still be there when I can take my daughter to see it.

I received it before anticipated! All in all, a great shopping experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I visited this place","review":"This is a fictional story but it is based on a real family living in a remote part of the Australian rain forest. You can only take a boat to the beach during high tide and you need to know how to navigate the reef. Unfortunately the reef is not as spectacular as it used to be. The water is not as clear because there has been run off from road construction.Luckily the forest surrounding the homestead is all protected park land now. However, there are still outside factors that can affect the health of the water and the forest. I think this is a wonderful book and the content is age appropriate. We live in a world we have to protect and we need to honor our children by being truthful with them. The artwork is beautiful and rich and the story is closer to reality than one might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is that song?","review":"Does anyone know what song is playing during the scene where they are dancing at a club?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic but not wholesome","review":"The musics are good indeed, but they do not translate the whole mood of the picture, since the scene music where they are dancing in a nightclub does not play. The music is \\"Samba de Janeiro\\", and I suppose it is played by a group called Bellini, but it does not figure in the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cats love it but it broke very easily and is unstable","review":"I purchased this about a month ago at Target. Although it appeared somewhat flimsy as I put it together, I was so thrilled with it at first. The price was very reasonable, it was very easy to put together, and most important of all, my cats (especially my 8-mo old kitten) just love it. My kitten is on it every day sometimes for hours at a time.I've been a bit concerned that it has toppled over a few times since we got it but I was even more dismayed to discover yesterday that the top of the tunnel has ripped. The tunnel is made out of very thin material like that of a windbreaker or duffel bag. Today I discovered that one of the angled arms has also broken. I realize that the price was reasonable but it becomes very expensive when it breaks in about a month.I'm so disappointed because the cats really love this and now I have to return it and find something else for them.

One particularly enjoys playing with the dangling mice, and the other will rest at times on one of the three levels. On that basis, I would rate it as a three star for the price.I do rate it a star lower for a couple of reasons.1) The picture does not emulate the actuality of the model. The picture is multi-colored and bright. The actual gym is a dark, drab blue-green and the mice are grey. A bit of false advertisement should never be rewarded.2) One part inaccurately packed and shipped. There are 4 \\"legs\\" that form the sides of the rounded portion of the gym. Two female parts and two male parts that link together are essential. Mine shipped with 3 male parts and only 1 female, causing me to be unable to construct the rounded portion of the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within two weeks","review":"Although my cats love this, it's not well made. Two support bars broke within two weeks. Replacement bars (2) come in a kit with other things I don't want. The kit is cheap ($5), but you can only buy it online, and with shipping it's about $11 to replace two support bars. My cat weighs 11 pounds, so he's not huge.

The lyrics are moving, almost as if Dr. King himself contributed. When read out loud they are still just as powerful. The slow, soulful expression makes the message dynamic. Because of the Christian doctrine of suffering with Christ and identifying with others, the Gotee Brothers express a unity within the \\"body of Christ\\" that gives a touching view of a hopeful unity among races.

This one, however, takes the prize for the worst I've seen. Frankly, it is not a travel video at all. Rather, it is a narcissistic tale that explains little about Iceland but says a lot about how self-absorbed and provincial one traveler can be. The photos I've seen of Iceland suggest an amazing island of glaciers, geysers, waterfalls and wildlife. This video is limited to shots of the Blue Lagoon (yes, Matt Lauer was there last year for the Today show), a mud bath, drying fish and a bar in Reykjavik, all through the eyes of an annoying (my opinion) camera-hog.

The author seemed to have something to say but it was buried in a sea of disjointed grammatical syntax, poor punctuation and poorly annotated text.Normally, being a writer myself, I can make my way through the most tenuous writing. But no amount of experience can decipher the words of one who does not write grammatically correct sentences and uses punctuation in such a way so as to cloud the true meaning of what he wrote.The sad truth is that this man has something to say but apparently lacks the necessary writing skills to successfully get his points across to the reader.

The only real drama of the film happens about 3/4ths of the way through it... and it's way too brief.Lili Taylor and Bill Pullman give nice performances (which is why the flick gets two stars instead of one), but there's not much else worthwhile here. Pass on this one unless you're the world's greatest Lili Taylor fan or don't have anything else to spend the $8 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but this product was not very sweet, putting a lot of stevia didn't sweeten tea.

It sure reminds me of how much I miss those fun times with roommates, especially coed situations. Unlike most college movies, it's not about fraternities, partying, or goofing around. It's a slower paced, day to day activity that's realistic, dealing with studying, stresses of exams, and campus, rather than flamboyant dramas. This low budget production goes hand in hand as this genre is driven by the atmosphere, characters, and set up. Lizzy Caplan and Izabella Miko play their student roles well beyond carrying a backpack. Campbell Scott plays a depressed but accomplished published novelist who ends up crashing at these girls' place in exchange for tutoring in literature. My only complaint was that the very last end scene was a bit far fetched (exaggerated) and made to appease the Hollywood concept. Don't expect much from this flick, but it's worth it for any college grad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different languages (version)??

Coffee and Bonafide truly take to heart the principle that trying to reach the hip-hop nation with wack flow is pointless and pratice the principle of fly gospel rap. This album also rebukes those who harm the message of Christ, from the 5% infiltration in the church, to the oft difficult environment of being \\"Gospel rappers.\\" I am really feeling tracks 17 and 18. \\"Fragmentation\\" is probably one of the illest cuts I have heard in a long time with the ecclectic piecemeal beat ala Prince Paul.

I like him because he is nice , like when Rose gets sick, he comes to see her a lot.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about 12 year old girls who have lots of adventures and who love to read.

I for my own part, feel sorry for Rose's lonliness that she seems to constantly feel, and how it seems to grow even in town. I also feel a little strange about her love-like feelings with Paul. I don't know.....she seems to take her feelings about Paul so seriously, and I don't know whether people back then truly allowed their emotions to florish or Roger Mcbride just added that little fiction, but I just feel that love for Rose was too soon. As for the plot, its exciting, kinda sad and dramatic.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween How-To","review":"I borrowed this book through our local interlibrary loan system to review its content and I was sorely disappointed. I was expecting a how-to guide for children, based on the cover design, but the book is geared more towards the young adult and adult age group. I was terribly disappointed in the black and white photos the author used, which were tacky and useless. The layout of the page, (i.e., divisions of paragraphs, headings, fonts, etc) could have been vastly improved upon by using color divisions, bars,and such. For an author who prides herself on being a Halloween expert, she lacks the creative edge and eye in her choice of graphic quality to make this book outshine its competition. Also, being a spinal paperback, the pages were easily dislodge from the glue of the spine to be a keepsake book on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between a Rock and a Hard Place","review":"Who ever thought that Jack Palance could ever deliver an emotionally wrought performance at this stage in his career? He does just that. He gives such a performance that it is just heartbreaking to watch him. Jack Palance had more range than he was ever given credit for having. This is a brutally well scripted realistic film directed by Robert Aldrich. Wendell Corey also gives a rationally based, cold and detached, but curiously humane performance driven by the system and in too deep for his own good but his conscience reminds him that he really should know better. Perhaps all the characters actually do know better and know that there truly is no way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought & Overwritten","review":"The Big Knife is Clifford Odet's tale from the dark side of Hollywood, clumsily adapted from his stage play about a mega star yearning to break free from the the studio yoke. Most of the supporting cast offer fairly low-key performances while the major players seem miscast, especially Jack Palance. He's a fine actor but tries to keep his part interesting by relentlessly mugging, exercising and sweating his way around the set. I'm not suggesting that you don't watch this curiosity...by all means, you need to see it just for the sheer pleasure watching Rod Steiger's scenery-chewing movie mogul. His odd vocal cadence and fevered histrionics became a staple for any comedian doing impressions in the 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I rarely dislike old classics, film noirs, thrillers, dramas, ect. But this flick was one of the worst. Firstly, you never warm to any of the charactors. The script is begging for help throughout and the plot drags on and on until it finally ends leaving you wondering if you missed something. Nope, you didn't. You just lost 2 hours of good downtime. Watch Vertigo instead :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christian Music","review":"This is a must have for any Acappella fan.

Also, the problems given in the book are valuable for a further understanding. Using it together with the book by Green, Schwarz, Witten one will afterwards have indeed little problems understanding the papers on this subject. However one caveat: if one reads this book, he or she shoudl be always aware that this topic is still deeply a research subject and by no means settled like mechanics. If this is always kept in mind, then this book is of considerable help in understanding one of the current frontiers of physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well developed main character makes this a great read","review":"This book pulls you in quickly. You follow the main character as he runs into one dangerous situation after another. The plot may be old hat after you finish the book, and if you really reflect on it, it seems dull and obvious, but while reading Morrell's books, you just can't put them down. I reccomend all of Morrell's books. This one might not be his best, but its a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just couldn't put the book down","review":"David Morrell has done it again. Desperate Measures caught my eye and never let go. The plot was unusual but fascinating. (with David Morrell as the author I wasn't suprised)A great novel to get yourself into, I also suggest another book of his \\"The Covenant Of The Flame\\" is also a great novel to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made-for-TV type fluff","review":"Reading this book was like watching a made-for-TV movie; it was somewhat entertaining, somewhat predictable, somewhat preposterous and completely forgetable. I read this during a beach vacation and it definitely kept me interested, but always in the back of my mind was this voice telling me how ridiculous the book was. Read it if you have nothing better to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Morrell's best","review":"Suspenseful at times, good action, but a pattern develops, as I remember (it's been 2 or 3 years since I've read it). The pattern is: 1. our hero runs to a person for help; 2. within minutes assassins kill the person our hero has contacted and our hero narrowly escapes; 3. repeat steps 1 and 2 about a dozen times. Not a terrible book, by any means, just disappointing. Keeps you interested while you're reading, but a week later you think: \\"It really wasn't that good after all, was it? And why do I talk to myself so much?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal???","review":"This author basically rips story line from other famous writers (i.e.-Stephen King, Peter Benchley), and submits it into an almost anthological format. You'd expect that because it's part of a trilogy that somewhere along the way, you would get the whole story of the inn and its history, but you get NOTHING. These novels skip from one decade to another with no fillers in between to tie them together. Given the chance, I wouldn't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't watch it all.","review":"I hate to disagree with the other reviewers, but after about 40 minutes of this, I had enough.

This book will take you to each mission (in WW II) like you were there. Spine chilling details of almost fanatical dedication to triumph over any challenge! Highly recommended to anyone interested in historical diving and underwater warfare. In the minus side, the book could be improved with more and better photographs of the gear and equipment used by these early underwater wariors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to Logic Design","review":"As a student, I often found this book to be helpful in my studies. The examples are a bit sketchy, but they force you to think to apply them to the material. The chapters are a bit confusing, but you shouldn't be using this book for an introduction to this course. Overall, this book is good for the intermediate or advanced digital logic technician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This text book was the required text book for my Digital Techniques I class. I'm simply posting this remark so other students will not be as unfortunate as I was in wasting money on this book. I tried using the book at the beginning of the semester, but after 2 weeks I gave up on using it. I haven't opened it since. I felt that there was no since of coherency in the text. I felt the examples were rather poor. There's not even a glossary to look up terms, and the index is not helpful. I don't know enough about digital design to give very constructive criticism on this text. But I know that as a student, I found this book to be very bad. There are many other text books out there that do a much better job of introducing the topics of an introductory digital design class. Use one of those.

Totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heck no!","review":"I think the negative reviews have summed it up pretty good. This book is not clear about anything. They go into great confusing detail just to explain the simplest concepts. Theres not (if any) good step by step guides on how to do the problems in the book. They explain concepts and problems in paragraph format which is dumb. I actually just transfered to a tech school because the texts the University was using were just plain awful.

But, since that volume is now hard to acquire, this makes a fine substitute that also offers a number of reviews, essays, and other tidbits the Agel book didn't have. It's light on photos, which is fine since the volume has limited space and text is the thing. If a bit \\"light-weight,\\" this still makes a fine beginner's volume for scholarship on this landmark masterpiece of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Americana Music","review":"More than three decades ago, I was privileged to sing Frostiana in a chamber ensemble in college. I've often thought fondly of those seven songs that almost magically put several Robert Frost poems to music. They were exciting, mournful, haunting, piercing, majestic songs that beautifully matched his words. This music can minister to the soul, bringing you to moments of rapture one second and to tears another with its sheer beauty. I was delighted to find them here in this album.I honestly bought the album just for the Frostiana numbers, but I have been equally delighted with the other songs contained. The quality is excellent and I have thrilled to listen to each of them. I pray that there is never a day that music doesn't absolutely transform me."},{"rating":"2","title":"JENNIFER KNAPP RULES!

There is no such thing. It is time to dump this deceivers music in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh. My. Goodness.","review":"That's just about all you can say when you first see or hear Jennifer Knapp. I'm not a HUGE fan of acoustic music, although I do like it and really appreciate it. But as far as I'm concerned, Jennifer Knapp just blows everythign else out of the water.Let me focus on three things: 1) songwriting, she has some of the deepest and most touching lyrics you'll ever hear, period; 2) guitar playing, I've heard that she's only played for a few years, but boy can she wail on a guitar. She doesn't do anything fancy, necessarily, but what she does, she does well; and finally 3) singing, I don't think that I've heard too many people with the passion that she has. You can just feel the emotion in her voice.This is an incredible debut album. She's very talented and very sincere. She can only get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unplugged! Uncompromised!

I too often regret buying a new cd to find I've been \\"duped\\" later because the song or two that led me to purchase turn out to be the \\"only\\" decent tracks!

It was much more than coffee house folk or Christian anthem. Her lyrics were human and her voice was raw. I could hear the imperfections but I loved her ability to control her pitch. Her voice sounded like it was better suited for country music, but her music was definitely descriptive of the Christian experience. My favorite tracks were the acappella \\"Faithful to Me,\\" \\"Undo Me,\\" \\"Trinity,\\" \\"Hold Me Now.\\" These songs appealed to me right away, but as I listened more songs like \\"Martyrs and Thieves,\\" and \\"His Grace is Sufficient\\" became favorites. I still say this is one of the best Christian albums ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite rock star!","review":"Jennifer Knapp is my introduction into Christian music, and I must say, she is awesome. I went out and bought her latest \\"Lay it Down\\" as soon as it hit the shelf. And beleive it or not, it is even better than the last, how can that be, I don't know, but this gal is going to be around a long time. Talk about poetry in music, she tops the list. You won't regret getting her C.D.'s I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs with powerful meanings.","review":"Jennifer Knapp has an amazing voice, and the songs are great for listening, but what makes this CD so special is the lyrics and how powerful they are. The lyrics are real, can be applied to you, your life, your faith journey, whether you or at the beginning or the end of that journey. The songs are great for prayer, worship, or just when you want to take a break from it all and spend some one on one time with God. Also a great CD if you want some good background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD no matter what mood you're in.","review":"I've been through some hard times.

This CD plays everyday before I face kids at school, it has good songs and a great message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"This is the second Christian music CD I own. The other is Jennifer Knapps 2nd CD. Her music is wonderful -- hip, rockin', exciting -- all the things traditional Christian music isn't. I'm hooked on her. I sing her music all the time -- even when I'm not listening to the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious","review":"I am your typical narrow-minded music listener who would usually not look twice at this CD, but after recieving it as a gift, I would recommend it to anyone.

Jennifer Knapp has a powerful voice, a great talent with the guitar, and is a phenomenal song writer. She is definately using the talents that God has given her. I would encourage anyone who loves music, and also loves God to purchase this CD.

At first listen, I had difficulty understanding what she was saying. However, as with any musical genre, I learned that the more I listened -- the more I understood.

It was in the Horror section and the front cover showed a rather menacing monkey, so i thought i'd be in for a scary little treat. however, half an hour into the film I realised i was watching a bizarre film about a woman with a pet monkey, who lived with her wheelchair-bound father who she didnt like too much. On the upside, there were a few interesting scenes where the woman imagined retaliating against her father, but thats about it really. the monkey didnt really do anything fantastic either. bizarre film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this Gloomy Gus some Caffeine...or Prozac. Something!","review":"I can't understand the reviews that say \\"Fun!\\" and \\"Toe Tapper!\\" This CD is anything but. The songs are probably fine on their own but the delivery is entirely glum. Does this guy not have kids? Did he make this CD at gunpoint? There is no joy--even when the lyrics are fun and happy there is just not a smile in his voice. Something about the timbre of his voice and the seemingly-too-slow delivery saps all the fun out of it to the point that a couple songs are quite morose. Even the children singing in some of the backgrounds seem half asleep. Aiken Drum actually sounds like a dirge!We can only tolerate about the first 4-6 songs, the best of those being Six Little Ducks, and Paw Paw Patch. I was very, very disappointed although I will say that as soon as the duck song is over my daughter asks for it again so at least we only have to listen to that song. $15.99 is a lot of money for one song.

That said, this is an incredibly bad record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This is not really a BAD toy, it's just sort of disappointing. The lettering on the bottom that gives the dinosaurs' names is hard to read, the figures are of indifferent quality, and most galling, several of the included figures are not even of feathered dinosaurs. I know there are not that many fossil feathered dinos to make, but I'd rather have five well-done, honest-to-goodness feathered dinos than a dozen mediocre figures, with about half being just regular old nekkid dinos. Having said that, being able to hold up, say, the microraptor and asking a kid what that could be, and being told that it's a bird, and then being able to say, \\"No, that's actually a type of dinosaur\\"--is a great way of demonstrating visually the evolutionary connection between avian dinosaurs and modern birds. In other words, even a child can begin to grasp that in an important sense, the dinosaurs never totally died out. They just evolved into emus and penguins and sparrows and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another beautiful collection by Martin B?ttcher","review":"Just like \\"Die Halbstarken/Endstation Liebe\\" compilation, this CD is put together in a manner that is very difficult to match. The songs are more or less available on other compilation (sometimes the newer compilations offer newer arrangements, not necessarily the originals), but what makes this CD unique is an outstanding packaging with a 100+ pages booklet that includes details from the movie opus Martin B?ttcher scored. This music is different because it was written for film, yet the unique musical craftsmanship and superb arrangement by Mr. B?ttcher cannot escape your attention. For $11 plus S&H; and little extra wait, this was a steal.In the past, there was a shortage of his music, especially in North America, but now all important titles are available through Amazon.I recommend this CD for every true lover of film music."},{"rating":"2","title":"its better than what he said","review":"this pack is real good but if you have a water capacity 40 oz or more dont bother buying this unleess you use alot of water i use it on my liquidator and it has like 4 1/2 times more water than before but if you alreaddy have a 40+ oz gun make it debating on how much water you use and if its worth it and yes it does fit on liquidators"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super treat","review":"Watching my grandson run with his supersoaker was entertaining.

On the one hand, this CD is not groundbreaking like some Xymox material, but on the other, the songs are very well constructed. Add Ronny's goth vocals to the mix and you've got exceedingly catchy melodrama! I even got a friend hooked on Xymox with this single (sneaky me!). Anyway, the music...My favorite of the bunch is \\"At Your Mercy\\" (my friend agrees). It's the most Xymox of the bunch. Liberty is pretty good, but is less distinctive. Number 1 is notable because it seems to deliberately copy the Sisters of Mercy, but in so doing puts most of their work to shame. The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is the remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sell out?","review":"The only reason I didn't give this cd single 5 stars is the single, Liberty. Liberty sounds like Xymox's flirt with semi-industrial music (sorry, that's the best way to describe it). It's almost as is Xymox is shooting for air time on American alternative radio, which, unfortunately, employs an \\"avoid like the plague\\" policy to anything laced with synth. Luckily, this cd recovers quite nicely with the other two tracks, Number 1 and At Your Mercy, which are more \\"Xymoxy\\", especially the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, what happened?","review":"It seems that Xymox continues to spiral downward, as they try to clone early goth bands.

In short, the Kodak EasyShare V603 is a very good digital camera for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"The camera has a nice feel in your hand. Not too small, not too big. Zoom and focus work great, low light and back lite shots come out fine. The in camera \\"Perfect Touch\\" option does a great job making mediocre pictures excelent. It saves you from having to load them into your computer to touch up later. Even the video mode is excellent for this size of a camera. My only wish is a better delete menu (you can either delete all pictures or only one at a time, it would be nice to mark pictures for deletion like I had on my old Casio) and a hand strap instead of the cheap-o neck strap. It seems to be impossible to find a handstrap! If you are in the market for a compact camera that is easy to use and takes great pictures at a good price, this is it.

I liked it's small size, brilliant LCD, and overall metal body. However, it uses too small battery that always make me nervous about the juice. (The camera won't show you the charge level unless it's almost gone) Also, V603 doesn't have any fancy mechanism like vibration reduction.However, I'm very happy with it's software side, I mean, the operational software that's inside the camera.It has a nice panorama stitching function, which lets you combine up to 3 pictures. Creates a very sharp and seamless panorama that was better than any similar software I've seen that runs on the computer. Another fun widget is called Perfect Touch, which compensates underexposures typical to a flash indoors shot. Of course you can do the similar thing in Photoshop, but hey, it's just more handier.I recommend V603 for its low price, nice looks, and some of those fun and easy functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!","review":"I love my little V603!

Unfortunately, after using the camera for a day, I decided to return it. First, the positives: the camera is very small and compact; it is very attractive; the interface is intuitive; the instructions are clear; and the camera is ready for the next shot almost instantaneously. The negative: the picture quality is very very poor. Specifically, I took a number of indoor shots during the evening. The photos were dark--esp. near the edge of the photos where the images were cloudy. In contrast, I took my older Sony Cybershot camera and took the same shots. The difference in picture quality was dramatic: the Sony shots were brighter and much more crisp.

Maybe we all had too much wine but we were all laughing out loud and not just once...The whole idea of the unrequited love thing based on physical unattractiveness is at best cheesy but the characters in this movie make up for the inane story. Anna Faris as Samantha is a riot and the constant bickering between the main character 'Chris' and his little brother is priceless. Adding to the hilarity is Julie Hagerty's ditzy mom character who says mom-type things like \\"just be yourself\\" and makes it sound really silly. All in all this absurd little movie is a must see and I really don't know why it didn't do well at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best...","review":"As a fan of Ryan Reynolds and someone who loved two of his previous movies - Van Wilder and Waiting - I had high hopes that this movie would at least deliver the same kind of stupid, silly laughter that the previous two movies did. Unfortunately, even though the movie did deliver a fair number of funny moments and great one-liners, it felt flat. Now, I know you don't watch one of these types of movies to look at character development or story arc, but you do need a sense of freshness or ingenuity when it comes to the humor involved or it fails to fully entertain or distract you for a few hours. As much as I laughed, the storyline was unoriginal and you could see what was going to happen - which I admit is not in itself a bad thing - but it took away from the efficacy of the humor. Waiting was a much better movie and much more worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Laugh!","review":"Fun Movie...after a long, hard day at work, this movie will definitely lift your spirits!

After high school he becomes a big shot record exec. and returns home about 10 years later due to a microwave explosion on the company private plane caused by his ditsy rock star client.

The problem with this movie is that the writing is sub-par and the plot goes nowhere. Amy Smart is adorable as usual, and she and Ryan do have decent chemistry, but those are the only redeeming factors. One of the most annoying things about the movie is the normally cute and goofy Anna Faris, whose character is as nice to listen to as nails being run down a chalkboard.

Indigenous cultures, before contact, weren't. This book is clearly written from the perspective of someone who has spent a lot of time among indigenous peoples. Really good books are such that you can read them several times, and get new insights each time. This book is like that, and I re-read it once a year, to get new insights. It has a lot of the heart of indigenous cultures. The heart of the problem is usually a problem of the heart, and this book is very useful for getting to the heart of issues. As a community organizer, student of minimal equipment wilderness survival, and even just human being trying to improve, I have used this book a lot. I have given at least 7 copies of this book to friends. I wish there were more books like this in print. It is really, really good.

I admit that I didn't realize who she was until I saw her in a few \\"Dr. Who\\" episodes around 2006-2007. I looked her up and found that she was linked to \\"Honey ToThe Bee\\" musical track. This cd has a range of fifteen songs and includes \\"She Wants You\\",\\"I Dream\\", \\"Day And Night\\",\\"Something Deep Inside\\", and \\"Caress The Gold\\" as some of the multiple hits on this cd. \\"The Best of Bille\\" is great for those who enjoy hybrids of dance/pop music from the late 90's/early 2000's."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"I would give this 0 stars if it was an option.

Second, if the template you want to customize has clipart from both CD's then you are out of luck. It has you go back and forth putting in CD 1 then CD 2 then back to CD 1.

I checked online and saw that this 'new' verson was in completely new packaging and was called 'Scrapbook Designer Platinum version 3'. So, I assumed, as anyone would that this was a new version. I just got it in the mail and it is exactly the same bulky program...the only thing they have added, is a few more images and sounds (and the new images aren't even that cute).

It lacks the depth that someone truly interested in the flavor of a Mexican Christmas might want, but it a good start for those who know almost nothing about Mexican culture.

Another word: self-infatuated. How about: pompous. Having been overpraised in the past he now sees himself as a fellow artist and equal of a legend like Welles. An intellectual Rupert Pupkin, Thomson doesn't much bother with original research or new interviews so much as mincing daydreaming about how he and Welles are such spiritual kin. Ah, the labors of shared genius! These sections are kind of funny in a way but not for long. The vanity of this approach is breathtaking.Stick with Simon Callow's exhaustive 1st volume bio, or the very good one by Brady, or Barbara Leaming's somewhat hagiographic but highly entertaining bio (the best for capturing Welles'charisma and his own take on his life) or even the rather plodding but informative Bogdanovich interview book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very creepy book","review":"I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light. There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken. For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her. Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.There are some useful takes on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"EASTER PARADE SOUNDTRACK","review":"The music score of this CD is great but this particular one is in analogue/monoral.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Ike could like this one!","review":"Vampire Time Travellers tries using every cliche in the book to make itself an interesting movie. However, in this task the low budget B picture does not succeed. The main characters are four college coeds seeking to join a sorority after arriving at campus. This naturally brings the potential of plenty of racy action, but sadly the chicks are about as sexy as Mamie Eisenhower! The plot is extremely weak, relying on gimics such as time travel and vampires to push the story along at a snail's pace. Since the plot is so thin, this movie would have benefitted from star power in the cast. However, I didn't recognize anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Country Charley","review":"I am very disappointed in this CD.

The cake box package arrived with the 100-stack of discs sliding around on the spindle. Usually there is a foam retainer, or donut, at the top to take up the extra space. With about one inch of free space, these discs were sliding back and forth pretty good, banging against each other like a wannabe slinky.I had planned to use the DVD's for data backups. I decided that they were not worth the risk considering the possible damage from banging around. Returned to Amazon. Perhaps the one star rating is unfair, since I never tried the discs.

I felt touched by the way she talks about time. Her explanation of the subjective feeling of time was close to my feelings and thoughts. However, there is a point after chapter third or fourth that each essay becomes 10 or more random ideas.For example, in chapter 5 the author jumps from globalization to \\"slow food\\" to climate change in a single chapter. I'm sure that the author sees a relation, but I do not see it. I also think it is a shame that the author lost the grip on the style initially shown in chapters one and two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Ghost Warrior is one of those movies I purchased expecting it to be absolutely dreadful, and comedic for that reason. It had all the signs of being a terrible movie. Proudly emblazoned on the video case is \\"By the makers of Troll.\\" That alone makes it look awful. The plot synopsis cements this belief. It's about a Samurai from the 1500s who runs amok in 1980s California.Astonishingly enough, the movie is very good. Sure, there's a whole buttload of suspension of disbelief, but the acting is strong, especially on the part of Hiroshi Fujioka. Watching him makes it easy to suspend disbelief. He is very skilled with his weapons, and his demeanor is redolent with bushido. I'd like to watch more of his films, even though they look uniformly awful. Maybe he's the Japanese version of Rutger Hauer--a good actor with undiscriminating taste when it comes to acting gigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy music with dreadful words","review":"I had been given a tape of the first two Poi Dog albums while in college. The tape had long since been lost, and I decided to replace it by purchasing CD's. I debated about buying both of the first two CD's, but I'm glad I didn't. My fond memories of this music were squashed when I listened closely to the lyrics. This CD is full of hate and I see that others who have reviewed this CD have come to the same conclusion. I wish I'd never given my money to this band, but at least I didn't buy the first CD, too.The CD is musically interesting, but the lyrics are dreadful. The overall message is that if you aren't an atheist, left-wing, socialist, extreme environmentalist, you don't rate. In the Ancient Egyptians, the singer won't ride a car for anything, but in the very next song, he sings the praises of an \\"aimless drive behind a motor wheel\\". I'm sorry, Poi Dog, but I have my own brain -- I don't need your new thoughts corrupting my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"secular humanism... snooze","review":"The music sounds nice and happy, otherwise this would get one star. \\"U-Li-La-Lu\\" is about the only song on here that I ever want to hear again. The lead singer sounds like he's wearing a clothespin on his nose. The lyrics are narrow-minded, naive, and annoying: \\"this great big world is for everyone\\" indeed. This CD is probably great if you have an over-idealistic, socialist worldview. Oh yeah, and you should be an atheist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Sound Ever","review":"You've read some reviews here. This CD has some classic material. I can't really add much to what you've read, except this. These are full-length versions of the material, not abbreviated \\"hit\\" versions. These are the songs you remember (or not) the way they were meant to be herd.I don't know what Sony did, or how they did it, but they achieved the ultimate in digital sound with this series. I've been buying CDs since 1983, looking for all my old favorites. This CD (and the other three in the series)represent an example of perfection in audio reproduction.You MUST get your hands on this collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"We bought this product, and had a problem, hearing crackeling when we started to record audio. We called the customer service line. They were of very little help. Tried several different things, new chords etc. Nothing worked. It was beyond the time for a refund.

We love it, worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, paper knock off of the real game","review":"We bought this for my daughter thinking it was the Monopoly style, just using princesses. We were very wrong. The pawns are actually paper (you punch them out of a card) and stuck into little plastic stands. The game board is even cheap paper...and bends very easily, and sometimes even lays flat enough to allow the pawns to stay upright and in the right spaces. This game was destroyed in only a few playings. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Buy a better game that will last for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!","review":"My 5&1/2 year old daughter received this game for Christmas and it has been great! It is nice to finally be able to play board games with her. This game uses 1,2,3,4 and 5 \\"dollar\\" bills, so she is learning to add and make change as we play. Great for number recognition as well. Unlike traditional Monopoly, a game can be completed in under half an hour, so it holds her attention well without boring the adults. We love this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy This Game","review":"The board is too small, the game pieces are terrible, too flimsy, the printing on the board is too small. The princesses are made of paper punchouts inserted into a paper base. The game board should have been larger and the game pieces should have been made from cardboard, to insert into a plastic base or made of all plastic. As it is the game pieces have difficulty in standing and the slightest breath or movement on the board makes them fall down. Also the castle markers are made of paper and move around on their own while moving the pieces around the board. The only well constructed part of this game is the box. Don't buy this game, it is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy, too cheap","review":"Would it break the Disney bank to provide a CARDBOARD gameboard and some PLASTIC game pieces?

Speaking of food this goes equally well with moonshine, marijuana or cheap beer. Speaking of drugs there is a certain psychedelic touch. This is also one of the better examples of accordion not being not nearly as bad (actually pretty good) as some are accustomed to. Trampled By the Sun is my favorite tune I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hill Country Christmas -- Willie Nelson","review":"If you're a Willie fan -- you'll LOVE this Christmas album!

Overall it is an Awesome piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Sung and Played Holiday Repetoire","review":"This volume is not as well known as the previous volumes in this Quintessential series, but still they're well-sung and played by Billie and her incredible sidemen. The sound quality of this volume is markedly improved and better. By this time, Billie's repetoire finds slow-paced material compared with the outright \\"swingers\\" on her earlier sides, but it's a welcome addition. Billie sounds equally at ease tackling the \\"slow burners\\" as well as the swinging fast ones. There are the usual standouts such as \\"You Go to My Head\\" \\"Very Thought of You\\" and \\"I Can't Get Started\\". Some of the material were later sung by Sinatra and Nat King Cole, but Holiday's versions still stick out in my mind. Only Billie can take laughable material like \\"Moon Looks Down and Laughs\\" and \\"Gonna Lock My Heart\\" and turn them into gems. It's a testimony to her timeless artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start","review":"I'm a huge Billie Holiday fan and this one's my favorite. By this point (1938) she was in complete control of her amazing voice. Her impeccable sidemen (Lester Young, Teddy Wilson, etc) add the perfect accompaniment. This predates Billie's torch singing (\\"Lover Man\\" \\"God Bless the Child\\") by a few years. Here, the songs are upbeat and she seems to be having a lot of fun.A perfect introduction to one of the greatest singers of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by a great talent!","review":"I recently purchased this album, having been a big fan of Skip's music in the past. It did not disappoint. This album showcases Skip's awesome songwriting ability and when coupled with his incredible voice and emotional performances is an instant favorite.The title track has an unusual flow to it but is catchy and heartfelt. \\"Answer To My Prayer\\" and \\"Half Life of a Heart\\" show two different sides of love at it's core while \\"Mary Go Round\\" is a truly masterful story song that is sure to bring a smile. \\"Sliver of the Moon\\" is another sentimental song that should have been a big hit.Skip Ewing delivers the best of what music is all about in this album just as he has in his past works. I hope to hear more from this exceptional artist in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ladies always loved jim","review":"picked up this cd a while ago. was quite impressed with the performance level of the music. there are several very unique renditions of the doors' songs. \\"the end\\" is especially powerful. definately a good pick-up for any doors fanyou won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young author worth following","review":"The subtitle of \\"A Novel of Lust and Transformation\\" caused me to hesitate before picking up this small volume. The subtitle is both accurate and a teaser - the novel never slips into crudeness even when presenting crude behaviour.The tale - a woman transforming into a pig and writing her story when she has accepted a pig life style - is a difficult story to successfully write. Darrieusseeq makes a few slips but clearly establishes herself as an author to be watched.The social message of the book is a little overbearing, a little \\"plastic\\". But the book as a whole is sufficiently interesting that the reader is willing to forgive the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty in Pink","review":"After looking at the front and back covers I feared this might be yet another overhyped little novel about sex by an overhyped writer - a book that would start with a sprint and then run out of ideas after 40 pages. Although the novel sags half way through, it recovers well and exceeded expectations. Apart from the obvious winks at Orwell and Kafka, the book also reminded me of Zahavi's Dirty Weekend and Atwood's Handmaid's Tale. It's like a Will Self novel, except that it it has humour, heart, narrative skill...and truffles. Four Oinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slop Stories","review":"Read this 4 or 5 years ago. Didn't get \\"it\\". Way beyond my capacity to interpolate from reality to suspended disbelief. The characters are not intelligent, appealing, or funny.

I give this book kudos for being only slightly longer than this critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution for big TV/small space","review":"So glad I ignored the negative review.This is a sturdy, attractive TV mount that provides the solution I neededto fit a large flat screen TV (46\\") into a cramped space.It arrived fast (with no extra shipping charges.)

IT IS JUNK!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I received one, and the box was THRASHED (holes, rips, etc.). The finish is so fragile, that just the friction of the cardboard box it comes in was enough to permanently scuff off the finish from top to bottom of every weight-bearing edge of every piece.I figured it was damaged in shipping, so I had Amazon send a replacement. SAME THING! Box arrived THRASHED (ripped, holes, etc.). I looked inside at the pieces and ALL OF THEM WERE SCUFFED TOP TO BOTTOM **AGAIN**. For my own curiosity, I decided to use a sponge on the scuffs and see if they came off. You know what came off? THE FINISH!!! LOL! Don't buy this thing. Seriously, it is a major piece of crap.

Only once my phone restarted when I played some song. But this hasn't happened again.I suggest people to buy the USB cable for the phone along with this card as its too painful to transfer each song to the phone via bluetooth as you have to individually approve each song for copying (on the phone).

Sandisk makes the best and this is no exception (with a 5 year warranty).My criticism lies in the fact that this card even exists. The card is very slow to transfer files(compared to micro and mini SD cards) and is relatively expensive. Also this card will not work in all Sony Memory stick devices so if you thought you could purchase it for one device and use it down the road (with an adapter) in other Sony devices you may be out of luck (check compatibility to be on the safe side). With Micro SD cards widely available and much cheaper than this one, the fact that Sony developed this card seems to be to line their own pockets rather than truely innovate.The worst thing about this card is that it only comes with memstick duo adapter and not with a full mem stick adapter so it won't work on most card readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"it's a memory stick. it does what it's supposed to do. however, I bought this as part of an x-mas gift for a friend who used it in her sony erricson cell phone. it lasted a year.

I can't speek to the transfer rate, as I have never owned a competing product, but it seemed a bit slow when loading music, although this may be due to the fact that I used the phone in \\"File Transfer\\" mode with it's USB cable.

But why make his introduction into the rich and luscious world of classical music so utterly bland? These have to be some of the worst renditions of Mozart ever created. They are painful to listen to and should not be your baby's first exposure to classical music.

The production is very simple, piano, guitar, organ, and Willie's voice. Willie's voice is starting to show his age and the guitar work seems a little sloppy in places. Even though some of the songs can be found on other CDs, these are all new performances and not just re-issues of older material. It is an ok CD but out of his 4 Gospel CD's, (The Troublemaker, Gospel Favorites, and Old Time Religion) this is the weakest one. I would recommend any of those CDs before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Lesson that Touched Many Hearts....","review":"This book does a wonderful job at touching on the many different levels of love -- the love you have for your mate, the love you have for your children, the love you have for your parents, the love you have for humanity, and the love you have for God. It reveals love in its purest form.My Sunday School class was doing a study on \\"Dealing with Adversity through Love\\" (focal passage: I Cor 13) when I stumbled across this book, and it fit in perfectly. I took it in and gave my whole lesson from it!

The recording of \\"The Letter\\" is a more upbeat, different version than the usual Joe Cocker one. Burton Cummings on \\"Stand Tall\\" is also excellent. There are several very commercial songs, such as \\"Ring\\", \\"Playground of my Mind\\", and \\"Brandy\\".

If you load your music as a folder you can then choose to play your music as per each album. The battery life seems good. I really like being able to use AAA batteries in it; I never have to worry about running out of power. As others have commented, it is no USB 2.0 interface. If you need to reload your music often, this is not the player for you. It took around an hour to load 2 GB's. I think the sound quality is good.

I loved this thing and when the jog wheel/switch finally gave out, I ordered its successor, the MuVo V100 2GB player. What a difference - they've cheapened the quality of the plastic so that the whole device flexes. I don't care to see light through the gaps in an electric device. I couldn't believe that this unit would last as long as the previous device, so I immediately returned it and ordered another MuVo TX FM. I'm not sure how much longer this older unit will be around, so I may have to order a second as a spare.

The songs transport you to earlier, more francophone times: most go back to the early 20th century, but one even harks back to Napoleonic days. Perhaps the line that best sums up the atmosphere of the album is: \\"Chauffer un gregue de caf��, gouter et causer en franais\\" (\\"Warm up a pot of coffee, sip it and chat in French\\", according to the liner notes). \\"L'��cho\\" is a great collection of mellow tunes, and sound testimony, if you spare the pun, of the Cajuns' determination to maintain their French Creole culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable AIP teen drama","review":"While most of AIPs teen-oriented flicks of the late 50s focused on juvenile delinquents or monsters (and usually a combination of both) DIARY OF A HIGH SCHOOL BRIDE is much more along the lines of a teenage soap opera. 17 year old Judy elopes with 24 year old Steve and they must do battle not only with Judy's disapproving parents but with Judy's psychotic former boyfriend. The film contains enough action that the melodramatics don't get the film too bogged down and amidst the wild hystrionics there is an odd plug for another of AIPs 1950S releases, THE SCREAMING SKULL. And, aside from the fact that the young leads (Anita Sands and Ron Foster) look old enough to be the parents of teenagers themselves, the cast puts forth a good effort with the script that they have to work with! Look for former one-time Lone Ranger, John Hart, in a small role as a policeman.

Either squatters had taken up residence on the site, or I got the old \\"this page is no longer available\\" message. And it's not like I forgot to type the .au or anything, the info was just bogus. I am giving it two stars because I'm sure I will get other good info out of the book. I even kind of expect travel books to have some outdated info, but for a book that was released in 2010 to have the first four websites I try to go to be totally inaccurate is unforgiveable in my mind.

And, as a bonus, you'll be able to forget Japanese in no time too. The faster you learn something, the faster you forget it. Oh, and if you lose the 1st lesson CD, just buy a level one box, as the level of learning is well paced.What is the secret? Probably about two hours a day, for each CD, and about 3 weeks per CD. In other words, drill it into your head until you are dreaming dreams about dreaming in japanese.Oh, and lest you think other wise... this is about 'speaking' japanese, not general reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your money","review":"I bought this and returned it by the time I got to the 3td CD It was nothing but talk. The first CD was just the author yapping about himself and saying stuff like if you don't get it right away don't worry and I took half a dozen other languages etc. The 2nd CD didn't work and the third one was still talking about nothing that had to do with actually learning Japanese. Translation or otherwise. The box says \\"The Complete Language Course\\" but the CDs say something like \\"The Secret to Learning a Foreign Language\\" I was so ticked off I didn't even bother to listen to the rest and realized it was a total waist of my money.

That was my primary reason for purchasing this book. While MAO INHIBITORS were vaguely mentioned throughout the book, it was not given its own entry. Secondly, the title of the book is a little misleading. One is led to believe that the entire scope of the book would deal with ADVERSE REACTIONS, INCIDENCE REPORTING, easily categorized REFERENCE CHARTS which lists all the WORST & BEST PILLS, etc. None of this was to be found. Instead, this was nothing more than a regular drug reference book with a few pages dedicated to generalized discussions on adverse reactions and preventions. I find it highly ironic that a book which is titled \\"WORST PILLS, BEST PILLS\\" would choose to omit NARDIL of all pills. The same NARDIL that is infamous for its life-threatening adverse reactions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading information","review":"As a pharmacist I have found that books like these can be very misleading.

I had to try it to believe it. I'm a believer! A few layers of briquettes are needed in order to get it hot enough to sear meats. I found that if the briquettes are placed on a flat surface, the lower ones get starved for oxygen and extinguish. But if a way is devised to raise the lid support and charcoal on a (Weber, or other) grill up at least an inch, all the charcoal will continue to burn and the griddle/lid will reach the requisite high temp. I use a woodstove chimney/top thermometer as a temperature gauge. I've purchased a second lid support so as to be able to double my pancake output. (I have 10\\" and 12\\" Dutch ovens.) I assume the lid support used as such would work equally as well as a 'side burner' for all manner of cast iron griddles, pans, or pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea, poor execution","review":"If you're going to dutch oven cook, one must consider the lost heat from the lid.

Leaving you with no means to capture said lost heat with your cast iron skillet. And raw eggs and raw bacon.A cheap fix is a #10 machine screw, a washer and two nuts, but you shouldn't have to.

Sadly, many opportunities were missed in the making of this movie. To whit, the character, Woman escapee in thong, was never fully developed and her bosom heaving was labored at best. Further, it would have been nice if the didn't make Estrada wear his old CHiP's uniform- he just wasn't in the same shape he was in when he was called one of the sexiest men alive.

When he expresses his discomfort with his baby-sitter, his parents find him a new one.This could have been a pretty good children's book, but I was put off by one aspect of it. Max has a seemingly irrational fear of his first baby-sitter's cat. His new baby-sitter has a puppy and pets of four other species, but no cats.

The music (can I even call it that?)soundtrack for this movie is simply earsplittingly loud and obnoxious.

Great voice acting though! The story was a crime drama with 4 of the classic characters being interrogated about a recipe thief by a frog inspector. Animation was stiff, the characters were ugly, textures were very ugly and pretty basic. Without spoiling it, they do take the characters and twist them like the Woodsman isn't really a Woodsman, the Wolf is a misunderstood good guy and the granny is acting like a teenager. There's a joke a second. Its kind of like Family guy where they just come up with random stuff and throw it at a wall to see what sticks. There are a lot of chuckles.

Nevertheless, it did pretty good at the box office, good enough to make a sequel. It used to be, long ago, that cartoons were either Disney fluff with barely any plot, or, consisted of a series of slapsticks pratfalls, also with barely any plot. Hoodwinked takes a good story, the Little Red Riding Hood story and tells it from the different views of the wolf, the axman, Red, and Granny, each with a secret. The cartoon has its facial distortions and occasional slapstick to appeal to the kids, but there are also a lot of humor directed towards adults (e.g., the wolf complains about being automatically blamed, \\"Talk about profiling\\"). It has some nice songs, great voices and a twist in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for little kids, but that is about it.","review":"Movie is cheap, not anywhere near the quality of say Toy Story, or something like that. Best part of the movie is the squirrel, the rest is just, well, dumb. The music is way louder than the voice, and they play chunks of annoying music every 8 minutes it seems. Probably ok for kids with short attention spans, but I can't see most adults liking this much. Really don't get what the people see in this movie who gave it high reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but still fun","review":"I liked this twist on the classic Red Ridding Hood story. It was not too \\"right now\\" like Shrek. I have two pre-teen boys that have enjoyed watching the movie several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A low budget gem of an animated movie","review":"Hoodwinked is a refreshing, outside-the-box take on various fairy tales. That is filled with great absurdist humor. Yeah, the animation is quite low budget. But, the top notch writing and voice acting more than make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoodwinked is Hilarious - for kids & Adults","review":"This is one of those wonderful animated movies that is a joy to watch with your kids again & again. Each time I see the movie, there's something else funny that I see that I missed before.It's also not your normal variation on an old children's classic tale - you get the tale through the eyes of many of the participants before you find out what's really going on in the end.A good reminder to leave your stereo-types at the door and listen the the facts before you make your decision. It's not always the big bad wolf that's in the wrong, sometimes it's the cute & innocent bunny that's the real bad boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent First Attempt","review":"The theater was packed with adults and children waiting for a Shrek-like fairy tale adventure. Early in the show it becomes obvious that this is a first attempt by a new company. The animation is only so-so. For instance, when the wolf is in the river, there is overlapping animation between his legs and the water. Their animation software (or their skills) needs improvement. The story had promise, but was supplemented by musical numbers that were a little strange and too long. They really had to stretch to get the movie to feature length. The characters were OK but all seemed to have an attitude problem. No one was happy with their fairy-tale life. The best character, and the only one that got adult laughs in our theater, was the squirrel, who was kind of a cross between Chip & Dale and Scrat (Ice Age). The kids all laughed in a few places, but the adults didn't seem to find it more than mildly amusing in spots. This is not a movie I'd pay to see twice. Wait and rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Spin...","review":"We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but could there have possibly been something more? The answer couldn't have been more inovative and flat out hillarious than 'Hoodwinked'. This fairy tale is turned into a classic 'Who Done It?' mystery as the police of the enchanted woods try to find out who is swiping sweets recepies. Red, The Wolf, the Woodsman and yes even Granny are all suspectes caught up in it.What amazed me about this movie was it was a very short story entirly, but it was told in 4 different ways. Each 'suspect' was doing a completly different thing and all four came together in the end. Each story was origional and funny and that's what made me enjoy it so much. The characters were voiced to perfection and the songs would put a smile on anyones face.This movie really came out of nowhere and even became the top grosser in it's opening week. If you are up for a fun time at the movies 'Hoodwinked' will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly funny and refreshingly clever","review":"not the usual tired fare that unfortunately makes up most children's movies (even disney these days)this is a super clever rewrite of little red riding hood with all sorts of zany characters and twists on the original. it's funny, fast-paced and amazingly no violence, sex or profanity. Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING movie! I fell off my chair laughing!","review":"I watched this movie with my family (kids aged 9 & 12). We all LOVED it! A very funny fractured fairy tale with unique and quirky characters. I rarely watch kids' movies twice, but I had to watch this one again AND it's only been two days ago that I first saw it.I don't understand all the negative reviews as the movie moves along quickly, has fun, upbeat songs, and a lot of adult humor. What could be better in a kids movie than to have the parents AND the kids entertained. This is tops on my list, and one we'll definitely buy. Of course, I'll be buying the soundtrack, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie in years!","review":"We saw this in the theater (twice) and walked away thinking that this was the funniest, cleanest, sweetest movie - we being myself and two 6 year olds. I couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD!A lot of reviewers are commenting on how terrible the animation is, but to those people I say, \\"It's what's on the inside that counts\\". and Hoodwinked is filled with superb personality. And I, for one, enjoyed the more-cartoon-like, less-realistic animation. It really fit with the story.We bought the DVD the day it came out and have watched it countless times, since. Each time it's just as funny and clever and heartwarming as the first. I even \\"rock out\\" to the fantastic soundtrack on my way to and from work each day.If I could talk to the writers and producers, I'd simply thank them for making this film and ask when the sequel will be out (and it WILL be out, it's already confirmed!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, especially for an independent filmmaker","review":"Yes, they didn't have the production budget to drop a few million dollars for state-of-the-art animation, but it works very well. To be honest, for an older tale like Red Riding Hood, I think I prefer more the more retro animation style.The story takes a little bit of time to get rolling, but by the middle of it my wife and I were both rolling with laughter. It's packed with jokes and culture references aimed at all ages. Young children will find it funny (and very clean - much more so than Shrek) just by its nature. An older audience will appreciate the nods to a variety of movies (including James Bond, XXX, City Slickers, and others).I probably only purchase a couple DVDs per year (1-2), and this one made it to the top of my list for this year. My wife and I are both in our early twenties, and we saw this movie in the theater with another couple (late 30s) and their daughter (8). All of us absolutely loved the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny movie!","review":"HoodWinked is about someone stealing all the goodies and the suspects are,little red rideing hood,the wolf,granny,woodsman.If you love fairy tales and action you should go see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Movie","review":"Hoodwinked is very well done and clever. The animation is very good and the writing and voice acting is top notch. Don't miss it. Even if you're an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a good movie. I used it in my classroom with my fractured fairy tales unit. My 5th and 6th graders loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY FRACTURED FAIRY TALE","review":"HOODWINKED is one of the most inventive and entertaining animated movies in years! The variation on the Little Red Riding Hood story is given sparkle and pizzazz with wonderful voice characterizations. I laughed out loud several times during this marvelous film. As the movie opens, Red is accosted by the big bad wolf who is doing a poor impersonation of Granny. Granny bursts out of the closet and a Paul Bunyan-like woodsman comes crashing through the window. When the police arrive, they think one of these is the Bandit, someone who is stealing all the recipes from the woods denizens. When a smooth detective questions them, each of the four tell their version of what happened.These tales are brilliantly conceived and the Bandit's identity is a hoot. Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Anne Hathaway, Patrick Warburton and Andy Dick are wonderful in their voice roles and the whole movie is just delightful! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine movie I almost didn't see...","review":"as I had heard so little about it. Clever and densely constructed (and reconstructed) \\"fractured fairytale\\"with an ensemble cast. Patrick Warburton steals the showas the street smart yet flaky Wolf, but Twitchy and the otheranimals add their bit. The humor is fast and furious (and usually, although not always, on the mark) as it pokes quirky fun at all things (animated or not). Quick little flick that'sclassy in its unassuming way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great at all.","review":"I did not like this movie. The animation was pretty bad, it looked like something from a video game. I remember a few times when the characters never moved except for their mouths. And a lot of the characters looked like plastic action figures. The trees looked like paper. There were a few funny parts, most of them came from the hyper squirrel...And the songs were really odd. But it was still kind of funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Disappointed.","review":"The idea of this movie had me making popcorn and sitting down with the whole family, ready to laugh! The cover even compares it to Shrek - which was a hit with the whole family!Sitting down, popcorn bowls in hand, and within 10 minutes we were ALL dumbfounded. This was NOTHING like Shrek, other than it is a twisted fairytale. My 8 and 6 year old daughters both went to play with friends. My husband and I struggled thru it, waiting for the funny part to start. It never did.I was distracted by anything and everything thru the whole movie - I even did 2 loads of laundry!Disappointed - all of us. Not worth your money. Rent it first - if it tickles your funny bone, you're WAY under weight!-1smileycat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek Wannabe","review":"Yes, Hoodwinked has an interesting premise and a half-interesting plot, but it fails in the execution. A comment on the cover reads, \\"The Funniest Animated Movie Since Shrek.\\" If Shrek flew, Hoodwinked just rolled along. It's like the Hoodwinked producers started out to build a funky, fun airplane and ended up with a go-cart. Both have a body, seats, controls, wheels, an engine, etc., however, an airplane has capabilities built in that the go-cart will never have. Starting with a wonderfully twisted concept, Hoodwinked is not that well written, has yesteryear's CG animation style plus music that sometimes carries a tune but rarely the heart. If you like movies at a go-cart level, be my guest. Go-carts can be fun, but they don't soar. Adjust your expectations accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ED in Sunnyvale","review":"Pretty disappointing. Not even the \\"clever\\" Cliches were enough to redeem it. Hubby fell asleep and I went and washed dishes, which was more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I was SO disappointed with this CD. I wanted to hear the great songs from Molly Brown - not the orchestrations! If you like listening to soundtrack album - soundtrack being the key word here - then you'll probably be okay with this version. If you want to hear LYRICS, don't get this one. I guess the lesson here is if you want lyrics, stick with the 'Original Broadway Cast' albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly junk","review":"Silly badly written new age junk.

You can have a very pleasant time listening to them. In this Volume of the setChristopher Hogwood and the DNR give warm heartfelt performances of the symphonies numbers 4 & 7 along with a concert overture.All of the pieces reveal a warm Romantic sound and a NorthernFlavor. Gade was a Dutch composer who was much admired byMendelssohn. I for one am glad that Chandos and Christopher Hogwood and the DNR have decided to bring the Symphonies of N.W. Gade to a wider audience. There are Four volumes in the symphony series Volume One features the symphonies nos. 2&8, Volume 3 features Symphonies 3&6 and Volume 4 which will be released soon features Symphonies 1&5.

No, I have yet to develop any sort of foot fetish but i recall the heightened awareness of never looking at another person's feet quite the same way again. In fact, i would have to say it instilled in me a deeper appreciation and adimiration for the human foot and the process of buying a new pair of shoes has never been quite the same. Afterall, what does your shoes say about you?Not for the faint of heart, Geoff Nicholson promises to drive you deep into the world of fetishism.

It's more about shoes than feet and maybe I was hoping for too much because this isn't erotic at all.

All the headbands I have owned have been worthless, not these, they are so comfortable, you forget that they are even there.

Most headbands give me a horrible pain behind my ears within minutes; these stay pain-free for many hours (though not the whole day). They have small combs at the ends to help hold them in the hair: this would probably be helpful for women with thick hair. I have fine hair and am growing out a pixie cut, so the combs aren't as helpful. The zigzag style is a nice change from regular headbands.

It's such a great game because it's all different, but with that same feel that the original one gave you. I love the fact that tradeskills are pushed along a little more at younger lvls, and not so open ended. The graphics have gotten a complete overhaul and I think it looks great. Whenever you start a new game, it seems like your always kinda lost trying to find what to do next, but this game does a great job of guiding you right fromt he beginning and slowly letting up to allow you to do as you wish. If you have never tried Everquest, I would definitely recommend EQ 2, as it is a wonderful game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best addition so far","review":"This has to be the best addition to EQ2 that they have made, the content in this is an entire game of its own!

I think Ms. Leo did a fabulous job of offering us the insights, resources, and information we need to become more effective parents.

I would strongly recommend this book to all parents and will be referring it to friends who do family therapy to use with their clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stellar recording at all.","review":"I got excited when I saw this cd and bought it. I thought, if it has Robert King it must be good. The playing is virtuosic but somehow lackluster. It doesn't have the elegance of old-fashioned recordings, nor the rich authentic sound of today's recordings. The accompaniment is somehow completely blurred and all I really can follow distinctly is the solo line. While technically precise, the solo playing is not very creative. Sometimes the true sound of the authentic instruments shines, as in the concerto \\"La Notte,\\" but for the most they just sound fuzzy and distant."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF WILLIE'S BEST","review":"I owned this album on cassette.

Resnick is obviously a very strong woman to bite her lip and tell the heartbreaking stories behind her best friend Nicole's marriage/death, as well as the justice sytem's betrayal of American trust with it's handling of OJ. She not only describes it all in great specific detail, but shows the emotion' and feelings she had toward it all, making us feel as if we were right there with her through all of it; that is where the strength of 'Shattered' (and of 'Shattered's' ability to so well expose the untruths and injustices of the whole Nicole/OJ mess) truly lies. I do wish one thing, though-that she could have written more about Ron Goldman and his involvement in all of it because I never have been able to find out much about him.

The lead actress also shines here , the supporting csst isn't half bad either. The problem is the vague script and low budget. This was made in the phillipines , that country at the time had it's own film industry and produced some wild movies like 'octoman' and some decent war movies too. These were all low budget affairs but they have some charm, this one has a unclear plot in that the satanists reincarnatied witches don't remember who they are. This just spoils the premise to a degree but it's at least in english and the print looks pretty good on dvd. It's horror exploitation (it has some nudity fmeale of course and scenes of half naked women getting whipped too) but that doesn't save this one in the end. However I love horror flicks and have seen alot worse. the idea of the painting possessing people was a good one too but it's the blanking out part of this that spoils it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most horrific thing about the movie is the painting.","review":"OK. I'm a sucker for old style horror. You know the type, has a plot, suspense, shock some gore, happy endings (sometimes)?Well this isn't one of them.A very pleasant to look at Tom Selleck complete with a Robin Masters type sports car but set in the Phillipines not Hawaii is the central part of the movie and that is about it.A devilish story, with demonic acting and about lousy paintings which carry the spirits of long dead witches seeking revenge is essentially the plot but it is just a mess really with cheesy special effects and bad acting and the worst thing was I watched it right the way through until the end on late night tv when I could have been sleeping through it instead.Next time, I will record movies like this and be ruthless about getting rid of them when they appear to be as bad as this.Hubble bubble toil and too much trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU GOT TO BE Kidding!!!","review":"A 30 year old 2 star movie with no sdh or subtitles for 20 dollars!!

Although this film seems like a piece of life, the writers try to connect these stories and don't seem to be very successful. Whereas in a movie like Crash, all of the characters affect one another, even when it seems like they are just brushing by each other. The story in this film seems a little too loosely connected. I'll stop complaining there, because that was my only beef with this film. The scenes are wonderfully done with superb acting, especially, again, by Robin Wright Penn and I like the closing scene with Glenn Close and Dakota Fanning. This film is intriguing and insightful, but still left me wondering what exactly women think. Very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"The movie wasn't what I expected, It just dragged and there wasn't a whole lot of important things, well to me anyway.

Whatever happened to them?","review":"I discovered these guys back in 1992 in my sister's junk pile of tapes, among other unknown artists, back when she worked for a music/video distribution company. 'Me & Elvis' is the first track, which caught my attention right off the bat. In following with the whole 'Elvis-faked-his-death' thing, this song talks of how they hung out together up to the time when Elvis supposedly fakes his death. 'Hole In My Head' is a nice song about how typically childish men can be in relationships. But my favorite song is 'These Are The Days' with it's upbeat, if rather cynical, view of life. All in all, it's worth owning because these guys are great musicians who, as you'll find out if you listen to the CD, have diverse musical influences. By the way, I found the CD version years later at a flea market and bought it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only we could have had more from this band!","review":"Most of the high points have already been covered. However, I was very surprised no one mentioned the track \\"My First Million\\". While I love \\"Me & Elvis\\" and others, \\"My First Million\\" is, and will always be, my favorite track. I first heard this album back in 1990 or 1991 when a friend's big brother brought it home with him from college. I was blown away. We lost his copy a couple of years later and were devastated. Then in about '98 I was browsing my local used cd store and found TWO copies traded in! One copy was stolen with my cd wallet (I hope the crook enjoyed that cd), but I still have the other. As I write this I'm ripping and encoding it to 320 br mp3 so it can be safely archived for many more years of listening pleasure.As far as I know this was the only album they ever released. It's such a shame that it didn't catch on commercially. I can only imagine what they could have turned out as they progressed as a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Albums I'd want if I were shipwrecked","review":"One of the great tragedies in music is that this band disappeared after this one eponymous album. Ross Rice (who penned most of the songs, I believe) might be one of the best composers you probably never heard of. If only they'd released \\"These Are the Days\\" first, maybe . . . The lyrics are great, the arrangements were like nothing else I had ever heard at the time it came out, and still sound fresh. Oddly enough \\"Me and Elvis\\" isn't my favorite cut. And believe it or not, I bought it because I liked the cover design.I just recently found out about \\"Umpteen\\" and \\"Dwight,\\" both of which I now have on order.This album is on my list of CDs to have if I were ever shipwrecked.

Impeccable. Ross Rice, Steve Eby, Peter Hyrka, Steve Arnold and Kye Kennedy have rare talent and this is a case where studying music at college (Berkley, in at least one case) just put the icing on the cake.

And as goober as this sounds, seeing them do a song called \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" ('they started up another war/i guess the generals got bored/while you sleeee-ping) at the Overton Park Shell is one of my most cherished musical memories ... a warm summer evening, a four-beer buzz, my six best friends and this group.Yeah, they had me & elvis, as a hit.

This stand is an absolute dream for the Pro but not quite right for the Air. With the Air you cannot open the laptop without tilting it first on the case (the notch in front is not deep enough), and the Air seems not perfectly stable because it is so back-heavy (for as much as you can call the Air \\"heavy\\").

I thought about getting this stand, but decided instead to opt for the 20 inch apple cinema display. Well, the cinema display and my laptop didn't really like each other that much--the hassle of plugging into (and unplugging when I wanted to go mobile 3 connectors combined with dealing with different screen resolutions (with the cinema display losing that comparison) convinced me to return it before 5 days had passed. I turned around and purchased this mstand to bring my laptop to the proper ergonomic level, and plugged my keyboard into it. Wow. The experience is so much better than the display. If you have a laptop that you sometimes want to use in an office environment and other times want to take with you on the plane or to a meeting, this seems a great solution.

Found that this makes a dramatic difference for my posture and my back and neck feel 100% better than working straight off of a laptop. The stand looks really elegant and has a port to feed cables through and help with cable management, but realistically, it disappears right under the laptop. The only people that would see if are those sitting across from you. The front lip is nicely designed so that any laptop will fit and be held firmly without needing any sort of adjustment.Price is the only thing that keeps me from rating this at 5 stars. A $20 DJ laptop stand would likely do the same job, but this definitely adds an air of professionalism and elegance if you're in an office/retail setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice laptop stand, wish it was collapsible","review":"I received one of these as a gift to use at work with a MacBook Pro and bought a second one for use at home.

Sitting my Macbook Pro on my desk and trying to spend 6 hours straight typing a paper on it was uncomfortable for my writsts, back, and neck. Also, the plethora of cables from my headphone amplifier, ipod touch, cell-phone, charger, ethernet and hard-drive could make for quite the cluttered mess.This stand solves problems associated with lack of comfort and messiness. Coupled with an apple keyboard and a microsoft bluetooth mouse, my desktop is now aethetically pleasing and much more comfortable.This stand allows you to elevate your computer to a comfortable viewing height while also managing the cables and maintaining the sleek aluminum look of my Macbook pro.I highly recommend this stand for people who want to make their laptop more suitable for desk use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Siltopper","review":"Love it!

The stand is beautiful, sturdy and does a good job of holding your laptop. Great. It contains a cable routing hole in the rear to keep cables neat. Smart. That said, this product suffers from a single major design flaw that just can't be overlooked: The cable routing hole is too small to accommodate the DVI plug from an apple Cinema display, despite the fact that the stand is shown *right next to* an apple cinema display in the product's retail packaging.FAIL.Fail. Fail. Fail.Did rain design not try to plug this into a single laptop accompanied by a Cinema Display before taking the design to the manufacturing step? Incredible. Sure, you can bypass the hole for the cinema display plug, but then what's the point in having the cable routing in the first place???"},{"rating":"1","title":"mStand Laptop Stand","review":"It is too big and bulky.

Unfortunately in my case, though, the amount of elevation was too great as I had intended to have the laptop screen elevated so that it was next to my Apple Cinema HD display. Owing to how Apple placed the jacks on the 17\\" MacBook Pro, though, it was impossible to put the laptop monitor flush against the side of the Apple Cinema HD display; no matter what the choice was to have either the laptop power cord in front of the larger display or the video out, USB 2 and Firewire 400 cables (all are required to run the Apple Cinema HD) in front of the screen. If you are looking to get the stand for the same reason that I was you will need to find something that raises the back of the laptop 3\\" or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, but you pay a premium for the sleek design","review":"As far as a laptop stand goes, this is a great product.

Lowered my idle temperatures about 6 degrees over the Logitech Alto Express stand. Boy did my MBP get warm sitting on that puppy, plus you couldn't eject discs while using it.

I'm pretty picky, but the Mstand exceeded my expectations. Not only does it look as if it was designed exclusively for the Macbook Pro, it is very functional as well. Accessing the DVD drive slot and release latch are no problem. My biggest fear was that the angle of the stand was such that even with the screen fully opened, it would be less than vertical, but this is not a problem. Trust me, I looked at more than a dozen different stands before settling on the Mstand, and I am absolutely satisfied.

It was perfect...the design is sharp, it color matches my MBP perfectly. Here we are 11 days later on Sunday, October 3rd, and the pads that keep the laptop in place have decided they need a break. In other words, the pads aren't doing their job. This morning when I had turned away from my computer, it fell off the stand onto the floor, which of course negates the entire purpose of this stand. This stand is supposed to tilt the backside up so you're able to use your laptop as a monitor. After purchasing a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse through Amazon.com, I was good to go! I've e-mailed Rain Design support hoping this might be a one time fluke only with this stand, because the other reviews for this product have been outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice quality.

As much as I didn't want to spend more $$$ on a keyboard, I think it's a small price to pay and would gladly sacrifice a $70 (Apple) keyboard over the MBP itself.The mStand I bought has the cut-out at the front which makes opening the display very easy (read: you don't have to lift the system.)

My laptop does stick out about a couple of inches on each side because of its width, but this has no effect on balance or stability. Because of the stand, the laptop sits higher which improves my sitting posture. I don't have to slouch to read my emails.

I work with my Macbook Pro and extra monitors sometimes for 12 to 14 hours nonstop. Before I had this product the Macbook would heat up underneath it where it was sitting on the desk; the fans would kick on a lot when using Photoshop, browsers, localhost, iTunes and other apps. Now that the laptop sits on the mStand it stays cool and if the fans come on it is only briefly.Not only does it keep the Macbook cooler it also gives you a great place to set your laptop and see the screen when using other monitors. The design is very nice and sturdy and the is a hole in the back for cable management. You could even shut your laptop and use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse with another larger monitor and use your laptop as a desktop while keeping it running cool.Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality design, but you pay for it, and it's not adjustable.","review":"As others have said, this is a solid piece of aluminum that looks like it was made and designed by Apple.

It's extremely well designed and is perfect for my Macbook Pro 15\\".The only thing I don't like about it is the height is not adjustable. Some people might want to raise or lower it slightly.The other thing I don't like is the price. Seems like a lot of dough, and they collect California sales tax on this purchase for some reason.

Sturdy construction, good height for pairing next to a monitor for a dual screen setup. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the rubber pads that the computer rests on fell off and I ended up losing the pad. I was able to order replacements directly from the company for a few dollars, but the glue that came on the pads was not strong enough to hold the new one on. Ultimately, I used some strong glue (gorilla glue maybe) and held it on with a clamp over night to dry.

(Next to my Cinema Display, the stand height causes my laptop connections to protrude above the bottom bezel frame of my display. 1\\" shorter would've made them at the bezel height or slightly below.

There are also numerous mistakes and errors in the typing. Most errors are found in the end of chapter problems.

On top of all of this, the amount of force necessary to make the keys register keypresses aggrivated my RST, which was the final straw. I've returned my Virtually Indestructible USB Keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea- poor implementation","review":"This is a nice keyboard for any area where spills occur frequently, but the layout and design of the keys make it unsuitable for regular use. The 'wake', 'sleep' and 'power' keys are just above the numeric keypad and just to the right of the pause key. I keep trying to pause my favorite game and keep winding up in the hell that is sleep/wake mode. The keys require an inordinate amount of force to use. The backspace and delete keys are actually smaller than the alphabetical keys, making them much harder to find when you make a mistake.This is the perfect keybord for any unusually strong, thin-fingered flawless typists or for anyone who really has to type while in the bath tub. For the rest of us, this is more of a novelty item."},{"rating":"1","title":"virtually useless","review":"I bought this several months ago to use with my slate tablet when I wanted to/had to use a keyboard. For awhile it generally worked, although the keys are very gummy and you need to press them very firmly when typing. But that's OK. What's not OK is that after very light use, the keys for all numbers other than 5 and 6 have stopped responding, along with all of the corresponding shift-keys--parenthesis, the \\"at\\" sign for e-mail, etc.--I can't type them because I'm using this piece of junk now. You can't appreciate how irritating it is to work without number and the other keys until you are forced to do it. Stay away from this virtually useless product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Virtually Indestructible\\" at all.","review":"Picked this keyboard up so I could roll it up and throw it in my backpack when doing field work on POSes. It worked for about 4 months, then I noticed when I press certain keys, it would add extra characters from nearby keys. Now the problem spread through most of the keys, and it's unusable. Definitley no \\"Virtually Indestructible.\\" Looking for a better alternitive now."},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative hackwork","review":"Yeah, they sound like Radiohead, Coldplay, etc. etc.Problem is: They forgot to write songs even approaching the quality of their influences. Everything here sounds fake and derivative. Endochine strain for soul and bombast, but they fail miserably. Hollow, redundant garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic","review":"I didn't think this book was worth the read. It is very basic and anyone that puts time into the game would already know most of what is detailed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clark's Ritzy Sandal","review":"This sandal is very comfortable - no \\"breaking in\\" period needed! It runs true to size and gives moderate arch support. I have a closet full of Clark shoes and this is one of my new favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polaroid makes bad products!","review":"This monitor/ tv was terrible. One thing broke after the other. The remote went bad, the picture got fuzzy and then went white and the channels didn't change reliably. What? I had many problems, it was terrible. Read the reviews on these guys, you'll see its a chronic issue with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfied... avoid this product.","review":"Bought the unit in September, 2006. First unit had no UHF and returned it for exchange; second unit would not turn on and returned it for exchange; third unit worked mostly until January 9, 2007... all we get is a purple screen.Written warranty of 1 year parts and labor so far is useless after 1 week of waiting after the first call... they are still trying to locate a carry-in service center for our area of Indiana.Although the picture quality was good, the sound is quite poor... someone else mentioned this in another review.The other failing is when we playback recorded VCR tapes to this monitor, the picture blacks out regularly... probably due to the monitor not showing a signal if there is *any* hiccup in the signal from the VCR... we know it is the problem with this TV because the same VCR player plays fine on another TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted.","review":"Nice TV while it worked. Unfortunately, if you have one, yours will likely quit in the same way mine did after 2.5 years: You'll lose picture, but still have sound. My local repairman told me that, even if he could get the parts (they are simply unavailable from any supplier), the cost would be greater than the cost of a new name-brand TV. (He based that statement on his knowledge of the prices of similar parts for other brands he services.) Also, based on troubleshooting info I found online, I took it apart to see if there might be any bad capacitors, but they all looked good (that is, not bulging or leaking like electrolytics do when they fail). I treated my TV really well, never overheated it, and always powered it through a surge suppressor, and it still died. Serves me right for picking a TV based on its picture quality. Remember kids: Cheap products are made of cheap parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minor problem after problem","review":"Ok so i've had the tv for a little over 2 years. I haven't had many of the large failing issues others seem to have but that doesn't mean it has been smooth sailing. First off the tv has this rolling distortion line that messes with dvds and my xbox. Also during dvd playback the black level fluctuates and is inconsistent. Lastly, and most annoyingly, my tv will not auto search any channels,it can find the channel if you manually input it into the remote but forget channel surfing. Save yourself and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this item at all cost.","review":"I have had my TV for 7 months. I have sound, such that it is, but no picture, just a white screen. After mine went out, I started checking on the internet and found 3 out of 5 had the same problem anywhere from 1 month to 13 months.....I called Polaroid and they said to return my TV. I am just waiting to see if I ever get a replacement TV. I am not very confident, went and bought a Sony today.Don"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted!","review":"We used this primarily as a computer monitor for our laptop, while docked--so it wasn't used all that much. It died about 2 years after use. Same thing happened with our 40\\" TV. The blue light shines, but there is no picture. So sad. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"A clear, concise and totally successful way to learn the essential backbone of rock 'n' roll; namely rhythm guitar. This is the part of the song you dance to - without it, there is no it! The author should have a plaque in the Rock Hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"chai","review":"Awesome seller; fast delivery; item as promised. It came just in time. I was going through chai withdrawal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comanche","review":"This film is a good idea that doesn't quite come off. That idea is to humanize the famous Comanche leader Quanah Parker; however, Kent Smith, a good actor, does not really seem to fit the role. The film does have good action sequences, and also introduces the lovely Linda Cristal in her first starring role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, solid \\"oater\\"","review":"Thanks to Amazon.com for making this video available. COMANCHE is a solid, goodish 1950s Western, with good action, good acting, and colorful cinematography. No, it's not SHANE or THE SEARCHERS, but it is entertaining and worth an occasional viewing. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great RPG AD&D adventure!","review":"Doug Niles, one of the original members of the Dragonlance team, has written an adventure dealing with the Chaos war. I enjoyed just reading this adventure.

It was quite funny and deeply poignant. Julie Harris was luminous. Hers was a powerful performance that was never over-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily Dickinson Revealed","review":"Julie Harris' solo act in this unique monologue was highly insightful. It penetrates with delightful overtones into the solitary life of the poet, Emily Dickinson. I couldn't turn if off.Albert Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatre magic","review":"I saw this years ago, and just recently rediscovered it. I remember watching Julie Harris and wondering who is this woman? I ran right out and rented \\"A Member of the Wedding,\\" \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"I Am a Camera.\\" However, it is \\"The Belle of Amherst\\" which remains dearest to my heart. Such a loving portrait. A bravura performance which earned the actress her fifth Tony Award for Best Actress, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording. This is a must for poetry lovers and theatre lovers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie's marvelous!","review":"I have to say that England has Dame Judi Dench and America has Julie Harris. Two actresses that should work together. Only in this DVD, Julie brings to life of Emily Dickinson, American Poet and Literary Genius to life. You can tell that Julie has transformed herself into bring Emily's legacy, vision, and works to life as only a master actress can do without the praise. Julie Harris is one of America's finest living actresses of the stage, film, and television. This performance does justice to the actual legacy of Emily Dickinson. We know that she researched the role thoroughly connecting with her memory. The stage version is kind of rough because of the audience but the quality holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read and enjoyed other books in this series. But the last one I read was for 5 year-olds. Since then, parenting has been a joy. But as my son approaches his 10th birthday, his behavior lately has been baffling. A dizzying array of being un-reasonable, clinging, forgetful, competent, independent and non-responsive. I ordered this book for help. It gave me one or two clues, but it seemed like it was written while the author was waiting for a bus. The book was very shallow, much too brief, with frustratingly incomplete case studies. I read the whole book in about 20 minutes. I felt ripped off. There has to be something better out there about understanding 9-11 year-olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"And they say, \\"I love that watch, where did you get it?\\"","review":"I think this watch is great! I'll be blunt, and the one and only downfall I've found with it is the wristband finish wears off too easily. The inside that wears against your wrist came off and turned my wrist green (A copper band! I couldn't believe it!). The outside of it still looks great, except where I've rubbed it against things, over time it's rubbed off a bit. Everyone comments on it though, and I've never heard anyone say they didn't like it. They have all thought it looks classy and stylish! No surprise there though, because it is! I will wear mine until it goes completely kaput. It's light, easy to put on, and when it's on, it stays on. It's easy to tell time with it and so far I haven't had any water problems with it. I've showered with it a few times and it did well. I'd buy it again. Oh, one more thing. If at first the watch doesn't fit, the links are tougher than snot to remove -- take it to a jeweler to do it for you."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-0b0b1cd0"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/62.md","filePath":"guide/62.md"}'),W={name:"guide/62.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
