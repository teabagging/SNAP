E. Stanley Jones is a favorite author of mine. This book was obviously written by an 87 year old man within an editor. It not only has typos, misuse of words, but in many places it is reduntant. There are gems buried in this poorly written book, but most of them have already appeared in The Word Become Flesh.Having great confidence in Jones I ordered three copies knowing I would want to pass them along to my friends. Anyone want a free copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better, but not by much.","review":"It took too long to get the main characters together. Once you started to read the book you could tell right away who the lovers would be and it just too long to get the two together. Also, there wasn't enough parts where he would come to her rescue or she would come to hers. But, there was excellent discription of everything from what everyone was wearing to what the lovers felt when they looked at eachother. Jude has an excellent ability to discribe everything without overdoing it and making it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read.","review":"I have read so many romance novels and can say that this is still one of my very favorites! I have read it a couple of times over the years. I would like to echo what others have said here that this is one of her best works and absolutely worth your time and money!

You will not want to put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great catch!","review":"I got this book because I love all of Judes book and as soon as I opened the page I was enraptured with it. Axia is a girl that was never let out of her house and her only campianion was tode her friend and the other campionion her beatiful vain cousin Frances. Axia meets Jamie when he climbs over the wall to get a look at Frances whom he mistakens for the Maiden Hall hERISS. Axia lets him belive what he will and the whole story takes from there.

Usually I am more than willing to stay up all night to finish a Jude Deveraux book. (I LOVED \\"Rememberance\\"!!!) For every few pages from \\"The Heiress\\" that I was able to make myself read, I would put the book down and take a few days break. The book was hard for me to get interested in, but I forced myself to finish it because it was a Jude Deveraux book. I think the surprise ending made up for the rest of the book, but I would not recommend getting this just for that. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from the library. You'll satisfy your curiosity without feeling stupid about paying for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful book, in one word, I'd have to say cute, the sassy characters are great.

But it didn't take long at all before the inconsistancies started to grate on my nerves. How does a woman who has been sheltered and locked away for her entire life know enough about the outside world to pose and then act as a prostitute.Why does everyone in the book think the hero is loyal and a man of honor when he breaks his word to the man who hired him by becoming engaged to his daughter, while at the same time courting another and holding the keepsake of another to his heart. He is a pig.Finally the twists at the end of the book are ridiculous. I could believe that a character might change a little by the end of the book. But to go as far as the author did here made me want to throw the book against the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"I found this book a little hard to get into. Axia and Jamie were just too annoying in the first few chapters. 10 chapters in I was finally a bit interested. I found it hard to believe that Axia would sleep with Jamie at the very beginning even though she found him shallow. The last few twists at the end were a little bit too convenient. Everything just seemed to fall into place too easily. This is my second book of Jude Deveraux' and I've got a lot more on the bookshelf. Hopefully they will be a little bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moorcock's richest, most surprising work!","review":"It is England under Elizabeth as it might have been if the Gods of Chaos still lurked in the walled-up secret corridors abandoned since mad, incestuous, violent Henry VIII was o'erthrown. In a palace in whose walled-in corridors lurk madmen and shadows, the frigid Queen seeks satisfaction, and a man who regards assassination as an art form seeks fulfillment. Moorcock's most surprising, rich and intense work, far beyond Elric and Corum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, unfufilled","review":"I read this becuase my husband's a devoted Moorcock fan (they're on first name terms- isn't this internet thing amazing?) I'll diplomatically say it's just not my cup of tea - there are just too many lists of fabrics, metals, walls that makes the prose unwieldy. I did love the fact that the most powerful character was a woman - exaggerated, but still human and I can't actively dislike a book that concludes that a really good orgasm is good for queen and country. So much SF/ fantasy (especially back when this was written) seemed to be written by men who'd never actually met a real live woman, so I'm impressed by 'Mike's' fem cred."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"I enjoy historical fiction books a great deal BUT this one is sooo boring. I will be reading it and realize that I haven't been paying attention to the past 2 or 3 paragraphs because it is such a snoozer. I really hate it when authors feel the need to describe every little detail about someone's clothing after a while it really starts to take away from the story. I find myself skimming through the page just to find something interesting to read. I was really excited when I bought this book but was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive review","review":"Mr Barbieri is clearly unfamiliar with my work and also with this particular edition in which I discuss the problems I had with including the rape in the penultimate chapter. From the beginning of my career I have been writing some form of moral fable and I am also on record for my support of feminists, many of whom are close personal friends (indeed, I'm married to one). I have written a great deal about sexual and domestic abuse, with particular attention to pornography as justification for rape. It is unsophisticated at best to take one of my fables, which shows how imperial power is maintained by hypocrisy and crime, and fail to understand it for what it is. I can only assume that Mr Barbieri has been offended by the polemic of my critical study Wizardry and Wild Romance which takes issue with the moral attitudes to be discovered in the likes of Tolkien and Lewis. I have no problem with morality, but I believe I have a right to disagree with another writer's moral intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Things Are Best Left Behind...This Is One","review":"The bizarre adventures of a cardiac victim are fashioned from his seemingly endless ability to fix everything except his own relationships. None of this, including the dime-novel sex, works. Ira Foxglove will waste your time as much as he did mine. Imagine floating across the Atlantic Ocean in an airship after disentangling your runaway wife from her lover by threatening to run him down with a motor scoter you fixed. Of course, you only would do this after a hearty round of sex with your daughter's dancing partner. Ira hopes to leverage that with a tomato sex-toy whose properties seemingly could produce an external heart machine. Dream on; tune out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book For Mature Teens & UP","review":"This is an outstanding book that tells a story with a moral slant. I loved the way the author used imagery in describing the natural beauty of the coastal Maine environment. Very evocative use of these elements in telling a serious story about racism in the early 20th century North."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book was purchased for middle school language arts classes to read.

I had to read it for a bookclub and It was one of the most boring books i ever read. It took me forever to finish. It has boring, typical characters and i pretty much predicted the whole book. I think they were trying to be a good writer by repeating stupid things like \\"i almost touched a whale\\" as symbolism, (really??) but i thought it was just annoying.

In my opinion it should have been the Winner. This is a thougthful, well written book. It is full of great characters in a thought provoking story. Seeing the story of Malaga Island and the town of Phippsburg through the wise young eyes of Turner Buckminster was brilliant. Gary Schmidt is a master at telling the story of \\"adolescents turning their face toward adulthood.\\" I heard Gary say those very words last week when I heard him speak at a local community dinner. I was very moved by all he talked about. It is clear that he is a gifted storyteller on paper and in voice. Lizzie Bright tells an important story about ignorance, prejudice and growing up.

With that in mind, it's a sufficient heavy bag stand. It's too tall to go into most basements though, which is a huge downer. It is just under 8 feet tall so you have to put it in between the joists to get it to fit.As for the speed bag platform... it is a complete wreck. You can't build up any speed at all because the drum (big round wood piece) is super flimsy attached to the bar. I literally can't get more then 1 hit off because the speed just dies.If you don't care about the speed bag, then if you get a deal it's worth it.

The towel, which I also bought, fits better.The material wicks away moisture while perserving curls.I just tried it for the first time and couldn't hook the button after three or four tries. The towel dries well, but all the struggling to find the button and loop only roughed up my hair, which is exactly what a curly-haired person wants to avoid because it creates frizz.

If they don't, back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you are bald!","review":"This product is extremely hard to put on your head. You have to put in on, twist it and then button it into a small loop on the back of your head. At that point, it slips back on your head and your hair falls out. My daughter was unable to get it to work properly either. I may return it, but with the price of return shipping, it's almost not worth it. I would be embarrassed to give it as a gift. I have purchased a microfiber hair towel from this same company and it works great but I would not recommend the hair turban at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight","review":"This hair turban is nice to twist my hair in when I want to leave a towel on for awhile. It's weighs so much less than a bath towel. It also works really well for my 5 year old daughter when she wants to be like mommy and have a towel on her wet hair, too! You have to be careful stretching it back to fasten with the button. If I don't pull the right amount of slack, it can be a bit tight and it hit some migraine pressure points on me.

It does speed up the dry time a little, but the reason I love it is that I don't have some giant towel on my head (that keeps toppling off) while I'm putting on makeup, getting dressed, etc. Also, this thing is great for vacation. You know how they only give you 3 towels when you go to a hotel? AND they are usually smaller than the ones you use at home? Well, I bring my turban with me and I don't have to have my husband call the front desk for more towels. It's also great for keeping your dry hair up and out of the tub when taking a bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to use","review":"I had trouble getting this to fit on my head. It seemed small, even though I don't have a huge head. Twisting it and getting the button attached were a hassle. I'd be tempted to think it was my own lack of coordination, but I have no problems with the Twisty Towels I got at Bed Bath and Beyond. Also, the Twisty Towels were cheaper, and the fabric was just as nice.So, if you like a challenge and want to spend twice as much, then buy this product. Otherwise, try the Twisty Towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to others it is dreadful, will never buy again","review":"The fabric and size of this hair towel is the worst I have ever used. I have at least one of every hair towel on the market from over the years because my hair takes forever to dry so I need to wrap and then blowe dry after awhile of soaking the water out.The size is ridiculous - it squeezes my head so hard it gives me headache in 5 minutes or less-granted my head is sensitive but has never been sensitive to a hair wrap. It's agony to wear this. The fabric has an awful static quality to it - it sticks to everything, zaps your head or hand with static, collects everything from the dryer, lint, strings, anything it can suck off of other fabrics, it does. But the worst part is that it is rough on your hands. The inside is soft but the outside snags and catches on your hands, or a blankets/pillow case if you lay down, it's just the worst quality and most expensive hair towel I have found."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea that doesnt work","review":"This is a nice idea that doesnt work at all. I bought this to have a small,light, neat way to keep my hair out of the way while using facial masks, bubble baths etc... but the thing wont stay on your head, it rides up so your hair is exposed, it pulls uncomfortably at the front of your hairline-- it's pretty useless.Stick to using a towel and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! NOT WORTH IT!","review":"This is the worst product - I washed the turban ONCE (before I ever used it!) and the button fell off. I sewed it back on.

It'd be even better if it had a handle at each end to grab onto (in my case). The half rounded side seems to dig in deeper, and the flat side helped to smooth it out a bit before I used a scraper and sandpaper to make it smooth. I would have preferred if the set came with some finer coarse-ness rasps too. I haven't had any use for the other shapes yet, but I'm sure most people can find places where they would want the flat or round ones.I haven't had any problems with them, they're still in great shape and they seem very strong/sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"think twice before buying from this","review":"Iam really very feeling very bad for this order for the first time with amazon the brake pad i receive is not for the car i need well they are clever they write the same number on the packed but when i opened it was something , i ordered i brake pad for Toyota land cruiser 2006 for the rear and driver and they send me a green and blue packet and was not nice to see its only the color what inside is the same pads small pads i even don't know for kind of car its even not like the pads appear in the photos .....my advise is think twice before buying from this company"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent DVD for Taekwondo kicking and is applicable to any practicing martial artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"I found very little about this video to be beneficial for Taekwondo training and kicking.

Problem arises so soon as I washed them. I was shocked to see how much those bumper covers shrunk. I washed them in cold water on delicate slow setting and dried them on low heat for 40 minutes and they came out shrunk so much that I can barely screeze in the paddings. There's nothing on the care label states that the bedding needs to be cleaned other ways. It's very disappionting that this set only has a highend look but not the quality to go with the look, consider this is a $300 sheet set.

While the quality of these sets is better than the other sets you'd find at Babies r' us, it's not even close to the old Wendy Bellissimo standard and I'm hugely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier!","review":"I was a little nervous about getting this set at first. I LOVED the way it looked, but was concerned b/c it is rather pricey and I had read that it didn't wash very well. I'm glad I went with my gut and decided to get it. I washed it according to directions and had absolutly no problems at all. It looks gorgeous in my daughter's room! I'm not a pink girl, nor do I go for a lot of ruffles, so this set was perfect. I get TONS of compliments on it! The quality really is much better than a lot of stuff out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't believe I found this at babies r us","review":"I couldn't believe I found the Sir Leapsalot set at Babies R Us. My sister bought this same exact set 6 years ago from a small retailer in her area. I fell in love with it then, but when she told me how much she paid for it...let's just say I knew when I had a baby, I wasn't going to be able to afford a Wendy Bellissimo collection. Which is why I was shocked when I found the same exact Wendy Bellissimo collection at Babies R Us, for about half of what my sister paid for her collection. We compared the two sets and they are identical. Now my sister is jealous that I have the same crib collection and paid so much less. Plus, I've been able to register for all the great accessories. Thank you Wendy Bellissimo and Babies R Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"I'm a new mom that was having a hard time finding a nursery set. I love this one! It is very classy.

Its a nice collection to later make a girly room or a boy room."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's still bad","review":"I wrote a review of this item and it for some reason got deleted as well. I have noticed this happening quite a bit with bad reviews on the Wendy Bellissimo items. I realize Babies R Us wants to promote it as much as possible since they bought Wendy off the high end market to come to theirs. But this is just disrespectful.The quality is not worth $300! The colors are ugly, the material is yucky, and the stitching is falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an education tool, I give this camera five stars! Why? Because it taught my daughter a good lesson; you get what you pay for. My six-year-old received this as a birthday present from a friend. She used the camera to take one roll of film, the 12 exposure roll of film that came with the camera. When we tried to rewind the film, the tiny handle came off. My husband was able to put it back on and we were able to rewind the film, ONCE! When we tried to load the next roll of film we discovered that the film advance was not working! What a bummer. I spent $20 on a simple Olympus camera to replace the broken one. I'm a long time Olympus user. My daughter used it to take rolls and rolls of film on our recent trip to San Francisco. She is one satisfied customer. Spend a little more and get something worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work","review":"I bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas, but we never got the film to load.

What a waste of money and huge let down. Caca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of your money","review":"We bought this camera for our daughter for christmas.

The new line contains aloe, to which my wife is allergic. Unfortunately, when the package arrived, it DID contain the replacement product, rather than the one listed. If I wanted the new product, I could have bought it at Target or Walmart for slightly better prices.So if you like the new revised product, then feel free to order this.

The Sony also got better framerates in games even though the Sony only has 32MB of video, likely because it's a faster card, and I'm able to play music loud without blowing out the speakers. You can buy a 802.11b card from Sony that doesn't stick out. Its better off anyways when the 802.11b is outdated at least it won't be \\"integrated\\" into my notebook.

I was really pleasantly surprised---it's somewhat of a period piece, taking place in London in the 1880's, and the look of the film is very atmospheric. I don't think today's kids would be scared of it at all, nor do I think they'd actually stick with it and watch it all the way through------it's quite talky compared to the other Castle films, but I actually enjoyed that about this film---great character development, fantastic story---this is one of those movies to watch on a rainy day, all hunkered up on the couch.

I used to do 1-hour daily walks on residential pavements; had tried many other brands and types (jogging or crosstraining) and none compare to Rockport walking shoes. Had worn a Rockport on a 5-day vacation in Orlando Disney World with 12 hours of walking everyday; and my feet survived nicely. Thick crew socks with Dr. Scholl's pad helps even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mosley-Modern Day Griot-Rush the Sequels","review":"47 joins the rare pantheon of young adult literature that is badly mislabled. This is simple literature at its most illuminating, haunting best. This is not a read just younger children. However this should be read and interpreted by an adult to elementary school children who need to understand the horror that was American slavery but also the strength and fortitude it took to survive. It should be read by everyone else because it is a fabulous story well told. Mosely is a gifted, gifted writer and here's hoping that young and old of all cultures experience his unique gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"I liked this book because it showed slavery in a different way. It was also very different compared to Mosley's series. Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable - Really","review":"I tried. I truly did. To finish the book. But gave up due to my inability to suspend my disbelief when the author chose to head for deep space.What promised to be an exciting historical tale of escape from the cruelties of slavery, turned into a sci-fi story of unrealistic proportions. The author seemed to be at cross purposes in terms of genre. Had not the fantastical elements taken over in the final third of the book, I might have stayed with it until the bitter end. As much as I hate to give up on a book, this just stretched too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"47","review":"African American Fiction. Excellently written but confusing at the end. Seems the author was uncertain how the story should end."},{"rating":"2","title":"We used it for a summer camp","review":"We sponsored a summer science camp for some kids from Pittsburgh and a faculty member led a reading of this book with discussion that followed. The kids were from a small school with a religious base which focuses on critical reading. They do not have the opportunity to read fiction with their school work, and they absolutely loved this opportunity. It led to exciting discussion, prompted critical thought, and opened their eyes to new possibilities. We loved the impact it had on these children and will use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I chose this book for my grade eight class to tie in with some study of slavery and the Underground Railway. My students were captivated by the descriptions of plantation life and the hardships of slaves. We all were baffled, however, when the story took a science fiction turn. We probably would have accepted some sort of time travel connection, but the little glowing multi-coloured aliens and an intergalactic battle between good and evil was just too much. My students agreed that a simpler, less outlandish story line would have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vietnam Nurses with Dana Delany","review":"I am a professor of gerontology currently teaching a course on the impact of combat on aging Vietnam veterans. In addition to explaining the role of nurses in Vietnam, the interviews in this documentary shed light on the psychological trauma the nurses experience. The symptoms of combat induced PTSD as well as the resilience that many nurses experience are also documented. The film should be of interest to scholars studying trauma."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story Long Overdue","review":"\\"vietnam Nurses\\" is a heartfelt, albeit often painful, documentary about a group of women who served their country in the midst of the horrors of war; and who, for far-too-long remained invisible within, and unacknowledged by most of, America.It is a series of stories of lost innocence; courage; pain; lonliness and [finally]redemption- A story to remind us that all (men AND women)who go to war on our behalf pay \\"a price\\" they could never have imagined.Every person in America should see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"its okay","review":"I like how its light and non greasy, but dont think its works as fast as others lighteners.

It's got alot of gloom to it with an interesing feel to it. \\"The Raven and the Rose\\" to me is the standout track on it. Very heavy and intense. But it's the last half of this album that prevails with depressing emotional tracks like \\"The Deepest of all Hearts\\" and \\"A Cruel Taste of Winter\\". One of My Dying Bride's best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best yet","review":"I am really anxious to see what comes next.This album has no bad, or even mediocre, song on it.My favorites: My Hope the Destroyer and A Cruel Taste of Winter. But I can listen to the whole album, and not get bored with ANY song. If this album contained: The Isis Script, She Is the Dark, Your Shameful Heaven, and Two Winters Only it would be flawless (and pretty long), and a perfect synopsis of what MDB has become.If you are a fan of their older works, this may not be the case for you. If you are open-minded and liked the last couple albums, you will certainly not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Excellent Release From My Dying Bride","review":"My Dying Bride is a truley excellent band. They are my favorite band of all time. The Dreadful Hours is another great cd by them, but its sad that its missing the band's trademark violin.

I recomend it to all fans of gothic/ doom metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring View of Custer","review":"I was very disappointed after reading this book; I expected more from the Oscar winner for the screenplay, based from his book, DANCES WITH WOLVES. Frankly, the book is rather boring. There are rare moments where you can't wait to find what happens.It's ironic that Blake originally despised Custer while writing DANCES WITH WOLVES then, later, found he liked Custer after all. If only he could have written about Custer's last days with more passion and ambition, yet, he did not.I do NOT think this is a good book to start one's discovery of Custer. For that, I'd strongly recommend Louise Barnett's TOUCHED BY FIRE."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW COULD A SHOW HOLD SO WELL FOR TEN YEARS","review":"THE BOOK EXPLAINS WELL ALL THE ISSUES AND CHARACTER BUILDING DURING YEARS OF THE SHOW.

I was sadly mistaken.This book nearly put me to sleep. Although I thought it was interesting to read scenes that I had viewed myself and read other people's reactions to them, I was quite bored by all of the technical reading in it.

The second book I ordered, \\"Pregnancy Bedrest: A Journey of Love\\", was much more useful with great things to do with your other kids, in-bed exercises/stretches, lots of links & other resources.

As a fellow high risk patient as well as on complete bedrest for 10 weeks this book was not uplifting to me. Sure, bedrest is very hard but you have to remain positive and count every day as a major accomplishment. I would have like to see more information on activities to do while in bed, exercises for upper body, calendars. As an informed patient the doctor's questions we of no value.

I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and Lame","review":"This book is not what I expected at all... it's more like a workbook than a \\"book.\\" It really doesn't contain any information I didn't already know. I spent 3 months on bedrest with my second pregnancy (after having my first unexpectedly at 32 weeks), and I don't think I opened this book once after reading it through in the first hour I got it. I agree with another poster who said she really doesn't deal with the psychological distress of bedrest at all.

I found I wind up drinking more water using the CamelBak than I do using a bottle because it is so much more convenient. This keeps me better hydrated and makes for a much better ride overall for me. Very easy to use and great for storing the usual list of goods you need to take along. It has a nice sized opening for dropping ice cubes in along with the water to keep things cool. Someone gave this item a bad rating saying the water tasted like chemicals when they used it. Not even! The only off taste I get is if the ice cubes have been in the freezer too long. I would get another one of these any day if I needed to and am considering one that holds more water for longer rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I love this thing. It is my first Camelbak and I use it for cycling. I wanted something I could shove some extra tubes and protein bars in and this works perfectly.I recommend putting the bladder it the the fridge overnight before use. Maybe add a little ice to it too, keeps it cool on your back that way. It feels awesome. Otherwise it sort of creates a hot spot right in your mid back that can overheat you if it's very hot out.I drink about 1 liter every hour when I am cycling, so I have to refill it about every 30 to 40 miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"CamelPack","review":"I bought the camel pack to keep water in when I'm running on my own and not in an event where there are water stops.

Amazing !!","review":"This is a great product!!! I was soo excited to come home and to see the package on my front doorstep. I was hoping for it to be a little bigger for storing more items, but come to think of it, smaller is better.I was able to fit my: Cell phone, wallet, replacement inner tube, keys, (2) Powerbars, and my Ipod. There is also a place where I can put a small tire pump (which was really cool, didn't notice it until my second mountain bike ride.) This Hydration pack is perfect for anyone!!!

Holds 1.5 liters which is good for a 3 hour desert hike. I have run out of water before(with this pack) when it's 100+. It has space for a phone, wallet, keys, and a snack. The space gets limited when the bladder is full though. It sure beats carrying a bigger backpack with water bottles rolling around inside. I would not recommend this pack for an all day hike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camel Pack","review":"The size is great for a full day of biking, and there is plenty of sstorage space for cell, wallet, keys.

It's small and light, holds 2L of water which is enough for 2 hours on the track for both me and my wife. What's more, it also holds my wallet, keys and cellphone. I always pop a bunch of ice cubes in there especially on hot days. The only problem is that the water left in the tube warms up and you have to drink that first before you reach the cooler water in the main tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"When do we grow up?","review":"Very good film about gaining maturity. Emraan Hashmi plays a rich young indian enjoying the fruits of his family's labor, but unconcerned with anything but his own enjoyment. Encountering a club dancer, he finds he actually wants to live for someone. The rest of the film is his struggle to let go of his selfishness. I love both Dia Mirza's and Anupam Kher's performances in this pragmatic film. Rent this on amazon instant play if you're doubtful, but I highly recommend this film. Do be aware that the DVD has reading issues at two points, but the music videos are unaffected by the reading issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best - but worthwhile","review":"Loussier is at his best when he plays Bach. His rendition of Vivaldi's Four seasons is also excellent, and he is quite efficient in handling his Baroque favorites on this CD, but something is missing.Loussier made his career on Bach because (and he said so himself) Bach makes the most Jazz-effective classical compositions. Perhaps these baroque compositions didn't go through Loussier's jazz-converter as well or as brilliantly as those others. Perhaps Loussier just coughed this CD without too much effort.In any case - I bought it, and I am quite pleased I did (and this is the best bottom line possible...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written more a reference than a text book","review":"This book's English prose is filled with jargon which a beginning student of Greek really does not need--it is also infelicitous and hard to follow. It is not a book of great\\"clarity\\" indeed sometimes it is incomprehensible. I have shown it to teachers of English composition who were amused or outraged. It is a book that will discourage the less talented from pursuing Greek unlike Athenaze which takes a slower and more discursive approach. If you have a great talent for morphology this may be your text--for us ordinary folks it is overwhelming and at times so badly written that one feels a need to translate the English rather than the Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Textbook","review":"Extraordinarily systematic and organized (far more than the Cambridge text, which has you dabbling a little bit in grammar here and there and reading chunks of greek without having a good grasp on the grammar contained therein.)

I just love how they introduce to you the 6 principal part verb system of Greek relatively quickly, which in my opinion, greatly expedites your understanding of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous and unimaginative","review":"I cannot recommend this book. We used it in my university course and I detested it. I have studied many languages using a variety of methodologies, and this is the worst. It is memorizing paradigms and translating sentences. It does not teach, nor encourage the student to think or to comprehend in Greek. It teaches instead the metalanguage of language learning.If you are learning on your own, try Seligsons Reading Greek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great for home-learning","review":"The book is thick enough to be used in a multi-semester Greek course. And it is not so feasible for home-alone learning. There are many many explanations that confuse the reader. A less extended, but easier-to-follow book would be much more helpful for beginners.One important thing that I realized is the pronunciation rules (especially diphtongues) are taught differently. Actually this is the problem in English-Greek books. I am quite sure that some words are not pronounced as they describe in the book. I also follow a Turkish-Greek book and I find the differences after I read both.

I got ripped off by someone else reselling this used so they knew they were selling me a bogus product so naturally I didn't get my money back. Be wary of buying this used though at least with a retailer you have more chance for recourse if you get a bum set. I didn't attempt to watch till long after I bought it so the excuse the guy used with Amazon was I waited too long, grrrr.

Brenda Novak created the town of Dundee and then wrote truly fascinating stories of each character.

YIKES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Back when Joan Crawford and Bette Davis were the \\"Queens of Horror\\" in the 1960's, both made some hideously bad choices. \\"Strait Jacket\\" is a prime example of this. Crawford plays Lucy Harbin, looking ridiculous in a black wig, annoying jangly jewelry, and skimpy dress, who comes home to find her husband in bed with another woman. Grabbing a conveniently available axe, she hacks them to death and goes to the Nut House for 20 years, only to be released to the care of her daughter (Diane Baker), who just as conveniently witnessed the killings as a little girl. When some new axe murders start happening, Lucy is suspected, but the true culprit is..well..guess who ? The axe murder scene is hilarious and is the high point of the film - rivaled only by Joan's shameless aggression towards her future son-in-law, while guzzling booze. There are'nt enough of these moments, however, to make this film work even as camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"This axe is sharp!","review":"A good transfer of this classic Castle shocker with a few decent extras including screen tests of Joan Crawford swinging that axe. Crawford is fantastic and pulls out all the stops - you want crazy...she's it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, you just got to have it","review":"It's so bad, it's brilliant actually. Crawford's ambition to work in her later years meant doing these kind of flicks, but it's actually worth owning for many reasons. Crawford's acting is sensational, the trampy scenes when she tries to seduce her daughter's fiance, and the unexpected ending. There's also the extras on the DVD which are great including interviews with Diane Baker now. Also shown is rare footage of Crawford doing public promo's for the movie. For some strange reason they have released most of her later films on DVD overlooking alot of the middle films like Mildred pierce - I think a lot of people are waiting for that one.But you cant go wrong buying Strait Jacket for your collection. It's worth having as a reminder of Joan's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Joan & William Castle Movie!","review":"The 1st of 2 movies that Joan Crawford did for William Castle. Plot is a little thin,and the special effects are crummy (Hey, it's a 60's horror movie,none of them have great effects).However, the movie is well written and Joan gives a great performance. Joan always seemed to give a 100% whether it's Mildred Pierce or this movie. Most of the supporting cast are also good,and you'll see a young and uncredited Lee Majors at the beginning. Basically, this is a very fun film to watch and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ole movie","review":"Seeing the movie in a latter day gave it something special, Joan Crawford was great and I enjoyed watching it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the watch","review":"I learned about this movie after reading a web site dedicated to the \\"Ladies of the Grand Guignol\\" - it's a genre of films that came out in the early 60s where middle-aged actresses were being cast as leading ladies in horror films. Joan Crawford is certainly worth watching in this film; although, she is overshadowed by her castmates' acting at time. There were a couple tense moments where I was on the edge of my seat and a twist (like most of the movies in this genre) that made the movie memorable.I ordered from Amazon, and I'm glad to add this to my collection. If you're into other movies in this genre, this is certainly one worth an investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Drive-In style Horror!","review":"Fans of Joan Crawford's Grand Guignol performances have already seen this one a thousand times, but for the rest of movie fans it is still a rollicking ride reminiscent of the glory days of the Drive In Theater. All the blood, shock and shlock are here to enjoy, complete with a young George Kennedy as a brutish farmhand. The wonderful thing about Crawford's performance (as is the case with all of her work) is that she takes her role as seriously as if it were \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" This results in frequent moments of real emotion, real heartbreak...even amidst the over the top, low budget setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album....","review":"My thoughts on this are; he invited the audience into the studio, so it's not so much live in the traditional sense, it's more like a recital & Glenn makes himself out to be more of a legend in his own mind than the rest of us.

Killer Instinct did not disappoint - I quickly bought up all the other novels available on Kindle and devoured them one after the other. It has been fascinating watching Charlie Fox grow as a character from one novel to the next.In Killer Instinct, we see her relatively early in her career, and we learn a little of her backstory - her conflicted relationship with her parents, the trauma of events in her military career, and we see her unafraid to face her demons.Zoe Sharp's characterizations are skillfully handled.

What a difference! Re-reading Killer Instinct made me appreciate Charlie's growth so much more. She is a fascinating character from the beginning and grows in each book. I am convinced that this is a series that needs to be read in order so one sees how Charlie's character is developed. Going back to the beginning with Charlie only reinforces that opinion.This is one of my all time favorite series. If you are just starting the books, lucky you. If, like me, you are starting it again, it is time well spent. But then I think any time spent with Charlie is time well spent.Killer Instinct: Charlie Fox book one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure I have the stomach for it...","review":"As other reviewers mentioned, I too was drawn in by the advertised foreword by Lee Child, whose books I enjoy. However, I second the use of the adjective \\"inexplicable\\" to describe it.While I applaud the idea of a strong, take-no-prisoners female who can compete in what is often portrayed as a macho world---and rooted for Charlie throughout, the amount of gore and protracted violence was definitely not my cup of chai. I cannot stomach people of either gender getting beaten to the proverbial pulp.As a character, Charlie never quite grabbed me...she seemed to be either falling apart or tearing things apart. I placed her in the \\"damaged goods\\" category, more fueled by anger than common sense.I cannot recommend the book to others but will check out the author's next free download or two to see if I find them more palatable.Regardless of my evaluation of the story line, I appreciated the fact that there were no typos :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer Instinct","review":"This is the first book that I tried to read in this series and I did not like the first 4 chapters so went to the next book in the series and so on and did not get into any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!!!!","review":"Do not believe the Lee Child endorsement of this book.

She doesn't tell you who the bad guys are or who is weak and who is strong, or that someone is afraid or not afraid, she just puts you right into the story and lets you see for yourself. As for Charlie Fox, she is the perfect flawed hero (in this case, heroine!).

Shardad Rohani does an amazing job conducting the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as dueling violins with Karen Briggs in the song \\"Within Attraction\\". All of Yanni's live concerts are wonderful utilizing some of the greatest musicians in the world, but I have to say that this concert is his best and will live on in infamy.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's not as quiet as I hoped, even on the low setting. It's not outrageously loud, but I definitely notice it. It doesn't interfere with listening to music or making phone calls -- it's just noticable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"The product seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do.

It is so quiet, compared to others and it filters the air to where we don't wake up in the night with sore, scratchy throats.

We bought this product to address, at least in part, our granddaughter's allergy and snoring problems. We were suprised that within a week of using this machine, we noticed a huge reduction in her snoring!I did take the filters out, just to test how easy it would be to clean, and it was a breeze.I'm waiting and hoping that 6 mos. from now this product will continue to work as well as it does. Presently, I'm thoroughly pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I purchased this in April and turn it on about two hours before I am to sleep. I have been suffering from horrible allergies (conjunctivitis, coughing fits, runny nose, multiple sneezes) since mid March, and nothing over-the-counter helped. I also have three cats, two of which sleep with me at night. I decided to try an air purifier for my bedroom since my coughing was keeping me up all night. My allergies were already getting better when my purifier arrived, and the first night I used it I didn't cough once. I am very happy with it so far and I love that I don't need to replace any filters. It is also relatively quiet - low setting is comparable to a fan at low speed. High setting will be a little louder but I turn it to low when I am sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I bought this particular product because of the Honeywell name and I've bought other products they made and was pleased.

It has two settings, low and high. Using the high setting, it is a little to noisey. On the low setting it is quiet enough to use in a living area where a person might watch tv or listen to music. The low setting does work, even for cleaning tobacco smoke smell from my house.IMO the thing is not attractive, and the top is not flat so you can't use it as a table.I gave it four stars because it does make a noticable difference in the air quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"better out there","review":"Every once and a while there is a dark area on the rug surrounding this air cleaner.

You figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little filter!","review":"The air cleaner has been running contineously since 7 Dec 09 and is still running. The filter is very easy to remove and the pre-filter is very easy to clean. Operation is very simple, 3 settings- off, low, high. I've had mine running on low since high is much louder. With it on low I am able to sleep even with it only a few feet away. It doesn't have any of the features of more expensive filters such as UV or ion, however more expensive models are available if that is important. I'm currently deployed to Kosovo and the air quality is very poor. I got sick a few weeks after arriving, purchased this air filter, and have not been sick since. I don't think this filter cured me, but sleeping in a better atmosphere may have helped me recover quicker and stay healthier.

This album sounds as though you got drunk and decided to sit down with a bunch of tapes and a casio and decided upon a \\"Greatest Hits\\" Album. Be it, the songs originally are great..but leave them alone already. This sounds like Mission Musak. What makes this effort worse is that they chose Cleopatra records, pushing them further into the Has Been pile. I will always cherish the Mission's music (I even liked \\"Neverland\\") Just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECEPTION: The Album","review":"I have been a great fan of Wayne Hussey, and Craig Adams since the days when they ruled the goth world with Andrew Eldrich in The Sisters of Mercy. When they departed the S.O.M and formed The Mission, their first LP First Chapter was great. Gods Own Medicine which was the follow up album was a masterpiece in my judgement. The albums that followed \\"Children\\" & \\"Carved in Sand\\" were good. Then Simon Hinckler left the band and everything that followed was a disaster. The indie release The Mask was treacherous to listen to, and much to my sadness after listening to Resurrection, I can only think back to the days of past, when The Mission UK, ruled the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"These songs are remakes of the originals, be aware.This album just fuels the fire of my theory that early Mission was great when Simon was in the band. Nothing was the same after Simon left. I'm not sure what happened with this recording. It sounds like it was quickly whipped up to meet some contract obligation. The Mission was great live and bootleg recording capure the magic better than this album. There was something magic about the band, the songs just had feeling, it's too bad it was all lost in this recording. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring - maybe, Enjoyable - yes","review":"Although I do not know the mission that well, i still reckon this to be a great album. In fact I went to see the mission last night at a club and it was one of the best concerts i've been too. Re-recording all there classic songs gives a whole different perpective to their music and just because it doesn't sound the same as the original songs, doesnt make the album any worse - i really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This IS NOT a best of The Mission UK. If I could give this negative stars, I would. Don't get ripped off by this collection from Cleopatra. I did get ripped off. I'll never buy another product from Cleopatra. Shame on you Cleopatra! (the Label) They tell you it's a Best Of, but they are ALL very (VERY) lame remixes. They do not remotely sound like the same songs, or even The Mission UK. The packaging does not say these are remixes.This is now available as a new release 02/21/2005 as Best of the Mission UK, but it's the same as this Greatest Hits collection from November 2, 1999, just with different album art.Intead, buy something else such, as Sum and Substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Partridge Family album I didn't have. :-)","review":"It was fun finding a new album when I thought I had them all.

But this doesn't - it's just a set of unoriginal and uninspiring carbon copies. There's nothing wrong with the choice of songs, but there's nothing distinctively Kutless about their presentation - this could have been created by a band of anonymous Nashville session musicians and it would have sounded exactly the same. It seems that the band checked their creativity out at the door when they went into the stuiod to make this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem With Special Editions","review":"Alright, I loved the regular edition, but didn't own it. So this comes out, and I pay seven bucks for three more songs that what I would have gotten. I wish I would have gotten the regular edition. Because this is a pathetic excuse for a special edition, in fact, it's just plain lazy.You get three \\"New\\" songs, I had high hopes for \\"We Exalt Thee\\". Kutless just got lazy on it. It could have been so much more, it could have been a great worship moment. What do you get instead? Awkwardness. I thought \\"My Savior, My God\\" was a cover of Aaron Shust's hit. It isn't, I don't know where it came from, but it's very poorly done. The singing is bad, and the retention of the song is a little under two seconds, but not much less. The last song? The live version of \\"Strong Tower\\" that was from the live CD, which Kutless fans already have.Overall, a useless, pathetic, lazy excuse for a special edition. Get the regular edition, because this is just plain embarrasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As mentioned by some others, I was expecting these guys to rock out these praise songs.

After having listened to it, I must say, I am positively horrified that the group dared to put out such unoriginal garbage. And this is no small claim from a Kutless fan. Not only has the group thrown to the wind their trademark sound, but they have also chosen to rehash old songs - songs we have heard many times in the past year alone from outer groups - and in doing so, have thrown away the elementary spark so necessary to draw listeners in.Quantum torpor makes it debut on Strong Tower and unabashed praise music has been thrown down the hole in favor of a softer, pop sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise that rocks!","review":"Every song on this CD is awesome! I have it on my IPOD & rock to it @ the gym...& to think it's praise! I get pumped up & blessed @ the same time w/ this amazing album! My hubby & I think Kutless has really out done themselves w/ thier last 2 albums! Kutless is another band that gets better w/ every album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I think it's awesome that Kutless put out a Worship album, it lets us see a different side to the band that we've never seen before. We've only been given glimpses through songs like \\"Sea of Faces\\" and \\"Grace and Love\\". Now I'm not sure what Ben meant by \\"overly religious\\"...how is that possible? It's not bad for someone to be passionate about God, so I see nothing wrong with artists coming out with their own worship album. Personally, I get bored with the same old stuff..it's nice when bands change things up a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah the beauty of worship","review":"Well this album sounds awesome. I love it. Especially \\"Better is One Day\\". That song is amazing weather its rocking or just acoustic. Anyways to answer up on Ben. In my opinion who cares if fans dont like what they hear because guess what dude? Third Day,Jeremy Camp, Newsboys, and now Kutless aint doing this to please the fans. Worship is not for the pleasing of fans. Its for pleasing God almighty. Kutless has expressed their heart to God. Not to us. Sorry dude. Maybe some day you'll come to appreciate and get out of your comfort zone. Peace and God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used same studio track from 2nd CD","review":"I love Kutless, they truly rock. One thing about this CD is that it just doesn't have the emotion like their other CDs did. Also, most of the songs were worship songs already done by others"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, bland, bland","review":"They were going through some blah years I guess when they recorded this one and \\"Sea of Faces\\". Usually praise and worship songs stir the soul but I found this CD lacking in the thing I like best in musicians - emotion. The sound of the songs ground me down. Kutless' \\"Strong Tower\\" really started to lean by the end of the CD. I was actually glad when it was over!! It has since gone on my CD shelf and hasn't gone into my CD player again. Maybe I can sell it on Amazon or some auction site? Hmmmmm"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars, All The Way","review":"LOVE this CD. I keep it in my car for my interminable commute to work and back. The band knows how to rock out, but the spirituality comes through strong.I'd recommend this CD to anyone who 1) is looking for an excellent worship album, 2) wants an introduction to an exceptional contemporary Christian band OR 3) loves quality music.Thanks, guys - keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thundering Praise","review":"I enjoyed this CD. The praise and worship standards seem fresh and new. Guitar work is confident and strong. I especially liked \\"Take me Back\\", and \\"Better is One Day\\".

I like it every bit as much as the original artist's version, if not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kutless Strong Tower","review":"Great CD, Really great Christian Music with a beat to it, Love it!I listen to it on my one hour trip to work and before I know it I'm there :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Tower - Kutless CD","review":"I would definitely buy from this buy again. The CD was used but in wonderful condition. :) Received in a timely manner. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different side of Kutless","review":"For those of you who are disappointed that this album doesn't have a whole lot of new stuff, don't be dismayed- they are releasing a fully new album this fall. But for now- the only new thing kutless fans can get their hands on is \\"Strong Tower\\". That is not a bad thing. Strong Tower has a Kutless twist on all the worship songs. While most songs don't have the \\"rock\\" twist as you would expect, it still sounds like a kutless ballad (like sea of faces or grace and love) My personal favorite \\"old\\" worship song they do is \\"better is one day\\". It has the type of rock feel as one of their other songs called \\"perspectives\\" has.My favorite song is \\"Strong Tower\\". A brand new Kutless rock song like the ones we've been listening to on their first two albums.So is the CD worth buying? If your a Kutless fan, then yes, you'll love it. If your a worship music fan, yes. But if your looking for a good christian hard rock CD, get their self titled debut or Sea of Faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best photography books i've ever seen!","review":"I baught LaChapelle Land, and i was so amazed at the pictures.

I know looks can be such a subjective thing, but I find this to be an attractive watch. Keeps time very well, and with the daily sync with the atomic clock, I don't have to worry about checking that it's set correctly all the time (I don't always wear this one)The only thing that detracted a star for me, was that the \\"crystal\\" on this watch is some sort of plastic, and not glass or crystal. This makes it more prone to scratching which is a shame for an otherwise nice stainless watch. For the price though, I guess I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value-priced atomic watch","review":"This atomic watch is a great value at the price. Though obviously not a \\"fine timepiece\\", it nonetheless looks good on close examination. The most important feature is its accuracy, assured by nightly time checks with the Atomic Clock in Colorado. Careful reading of the owner's manual made it easy to set the watch to the proper time zone, and placing it in a window at night with its plastic back facing West garners a strong signal from the radio transmission. As an everyday watch with superb accuracy, this Casio is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Men's Atomic Watch","review":"This is a great watch.

You might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it, and as most of you know, if you have to grow to like something, you like it for a longer time than something that just \\"grabs you\\" quickly.It keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from Fort Collins, Colorado every night.

Not only does it break down all the aspects of brewing, but with it's customizable playback; I can use it as the perfect reference for the brewing equipment I have now and as well as any equipment upgrades and additions I make in the future. It explains as well as illustrates the brewing process from start to finish. It provides a list of equipment that is required to brew as well as things that may make the process easier or more \\"technical\\". It also provides great background information on the main ingredients of beer. This is a great buy for anyone looking to begin brewing beer or if you are already a brewer, it provides itself as a great reference and may help assist you in greater brewing adventures. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three in One","review":"This dvd is like having three dvds in one. You learn how to brewwith single stage, two stage and a conical.

Everyone involved in the making of this video is very intelligent about brewing, but isn't nearly as informing as you'd like it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great supplement for hair and nails!","review":"This is my second order for this product.

I bought it because it sounded interesting and fun. You know what I was right. This is a wonderful book. I do not feel that this is a \\"guy\\" book. The main character is female, just different from most females. Diana is a strong and powerful female lead. The kind that you have to have in a book like this to make it work. I think that Mr. Sullivan did a great job in working out the plot. I was totally engrossed in this fine piece of work from the beginning. OK the author did mess up with the scalp thing. But some times that is a part of the fun. Finding a mistake that everyone missed and they get paid the big bucks! (No pun intended.) This did not take away from the story and was not important to the plot. So you are forgiven Mr. Sullivan for one little bitty mistake. I'm looking forward to more by this wonderful author. Keep them coming, Mr. Sullivan. I highly recommend \\"The Purification Ceremony."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Action-Packed Read","review":"I picked up this book on a whim, and I'm glad I did. This is a fast, engrossing read. The mystery was fairly easy to figure out early on, but it was interesting to see the characters process the clues and find the answers. A very strong female main character didn't overwhelm the story but pulled it all together. A fair amount of violence is involved, so if that bothers you, you might want to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbing amounts of deer hunting, cookie-cutter people","review":"Gosh, I usually love adventure/suspense reads, but this one just couldn't grab my interest. If the author had put half the effort into characterization that he put into describing the act of hunting a deer, it might have been worth something. All the characters were cookie-cutters except for Diana Jackman and she was so screwed up I thought for a while she was the killer (coulda been a nice twist, parts of her behavior seemed very manic depressive to me). By the time Diana confronts the killer, I didn't even care. Also, I thought it was pretty stupid that the killer is targeting evil deer hunters up north in Canada, when we get about 250,000 deer hunters each fall in Michigan-- they'd have made a hell of a lot more logical target. So the killer stalks some rich hunters way north somewhere white and cold. So it's got an Indian, peyote flavor to it. Go back to the 70's if you still think that's neat. Or better yet, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this find a publisher ?","review":"This is, without a doubt the worst mystery I have read in recent memory. It features an unlikely plot and poorly defined characterizations wrapped in excessive description. Who really cares about the color of the drapes in her cabin(green), the color of her long underwear (green), or the color of the pants of a half dozen men standing around a cabin (also green)? The author seems to be of the school which believes that where one word will suffice, use ten. ie: \\"Phil's shoulders seemed to become part of his ears.\\" could maybe be \\"Phil shrugged.\\" Edited in this manner this would have been only a bad short story instead of an awful novel. I don't write a lot of reviews but in this case I felt the public should be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific; entertaining to the end; would be great movie","review":"I read dozens of books each year; this would be in the top 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"good beginning - anticlimatic ending","review":"The first 200 pages of this book had me on the \\"edge of my seat\\". The combination of mystery and almost-horror genre was excellent and the pace was just right. Diana's struggles and relationships with both the \\"hunt\\" and the others were actually easy to relate to. Unfortunately, the story fell apart in the latter pages with a very weak ending. The reliance on the \\"power\\" and the mystical strength of both Diana and the antagonist were just a bit much for me. The book moved from a credible human suspense with believable characters and action to a superhuman or supernatural non-thriller by the end. By the time the climax occurred, I cared little about who won or whether I read the rest of the book. Sullivan also spent very little time on characterization of other players in the book...only the painfully long descriptions of Diana's past. This book reminded much of Congo...great start...poor finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have, should have","review":"This is the first book I have read by Mr. Sullivan and after this I am not sure if I will read any more. I was rather disappointed with this novel after reading the premise and the excellent reviews that accompanied it. The background characters are in no way developed enough and as they were eliminated from the book I found myself not really caring. Addtionaly the perspective shifts from the present to the main characters past were very awkward and disorienting. In defense of this novel the hunting scenes were described very well and the background information on the Native American beliefs were fascinating-but not enough to carry the book.

Thank you Amazon.com for your Power Search feature. I heard this book on tape, and have been wanting to get my hands on the actual book. Even, if you're not into horror, this crosses over into mystery thrillers and the story is just, well words fail me, amazing. The female lead is so strong and so believable, it boggles my mind that the author Mark Sullivan (a mere male - presumably) could write such a masterpiece. I'm going to go hunting for more Sullivan fiction, but in the meantime....INTO THE SHOPPING CART with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a thriller? Love suspense? This is for you!","review":"My boyfriend loaned me this book. I am sooo mad at myself for not reading it the instant he placed it in my hands! It was awesome! I am a Stephen King fan (except for the fantasy stuff) and this was right up my alley. From the very beginning I was drawn into the suspense-packed plot, and I could not put it down (hard not to put a book down when you have a baby!) I devoured this book. I admired Diana and was proud of her for showing that heritage, wits, and power are ok for women to possess and display.

I am a published novelist myself, and I have the greatest admiration for Mr. Sullivan's artistry. He has the spirit of a poet. I have a few quibbles about the solution to the mystery (I always have quibbles!) but I cannot deny the fact this author's descriptions of snow and isolation are masterful."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just suspense.","review":"This is a fast moving, suspenseful novel that explores man's relationship with nature through the eyes of an educated,highly spiritual,part native-american woman.Through his protagonist, the author studies the concept of death as a renewal and something that can have a positive effect upon those left behind. Nature appears to rule and by living in accordance with the laws of nature and in union with it,one will certainly be blessed.This is a most enjoyable story,especially for anyone interested in moving beyond the stereotypical thriller"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rewarding, almost spiritual ending to a powerful thriller","review":"Half way through this strong and terrifying novel I thought what a great movie. A rival for Dickie's\\"Deliverance\\". But, as I read on, I came to the realization that the spirit and heart of the character and that of the protagonist and Gaia herself could not be brought forth but by the written word. I had to bring something to thisnovel and thank God I was able to do so. There is terror and there is high tension.

On the surface what's so funny about the staff of a rich woman committing larceny to keep her afloat? Not a perfect film but it works on it's own terms. The film is graced with a terrific turn by Dick Van Dyke as the title character, the ringleader of the gang of larcenous household domestics. The supporting cast is also terrific notably John McGiver as a former minister who is morally conflicted about his activities. The final job, a Christmas Eve robbery of Gimbels department store is also terrifically conceived.

When read quickly the lack of development and detail gets brushed away by the addled pace. There are a few good concepts, though they are diluted by digressions and contrivinces, and the plot moves along quickly.However, when read slowly these problems dominated the narrative and left me frustrated and bored. My 6 year old son, who loves to draw pictures to illustrate the stories that he hears, was unable to find inspiration. That a visually precocious child could gain no mental picture of a crucial plot element, the shrouded castle, says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book","review":"only reason i gave this one star is cause you can only listen to it on kindle. if i wanted to listen to books id buy them on itunes"},{"rating":"2","title":"MERLIN RULES","review":"This book/series is one of the most original fantasy series I've ever read.

I can't tell which of the 4 is better, as a matter of fact I've only read the 1st 2 (waiting for paperback editions). These are absolutley the BEST books ever written. They by-pass Harry Potter by a long shot. Barron was ingenious to put it in 1st person. But what really got me was the inward as well as outward struggle. When you see Merlin, you think of a powerful wizard which nothing can effect. These books tell that differently and explain a lot of things in his earlier life.

But ever since he lost his sight in a tragic fire,that he started,he gave up hope untill he is gifted with a second chance at sight.

When I had finished the book I let a friend borrow it. I felt odd not having the book to read. Whenever I would stop reading I would think to myself: Where am I? Because the book made me feel like I was there, in the book. I'm not going to tell you about the book because, first of all it's to complicated to understand (but if you read it you'll understand it,) and second of all, one word could spoil the book.

One warning to middle-school age kids: prepare to be made fun of. It's worth it though. T.A.

To the extent that he has any impact on the plot, it is merely through accidental, uncontrolled use of his magic. The moral of the stories appears to be:-- one need not apply oneself-- one can coast purely on raw talent or skill -- people will like and appreciate you merely on the basis of that talent and skill-- hence, one can wander through life in a self-absorbed fog.Please do not buy these horrible books.

Like previous reviewers have said, if you are a fan of music that expertly blends synth, guitar, searing vocals, and lyrics, BUY THIS.

If this does not give you a little clue about what to expect, then you must be without a clue. Fans of gothic/industrial music are going to love this album. The songs are very well written and very doomy and gloomy. Numan is obviously influenced by Nine Inch Nails here but he is not simply ripping off Trent Reznor. He just takes a few pointers from Trent and creates music of his own. My favorite tracks are:PureRibOne Perfect LieMy JesusListen To My VoiceThis album would be great for listening during that drive to attend Goth Night at your favorite club on a rainy night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numan Of Old Returns!!","review":"It took me a few listens to really absorb this album fully, and when i did, i found that i really enjoyed hearing Gary put the angst back into his songs that reminded me of his early 80's work. Definitely the best of his last three ablums (which seem to have a similar theme), and i would say his best set of work since \\"I, Assassin\\".I was disappointed in his last two albums which seemed to have that dark edge, but missed the production value that this CD has. It is definitely worth buying if you are a Numan fan of old, and want to hear a fresh new sound. Some of the songs are extremely heavy (think \\"Head Like a Hole\\" by Nine Inch Nails\\"), and full of energy. There is the classic Numan voice, which seems more energized on this album then the last few. The drums are a huge improvement over the last two albums. I particularly like \\"My Jesus\\", \\"Pure\\", and \\"Prayer for the Unborn\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The videos featured are classic","review":"I like Phil Collins.

That means you don't only have to carry around the compact unit, but also the not-so-compact plug in keyboard. I'm going to try and return this.

I wanted a simple, non-overwhelming model to be able to show clients during this explanation. I was so excited for my brain to arrive but was extremely disappointed with the actual thing. Most disappointing was that it didn't have the amygdala or hippocampus listed among the parts. Also disappointing was that the two halves don't stay together unless you hold them. The outside is gray rather than the bright yellow shown in the image, and it's made of material reminiscent of a dog-toy. I believe this would be good for children which is why there are so many positive comments about it, but if you want it for anything other than that, keep looking. As one other reviewer said (which I should have heeded and didn't), \\"it's neither a toy nor an educational tool\\". I certainly expected to get a lot more for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I only had a brain.......","review":"Nice brain in attractive packaging.

The labels inside are clear and the areas are bright.

It's a talky movie with not a lot of action and no physical contact between the leads, but I couldn't turn away. It looked like the ending was going to be predictable, especially when it got down to the last 10 or 15 minutes. I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone.

The cinematography is impressive, as is the first time direction from Gorak. The performances are convincing, adding weight to this disturbing examination of the effects of terrorist activities on Mr and Mrs Everyman. Their struggle to survive makes for harrowing viewing, and, although it does run out of steam in the middle, it provides a memorable experience. It's a shame that a little humour wasn't injected, particularly during the slightly flat mid-section, and the ending, on reflection, seems just a tad contrived. But overall this is a muscular and unsettling piece of worthwhile cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for an Independent Film","review":"For an independent film this is spectacular. Like many others have said is is extremely thought provoking, and has sorta the same feeling I had when I saw Cloverfield, in the beginning it also has some of the not so nice feeling of 9/11. All in all good movie, great beginning and end, with a sorta stale middle. Plot could have had more ups and downs but all in all worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"operators are busy...","review":"apart from a shockeroo didn't-see-that-coming ending and a deft,touching, lyrical, even poetic scene of contaminated dust and debris wafting into the protagonists' backyard, this film schemes to make the most out of an obviously low budget. we hear about the bombs and their aftermath all from radio broadcasts-- no faux tv anchors here. and it seems that way too much time is wasted in the first quarter with Mr. Unemployed Musician fiddling and fumbling with what seems are more cellphones than one can find at RadioShack hoping to reach his wife. yes, this flick is claustrophobic and dark and even menacing(and boring every time mom gets on the phone-- we hear, not see her) so when the Big One Hits, make sure you have plenty of duct tape to swaddle/cocoon/barricade yourselves in your home or apartment. also, load up on bottled water."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave it outside the door!","review":"This movie was mostly about a stay at home musician husband, driving around and trying to avoid the police. Then when he finally does what he has been instructed to do for his own safety, he falls apart. I think from the title, most can figure out its a disaster movie. I did not expect it was a movie about an idiot, and all his bad choices. This will be on offer at my next yard sale for $1.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"My hair fell out more than ever......","review":"I was so excited to get this product, that's until I put it on my head. My hair started falling out immediately, and I'm not talking about a couple hairs, I am talking about a brush full of hair. It scared me, I thought if I keep it on all night like it instructs you to do, that I would be bald the next morning, so I washed it out. It continued to fall out while rinsing it in the shower, the only thing that seemed to stop the hair from falling out after the rinse was the washing of head and shoulder shampoo on my scalp. Now I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I was told that Asian hair products are way too strong for Caucasian hair. Does any one know if this is true, because if that is the case that might have been why it didn't work for me. Does anyone know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but leaves too much out","review":"As a fan of Lois Rock's Learning About...series, all of which have reviewed, I was disappointed by this offering from her. In an effort to be short, Lois has left out some details of some of the stories which in my opinion were important in the idea of the story. Many of the most popular stories are included, and while this was a good idea I feel this was not given as much effort as could have been given. I feel this could have been improved by possibly making it two books, one dealing with each section of the Bible, instead of shortening the stories so much as to leave it lacking in details. I also felt the writing was somewhat confusing for younger children that possibly had little knowledge of the Bible previously. Pictures were nice, but in some places the type over the pictures was hard to read because of the color beneath the type. I feel this is worth reading, but with additional discussion offered by the person reading the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I bought this product, to use in our Bosch front-loader, on the strength of others' recommendations, because it has no optical brighteners, and in part because of BioKleen's liquid detergent which is effective in hand washing. The powder, however, is a disappointment. It simply does not work on sweat and grime soil unless I pre-treat each garment liberally with Oxy-Clean gel. For light laundry soil it's OK, but even so it does not remove odors from all parts of a garment. The half-scoop recommendation doesn't begin to get the job done in a full wash in warm water. I am using up what I bought but will look elsewhere for an effective laundry detergent that has no optical brighteners."},{"rating":"2","title":"$94.85 comes with a little scoop in each box","review":"The box is a purply red not white as pictures. The detergent is in a plastic bag with a twist tie inside the cardboard box so there were no leaks. The citrus smell is not as strong as the dishwashing powder. For front load washers, one tablespoon is required but the scoop is much bigger than one tablespoon. I emptied all 8 boxes into one plastic airtight bin.I have not found startlingly good results with this product but the less intense scent is a welcome change from big name brand versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is better than what I've been using!","review":"We thought we should be good to nature and give up some performance moving to an environmentally safe laundry powder. We have four kids and often do two loads a day, so making this change will mean a lot less mess from our waste water. Out went Tide and in went Bi-O-Kleen. The first thing we noticed was the fresh natural scent, not the pungent detergent scent from the major brands. I then noticed how little we had to use, how one box does 54 loads. Nice! And then old stains started to dissapear from our clothing. Old, kind of faded grease stains was gone! Also, dulled fabrics seemed to brighten up, but we are not sure if that's only our happines with the product rubbing off on the laundry.We have been using this now for a while and we will never go back to the \\"old school powders\\". because not only is this good for nature, it's a better laundry powder alltogether!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for stain removal or brightening whites","review":"I love eco-friendly products. And I have nothing against biokleen (their automatic dishwashing detergent works better than anything in my Bosch). But their powdered laundry detergent is a huge disappointment. I use this in my high-efficiency front-loader, and clothes come out dingy and stained. I've tried different amounts of this detergent and different cycles but can't seem to get it to work for my household. The nearly full box is literally sitting on the shelf because I have to pretreat all of the stains with Tide before I can use it! This product just doesn't work as well as it should.

(I find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric!)If the manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your mitts.

The book is veryinsightful, with plenty of ideas to add to yourpersonal array of tactical and strategic aims.His best commentary is in the 'ideas' chapter.Soltis maintains that if you do not have a generalidea of how you want your game to progress, thenyou are merely moving pieces around. You musthave a plan. But to have a plan and stick toit without regard for changes in position andserendipitous events is equally foolish.Many of his example games, however, use thefamiliar theme of attacking a castled king. Thiscould get monotonous, but if you are looking tobrush up this area of your playing, then 'TheInner Game of Chess' will teach you what youneed to get you moving in the right direction.- Barry Ball"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"Until you reach the 1900 to 2000 level the only thing that you should be studying is tactics and calculation. The reason for this is simple, if you can see 90% of the combinations on the board during a game, you will not have to even use postional advantages. Don't get me wrong positional play has a very important role, but more at the higher levels. If you can calculate efficiently and quickly you will have a huge advantage over all those people who just memorize opening moves, because after move 10 they're lost. Why are some children so strong at chess? It's because they can calculate well and can visualize the board. The bottom line is get this book along with a set of practice problems, like Reinfeld's 1001. Solve the problems, write down all your candidate moves and analysis, and you'll be amazed by how quickly you improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute shoes but not comfortable","review":"I usually wear 3\\" high heels for work, so I think I can handle this pair.

I tried using flat wrappers, but it takes forever. When using flat wrappers, you use the sorter and let the change fall into the tubes, and then you have to try and get them into the wrapper manually from the tube. It sounds easy, but it is not - I spent up to 15 minutes trying to get them into one wrapper. When using preformed wrappers, you slip the wrappers into the tubes and the coins drop directly into the wrappers. All you do is fold the end, taking about 2 seconds. This machine is a great investment if you are willing to purchase preformed wrappers, which are less than $10 for an assortment pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"I purchased this machine from a catalog (hammacher schammler) at higer cost than amazon because of a gift certificate I was trying to use up.

The first word in the title says WIDE and it was nowhere near wide. It was maybe 4 inches. Yes, I should have looked at the dimensions, but when you advertise as a wide base then it should be one. Also, there is no way to hold the bigger items you want to display on it. I put my plate I wanted to display on it and it just kept slipping right off the stand. I held it on to at least see what it looked like and it wasn't even strong enough to hold it! it just opened up flat! This is definitely not a stand to use if you have something big/expensive to display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"The Wide Base Adjustable Two Wire Stand does what it should. I use it to hold my iPad v1 which is in the standard iPad v1 case. Even without the case the hinges and frame are rubberized and would prevent scratching.

As Aptheker notes in her introduction, she was a remember of the CPUSA's national commmittee when she wrote this book in 1973; it was first issued by the party's International Publishers two years later. Ironically, Aptheker lauds the socialist countries, especially the USSR, throughout her narrative. It's deeply regretable that Aptheker and her comrades protested the political incarceration of Davis and other U.S. militants and yet passively supported the repression meted out to Soviet and Czech dissidents during the same period. During an official visit to Czechoslavakia in 1972, Davis herself insisted that imprisoned rebels of the 1968 Prague Spring \\"deserved what they got\\" and should remain behind bars.

I agree with the other positive reviews regarding the recipes themselves.ConsThe Kindle edition is nearly impossible to use. The table of contents only links to the chapters, not to the recipes themselves. Although there is a recipe listing, it does not link to the recipes - and of course the page numbers are no help since the Kindle uses locations instead of page numbers. So, the only way to get to the recipes is to search by the recipe title and then guess on which location points to the actual recipe.

That alone makes DS9 wierder and scarier than most science fiction.All the usual conflicts are located on DS9: racism, prejudice, anger, arrogance. And they're all jammed inside wonderfully visual sci-fi settings and characters. All the genres are there, too, including romance and mystery.From the first season to the last, the characters develop in both depth and relation to the others. Here's my favorite part of DS9: The same old racial attitudes prevail, but a couple of naive kids cross the forbidden borders to form the kind of friendship only kids can form. Nog is the Ferrengi kid, and Jake is the human kid, the son of Commander Benjamin Cisco.Whether one watches Deep Space Nine as pure fiction or latter-day morality play, it is pure enjoyment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star trek deep space 9 series","review":"I ordered the whole series from this company & only half of the disks work.

They skip, they pause, they don't play correctly. The cases they come in are little better then plastic taped together (that's literally what it is made out of). I own all 7 seasons of TNG and the build quality is fantastic. I've never had a single problem with any of those disks and I've watched them tens of times. On my first run through with these BRAND NEW DS9 set, I've had to skip episodes because of how terrible the quality is. They freeze in the middle of episodes, skip and jump ahead. Terrible terrible terrible! I would highly recommend waiting for a new set to come out because this one is just worthless. On top of that the price they charge for this crap is outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trek ever","review":"To me this is the best Trek ever. Why? Well because it kept the future real, by having conflicts between the characters. Also the latter seasons are some of the best Trek seasons ever.

I'll admit, the first season is kind of tough to get through, there are some real stinkers, but it's totally worth it. The entire series is saga-based. The characters, stories, and setting are rich and deep. Everything seems to flow logically through-out the series.

The first episode was good no problem but after that it was terrible froze frame, skipped, not what to expect from a new DVD.

When I got it, however, it was to find that this was the WORST packaging I've ever seen. I've never been bothered by bad packaging before but this is so bad that it makes the discs difficult to get to and easy to damage. And then the further I got into watching the discs, the fewer of them would play. Most of the discs for seasons 5, 6, and 7 won't play at all - and by the time I found this out, it was too late to return the set.

What I will say is this series was ripe with political intrigue due to the nature of it being on a space station thus less exploring of strange new worlds. The first 2 seasons lent themselves to character development and could be considered slow by the uninitiated but as with all Trek series, by the third season the show picks up speed with the arrival of Worf and the start of the Dominion War and continues to entertain thru the next 4 seasons.

Our itinerary was already out with family, so to not endanger ourselves with a change in route, we did an out and back of our trip.I have never had such an inaccurate book in my 14 years of backpacking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal Hikes","review":"This book is a wonderful fusion of wilderness hiking guide and photo essay, fabulously bridging the gap between funcionality and literary artwork.I've personally hiked in over ten of the areas described by Mr. Huschke, and have not once managed to find the words to convey their beauty in as magic a manner as he. At the same time, the crisp and accurate detail of each hike-description clearly show the great deal of time spent in growing intimate with each trail and side-trail.I've read dozens of guides to the Pacific Northwest outdoors, but the photos and background depictions in this book make it easily the finest I've ever encountered. I agree with the first review of this book in anxiously awaiting the next effort from these two gifted artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy a Smartpad for a Palm IIIC!","review":"The Seiko Smartpad is advertised as working with all Palms higher than the III. I have the IIIC. It does work, however the 4 X zoom feature does not work, and when you enable it, it says \\"go to our website to see if there is updated software, the 4X zoom does not work with the Palm IIIc\\". There is not a patch for the Palm IIIC yet. Also, Seiko's customer support is awful, so if you want no support, this is the place to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out IBM products","review":"Another reviewer points out that the Seiko pad lacks handwriting recognition. If you're questing for a way to get your handwritten notes digitized, IBM and Cross teamed up to create a pad that recognizes handwriting, complete with handwriting recognition. IBM now sells a laptop with this pad as part of the case for a Thinkpad. I own the pad and like it -- you can extensively \\"train\\" the pad. I let some notes stay as \\"scrawls\\" by telling the pad they are a diagram, and then carefully write in text I want as computer text (like key words for later searching). I'm assuming the very negative reviews of this Seiko product reflect consumer feedback that have made this product unavailable for at least 4 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Not the best of the Vinx records (see \\"Rooms In My Fatha's House\\"), but still a wonderful CD.

I'm a total kitchen gadget junkie and so I was delighted when I received this for Christmas. Yes, it's more ergonomic to hold and it's a little easier for me to slice up small bits of pizza for my toddler, but it's not *all that*. The problem is the thing is so irritating to wash that I find myself just reaching for my regular pizza cutter instead of this one. Basically you have to take it out of its plastic case to wash it which can be rather tricky. I keep worrying I'm going to slice myself with the blade. Even putting it back together after it's clean is a bit nerve racking. Frankly all this business of taking it apart and putting it together sort of nullifies the ergonomic aspect of it for me.I'd say if you already have a pizza cutter that you're happy with you don't need to bother with this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting to give this a try","review":"I am still waiting to use this pizza cutter. Why am I writing a review now? Because I want you to know how poorly this is packaged. There is a round sticker around the entire blade, and it does not come off easily. The blade does come out of the handle for cleaning. That has not helped me to get this sticker off. They must have used the strongest glue they could find to attach the sticker. The sticker does not peal off. Instead it tears, and comes off in tiny bits. I picked at it for over half an hour. I gave up for a while, and put the blade in the dishwasher. I hoped the hot water and steam would loosen the label. It did not. There is still glue and bits of paper that I am still picking off. Although the blade is not 'razor sharp', I have to work carefully so I don't cut myself. So far this product has been a big disappointment. If I can ever get it clean enough to use, I'll write another review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ergonomics Strikes Again","review":"I purchased this pizza wheel for my mother because of her loving pizza and having arthritis in her hands around her thumb and the inability to use a conventional pizza cutter to put enough pressure on the shaft to cut pizza.

She has no problem cutting through even the thickest hand tossed doughs anymore, and the clean up is a breeze with the wheel's ability to come out of the casing.

The top edge also has a green discoloration in the plastic. It is infrared, not radio controlled like the XBox 360 controller. Because of that, you need a good line of site. The range of the remote is short and I cannot use it from everywhere in my modestly sized living room.Also, the directional buttons do not control the XBox menus or inside netflix very well.

It does not turn on. The package labeling is absurd and offers no usage instructions whatsoever. Package says \\"DVD Movie Playback Kit\\" on the back, even though that's not what it is. It also says it requires two AAA batteries, but opening it you find it needs two *AA* batteries. It says to read all accompanying information, yet there is *none* - no manual, no insert of any kind. The end of the English section on the back of the package says \\"For Xbox customer service in the\\" - and that's it, nothing more. The packaging is also labeled at the bottom as being manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, yet this absolutely is not Microsoft quality at all. I think this is an illegal copy of Microsoft's universal remote, and seems like something I'd picked up at the local dollar store. Just junk.

It does work, it's just got a very weak signal. You have to be close, and hit the right angle for it to work. That said, it's five bucks. The way my rooms set up it works for me, but someone with the box on the other side of the room would have trouble.

Yes, the scenery is stunning, but the beauty of human relationships it attempts to convey is lacking. The scenes of the male model holding the baby for example, are just plain silly. I don't feel any love or relational debth when I watch them. It's just some guy with an above average body holding a baby as though he's not quite sure what to do with it.With that said, the best chapter on the DVD was \\"L'Abitudine\\" with Andrea and Helena Hellwig at the recording studio.

Since he is anti-organization, anti-teacher he dimisses all the mystics and spiritual teachers who ever lived. They don't know but since I'm free of all that dogma and rigid teachings I know best sums up Krisnamurti's thought on god. This borders on egomania. Sadly by lowering the topic to such a low level of discourse he makes himself no better than any new age kook. Since he had no method per se and dismisses any sort development of higher level perceptions he puts himself in a box all alone. It's too bad his experience with Theosophy ruined his opinion of teachers and organizations.This book could perhaps stand as signpost as too how far rational thinking can take a person.

The only problem I have with it is that Krishnamurti is not willing to investigate world religions. He just ASSUMES that they are all wrong. I'm not saying that they are right, but a true scientist must be open to all possibilities. K is obviously not. He brings all his ideas to a level that is so low, that no one can possibly argue with him. He never read anything and so it is easy for him to criticize all the great thinkers. He never read St. Thomas Aquinas so I wonder how he would be arguying about Thomas' five proofs of God's existence. But he doesn't want to deal with all of that, so he just brings everything to an incredibly low level where only he is right. He also rejects all mystics, knowing that there have been mystics in all religions since the beginning of man.I like Krishnamurti. There is a lot of good stuff in what he teaches. But his method of finding the truth is not always very scientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your mind too open and your brains will fall out!","review":"Jeeper,s what a great idea!

I will be returning this phone & getting one that has the digital spread spectrum technology. (Thank You to Target for the 90 day return policy.)

In turn, I purchased the USB cable, but the picture that Amazon shows is a long \\"version\\" of the cord. Looking closer, it looks like they just chopped off the USB cable from a cradle and showed that, being that cable is longer. In reality, the cable is a very short limited one. No wonder they offer it for 51% off. But oh, do they make up for the cost in shipping and handling. When I got the product and saw how short it was, I was naturally disappointed.

I bought it because I thought I'd try something new and the gel idea appealed to me because sometimes some of the liquid gets lost or spilled between dispensing onto the hand and traveling to the target area, or simply drips off or spreads too far after application. The gel seemed like it would be a little more controlled product with less cleanup afterward.After one use I would say the gel is too thick for manual stimulation where a silky smoothness is desired. Instead of creating a slippery effect, there was a feeling of the thickness and almost tackiness of the gel. This might be OK for use with toys or other activities, but it was just too thick to achieve the right gentle touch during manual stimulation that we desired.Also, cleanup afterward required a little more water and a few more wipes due to the thickness of the coating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the pictures","review":"I followed the routines in this book for a while.

When Amazon said it was produced on demand, I figured it would be a refreshed, enhanced print, much as Criterion often does.The movie poster reproduced on the case cover says \\"You can expect the unexpected when they play 'Charade.'\\" Yuo certainly can. You can expect both muddy print and sound, jagged herringbone edges instead of straight lines on objects, a horrible score that has replaced Henri Mancini's masterpiece, and so on. It was so painful to watch I turned it off even before Cary Grant appeared, and watched instead an over-the-air VCR print of infinitely better quality.There are other reviews here recommending which versions to buy. But please, PLEASE, don't buy this one. Get the Criterion, get a videotape, get a book, get a good lunch, but stay away from this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - DVD-R","review":"AMAZON list hundreds of DVD-R's as DVD's when running a search and again under the title on the product page (as FORMAT: DVD).This review is for CHARADE, Synergy Ent.

As noted by many reviewers, this version is awful.Please email Amazon insisting they change their policy and identify DVD-R's as what they are and at no point call them DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy and poor quality","review":"I was so thrilled to get this movie in the mail.

I will be returning and reordering a much better copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version","review":"I bought two copies of this video and they were both returned as unviewable. They were the worst DVD's I have ever seen. They would strta and stop and ther was no way to view the movie.

A total ripoff, as a matter of fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews before buying!","review":"I did not look closely at what I was buying before I got this particular copy of the movie (which I love) but I have never seen such a poor quality recording in my life. Pops & flashes, floating vertical lines, green circles appearing randomly and skips in video AND audio make this extremely disappointing. (I would have been better off to make my own DVD-R from my old worn out VHS copy!) You get what you pay for -I will be getting the Criterion Collection copy and throwing this one away as a loss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD Quality","review":"The quality of this DVD is very poor. I don't know who produces these DVDs but they clearly don't know what they are doing,or they don't care. The film Charade was in letterbox format. Above the letterbox, ran a series of black and white squigglely lines. They were throughout the film. It was extremely annoying and ruined watching the film. Charade is one of my favorite films; it's also one that you have to watch closely because there are so many twists and turns in the plot. I finally took a towel and laid it over the top of the TV to cover up the black and white squiggles. Then I could finally focus on the film. But I shouldn't have to do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the quality of the cd was awful.","review":"charade is a fun movie, but the quality of the cd itself (which was the replacement for the first cd I returned), was unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal at Best","review":"Unfortunately, the content is rambling with arguments poorly constructed, or not supported at all.

One of the features highlighted in the ad is the use of a new backlighting unit using HCFL (hot cathode fluorscent lamps) instead of the old style CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamps). I am a technical kind of guy and a tinkerer. Little did I know that my curiosity would reveal some false advertising. The Philips set did not have the HCFL system, but had the old CCFLs. I have pictures to prove this.I intend to take this up with Amazon and see what they say about it. This makes me suspect of other Philips products.

There are so many songs from \\"today's Sesame\\" - what happened to the songs of Sesame from years ago? I was expecting to see more of the classic, unavailable songs from my record collection, but sadly, they can't be found on this box set. Disc 3 is a disappointment - who wants to hear another Aerosmith song???!! Not me. Give me the Ernie & Bert Rhyming song and you would have made my day. Sorry, I have to give it 2 stars. Most of these songs are available on all their other CDs. Shame on you Sesame Street!

I can not think of another one that even comes close. It covers both basic use of this tool as well as many of the more complex things that you can make it do. I think it would be most helpful to those people who have not done much with the table saw. That said it has things to offer to even the more advanced woodworker. It presents the basics in such a way as to build confidence, keep fingers and at the sametime teach useful skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware...","review":"I purchased this book and wish I had not. (Revised edition (c) 1997) It contains the most basic information which might be ok for a beginner but it is coupled with poor photographs and confusing (wrong?) information (i.e. The Taper Jig Text on pg 224 says \\"Measure back from hinge exactly 1-foot\\" yet the line illustration on Pg 222 clearly show's the 12inch measure from the Taper foot - the two directions are contradictory).

My favorite was Away in a Shelter, by Annie Kimberlin. An innocent puppy, two lonely dog-loving volunteers, a Christmas Eve blizzard that strands the three at the animal shelter--what more do you need for love to blossom? The puppy is wonderful--very much a character in her own right, and yet totally canine. Nothing mystical or anthropomorphic about her. Just Puppy Magic--which works on everyone! The man and woman work through their romance-traditional initial dislike very believably, especially considering the amount of time they have to do it. Real characters, honest settings and believable dogs add up to a great Christmas story which could be enjoyed any time of year."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked great when I was younger, but...","review":"I love the taste, smell, and feel of this gloss.

Katey Sagal, who is a complete fox, talks trash throughout. She is later raped by several men after being beaten and hung up on a fence.

Instead of just being the victim of a horrible act, she realized the future percussions of what could've happened if she had reported it. Changing from victim to a woman of power, wasn't easy and Tara and the nanny were helping her as much as she would allow.On another note, Jax, Tig and Clay are hiding what really happened to Opie's wife and the killer. Trying to give Opie an outlet for revenge and still manage to keep silent is what bothers Jax. Blaming it on a rival gang has repercussions with the 9er's and the Mayan's. Especially since the Mayans got a tip from an unexpected source.I rated the episode a 5 star, because of emotional and traumatizing issues that were being dealt with and how everyone related to one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Plotlines - Murky definitions of Protaginists and Antagonists","review":"Can't say that this series is not interesting.

I had two non-working lights from before this order; I was able to get one of them to start working by twiddling some of the metal parts inside; the other one may have had dead batteries. In short, they *may* work for a while, but don't count on it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely a talkie","review":"This is an extremely weak film from 1932 presented in a lousy print. The production and the acting are so crude, that one would think that this came from 1929 or 1930. The story is a familiar one: gold-digging girls. Audiences were supposed to be titillated by the sight of ladies in underwear, plus all the drinking, smoking, and conniving. The movie may be of interest to film students, and even Joan Blondell freaks. But it's a solid loser, and certainly not worth the $9.95 price. I'm not reselling my copy; I'm tossing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and introspective","review":"I was hoping for an exciting story or at least some hot scenes, but was disappointed. The story flows well enough that I stuck out the whole book. It does lend some interesting insights into the S/M scene which could serve as an introduction to this genre. The writing is a little better than some other books in this category, but it is still not up to the standards of trade fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I own a firebird 1, 2, and freedom.

I finished the game hoping throughout it would improve. I purchased the game for me and my daughter,she quit after ten minutes. The main character didn't speak and I found it very hard to move him around the screen,especially if other characters were close.I usually enjoy The Adventure Company games,not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another successful volume...","review":"There's not much to say about MST3K - either you love it or you don't.

I've waited for the FUGITIVE ALIEN movies for soooo long! And Frank's last episode is noteworthy as well. (Sadly, I missed it in first runs, as our cable had been taken away.) With this episode, SHOUT! Factory has released most of the major \\"pivotal\\" plot-point episodes that encase the narrative which surrounds our movie riffers, and I couldn't be happier! Please note this is NOT a set for those just learning about/exploring MST3k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really?","review":"Seriously, no MST3k release should be 3 stars. I don't care if the 1 star review guy did what he did as a joke. THREE STARS... IS UNACCEPTABLE! UN... ACC.. EPTABLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Another great collection from Shout!Factory. The episode selection is a big step up over the previous set (vol. XXIII), with two series classics (the Fugitive Alien dualogy), a decent episode that perhaps should've been stronger, given the cheesetastic film (Samson vs the Vampire Women) and another solid, fun, colorful episode (Sword and the Dragon). There's not a weak episode in the bunch. My only complaint is the continued lack of Sci Fi era eps. And KTMAs, for that matter. But this a good, crowd-pleasing set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably My Last MST3K / Shout Order...","review":"Up to this point I have purchased nearly every MST3k boxed set released. I am a huge fan of the show and I'm only missing a couple that went out of print before I started collecting them.Unfortunately for me there seems to be some brand new encryption on this set. And as I use my computer for most of my TV watching needs every disc in this set is not recognized and will not play.Really sucks too as I had hopes of building the entire MST3k library on DVD.

However, I would say his treatment of Scriabin's formidable C# minor etude falls short of the lyrical Romanticism and masterful voicing of my Horowitz recording of this piece, though Kissin rises to the technical challenges admirably. It's an impressive live performance by a young artist, but to call it the best recording of this etude to date is a stretch.It should be pointed out that the track listing shown above and on the CD cover seems to be incorrect in that track number 9 on the CD is not in fact \\"Un Sospiro\\" as listed but is rather Liszt's \\"Waldesrauschen.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Consider Getting This Cd. It's Very Good.","review":"I would Consider this music as uplifting, catchy and devoted. These are the kind of songs that stick in your head. Which is a good thing- so they're there when you need them. The liricks have beautifully developed meaning and the music has an inner beauty of it's own. Ecspecially the songs Un-fazed, I AM, I Need You, So much Of Me, Speak, and Too Many Miles. The Waiting is a great group, if you go for them you'll never get sick of listening to their music. This album is toned down abit but that doesn't diminish it's value. It's still creative and enjoyable. Watch for these guys in the future. They got something special you don't see very often these days, ecspecially in the Christian music realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I am a huge fan of The Waiting; however, this effort was simply disappointing. There is nothing new here. The band definitely needs to grow to stay interesting. Of particular concern was the refrains. The Olsen's work the guitar-vocals very well on the verses but the refrains do not seem to fit with the verses. Examples include the annoying Disappear and All Together."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PORTRAYAL OF SEVERAL TRUTHS","review":"\\"BLACK BELT\\" is a well-done film which reminds viewers of several important historical and martial arts facts. One, the complete and utter barbarism demonstrated through the rise of Japanese militarism during the late 1930s and 1940s. Two, the physical effectiveness of karate techniques and how they can be misused - even after years of serious training by a practitioner. And lastly, the transcendant power of man's inner morality - a trait which always triumphs over evil.The martial techniques are realistic as are the conflicting attitudes shown by the main characters. This is a great movie for both the martial arts enthusiast and the person with a budding interest in the history of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Nice Japanese Movie","review":"I love Japanese movies and I saw this movie with my kids. It was very nice. Although the moral of the story and the nice movements of the fighters were exciting, my son thought that the slow progress of the story made it a bit boring. But if you love Japanese movies, you will get use to these things, and watch it with enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"best karate movie ever","review":"This is one of the best, if not the best movie focusing on karate that I have ever seen or heard of. There is no wirework, no CGI, just real karate by some of the world's greatest practitioners"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Goju Ryu and Shotokan Examples","review":"This movie includes lots of great examples of traditional Goju Ryu and Shotokan kata and combat techniques! No fly by wire type of special effects used. And that makes this movie fun to watch in my opinion. However, the story drifts quite far off base as far as how Karate instructors were used by the Japanese military during the 1930s leading up to World War Two. But the movie wasn't made to be an historically correct documentary of that period.If you are a student of Goju Ryu or Shotokan, or if you like watching demonstrations of great traditional Karate techniques, you should get yourself a copy of this movie for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing realistic Karate Action","review":"Such a great film about Karateka's in Japan.

Then see them live. It only gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I originally purchased this movie with the intent of showing my students the horrible nature of Saddam Hussem, and the awful atrocities that he committed against the people of Iraq. On this front, the movie was successful. Unfortunately, it quickly became a film to justify the American government's military actions in Iraq. The producer's argument, and a poor one at that, is that the military invasion into Iraq is indeed right, since Saddam was such a terrible man. For this reason, I will also use this film to reveal to my students the attempt of some real estate guy to promote his propaganda, and right wing agenda of defending Bush's miserable Middle East foreign policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Build & Destroy album: Disappointment","review":"This album is a total disappointment.

I use two in an SLI setup for a gaming machine and one by itself in a home theater PC. All run smoothly. At first when I only had one, it ran fine for games like Oblivion. Two in SLI mode can handle just about anything out there these days. The one in by HTPC works great with my high definition television. It has no problem outputting at 1920x1080 resolution.Of course, the best thing about these cards, and the reason I bought 3 of them, is that they are absolutely SILENT because they are passively cooled.**One thing people building HTPCs should know is that these cards are not capable of outputting 1080p; 1080i is the max. Although my TV can handle 1080p, I felt this limitation was far outweighed by the the fact that the card is silent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected Novel","review":"It's more of a history book than a novel and it was hard to read.

This is a complete falsehood. I lived in CB for over 25 years. It is an impoverished, dirty, run-down hellish little island with extremely high unemployment and alcoholism. The \\"culture\\" existing, consists of bastardizing the English language and drunken \\"fiddlers\\" hopping around, believing that they are prodigies. This book, while well written, further perpetuates the myths about this island. That is unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Work","review":"MacLeod's stories evoke a sense of place better than most living writers. He does not rend his characters with relentless descriptions of their appearance (in fact, in some of the stories, the characters have no names and we are given little or no hint of what they look like); rather, they seem to emerge from the very landscape the author describes. They are coal miners, fishermen, lighthouse keepers and their wives and children, living in a part of the world that is alternately gorgeous and ferocious. MacLeod recognizes that this is all we need to know of them to understand their lives. What is even more impressive than MacLeod's elegant, understated style is the fact that the stories in Island were published over the course of 30 years, from the late '60s to 1999. Yet the author's voice and the quality of his craftsmanship are so masterful, the span of time between the stories is virtually indiscernible. This is what makes literature classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"baaaaad service","review":"DO NOT BUY THE DALL SHEEP KNIFE AS YOUR ORDER WILL BE CANCELLED AND THEY WILL HOLD YOUR MONEY FOR A MONTH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF KNIVES BUT I BOUGHT TOW OF THESE AND THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER AND HELD MY MONEY SAYING THAT THE ITEM IS OUT OF STOCK AND NOW IT IS SHOWING THAT THERE IS 2 IN STOCK WHO SHOULD I Believe ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Pipe Book Regurgitated And Slightly Updated.","review":"Let me start off by saying that if you own a copy of the Ultimate Pipe Book by RCH, you don't need this book.

Only this time, there is a tobacco section with the authors nonsensical rating scale.That being said, if you don't own the Ultimate Pipe Book, this is worth the read. As other reviewers have stated, there is very good information to be found here, you just have to get past the authors ego and occassional inaccuracies.

The only real downside to the DVD is that while they are showing the live shows, which are great b/c you really get the feel of the live shows, the constantly break them up w/ commentary from band. Ya it is a Documentary but come on, they only have two live songs that are full length and thats in the *Bonus Features* They really need to have a DVD of a full, live show.

I play a bit of guitar and thought how great would it be to build and design a Ukulele that said something about me while entertaining friends, family, my co-workers on stressful days and ultimately myself. The rewards are priceless.The kit is easy to understand. All it takes is a bit of patience in allowing the glue and finish to dry. As long as you attach the neck and bridge properly, you will have a working instrument. Mine took about a week because I wood-burned my design into the guitar body.I play it every day. The tonality is warm. The wood pieces are quality-crafted. I plan on ordering more in the future and experimenting with customization. You can always upgrade your strings & tuning pegs - possibly adding a pickup, etc.Grizzily is the way to go if you want an inexpensive project that offers a priceless experience after completion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uke in a week end","review":"I received this kit as a gift and had it built and playing over the easter week end.It was easy and fun and with a few minor additions I now have a one of a kind addition to my string instrament colection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not great","review":"Bought this for my husband - he says the instructions were vague but all of the parts were there.

Would recommend this book to anyone who is in a situation where they must take someone off life support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Finish","review":"I bought this book after readingLife Support (Santee, Book 1)which I had found free on the kindle. It is the second half of the story of Alexis and her journey of faith and how that is lived out in the court system. She has a hard to deal with client who is not totally honest with her. She has a beginning relationship with the minister who loves music as much as she does. Lastly she is having the most challenging case of her career. How will it end? You don't really know until the last page. This book is a great read that I would recommend after reading the first book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Read","review":"This book drags on and on with the story not really developing. After reading the whole book the ending is pushed into four pages. Terrible. I have never read this author before and I doubt I will again. I was disappointed and would not have finished the book if not for traveling and needing something to read on the airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Another gripping novel by Whitlow, I've yet to be disappointed. Full of suspense, exciting, and amidst all this he shows us our need to rely on God and trust Him.The characters are fabulous, I love the way Whitlow portrayed Rena. It's like he knows these people inside and out and there's always moral issues to deal with.The ending was too quick, I felt it was wrapped up in just a few short pages. Life Everlasting is worth the read though. I give it 5 stars.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not required to write a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Everlasting","review":"Robert Whitlow writes about issues of the day from a Christian lawyer's position.

I'd recommend The Santee Series for men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Confused","review":"I was really impressed with the first book I read from Robert Whitlow, Water's Edge, but Life Everlasting was not up-to-par. To be honest, I'm still not sure what actually happened.Throughout the story, one of the characters, Rena, is caught in lie after lie. Her story keeps changing, bringing with it twists to the overall plot. I was actually enjoying the story and the character (for the most part - I did have a few issues with a few of the characters), but when the book ended, I was left confused and unsure of what the resolution of the plot was.I'm going to have to give this book 2 out of 5 stars. Two weeks after finishing it, I'm still confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six-Dinner Sid","review":"The book, Six-Dinner Sid (Aladdin Paperbacks, purchased in 2008) included an advertisement for Cheerios printed on the inside back cover of the book.

A lovely story which gently presents themes of provision, caring, and cooperation in a memorable way.'Still loved in our household after more than 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy ending to a yummy tale","review":"Six-Dinner Sid is a book (out of a huge collection) that we turn to again and again. The deft watercolor illustrations portray Sid and his quirky -- and unwitting -- co-owners with humor, affection and sophistication. A previous reviewer felt that Sid's problem was that he was lying and sneaking around. I don't believe this is at all the case. The text confirms that the trouble was rooted in the non-communicativeness of Sid's first set of benefactors. The second blockful he adopts \\"talked to their neighbors... And, because everybody knew, nobody minded.\\" Sid's appetite for six-square is satisfied by the happy folks who deliver a pretty potent social statement about urban living. It's an immensely cheering story that never wears thin over repeated readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Cat Story","review":"This is a delightful story of a friendly cat!

Even 'Gigli' is way better and more entertaining than this BOMB! The film is based on a play, and does not translate well to the film medium. It is extremely BORING and TEDIOUS, and essentially takes place in a kitchen, living room, and bar. You will have to sit through an hour and a half of inane dialogue that cures insomnia. Yes, there are innovative visual lighting/panning film techniques, but they don't make up for this miserable excuse for a film. I sat through this with my jaw agape, wondering if it would get better towards the middle or the end. It didn't! Essentially, if you setup a camera in the kitchen of a dysfunctional family, and let it run for 96 minutes, you would get this ridiculous movie. It's no coincidence I found this DVD for three dollars in the 'bargain bin' at a major box retailer! 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"I love Kevin Bacon, but I hated this movie. I tried fast forwarding to see if it got better...but it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This game was pathetically easy. Solving the puzzles involves, for the most part, finding all the objects and the areas where you need to use them - it's not really that hard to figure out which objects you need to use and where you need to use them. The voice acting wasn't really that great, and the story was only mildly interesting. The only reason this game doesn't get a one is because I've played adventure games that are actually worse than this one. There was a monkey puzzle in this game that was really pretty interesting (you had to get the monkey to do something for you after you figured out how to communicate with it), and the graphics, while not excellent, weren't horrible. Still, unless you've run out of games of this type to play, I'd advise getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Incompetence","review":"This game sounded good on the box,a real mystery,exploration,thriller type game,my favourite.What a let down.This game is a complete waste of your time.The story line is very weak,a loony guy wants to sacrifice your girlfriend to make his scarred girlfriend beautiful again.But the main problem with the game was 1-that it was way too short,I finished it in 3 days ,and I'm only able to play 1-2 hours a day!and 2-the dialogue was so cliche and nauseating,absolutely no imagination what so ever. Even the charachters were ugly to look at,no handsome hero or pretty heroine here.Sorry to be so negative,but this game was really awful,I would not recommend it to anyone,not even grandma or junior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road To India","review":"I was not aware that this was a game, I thought it was a travel cd. I did not play the game, it is not what I thought it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Complex Work","review":"This work is an analysis of complex practical endgames that occured in tournament practice. These types of endgames are probably the best for improving your own play, as the simple theoretical endings found in BCE and FCE can only take your play so far. The work is fairly short on words, but I suspect this is done in order to help the author remain objective since the games under discussion are his own. This book expects you to think hard about the game, but will almost certainly improve your play. BTW, Silman and John Watson both suggest this book to students interested in improving their endgame skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays put!","review":"Excellent!

There are only around ten pictures in the entire book (the majority of pages are either text or white space), all of which can be found online in some way or another, though this is hardly the book's fault (but still! Where's the art, people?) - these pictures, a coloured sketch for each character, are then re-used later on in the book to fill another 20 pages or so. Nto good.To be fair to the book, the writing may be amazing. As I know practically no Japanese whatsoever, though, this doesn't help much (and besides - they call 'em ARTBOOKS for a reason!). So do yourself a favour, and trawl t'interweb for pics if you need 'em. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"When i first got this game back in the Summer of 2004 I was amazed at the gameplay. But not only the gameplay was cool, the music got the battles going and kept it alive. I thought that the character were cool and being an amateur artist I drew some pictures. When I found this book I immediately ordered it hoping for some cool drawings. Sadly this did not happen. Not one picture of the Summon Spirits were to be found.

Yes, I know that a central character other than \\"Tomie\\" is always the focus of each film but there were still more airtime on \\"Tomie\\" on the others.

There's lots of little quality issues that keep this from being a nice watch - the second hand doesn't line up with the marks as it sweeps. The date is hard to read once it changes to two characters (10 thru 31) because the first number is partially covered by the face. The tritium is not symmetrically aligned on the watch - the glow over the 12 is offset to the left a few degrees. There is no coating on the edges of the links where they meet - so when the band flexes, you see silver color between the links. I didn't expect the quality of a Rolex at this price, but this feels and looks like a $20 watch from Walmart. I'm really disappointed and I am returning this. Shame on S&W for pushing this junk -"},{"rating":"1","title":"SWW-357TT","review":"Good watch..BUT the quality does leave a bit to be desired...my first one, the tritium dials were not seated properly and when Icalled the manufacture..they told me that wasnt possible.

Now the numbers on the dial are falling off...but I am not willing to go back to customer service for that....Keeps time great and the tritium is wonderful...If they could just fix the other stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch for the money","review":"I just got this watch today. So far I am very pleased. It is very nice looking and the tritium is nice in the dark. I talked to a distributor about this watch before I ordered. They told me that yes the black will tend to wear off this watch. Hopefully, it will only be mainly on the clasp where it hits on a table. You can order replacement bands, or, if you are gonna be hard on the watch maybe the plain stainless would be a better option.

Our most consistent model was a pinless Wagner L606 analog, which looks similar to this Accuscan model. We had hoped that the wider range and dual scale on the Delmhorst Accuscan would work well for both wood and cement siding materials, so we ordered one to try.The needle danced irratically and was generally too lively to get a good reading. I saw inconsistent readings on the materials I sampled. I believe that the unit I purchased may have been damaged or otherwise out of calibration. Due to immediate need for true readings in our factory, I decided to forego a replacement and went back to the Wagner L606 analog which has worked extremely well for us for a long time.

In fact, he is in a class all by himself. His Rossini CD is the best CD released in this new century. This recital is number 2. No one sings Rossini like Juan Diego Flores, only Rockwell Blake comes close. In the new CD, he proves to be the equal of the young Pavarotti in Donizetti and his better in Bellini.

It is not the greatest one ever, nor it needs to be a supreme quality achievment. It just needs a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\" that allows it to reach to our \\"inner musical child\\". This recording did it to me. Not for the quintet, which is superbly played anyway, but for \\"The Shepherd on the rock\\". We have Benita Valente singing the amorous longing of a young shepherd, accompanied by a clarinet and a piano (Wright and the great Rudolf Serkin). A most unusual combination. The effect is terrific. And the accomplished performance is a big plus. I would have given it a 5 stars, but the quality of the recording and the mismatching of the two pieces makes me take one star off. But by all means I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schubert: Quintet in C and Shepherd on the Rock","review":"This is an excellent recording. Of course, both are wonderful pieces of music. Shepherd on the Rock is a beautiful song - probably the last that Schubert wrote before his death. It was written especially for a friend to sing.

I would submit that this would only be true by re-reading the text several times and parsing the information into more natural categories for better understanding.The information was there, possibly, but why waste your time.C++ Primer Plus is an excellent book, with appropriate humor, carries only about 10% bloat, and more reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Enid","review":"Growing up as a child, Enid Blyton books were all I read, I cannot begin to explain how much I love reading and how often I do it.

UNTIL I got the CD a couple of months ago.I was angry!!! Because, like Mr.Doucet, I could hardly hear Hilary. I have since figured out why.One reason fixable and one reason not.The non fixable first. As we age many or most of us lose some of the ability to hear higher notes. I'm 67.The fixable one. What I could hear I loved, so I kept playing with it. Finally I tried leaving the treble volume normal, but reducing the bass a lot. SUCCESS!!! There was Hilary, quite hearable. And the big strong Beethoven bass and middle chords were still big and strong, but didn't bury her. Now I love this recording.I also have copies of her (also Sony) Mendelssohn and Brahams concertos which were (for me) improved by this bass reduction.I hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE CASTS A SPELL WITH HER VIOLIN","review":"She's a wonder this Hilary Hahn. Crowned \\"America's Best Young Classical Musician\\" by Time Magazine, and dubbed as a representative of the next great generation of violinists following in the footsteps of Mischa Elman, Fritz Kriesler, and Efrem Zimbalist, she plays not only with technical prowess but with a dignity and nobility seldom found in one so youthful. Her choice of repertoire belies her years.A graduate of the Curtis Institute, Hahn began performing with major orchestras at the age of 11 and hasn't stopped since. Of her CD Hahn said, \\"I had wanted to record Beethoven for years.\\" It is luminous, indeed.Music lovers who aren't already under her spell will fall in love with this enchanting wunderkind's presentation of these concerto masterpieces.Truly, one of the most breathtaking performances to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance; adequate recording.","review":"I disagree with other reviewers who say that Ms. Hahn isn't miked close enough. I hate it when producers make it sound as though the soloist is ten feet away and the orchestra is in the next county. That isn't the problem here. The balance between soloist and orchestra here is perfect, in my opinion. The problem is the dry sound. Orchestra and soloist both sound stark, as though in a hall with no natural reverb at all. Nor is there much directionality to the stereo sound-- very austere. But all that is mere carping. The performance makes up for everything. Ms. Hahn plays cleanly, warmly, fervently. You can tell how much she loves the music. She makes us love it too. Nice pairing of the Beethoven and the Bernstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats all!","review":"Read it in a day passed the exam, but I don't think it helped not one bit I returned it.

Very handy for equations where you have to solve for y in a y^n form, let the calculator do the iterations and algebra in a second, instead of spending precious time working it out by hand.

The life of Judson has propelled many Christians to a more devoted Christian commitment. Anderson demonstrates her scholarly research in a format that is very accessible.

In addition to sucking the comedic relief out of one the best sitcoms ever written, Delaney does not serve his field of sociology well either.

Her love of this magical island is obvious through this book, and its pictures of Cavendish beach, Lover's Lane, the red cliffs, and the sea, among many other spots is a great way of capturing the magic.

The suction was okay. It was never great but okay. I still had to sweep in the corners before using it. After six months of use, there is no more sunction. I tried taking it apart and cleaning it but that didn't really help. I was also disappointed with the quality of the product. It is made out of cheap plastic and unit that holds the dirty water doesn't seal properly. I was always told by my grandmother to always get a Hoover. The quality has changed greatly over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is the most worthless piece of equipment I have ever used. It has a small dispensing cup, which means you have to keep refilling it. It is supposed to pick up water, but it does not. If I could have chosen zero stars, I would have. I contacted Hoover, and they just left me on the phone waiting for a supervisor. This item is Made in China and is nothing like the quality floor scrubbers Hoover used to have years ago.

Entry hallway, living room, brakfast room, kitchen, laundry room. This machine allows me to scrub them and leave them spotless in about a half hour.Its very dusty here I live and you wouldn't believe the dirt in the discharge reservoir after I'm done (it takes about three refills of the scrub solution and three dumps of the reservoir).One hint - go to your local resturant supply store (Smart&Final; on the West Coast)and buy a gallon of Mr. Clean Finished Floor Cleaner (about $10) Its made for the big industrial cleaners and works perfectly in the Hoover. Smells pretty nice too.If I had to I'd buy another Floor Mate in a New York minute. Probably even upgrade to the new High Performance model."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOVER H300 FLOOR MATE","review":"I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS MACHINE.

We have lots of hardwood flooring in our home and two dogs. I was tired of scrubbing the floor all the time by hand. This machine scrubs the floor pretty well. It vacuums the floor very well especially when it comes to picking up all the dog hair that a regular broom doesn't help with. My only complaints are it doesn't dry the floor very well, and the machine has many parts that have to be cleaned after washing the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"Our new house has tile bathrooms, entryways and a large tile floor in the kitchen. I had been using a Swifter and bought the FloorMate hoping to make scrubbing the floor easier. It does not pick up debris nor clean the tiles effectively. I still use my regular vacuum to \\"sweep\\" the floors prior to using the FloorMate.It cannot reach into the recessed grout lines. The tile downstairs, which has an uneven surface, gets cleaned unevenly. The upperstairs tile, which is flush, gets much cleaner. My biggest complaint is that the suction feature doesn't work well. In the middle of cleaning, it stops drawing up the water. The instructions say to check the automatic shut off, but I've found that it is tempermental. The clean and dirty water tanks don't always snap into position tightly and it doesn't clean corners and at the baseboard intersection well.Its ok, but I've found that I will still need to go behind the FloorMate with the Swifter as it does a better job and will fit around the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"High build quality..no performance","review":"The product overall is very high in fit and workmanship, it just doesn't clean floors. It suctions water perfectly, but the rotating brushes are made for the very lightest of dust or fresh spills. It will not clean a floor like a mop and scrub brush. And it could..but the brushes are flat and not designed for real cleaning. It just scoots over set in dirt. The brushes are more appropriate for polishing, not scrubbing. I guess that's why on the commercial they show wet, fresh mud tracks. It reminds me of a kids toy, not a utility machine. A little more weight on the brushes would help too. I returned mine. It's a very good concept. But in practice, it does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible at sensing humidity","review":"I've had it a week, but it's going back. As the other reviews say, it measures the humidity level at either 30% or 33%, no matter how small the room or how long it's been running. The humidity sensor is useless.The lights are far too bright. My bedroom looks like a disco with the thing on and the night light is almost as bright as my lamp.Others didn't seem to have much of a problem with this, but ours is far from silent, especially when you first turn it on. It seems to quiet down some after it runs for awhile, but it is far from silent.Look elsewhere folks.

When I spoke with the lady at the manufacturer's customer service desk, she said THEY HAD HAD QUITE A FEW SIMILAR COMPLAINTS and they shipped me another one. In far less that a year of use, the replacement did the same thing. Now, I get NO answers to my phone calls and NO call-backs to my phoned messages.

The handle was a pain to assemble. We have all tile floors and I was hoping for a cleaner that would do it all. The thought into the product was good, but it doesn't work as advertised. (I bought the delux model by the way). After cleaning there were marks/streaks left by the solution the vacuum doens't pickup. The little bit of solution it did pick up was obviously dirty, but when I had to wipe down the tile to get rid of the streaks, I found all kinds of more dirt coming off on the paper towel. That tells me it left most of the dirt behind.I hate returning things, so I'll just give this to my step-son, who also has tile floors.I'll stick to the 14\\" sponge mop and divided bucket.Peter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this item today 01/01/10, followed the instructions step by step, and nothing.

It lasted ONE MONTH before the motor burned up. So far it's been in the shop for almost 4 weeks. They say Hoover hasn't sent a motor. I wish I'd returned it to Amazon.

It's just not reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money and time","review":"I bought this floor mate thinking i was going to throw away my mop and broom, but it takes more time for you to put in the solution and actually staying a few minutes on a spot so it can scrub it. Might as well scrub it with your hand it will be faster. And still this machine did not even clean. it just moves the dirt from one side to the other. The difference with a mop is that you mop and squeeze all the dirty water out of it. The difference between a broom is that it is faster to sweep then to try to get a lil piece of trash sucked up by a machine.i do not recomend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"My housekeeper won't use it","review":"My housekeeper won't use it because it doesn't pick up anything and because the baskets keep falling out.

I got it yesterday and I can say that I love this thing! I have two dogs and that kept me busy cleaning the floor in the family room and kitchen, where they usually hang out. I used to sweep, then mop and the floor still looked dirty. Plus, it was hard to keep the dogs out when the floor was still wet. Now with the FloorMate, I use the dry pickup to get the dog hair and loose dirt off the floor, then I switch to wet scrubbing to clean the floor, then switch to wet pickup to dry the floor. It works great! I especially like that the solution going on the floor is clean - I always thought mopping was almost a lost cause, because you are always using the dirty water that you just wrung out of the mop. Tonight I walked around on the floor barefoot, to see if it was really clean. It felt clean and my feet aren't dirty! Yes, I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow! I love it!","review":"After reading reviews here I made the plunge. I have about 1500+ sq. feet of wood floor, and 2 dogs. In the winter (in Seattle) the floor needs cleaned almost every day. This thing makes an easy job of my most hated chore! I was pretty shocked at how dirty the water was after cleaning my *clean* floor. I love how the nozzle snaps off for cleaning afterwards. I agree it would be nice to have a little larger reservoir for water, but then it would be heavier too...I love how light weight it is, and most people probably have smaller floors to clean. If you have dogs, you know how the dog hair piles up every day, and you know how much dust and dirt they bring in...this is a god send! Plus with the wood floor much cleaner, the carpets should stay cleaner too. p.s. I used just vinegar and water in the cleaner and it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes more work out of Housework!","review":"The machine is lightweight but I found that when dry vacuuming it did not glide easily.I had to stop now and empty the recovery tank with the dirt. I then set the machine to wet and found that the brushes did not remove anything that was stuck on the floor( I have two small children who tend to spill). I also had to stop in the middle of the floor to add more solution and water. I did like how it picked up the water, my floors which are ceramic did dry quickly(but they don't do too badly when I flip on the ceiling fan either!)Then comes emptying the dirty water. I found it a bit messy and then I had to clean the recovery tank and the nozzle. I found it took me twice the amount of time to clean the floors with double the work. For the money it is not worth it!I wonder if the people who rated this machine with five stars are employees of Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase a Swiffer instead","review":"I purchased the Hoover Floormate last week and am returning it. We recently built a new house with all hardwood floors and tile. I was looking for a quick and easy way to clean my floors and the Floormate is definitely not what I thought it would be! First the suction is not powerful at all, so you may as well plan on sweeping or using your regular vacuum for this. Secondly, after using the wet scrub, the floor looked good; however, when the floor dried, there were streaks all over (even using the drying action). I immediately picked up my Swiffer and went back over the floor and it looks terrific. Save your money on this one! The cleaning solution and filters are also very expensive and clean-up is time consuming. After all is said and done, I don't see where you are saving any time over mopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"I had high hopes that this item would help me keep my newly-installed ceramic tile floor clean. Not so!! I have seen that people with wood floors do like it, so perhaps that is its niche. But I have to say that it did a dismal job of scrubbing a brand new floor, not one coated with grime as others have suggested. Also, it was unable to pick up the water/cleaner, the suction was so weak. I resorted to my regular mop, which cleaned the floor and picked up the water that this item could not. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs DOWN","review":"Like so many of the other reviewers, I too thought that this product was a waste of too much money. After just a couple of months it no longer produced results. The water container is too small to be effective and the sprayer is a joke.

I tried to use it to clean my kitchen floor. My garage is next to the kitchen. The kitchen floor always has dirty / salty footprints during the winter. I tried running the floormate over the floor to clean those footprints. After a few passes, they were still visible. Next I ran a few passes across them from another direction. A little more of the footprints were picked up, but not all. I double checked the instructions to be sure I had the correct cleaning solution, and made sure all of the switches were in the correct setting for floor scrubbing. I guess man still has not invented a machine that does as good a job as getting down on your knees with a brush & bucket of hot soapy water. If your floor is just a little dirty, then this should work for you. If your floor is extra grimy, then keep the bucket & brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy floor cleaner","review":"Very skeptical buying the Floormate, so read all reviews and decided if it didn't do the job for me I'd take it back.

While it is noisy and the cleaning process slow going, I have to say I am quite impressed! The dry vacuum works fine for me, picking up glitter, hair, sand and dust. I couldn't believe how filthy the water was when I emptied the recovery tank; I don't think I'll ever trust a mop and bucket again!

This machine is amazing! The three features that I love the most are: 1) for the most part you can simulataneously vacuum and mop cutting the usual cleaning time in half; 2) since the machine uses scrubers and clean solution is dispensed with every sweep the floor feels cleaner; 3) it's much easier and less time consuming to fill and empty the machine than to constantly bend over and wrestle with my big dirty mop and mop-bucket. If the cost doesn't bother you, buy this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine But...","review":"Has a hard time with very dirty floor.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it could do better at cleaning the grout around the large, smooth tile.I have yet to find anything it won't clean and vacuum easily off the tile kitchen and dining room floors.I also use Murphy's Oil Soap in the machine and did before when I cleaned with the old mop and scrub routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist time or money","review":"This product didn't clean our floors at all. I spent over 20 minutes on the same 3'X3' area until I finally packed it back up to return. It doesn't have enough clearance during the dry vacuum stage to sweep anything more than hair, and the wet vacuum cycle has too much clearance to even come close to being called \\"scrubbing\\". I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO RINSE THE BRUSHES BEFORE RETURNING THEM!! You'd think after trying to clean a kitchen floor that is home to two large dogs, there'd be at least a little bit of dirt.

I thought I'd bought a floor scrubber, you know, something that would take a day or two of youngsters learning to eat and carry foodstuff around that hit the floor, got stepped in and tracked, and you know what I mean... I wanted something that would make a good job of an entire floor surface instead of spot cleaning. This machine had all the right things going for it as far as I could see...I just could'nt see that it does not work! There's no pressure on the floor where the brushes touch! Go out and buy a mop pad type floor cleaner... a much quicker, easier and efficient means of cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fed up with Hoover products in Jacksonville, FL","review":"Thinking that Hoover made reputable products, I purchased the Hoover FloorMATE. I used it for one year and was not overly-impressed with the cleaning ability, but it was better than getting down on my hands and knees. The machine removed surface dirt off my ceramic floor, but it did NOT remove sticky or ground-in dirt; the scubbing mechanism is very inferior on this product. You must go over the area many times to remove stains. Finally, after the warranty had run out (when the FloorMATE was 14 months old), the machine stopped releasing the cleaning solution. This is a defect that the customer cannot repair, this problem has been noted many, many times in customer reviews but continues. Now I must manually use a squirt bottle to wet floor prior to cleaning. Hoover (Maytag) needs to get its act together. Hoover call center was of no help, why don't they alert users who have registered with them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I out of luck or what","review":"Bought this thing from [another retailer], spent about half an hour assembling it. The scrub part is ok, I was able to get dirt off the floor. The problem is it won't suck the dirty water off. So I had to use the regular mop, what a hassle!

I was very pleased with the way it cleaned although it was cumbersome to change the water and cleaning solution so often. I use the product maybe once a month perhaps two. Since I purchased the product I have had to repair it at least 4 to 5 times and now it is broken again. It is usually the wheel assembly that breaks (just seems to crack because it is made of really cheap plastic). If Hoover could fix the quality of the machine I think consumers would be much happier. When machine is working it does a good job of cleaning the floors which can be witnessed by the very dirty water that shows up in the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am not a mop person, I hand scrub all of my floors. I feel like Mops just move dirty water around. When the Floormate came out, it looked like it would be a great thing. It would actually scrub my floors and suck the dirty water back up, and I wouldn't have to hand scrub every week.We have 2 large dogs with long hair, and 3 kids under 6. I found the vacuum feature to be completely worthless.Not enough suction, clogs easily. I'd still have to use my regular sweeper first before scrubbing. It just doesn't scrub hard enough. We have a white vinyl floor in the kitchen, and it just doesn't get it sparkling clean. If there is a spot of something grimy on the floor, I have to stand there with the Floormate for afew minutes and keep going over it.I still have the Floormate but rarely use it anymore. It's actually quicker for me to scrub the floors by hand, and they get much cleaner. It's okay for between scrubbing touch ups, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting rid of it after less than a year","review":"The Floor Mate seemed like such a great product: my home has hardwood floors and ceramic tile, it is lightweight and it \\"easily\\" scrubs and squeegies floors dry.

Not only that, but I have to stop it just as often to take out the dust collection cannister to remove the lint blockage at the screen.

I was on hold for 30 minutes- literally!! Then someone finally picked up only to just hang up and disconnect the line.

I've only used it to clean my kitchen and bath, so I'm not fully familiar with all the quirks yet. However, I have to admit that I was really pleased with the way it cleaned my floors. My bath has white tiles, which I'm embarressed to admit were somewhat gray with dirt (I hate mopping and can't remember the last time the bathroom floor was cleaned....) - the Hoover cleaned it in seconds and my tiles were gleaming white. Imagine my surprise when I realized I hadn't even turned on the \\"scrubbing bristles\\" yet!!!!!!The machine is a bit heavy and the cord, albeit nice and long, is always in the way.

Would definitely recommend the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Floor are Finally Clean All Day!","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this floor cleaner is not good for picking up dust and dirt. BUT, if you want a wet floor cleaner this one will do the job. I have marble floors in my foyer and kitchen and a dog that is paper trained. When he misses the mark, it has been a real chore to clean up the mess. Now, with my new floor cleaner it is done in a wink. It does remove the water and make the floor dry. If you have an uneven floor a puddle may form, but just go over the spot and it is gone. I don't know if this works well on wood floors, but my marble and tile floors are clean, clean, clean. I could not believe how dirty the water was after using this machine. I did not find all the parts cumbersome to maintain. I keep the soap container filled at all times and just remove the extracted dirty water at the end of each day and rinse the pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"I work in a store with hardwood floors. Dirt is frequently tracked in and dust bunnies multiply like real ones. I've tried a regular broom and a swifter wetjet but that just pushed the dirt around and left dirty streaks.I was VERY excited to try the Floormate after reading all the great reviews. However, it has not solved my problem of finding an efficient way to vacuum and clean the floor.The suction is almost nonexistent as well as the drying function. You're better off letting the floors air dry. It streaks even if you use it as directed and if I take a wet paper towel to any spot just cleaned by the floormate; it comes up dirty. It does not get into corners and has no attachments like a regular vacuum to get corners and it gets clogged easy. It's a decent option if you have few others. We don't have access to a large sink so a mop is out of the question. If we did, I would use a hardwood floor vacuum and a mop. Not the Floormate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrubbing by hand gets the floor cleaner","review":"My back was killing me after hand scrubbing my tile and linoleum floors. According to the reviews, the Floormate was a godsend. However, once I brought it home and used it, I found that it's pretty much useless. It takes longer for me to clean with the Floormate than it does to scrub by hand. When I use the Floormate, I have to keep it standing on a single spot for at least a minute, sometimes more, before I see *any* difference, and even then it's not as clean as it cold be. Whereas if I clean another spot by hand, the dirt's gone in seconds and the floor is dazzingly cleaner than the spot \\"cleaned\\" by the Floormate. The Floormate also doesn't clean the grout in between tiles.A better machine would have a smaller nozzle with spinning brushes, so that the brushes actually touch the floor and can clean the grout and the floor where it meets the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great in an \\"Animal House\\"","review":"This is our third Floormate in about 10 years. The only complaint I have about it is that the lifespan of the machine only seems to be about 3 years.

We have tile floors, six dogs, and eight cats - all indoor animals - two with chronic health problems. Needless to say, someone is always throwing up, peeing, or pooping. We use the Floormate on a daily basis and have never had a problem with it cleaning properly until it gets old and stops vacuuming up the dirty water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but you have to READ THE DIRECTIONS!!!","review":"I have had my Floor Mate for a year: it still works great. I do however agree that it can be a bit challenging sometimes. I have 1250 SQF of Hardwood, tile, and linoleum. You have to read the manual, it says to only fill to the line with water, only use the cup for measuring fluid, and it says clearly \\"move slowly!! Over floor\\" You also have to remember to clean it every time you use it. I like mine and would recommend it for those with a lot of hard floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"I have approx 2k sq ft of floor to clean and it was difficult to finish it all. I read the reviews for the FloorMate, and decided to ignore the bad ones and go ahead and buy one. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was not only good, but much better than I had expected. It gets my floors cleaner faster. The drying and removal of the water makes it better than anything you can do by hand. I used it on vinyl and ceramic tile. I really don't see how anyone could claim it was a bad design, unless they didn't follow the directions. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best floor machine ever!!","review":"I had wanted this product for a long time so when I got it I put it together right away. I went together in a snap and I was up and running in ten minutes. At first I was disapointed because it did not seem to be cleaning anything. Then I emptied the reserve bucket and the water was black! The difference between this and mopping is there is NO MESS! I will never use a mop again! It is so efficient that you don't even realize how well it is cleaning. I cleaned my tile floor ( many crevices and dirty grout ) in twenty minutes and will do it over and over again until I get clean water. My hardwood floors looked restored as promised. The best part about this machine is the immediate dry floors. I have three children under 3 1/2 and they were running around while I was cleaning! No more wet floors to wait to dry and cleaning at night when everyone is sleeping. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to save time and get your floors cleaner than they have ever been!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have taken it back when i had the chance","review":"I bought this awhile ago without reading any reviews of it.Big mistake.It was ok for awhile although it didn't scrub and the vacuum was low.It had acceptible performance for me as my expectations were not high.Then water started to leak out back onto the floor from a water tank while the machine was sitting.That was fairly annoying.Tonight i brought it back out and can't get any vacuum out of the nozzle at all because of the cheap,crappy seal between the water tank and the vacuum line.It's going into the garbage tomorrow as it's not worth the trouble to keep it going.The dirty water tank is too small as well and the float shuts the machine down after only a few minutes of cleaning.I'm going out to look for another one from another company.This machine definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This makes it FUN to clean hard floors....","review":"This Hoover FloorMATE machine is fun to use and cleans the floor excellently! I hate cleaning the floors with a bucket and mop because the mop just puts dirty water everywhere. This machine uses CLEAN WATER to clean the floor and then dries the floor for you. You can easily walk on the clean floor just after washing and drying it. I borrowed a friend's machine and then immediately went out and purchased my own. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This floor cleaner works great on my laminate floors. Then I tried it on tile and it worked just as well on that. If a spot doesn't come up right away, I just put the brush edge over it and press gently on top of the cleaner with my foot and it always brushes hard enough then to get it clean. I've never used the cleaners that were recommended. I've only used warm water with a little white vinegar in it and it cleans very well. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'm not sure how sturdy the plastic on it will hold up. But so far it's been fine, and I don't think it's more cheaply made than anything else on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking foward to recieving this item and when it came I couldn't wait to get it put together. The floor mate didn't pick a thing up on my tile floors. At one point I turned the machine over to see if the vacuum part was working. If I put a piece of dirt up the machine it did take it but not while I was vacuuming. The mopping wasn't much better. I ended up taking a mop to my floor. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly executed","review":"The Hoover Floormate seems like a good idea, but does not quite perform up to expectations. To avoid excess water forming on sealed wood floors, you must continually turn off the brushes when moving forward and then turn them on again when pulling back. Otherwise, pools of water can form and potentially damage the floor. Plus, I found that the soft brushes did not remove some of the stains and scuff marks on the floor. On a positive note, the cleaners that come packed with the unit have a nice smell, but replacements may be hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"total piece of junk","review":"I bought this from a wal-mart and had to return it immediately...this is such a flimsy piece its ridiculous. It doesnt do a good job of vacuuming, plus forget about cleaning the grout, never gonna happen. The suction is so low and the sound is almost like a boeing 747...save your money and go for the good old mop"},{"rating":"2","title":"The PERFECT Floor Cleaner","review":"Have had my floormate for two months now and love it! I have approx. 2000 sq. ft. of tile and hardwood floors. This machine leaves my floors with a streak free shine, which you can't get with a mop. No back aches. Fast, convenient and so worth it! I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"its outside right now by the trash can","review":"this was a big waste of money. my brother teased me so much about buying the crappiest home appliances. I was so fed up with the product, I just had to stop you guys from buying it. As I am writing this, the Floor Mate is outside next to my trash can.pro. nonecon. doesnt even pick up water. the button to release the cleaning solution doesnt even lock in place, you have to pump it the entired time you're cleaning. My hand gets tired just cleaning a small area. imagine having to pump gas with out that lock holding it down. the scrub doesnt even work, even passing it 3,5, 100 times over a spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome and overpriced. Save your money.","review":"Cord is too short. Handle does not fold down far enough to reach under tables. Dirty water reservoir is cumbersome to open and empty and does not hold enough. Be prepared to spill dirty, nasty water all over the clean place while trying to remove the top of the dirty reservoir. Clean solution tank doesn't hold enough to do my kitchen in one fill. Brushes do not reach grout in the \\"valleys\\" between tiles. I sometimes have to push on the base with my foot to get some \\"elbow grease.\\" On/Off switch is located on side, it should be located on handle making it cumbersome to operate among 4 switches total. This machine is an engineering flop. I regret buying this product. Hopefully Hoover would consider redesigning this one, or drop the criminal price for the product dramatically. If it worked well, I'd see the price fit. Maybe I just have too much house for this dinky machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I was hoping it was good but never thought it would be fabulous. I got it an hour ago and I have a huge house and did 3 giant rooms in 30 minutes to a sparkling shine. I am impressed. The black dirty water really convinced me it was definetly working. Try it you wont be sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover H3000 Floor Mate Hard-Floor Cleaner","review":"This product works very well for mopping the floor. It does take some more work when trying to clean up spills that have dried on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this if you have tile","review":"The machine leaves water at the grout line, I ha use a mop to clean the floor after using the floormate. I have stopped using this. I hope someone makes a machine to clean tile"},{"rating":"1","title":"hardwood floors are smeary & streaky","review":"It did a good job at dry vac on my hardwood floors, but the wet scrub and wet vac left my floors very smeary, streaky and dull. It really looked terrible. It's also pretty slow going - you have to go over each area several times to feel like dirt has been picked up. I'm returning it, hoping to find a good hard floor vacuum to replace it and go back to bucket & rags for wet cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MACHINE IS FABULOUS!! I WILL NEVER USE A MOP AGAIN!!","review":"No more mop & pail, scrubbing with hands on stubborn spots. The Floor Mate does it all, and continuously uses clean water! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to anyone who has any kind of hard flooring in their house. My floors have never been so clean. It's as easy as pulling out a vaccuum to use and has cut the cleaning time in half. The suction of the dry pickup is excellent and the floors dry in to time after cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Thinking that Hoover made reputable products, I purchased the Hoover FloorMATE. I used it weekly for one year and was not overly-impressed with the cleaning ability, but it was better than getting down on my hands and knees. The machine removed surface dirt off my vinyl flooring, but it did NOT remove sticky or ground-in dirt; the scubbing mechanism is very inferior on this product. Finally, after the warranty had run out (when the FloorMATE was 14 months old), the machine stopped releasing the cleaning solution. This is a defect that the customer cannot repair, so it was going to cost me $75-100 to get it back in service. No thanks! I went back to my $20 Swiffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pergo Floor Paradise","review":"Just brought it home last night and after reading the easy instruction booklet, found it simple to use on our 1300 sq.ft of Pergo. I must say it seems much cleaner than my previous method of bare floor vacuuming, mop and bucket and Mr. Clean. Plus it dries so fast. Mine leaves a puddle of water when I switch it off, so I wonder if flipping the switch back to dry vacuum only will prevent that from occuring. My husband thinks it takes too long but does like that it really has alot of suction. Of course, since I do that particular chore, I love it. Stay out of the water trail to avoid your darling footprints on the already dried floor...."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last, Clean Wood Floors","review":"I received the Floor Mate from my Mom for Christmas this year and have used it several times with excellent results. So far my usage has been on hardwoods only. I have two shed-happy white dogs and hardwoods in my kitchen. My routine had been to vacuum with an upright, hand sweep under the cabinets and then mop the hardwoods. Even with all of this, my floors would still prove dirty if wiped with a damp paper towel. Now I have one appliance which accomplishes all three steps (the base is low enought to fit easily under the cabinet toe-kick) and it also passes the paper towel test!! I LOVE this machine, but haven't tried it on tile yet (both of my bathrooms have tile floors). Hopefully I will be as pleased with the results on tile."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mop would be easier","review":"I could not have been more disappointed with this product. I have mostly hard wood floors and some ceramic tile. I was first surprised by how hard it was to push - I felt like I was pushing something very heavy. The scrubbers do not work. I have toddlers so I often have sticky juice spills etc.. and the area was still sticky and still spotty even after I went over a spot several times. A mop would have taken much less effort and done a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Job too large for the machine","review":"Purchased late in 2001 for cleaning Porcelain Tile (approx 1300 sq. ft.). Was trying to improve over using sponge mop. Solution container and pick up container too small. Round bristles used for scrubbing leave swirles that can be seen after floor is completely dry.The current process I have settled on necessitates dispensing cleaning solution and scrubbing with Hoover scrubber (70's vintage, pickup no longer works) then using floormate to pickup solution and dry floor. It does a nice drying job.I now realize, I probably should have purchased a new F5300 floor scrubber instead of the floormate, but it's hard to justify now that I have the floormate machine setting there. If I had kept the box, I would have tried to resell it. It would probably do a fine job on a small ceramic or tiled floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best cleaning product ever!!!","review":"When a friend told me about this product, I had to buy it!!! When it arrived, I instantly put it to the test and it passed with flying colors. It is very lightweight and easy to operate. It did an excellent job of cleaning the floors, and besides that I now don't have to use dirty mop water on my tile floors since the floormate dispenses only clean solution. This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for marble floors...","review":"Read alot of reviews before buying and bought locally just to insure ease of return if I didn't like it. Will definitely keep it. My marble floors have never looked so good. Did well on the kitchen tiles too, but as they aren't smooth like the marble, didn't dry completely. Have always hated mopping and felt I wasn't really getting the floor clean...the dirty water receptacle proved that, disgusting!! Haven't tried it on the hardwood yet as I'm not certain it's sealed well enough. Good product, pricey though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failing grade in all subjects","review":"A multitude of problems:1) the humidity readings never go above 25% even in a bathroom with a hot shower running,2) unit shuts off regularly in the middle of the night3) small water tank relative to overall size of the machine, and4) very expensive relative to machines that do the same job with less lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great. :(","review":"The one thing I DO like about the FloorMate is that you're not constantly mopping with already-used (aka dirty) water. HOWEVER... I find both the wet and dry pick-up to be, well, nonexistent (this thing doesn't suck up ANYTHING). In addition, the scrubbing brushes don't seem to touch the floor enough to be effective (does anyone possibly know of an adjustment I could make, here? Is there some kind of Hoover secret to operating this thing?). I find that after going over a dirty spot on the floor several times with the FloorMate, I am STILL required to clean the spot by hand. What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I have 2 large dobermans, a dirt filled back yard and a white ceramic kitchen floor. Needless to say, I was washing my floor on a daily basis. This floor cleaner does the job. It may not be the best vacuum cleaner and it may be loud, but it cleans my floors without my having to get on my hands and knees. It even cleans the baseboard. I read many reviews and decided to try it. Of all the cleaners I have tried, this product is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works reasonably well","review":"This particular unit looked like it had been a floor model or previously used, but it works fine. The brushes don't get tough spots off the floor and don't quite reach the grout, but it sure beats scrubbing the floor yourself. I like that Hoover doesn't require their own soap-solution so you can use pretty much anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Hoover!","review":"I just bought this item for myself as a early Mothers Day present. I came home and tryed the vaccum part first. It was ok, just like any other vaccum. The next day when I went to use the mop function on my hardwood floors, I was amazed! I couldnt even stop with the family room, I had to move on to the dining room. Needless to say I had to do all the wood floors. ( which is almost all my apartment- except bath and kitchen.) I have never felt that they were really \\"clean.\\" I could mop with the mop and bucket,and then watch as my 16 month old and 9 year old played and their socks still turned black from the floor. Not now, now they are clean, shiny and it smells clean too. ( an amazing feat with 2 dogs, 5 pups and 2 kids( boys at that) I just got done cleaning the bath and kitchen tiles, and once again clean and sparkly. I agree the oder is strong, but thats a clean smell and I love it!!!!!! I would highly recomment this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little noisy but my floors are really clean.","review":"I have 2 dogs and 2 kids and they make a real mess on my kitchen floor. This machine is god sent in many ways. My only complain is that it's a little noisy and pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"I bought this because cleaning my tile floors is a dreaded task. This machine works for VERY superficial cleaning; otherwise, it seems like you'd practically need to stand on where the brushes are, because they don't touch the floor. I have read similar reviews, but because there are so many positive reviews I bought it anyway. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought a Hoover Floormate because I hate mopping floors and thought this would be great. I got it home and used it twice and it was awesome. By the third use, the machine wouldn't suck up the water. I took it in for repair and the repairman serviced it but couldn't find anything wrong with it. I got it home used it once and it was fine. The next time I used it the floor was sopping wet again, so I just mopped up the mess with my mop. The next time I turned it on, smoke started pouring out. This machine had only been used 6 times. It is a piece of junk. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"I bought this product quite a while ago, thinking it would be the best to clean my floors. Mine was refurbished and it doesn't work right. It doesn't scrub the floors or pick up the dirty water. I do better with a Swiffer WetJet than with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for those with kids","review":"I recently purchased the Hoover Hard Floor Cleaner and I absolutely love it. I have two young children and it seems that more food ends up on the floor than in their mouths. This cleaner really picks up the sticky mess on the floor and dries it instantly, so I don't have to worry about my little ones sliding and getting hurt. I truly recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy way to keep your hard floors clean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I pray you read this first!","review":"We just purchased our dream home, an old church, with hardwood in every room! I was accustomed to carpet in my apt. So new that the job ahead was going to be a new experience! Off we went to get this evil machine! It does not suck up anything! From hair/fur, forget granular dirt! Sometimes only one of brushes work, you end up having to go over and over manually in the same spot to get a stain off the floor, and you think pushing a mop is laborious! DON'T leave the dirty water in there for more than a day, the smell, grim, and creatures that grow in the trap! Plus they of course want you to use only recommended product, and that&#146;s gets pricey. So it's back to Murphy Oil, water and vinegar, and old fashioned elbow grease for me...while that 200$(at the time) machine sits in the corner, reminding me that although cleanliness is next to godliness, a fool and her money are soon parted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"I bought this Hoover H3000 Floor Mate Hard Floor Cleaner bec/ of the raving reviews I read about it. I am amazed and cannot help but wonder if this has an evil twin that looks the same... but isn't?This did NOT pick up anything with the vac pick up feature. I don't think dust would have easily been picked up. This appliance did not clean good at all and was more trouble to clean and put up than it was to use. I wouldn't have minded more trouble putting away... IF a great job was done... but that wasn't the case.I GAVE mine to my sister and she seems to have the same view I do of it!Great disappointment and I took the only gift money I had to buy it:( This was when they first came out so maybe changes have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't do ceramic tile","review":"I don't know what type of tile these other reviewers are referring to, but we have ceramic tile that is slightly rough (pits and plateaus and valleys) and it doesn't even COME CLOSE to getting into the low areas. Nor does it even touch the grout. I even removed the housing thinking I could put a little muscle into it, but the heads float and therefore you can't get any pressure onto the floor. (Probably a liability thing with Hoover, they don't want it to damage your floor). I got this for Christmas and I was sooo excited I tried it that same day. I ended up in tears since I SOOO wanted a solution to cleaning my floors that didn't involve 3 hours on my hands and knees using a hand held steam brush. If you have toddlers like I do, and your floor is not completely smooth, pass this one up. I'm going to get a Hoover FloorMax which actually looks like it will get into the lower portions of my tiles. The floormate is simply too wimpy for floors that are not completely smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum? I wish!","review":"I had high hopes for this product, but once it was assembled, it didn't pick up anything on my kitchen floor-- not dirt, not pet hair, not the little pieces of grass the dogs track in. Since that's why I purchased it, I can only give this cleaner two very disappointed thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Used it once on my laminate floor and fell in love with it. Must be a well kept secret. My floor was about 16 months old and I had cleaned it as instructed with the spray cleaner and mop. It was starting to get a dull finish to it. The first time I used the Floormate, it shined like new again! May use the spray and a rag for little touch ups but the Floormate was simple to use and did such a fantastic job, that I would use it for all my needs. I recommend it to anyone with a vinyl, wood, tile, or laminate floor. I wish I would have had it for my old vinyl floor. I'm sure the brushes would have cleaned the indentations beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hard floor cleaner I've seen","review":"I have Congoleum throughout my house, so I need a LOT of cleaning.THis machine does it all.

I have not had, what I feel, are clean floors, with just mopping. THe water gets dirty right away and the floors look it.I have several dogs so those spots of food that get smashed or water that is dripped is always SHOWING up.This machine is quick and easy and can clean wet or dry.I am also in a powered wheel chair and so this makes cleaning VERY easy for me.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"We just purchased the Hoover Floor Mate and LOVE it. What a wonderful machine. Dry vacuum picked up all the crumbs, dog hair, etc. The scrub brushes cleaned the floor perfectly and sucked up the left over water/solution so the floors were dry in under 2 min.

Not only did it not perform as promised, when I tried to clean the dirt sucked into the roller area, I couldn't get it out. Then it started making a squealing noise every time I turned it on. Hoover has lost their TRIED AND TRUE product status with me. This brand name will be the LAST one I look at for future purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Purchased to clean our real wood floors. Performance was quite poor. This Floormate did no better job than a regular mop. In addition, the scrubbers left marks on the wood. I had to use our \\"Swiffer\\" to clean up the marks. The general idea is good. It's lightweight, easy to add the solution and easy to empty.For the money, your much better off purchasing a $25 Swiffer - it does a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The Hoover Floor Mate doesn't work well on tile floors, as the brushes don't reach the grout.

I was surprised at how much dust and dirt it picked up on my wood floor that I had missed with a regular mop. I wish the tank was a little larger, though.

Overall I would recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble than it's worth","review":"This is a good idea but it could be so much better. The tanks are small so plan on several trips to the sink to dump and refill for each room. Consider this inconvenience if you have floors to clean that are not near a bathroom. The solution is quickly used up so have more on hand before you start. This machine is not for deep cleaning. Despite many repeat applications, heavily soiled grout did not come clean. The cord is long but I couldn't keep it out of my way. I would like bigger tanks, bigger brushes that clean uneven surfaces, a low-suds cleaning solution, and a switch to release the handle in a more convenient spot. Smooth tile was easy to clean but uneven surfaces and grout required lots more effort. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floor Mate manufacture upgrades","review":"All in all a good machine, but I have found that I need an accessory of a harder scrubbing brush.

It vacuums and mops at the same time, so I eliminate pulling out two different machines and unwinding and winding their cords up. Mundane. There are two problems I have with the machine though. 1). The brushes should be larger in depth, I have to move the machine back and forth several, several times in order to get some hard spot of dirt up. 2). You have to push light to medium hard to push it forward when mopping unless you use your trigger handle to spray more liquid on the floor. Other than that, it vacuums, mops and squeegees all at once.

The scrubbing is not all it's cracked up to be, the suction sucks-or in this case, doesn't really suck and is poor. It did not suck up the water in the grout lines in my tile floor, so what's the point? I am returning it and also returning to using my swiffer and broom vac-takes the same amount of time using muscle compared to filling and emptying the unit. JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this because I have laminate and tile flooring all through my house and I was tired of lugging a mop and bucket. This machine was very dissapointing because 1) the cord is so long it get in the way, 2) it doesn't hold much water so it constantly needs to be refilled/emptied, and 3) it drips water everywhere. All in all I wish I had my money back so I could invest in a good hard floor vacuum and go back to just mopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"My husband and I bought the Floor Mate after quite a bit of research to use on our linoleum floors. We were so excited when we brought the Floor Mate home. It was very easy to put together and very easy to operate. However, we soon noticed that the Floor Mate just didn't work. It didn't scrub our floors at all. It would lay down cleaning solution and just suck it up. I would have to make numerous passes over dirty spots to get them up (if they even came up at all). Because I was continually making numerous passes over the dirty areas, I went through the cleaning solution very quickly. The sample bottle (8oz) was used up the first time we used the Floor Mate to clean our kitchen. It's quicker for me to just vacuum the floors and then mop them the old fashioned way. I wish the Floor Mate would have worked better than advertised. I hate mopping my floors, but for now, it seems to be the best way to get them clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the scrubbing action???","review":"If you have a floor that is already mostly clean...as in a Swiffer WetJet could make it nice, then the Hoover Floormate will make it just as nice PLUS dry the floor as you go.However, if you have a dirty linoleum laundry room that a dog calls home, this product will do nothing for you! I got my floormate last night and immediately went to work on the floor. I saw no change in the dingy color so I tried going slowly; I tried \\"soaking\\" some spots; I tried everything.Finally I got on my hands and knees and stuck my fingers under the rotating brushes while they were on. It felt time a soft-bristled toothbrush on my hand!!I ended up scrubbing the floor with a scrub brush on my hands and knees and got it sparkling white in about 45 minutes. I used the Floormate to suck up the suds and dirty water that was left on the floor as that is all it is good for.I will be returning it promptly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wet cleaning ability.","review":"Very good at wet cleaning and drying floor. The vacuum cleaner feature is not great, and the capacity of the canister is small, so that you need to put in fresh cleaning solution / dump out dirty water every 5 minutes or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit better than a vacuum and a Swiffer","review":"Based on a couple of the glowing reviews I'd read here, I expected more. It's an ok machine. It's far from a professional piece of equipment, but I suppose the price reflects that.Pro: It dries the floor quite well; light weight.Con: Small cleaning fluid reservoir, requiring relatively frequent attention; brushes don't scrub hard enough, and don't reach down to grout; I'd like it if the cleaning foot were wider; doesn't handle much dog hair before needing to be cleaned out; yet another piece of equipment to store.I'd give it a \\"C\\", but I have to admit -- I'm keeping it. My wood floors aren't as clean as I'd like when I'm done with the Floor Mate, but they're pretty clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on textured surfaces","review":"Let me say that this thing does suck up water and leave the floor almost dry. The problem I had was that the brushes don't make very good contact with my tile floor... We took it back after 2 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost a 5","review":"I love my hoover floor mate hard floor cleaner. My hardwood floors are sparkling after I finish cleaning them! This product is lightweight and easy to use. The only reasons it didn't get a 5 is because it is very loud (can't use it while the baby is taking a nap), sometimes it doesn't suck up all the water on the floor (haven't figured out why yet) and when I turn it off and put the handle upright, a puddle is left under the machine on the floor. But these little problems don't make it worth getting on my hands and knees to scrub the whole first floor. I recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design!","review":"Overall I like this item, however there is a serious flaw in the design that makes me less likely to use it on a regular basis. I also would not buy another one unless this flaw was fixed. The receptacle that holds the dirty water is the culprit. It is near impossible to remove the lid; you will struggle and struggle until your fingers are sore. It is frustrating and just overall a poor design. I don't understand how Hoover could have overlooked this obvious problem. If you buy one of these, the first time you use it and attempt to clean out the collection receptacle, you will certainly recognize the serious problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"mom crazy about clean floors","review":"I love my floormate i have had it for 6 months and it is awesome!!! Gave it the damp cloth test and it was clean!!! My floor was never clean like that after I had mopped. even when I mopped the floor several times. I usually use just hot water and works btter than bleach. I recommend it highly. Only one complaint it is a vac so it doesn't get the nooks and crannies so every now again you have to get on your knees and clean aroung the baseboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed buyer","review":"I was really looking forward to using this item and saving lots of time, but I was thoroughly let down. First of all it does not vacuum up the water very well, I can do it faster with a mop. The scrubbing action is very poor and doesn't clean any better than my brush on a handle! It has been sitting in my laundry room just taking up space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"I purchased the Hoover Floor Mate when my old Hoover floor cleaner gave up the ghost. The old model was so extremely efficient I did not think I could live without it. Unfortunately, this new Floor Mate is not as good as the original. While it does put down cleaning solution and vacuum it up, it does not clean. I have all tile flooring. The majority of it is textured. The brushes of the Floor Mate are permanently set in position so only the raised relief portion of the floor was cleaned and I had to get down on my hands and knees to clean the lowered part of the tile pattern. If you have perfectly flat floors, it will probably work. It didn't for me and I returned the machine. It is a shame that Hoover replaced a perfect floor cleaning machine with an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read with puzzlement some of the excellent reviews of this product, as my experience has been just the opposite. The product does not clean, does not pick up dirt well, and tends to simply smear dirt over the floor. It is cumbersome to use and the cleaning product refills are expensive and hard to find. I've used the machine 3 times now and each time I get angry with myself for purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I really tried to like this machine. I liked the idea of not having to mop anymore, but it just doesn't work. It squirts water on the floor and picks it up, but the brushes barely touch the floor and it's no good at all for removing marks of any kind. If there is anything sticky on the kitchen floor, forget it. In addition, you have to run over the spot you just squirted the water on several times to pick up all the water, so it's very time consuming. I can get out my old-fashioned sponge mop and get the job done in half the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Machine","review":"This machine worked great the first couple time we used it, but then the problems started. First the scrubbers didn't work. Then a defective squeegie made the machine make an awful howling noise. Next the wheels broke. Finally, it started spitting out dirty water because of a clogged hose. Beware, the monthly repairs cost more than the original price of the machine. Our Hoover vacuum clearner had similar repair issues, but lucky we purchased a maintenance plan with that one. We've learned our lesson and won't be buying from Hoover again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must Have!!","review":"I got this and was absolutely thrilled at the job it does! As a mother of 2 children (4 and 1) and over 500 sq. ft. of laminate, I was sweeping and mopping every day! The Floor Mate was truly a God send. It scrubbed up everything from squished banana to dried spilled juice! When I used to damp mop my floor, it dried dull and streaky. The Floor Mate however put an end to that, my floors look lovely! Not to mention that it has saved my back!! Another plus in my book, is that clean water is always being put on the floor, you are not just spreading your dirty mop water around. The squegee is ingenious, a dry floor as you go, not more foot prints or risk of someone falling! I love the Floor Mate, and I too would replace it in a minute if something were to happen to it!! I highly recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a half stars really...","review":"I use my floor mate on vinyl kitchen flooring and I have to agree with the positive comments already given by the other reviewers. I won't bore you all to tears by saying the same thing in some new way. What I do want to mention is that I only give this thing 4.5 stars because the dry vacuum mode is not all that great. If you have a few crumbs in the middle of your floor this will pick them up no problem. If you have a few crumbs around your baseboard or in the corners (as many of us do), this thing will drive you mad as you try unsuccessfully to pull those crumbs. Eventually I give up and sweep with a broom first and then use the scrub/wet vac settings to produce a very clean floor. Its a small complaint but one I though worth mentioning. If the vacuum power on this thing were a bit stronger, it would easily be 5+ stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Herb's experience with the H3000","review":"I found the H3000 to be complicated, too heavy and difficult to operate. Too many parts, not enough results. Did not get close to edges and corners. Brushes hardly touched the surface. It did get up a lot of dirt from ceramic tile, but preparation and cleanup of equipment is excessive. I packed it carefully with large instruction book and spare detergent and gave it to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't want this if it were FREE","review":"This machine was a huge disappointment. First of all, there's hardly any suction to vacuum dry debis. I ended up using my regular carpet vacuum. Next, it doesn't scrub. I went over dried spilled coffee 8 times before it disappeared. Tougher stains I had to remove by hand. The so called sqeegee does a lousy job of picking up the dirty water. I ended up drying my floor with a dry mop. This thing is a piece of junk, and I'm packing it up for a return. If I could give this a minus rating, I certainly would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water everywhere!","review":"Though I usually don't write reviews, I thought it worthwhile to point out the problem I had with this product: It no longer has enough suction to get the water from the floor into the receptacle. Instead it would suck up water for a bit, then deposit it somewhere else in a puddle. I can't return it since the warranty has expired; I was the only one in the household using it, and I usually didn't have floor duty, so it didn't see all that much use. I cleaned all the parts I could get to; I suspect that somewhere along the suction route something has degraded or broken loose. Given the other reviews here of this nature, I don't really wish to spend more money getting it fixed, though, so back to mops I go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it had cleaned the floor...","review":"Alas, the Hoover Floormate does not cut the mustard...or clean the floor. It does leave a filmy residue. The tanks also seem rather flimsy.We are not talking major dirt here; merely some dog drool on a laminate floor. After hours of helping the little brushes whiz over the area and dutifully squirting the enclosed cleaning solution, the floor looks the same, but dingier.The instructions direct you to overlap each stroke 1\\" to avoid streaking. Do he math and figure how long it would take to clean a 30 x 24 room. Unless you are cleaning a closet, this would mean devoting your life to a cleaning machine. Assuming it could eventually remove the dirt.Walmart took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent an entire Sun. afternoon cleaning up behind this thing.","review":"It spins just fine. It scrubs just fine. It puts water all over your $10,000 bamboo floor. And then, it is \\"Oh my God\\", because it does not pick up the water. When you have to jump and run to buy mops, instead of settling in for your day of rest, the fun went out of that little monster real quick.Hoover will get more of these back, but 95% of people will just quietly quit using the things and never report what a flimsy little, plastic, snap together, made in China, farce this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucy Ricardo \\"Handy Dandy Vacuum\\"","review":"I read all the reviews and ordered one, I just didn't have the same glowing results. It didn't suck up fluid at all, the vacuum never sucked only blew out air and cleaning solution and I returned it. Not for everyone I guess :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic....... Don't buy !!!","review":"I bought the Hoover H3000 Floor Mate as I have hardwood floor and Tile in my house. Like a \\"smart\\" buyer I read thu all Amazon reviews on the product. Some of them did caution me against this product. I guess when you are favourably predisposed towards something, positive reinforcement has a mutiplier effect.I should have heeded to the bad review.Bad product. Doesn't even vacuum properly. Too complicated to operate, with 2 kinds of fluids. I think the biggest drawback is that before you use the scrubber, the floor has to be completely clean. Which, unfortunately is not possible as this product is unable to perform even simple vacuum fuction. Pile of dust, debris remains inspite of moving the machine over it multiple times.Do yourself a favor. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought the Floor Mate because 95% of the flooring in my house is hard surface. It has been a great disappointment to me because it is so hard to use and doesn't do a very good job. I cannot use it on the hardwood floors because I am afraid water might get down under them (they are very old - about 150 years old - but have been refinished recently.) I have a cat so have to stop and empty the recovery tank every few minutes because the cat hair clogs the filter. It doesn't mop well and doesn't suck up the water well at all. I find the recovery tank very difficult to get off and put back on. All in all, it is a very poorly designed appliance. I wish I could take it back where I bought it, but I have had it for six to eight months, even though I have only used it three times. I sent a letter of complaint to the Hoover Company but didn't receive an acknowledgement from them that the got (and read) my letter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soaked..","review":"This thing left my moms 3,000 dollar kitchen floor wet..

You will still have to mop and hand scrub marks.However, It does do an excellent job of vacuuming up the mop water, leaving the floor almost completely dry.In my opinion, that is NOT worth the expense. I'm sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for smooth surface floors","review":"Most of my tile floors are textured, and I'm disappointed at the Floor Mate's performance on them. The brushes aren't deep enough to get into the grooves, and the grout doesn't get clean.Since this is a Hoover, I thought the quality would be a lot better. I have had this cleaner for four months, and already the liquid release is not working correctly. And, there are no Hoover Factory repair depots near me, and no vacuum repair outfits work are authorized to work on Hoover products.Also, the cleaners cannot be found in the rural area where I live.If the quality were better, I could recommend this for smooth surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it, the reviews helped","review":"I wanted this thing for Christmas so bad and got it. I am so happy with it. I read the reviews and most were good but some were bad which prepared me for some of the features. This is quick drying so I don't have to rope off the kitchen and works with little effort. I hate to mop and I was using this thing on christmas day and the next. I used to mop about once a month, now I am using this 2 times a week. It does use a lot of cleaner but since I have a dog and am using it quite a bit I have started to just use a bleach solution and it works great. You may have to work a little to get near the edges and high traffic areas but remember this is not industrial. The time saving is the best part. I love it and am so glad that Hoover has made my life so much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floor mate, great or not?","review":"We just purchased this machine in ... At first it was the greatest thing ever. Now after using it for about three months it is loosing it's touch. I'm already searching for replacement parts and I still have to srub the floor by hand. After using the machine on the floor for a period of time it leaves a build up of dirt that has to be scrubed by hand. I was very impressed at first but now very disappointed.

It intially worked reasonably well for cleaning, although the dry vacuum function was never very good. As time went on, it became less and less effective. I don't want to POLISH the dirt, I want to remove it! The scrubbing brushes just aren't strong enough to clean up anything oher than very light or loose dirt. Forget stains or dried on messes. It can't touch them. I eventually tossed it in disgust.

I have a dog with muddy paws, and white(ish) linoleum in the kitchen that she comes in through. When it rains (or has rained) she comes in and puts muddy paw prints all over the kitchen floor. No problem! I keep this in the kitchen, it's already plugged in, so I pull it out, run it, and within 5 minutes the floor is clean again. Not just wiped up, but actually scrubbed clean even with cold water. I have problems with my knees, so getting down and scrubbing is not something I would do. This vacuum has enabled me to do things I can't physically do.Hot water does seem to work better on tough stains, and I have found it is better to use my Dyson \\"Animal\\" (available at www.amazon.com, target, sears, and a few other places - search for \\"Dyson Animal\\") vacuum to get the dog hair and other debris up first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable Failure","review":"This machine was a huge disappointment. As a vacuum I found it almost completely useless as it rarely did a complete job of vacuuming anything, which I had to remedy by sweeping the floor afterwards (some timesaver). I found that the brushes did not make adequate contact with the floor even when I used the toughest brush and they often failed to clean \\"stuck on\\" spills requiring me to get on my hands and knees with a scrub sponge. The worst part is after just a few uses it simply stopped working. It's suction became intermittent and I finally just gave up on the stupid thing.

The Hoover DID take a bit more time than slopping a mop and bucket around, but it was certainly worth it.

The one caveat is the twisting of the wrists which hurts a little sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, these are baaad","review":"By bad, of course I mean good.These things are terrific. I've been using them a month. Can do 45 straight push ups already. I am seeing improvement in my upper body. The motion you get with these are wide-ranging. I also appreciate that the handles are thicker and studier than other similar push up grips. But these are in a class of their own. Get them and you'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY REALLY DO WORK","review":"After only 2 weeks of workouts, i can already see an increase in size and tone of the muscles it works. Abs, triceps, biceps, back, chest, shoulders. The perfect pushup has also increased my bench press.

This product is very durable, smooth, and cool to show off to people. I do a routine 2 to 3 times a week with these and they kill me every time. They say that you can do 1/3 of the pushups you normally do when you use these, and I think that's about accurate. Doing 25 is an impressive feat. I think this product is great for anyone who wants to have sweet pecs.I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles too big, not very stable feeling","review":"I'm 5'10 approx 260lbs, so I need a sturdy device for push ups. I tried these because they were on sale locally and the store I went to didn't have any standard push up bars. I took them back after a day. The handles are too big, you better have a massive sized hand to use these. Not only that, I want stability in my push up bars - these do not feel stable because you can't lock them in place..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, cheap quality","review":"I got this product as a gift. The twisting motion does help you work out the right muscles. It's pretty neat. And the grips easily collapse for traveling.However, the craftsmanship is not high quality. It's not worth more than $15 tops. One grip broke just after 2 weeks of use! I'm not a heavy guy at all. And I didn't drop it or knock it around. The lower plate just came off! And since it only comes is pairs, I'll have to buy a new set now."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard on the hands","review":"well made but way too hard on the hands, needs padding and i am not interested in wrapping in towels. i use the iron gym on the floor for pushups."},{"rating":"2","title":"eh?","review":"I just bought one yesterday and was using it and it definitely works but doing regular hand push up seems easier than using this, overall if you aren't good with regular hand push up then this is for you. The pro and the basic version seems to work the same and its quality also don't differs, but basic is $20. Go to your local walmart/target/kmart and they may have both basic and pro and you can play with the models to see which works best for you.$20 or $40?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it work??--->HELL YEAH!!!","review":"O Boy,,,I absolutely love this product....I just completed the 21 day routine and am very happy to see the results.My body looks more toned than ever.Wish Bodyrev could come up with a similar product to work out Biceps.All in all,,,a Great Product.My advance-Sow that green dollar in dis gr8 product and reap the benefits!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful - Can cause shoulder pain and rotator cuff damage","review":"This product can cause you serious harm. Be careful. I hurt my right shoulder, probably rotator-cuff, fooling with this device. Do your homework on the internet. Go to youtube and look at WDSUTV's review of the perfect push-up. Dr. Corey Hebert says a traditional pushup does a better job of distributing weight throughout your body and lessens pressure on wrist and hands. He recommends that you not use this product if you have a pre-exisiting joint or rotator-cuff injury. You can find other information on the web. A lot of people experience shoulder pain from using this device. It's not worth the risk"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Pushup","review":"I heard good things about the perfect pushup and wanted to buy them to see how good they really are. I have been working out for a long time. I also do regular pushups which are the best pushups. The perfect pushup works against your rotator cuff which isn't good because I found out the hard way. I have a strained rotator cuff now and have to take it easy because of it. I have since heard from other people about getting the same type of injury. I wouldn't recomend this product and tell people to stick to the old fashion way of doing pushups which have been around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets me motivated","review":"I can normally do about 50 pushups but with the perfect push-up, I reach muscle fatigue at around 35. The best part is that I don't experience any strain in my wrists as I would with regular pushups. It also leaves me feeling pumped with a nice muscle burn. My only complaint is that it's plastic. The bottoms have a rubberized grip so they don't slide around, but I still would have liked it to feel a bit sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT purchase through Amazon, see below","review":"Do not purchase through Amazon. Body Rev, the seller, is misrepresenting the product. If you purchase the perfect push-up through a store (i.e. Dicks Sporting Goods) you will pay the same price and receive an instructional DVD and workout chart with the package at no extra charge. I just spoke to Amazon, save yourself some time, go to the store instead. In no way is this review giving the product itself a 1 star, do not buy from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This product is soo simple and useless that it begs for an honest review.Being a push up fanatic , I know how quick and effective push ups are. And I find it best to do pushups on a flat surface or my finger tips, as opposed to gripping plastic bars.I received this item as a christmas gift, used it twice, then noticed the impressions on my palms and stopped. My main gripe about this product is not thats it ineffective, but that it limits the amount of push ups that you can do, therefore compromising your workout.Doing push ups in perfect form is great for targeting muscles, but you expend all of your energy therefore and cannot do enough to work your entire upper body.In conclusion, I think this is an over hyped, un-nessicary work out device that is best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, the other reviews cant be serious","review":"Are these reviewers insane? This product is horrible. It is unusable. Why? All of my weight is being centered on the inner palms of my hands where I hold the handles. It is like the handles become knives after a few seconds. The pain is unbearable, and the thick padding on the handles does not help. It hurts to a point that I can only do two or three pushups. Do NOT buy this idiotic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Care full","review":"I make a 3 day excercise like the video said, one morning i found i cant move my left arm i cant feel it, i woke up then i start to feel the blood flows then i recover the mobility, i still feel some injury in my shoulder, ill will see a doctor, it was the only rare thing i do that week, so be carful when us this ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do all these reviews read like ads?","review":"I've read 40 of these reviews and they all read like product endorsement ads.

These handles bring excitement back to the pushup. I have enjoyed the workout provided and especially the progress I have been making.

Now, to get my hands on the Perfect Pullup!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pushup the perfect workout","review":"I am always a little skeptical of new training equipment. They seem to over promise and under deliver. Some products do this more than others. The ones that completely under deliver I send back. The Perfect Push up doesn't fall into either of these categories. It is exactly what they said it would be. The first time I used it I felt a huge difference in my chest, shoulders, triceps and abs (particularly my obloquies). I use it almost everyday and have felt in just 3 short weeks a measurable difference in my strength. I have recommended this to my friends which I never do.The only thing I wish they included was a more in-depth workout plan.Other than that it is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"These are great, I had the old style fixed position push up handels.

I would recommend to anyone in High School & up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh the burn","review":"After fumbling around with this product for a week I finally looked at the poster and followed their recommended workout on the back. Let me tell you, it's a great workout and I was feeling burns in places I didn't think previously existed. In addition to the triceps and chest, it really works out the upper back. I have some big knots in my upper back just lateral to the spine at the base of the neck. This really helped squeeze those muscles and helped to relieve some tension there.I haven't changed my workout routine or pattern in the past month with the exception of using the Perfect Pushup. However, my volleyball teammates have noticed that I have more snap and have been hitting harder recently so maybe this product helps with the rotator cuff, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET","review":"THE PERFECT PUSH UP IT IS TO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET,ALSO IT IS TO BIG.IT SHOULD BE MORE COMPACT.IT IS OK PRODUCT.WALMART HAS IT FOR $19.00,THE SAME PRODUCT,THIS IS A FAIR PRICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not great","review":"It's so-so, you can definitely feel it working.

While these won't substitute a full gym workout. They are great for a chest workout at home. They are a lot harder to do than regular pushups because they isolate the muscle and don't hurt your wrists because you don't bend them. They also allow you to build your stabilizing muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pushup","review":"Great piece of excercise equipment. Adds a whole new twist to the basic pushup. More difficult to do at first, but use good form and the results will come. Don't worry about how many reps you do.

I'm in the military and can knock out 60 or 70 pushups in 2 minutes (depending on how hard I've been training recently). These grips make pushups tough and challenging, and I can barely do 35 straight on them! I've been training on them for 3 weeks, and while I haven't yet measured the difference in terms of my performance on \\"regular\\" pushups, I'm sure it's appreciable.

Before using this product, I considered my arms to be pretty strong but my chest and shoulders lacked the definition I was looking for. I use the gym but I was always looking for something compact for the home in between gym trips. The Perfect Push-Up does the job for sure.My initial test of the product resulted in being able to do a mere six regular Perfect Push-Ups as compared to being able to do fifteen regular push-ups. I felt so weak! After completing the first week, I could already feel new definition in my shoulders and my triceps. Now I'm on my second go-through and the reults are undeniable.I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great uper body/core workout for home use. It's more than worth the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Named Product","review":"Though simple in design, sometimes the simple things are the best. The product works as well as advertised.

I don't really work out with weights, but I do lots and lots of pushups. \\"Perfect Pushup\\" just turned my world up side down - it's so much better than regular pushup!!! Especially for people practicing martial arts or boxing - it's a must have. It gives you exactly the same twisting motion as when you throw a punch. Just after a few exercise, you'll feel the difference. Your punches will be stronger, faster, and much more powerful! I highly recommend it to anyone, from beginner to advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Perfect Pushup","review":"The perfect pushup is not perfect by any means. One thing they forget to mention is that they don't work well on carpeted surfaces. They have to be used on bare floors or they tend not to rotate very well.

The best results for me were my pecs, lets just say people jokingly say that I should wear a bra for those things.Doing pushups using this machine is harder to do then the normal \\"free\\" pushups but the results so far are much greater.All in all, I think this product was worth the money and I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit too tricky","review":"Well, it does what it claims to do-- changes alignment as you do pushups to avoid strain on your wrists.

I work out 5x's a week and found this VERY challenging. It will be a great supplement to my gym workout.You can immediately feel the muscles being worked and it's great. I love having it around and being able to do a few pushups while watching TV or in the morning as a start up.I have two bulging/herniated discs in my neck and this put NO strain on my joints or neck, but did work all the proper muscles that I need to work as part of working out and physical therapy.I only wish I had bought this earlier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pushups Work Great!","review":"The Perfect Pushup is a very nice addition to your exercise equipment. They are very heavy plastic with metal handles wrapped in rubber. They fit your hands well. Pushups are definitely harder with these I think because you focus more on control because the motion is so much easier without the strain on your forearms, wrists, and hands. They are heavier built then the $20 dollar version called the Pushup Pro. I like them a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant pump!","review":"this product gives one an instant pump throughout the upper body. the perfect pushup handles directly hit the pecs, front and side delts, and the triceps. perfect pushups done in accordance with pullups and ab work by the thousands of reps, will give you a total upperbody workout. i highly recommend the perfect pushup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical to begin with","review":"I was skeptical to begin with.I thought that these were nothing but glorified push up stands, which can be purchased for much cheaper.I finally decided to take a chance based on all the good reviews.I figured that they couldn't all be paid reviews.To my happy surprise they definitely worked as described.The pushups are much tougher.It does take some getting used to.You will have to work up gradually to your usual number of pushups.The results will show.The only negative is that at the price they are selling for they should definitely include a DVD and a book.Come on Perfect Pushup, please include a DVD & a book.Don't be so lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Push-Up Program","review":"It works!!

Long story short, these things really target muscles you don't normally use and make you work. No more getting by with just your chest and arms. Say hello to your back, stomach, thigh and calf (yes, calf) muscles. Be ready to sweat after a two minute workout. Be ready to muscle up. Not too expensive, don't take up a lot of space, easy to use, effective. What else do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"D. Durette","review":"AWESOME!!!

They're perfectly fine for just doing some pushups, but if you get more intense and follow the advanced programs, they can really mess up your rotator cuffs if you have any weakness there (and most of us do). There are much safer exercises to get the same effects. So again, if you just want a good way to do some pushups without straining your arms and wrists, these things are fine. But don't go hardcore with them or you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wahoo....Perfect Pushup","review":"I love these so much!

The story sounded intriguing and the review stated the sexuality was burning. The plot was unique in a \\"cutesy\\" sort of way and had wonderful possibilities, however I guess I've read too much Linda Howard, Stephanie Laurens, Nicole Jordan, and Dara Joy because the sensuality just left me flat. There's really only one consumate sex scene in this book and it lasts about a minute and a half. There is no romance to speak of at all and the idea of the heroine repeatedly placing sexual phone calls to the wrong number and not realizing she was talking to someone other than her boyfriend was difficult to buy into. I felt the whole tone of the book was adolescent in nature, if you want to read a really \\"So Called Hot\\" Contemporary Romance read Michelle Jerott's ABSOLUTE TROUBLE or ALL NIGHT LONG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Brother","review":"Didn't know what I was buying until I started reading.

His experience with Wagner's works from the 1930's in various opera houses around the world and at the Metropolitan Opera from 1949-53 is evident here. Reiner's command and control in these excerpts makes them sound completely different from other conductors' performances. I only wish that there had been an additional Reiner/Chicago Wagner album or two, as had been done by George Szell in Cleveland. The sound is not the best by the Mohr/Layton team; it seems as if there was tape overloading in the fortissimo passages.This CD is filled out with Reiner's 1960 Chicago recording of Richard Strauss' \\"Don Juan.\\" Recommended for the unique Wagner performances, not the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't figure it out","review":"After many of my friends would go on about how much fun they had playing cards, I couldn't wait to get my order in.

It does contain useful information. It currently is in print, making it relatively inexpensive at under $25.00. It is also a nice looking book.The book's vices, however, far outweigh its virtues.Simply put, the book fails to be objective in its assessments of the Royal Navy and its ships. Instead, it reads like a volume published by a public relations firm paid by the Royal Navy. Brown simply ignores or glosses over the numerous flaws of Royal Navy ships of the period. Tony DeGiulian's superb review touches upon this to some extent, as does the discussion about his review.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive fan letter to the Royal Navy of the past, this might be your book. If you are looking for a book that objectively discusses the virtues and vices of Royal Navy designs in comparison to those of other navies, then I advise you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide for the Grad School Process","review":"I originally borrowed this book from a PhD student at my Alma mater.

It demystifies the graduate school application process as well as provides information for navigating after enrolling and developing strategies to complete coursework. I highly recommend EVERY African-American baccalaureate student read this before deciding whether to go on to graduate school AND for those who completed their bachelor's degree some time ago and are considering going back for their master's degree.However, the book has several distracting typographical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I found this book to be insightful, helpful, and downright funny.

These were so detailed that at times, I tired of the seemingly endless political escapades Pompadour was a involved in. Sometimes, the book felt more like a biography 18th century French politics rather than the life of Pompadour. Her life was abrupt and her time as the romantic love of Louis XV's even shorter. After it was obvious that Louis XV no longer looked to her as a romantic partner, Pompadour positioned herself as a confidant, a friend, an advisor, among many other roles. This made her a very well-known woman in French royal society; some dubbed her as the Prime Minister of France, others called her the true Queen. While this book was well researched and well written, I still feel that it's a pity that this book focused more on her foray into politics rather than the overall doings of her private life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpfull!!!!!!","review":"I am a senior in high school I've been involved with wicca for about four years and this book reminded me what drew me to wicca in the first place.

Using construction vehicles for the characters is the ultimate for kids, they just eat that stuff up. Also, the video has a very clear and strong lesson. Which should be a major part of the purpose for letting kids watch videos. It clearly shows kids that tasks at hand can be completed more productively through organization, cooperation and planning. So many kids videos are empty or try to teach a lesson but are not clear enough. This video clearly delivers the point.We also loved the fact that despite the fact the characters were working on a noisy construction site, there were moments of quiet, and voices were lowered with soft music which presents a great contract and prevents kids from getting wound up and loosing the message. We also chuckled at some of the antics of some of the characters.Thank you so much for the video, we will treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"Cody's Crew is a gentle story that appeals to my 2-year old and my 7-year old.

My skin even starts cracking if I keep wearing them. It's happened multiple times so I KNOW it's these gloves causing it, every time I try them again. Other people at work experience skin irritation as well. I'd say it affects maybe 5% of the people at work just from asking around..

Sharp knows it is not worth repairing and in all likelihood another microwave will be purchased. Not even 9 months after buying this microwave it made a loud sound and no longer would heat. Personally I want something reliable and am tossing this microwave and moving onto another brand. I am having surgery in a month and will need a microwave and am at least thankful it did not stop functioning just after my surgery.

The past couple of months it started to take longer to warm food-a few seconds every couple of weeks. Last night I made popcorn, my husband then tried to warm water and the door just stopped closing. Now it's going to the dump where we have to pay $15 to get rid of it. By the way, the door latch is really loud to open and close. It has woken our kids up who are on a different floor of the house.

(They provided great service). In May of 2009, the magnetron failed again! No longer under warranty, I did the research, and the part alone, direct from the distributor would be $92 plus shipping. I decided to just buy a new microwave. I bought a GE at Sam's Club, equivalent size, more features, more convenient to use, for only $64!In addition to being poorly manufactured, The functionality of the controls on this microwave is terrible. Sharp has gone backwards with ease of use on this model.It used to be that Sharp made the best microwaves. The two Sharps I had prior to this lasted 9 years each. Their quality has gone way downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work!","review":"Made a loud noise when I plugged it in, it got very HOT and the noise did not stop!!! It scared me that it might start a fire so I returned it. Amazon was great, took it back, gave me a full refund plus my shipping expense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good oven","review":"I like the oven, except that there is no light on the touchpad and it is difficult to see to program. Other than that, it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for almost 2 years.","review":"I had this microwave for about 1 year 10 months and it crapped out. It would turn on like it was working but no heat. Called sharp and nearest authorized repair was 30 min away. They would cover the part from the 3 year warranty, but service charges were on me. I paid 100.00 for it and I just bought an Emerson for 79.00. I guess I will just buy a new microwave when this one craps out too. I remember old microwaves would last so long that you couldn't wait for them to go out to get a new one. These ones are the opposite. I wouldn't go with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"serve its purpose","review":"I have used both Panasonic and Sharp microwave in the past. Liked both brand. Read and studied reviews from others and then purchase this Sharp more basic ones. Most time I use the features for reheat or defrost. Both feature works very efficiently. The price is right. I do not like the user interface on this unit. I use \`minutes plus' feature a lot. The button is not big enough and sometimes I have to press 2nd time in order to make it to work. So I put a little round sticker to make it easier for my finger. For defrost, it is 2-3 steps process and you have to read the instructions on the unit while the door is open to choose the right setting. Maybe that is why it works efficient. The working efficiency is a 5 star, the look is a 5 star, the price is a 5 star and the user interface is a 3 star. Amazon's 2 day delivery services is a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen appliance","review":"Just the right size, not too big and not too small.

The stainless steel exterior adds a little more class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Important","review":"I needed a product that would fit in a built-in space. Actually I wanted one in white, but could not find one that fit. I settled for the stainless, and am very happy with how it works. I was unhappy with a different brand, in white, that only lasted 3 years. I bought a Sharp based on previous experience by friends, and hope the Sharp keeps performing for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great while it worked","review":"Just wanted to add my experience in with the others who had issues with this microwave. We actually had ours for several years and it worked very well, but the other day, we were using it regularly when it popped and burned as others have described. The door on ours actually had a melted and burned spot on it! Obviously, we are out of our warranty period, but I've had microwaves in the past last MUCH longer than this one! I will be buying a different brand to replace it for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My mom already had one before... so no learning curve.","review":"The best thing I can say is that it was the same model my mother already had for several years. Lightning killed the control circuit of her microwave and I was there visiting. I found this for under one hundred dollars and with free shipping. Mom is quite sharp at age 78, but why make her learn a new microwave now? She's happy to have it replaced with the same model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it just past the warranty!","review":"I bought one of these for a relative-fit/function/operation seemed fine 'til just after the warranty expired, when most of the buttons would not operate. Since it was out of warranty, she plugged along since the one-touch button operations were 'bout the only thing she used. After a couple more months, the last few remaining buttons that did work gave it up. She has a display, but none of the control buttons work.I've had a couple of Sharps over the years, and they seemed to be quality units.I guess Sharp has now joined the ranks of those in a race to the bottom?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great - for three weeks","review":"We have had a couple of Sharp Carousel microwaves in the past and have always been very happy with their performance, so this is the first brand we went looking for when shopping for our son. That, evidently, was the Sharp of years ago. This worked well for our son in his new apartment - for precisely three weeks. He tried to make microwave mac-n-cheese one afternoon, and the microwave started smoking. This was about a 4 minute process, and the product was specifically designed to be cooked in the microwave. Afterwards, it made a horrible noise and would no longer heat. We bought it here online, so of course, no original packaging three weeks after it was delivered and first used. In essence, we paid $100 for three weeks worth of usage. Not worth our time to try and find a Sharp dealer and possibly pay again for a repair. Now we're off to Wal-Mart to find a replacement brand. We will never buy another Sharp again, nor will we be likely to buy appliances online again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, no problems","review":"We have had this for a year, give or take, and have not had a problem yet. With that in mind it is a microwave. My last one lasted 10 years or more. I expect this one to as well. it seems sturdy, it cooks well. It is not too powerful (yes this is possible) so most things that say cook for 1 min actually do take 1 minute.We do not use this as much as other appliances but when we do we are confident it will work. It is easy to clean too. Easy to use, easy to set the clock, easy to open, etc. It fits all the dishes we use in the microwave. It is bigger inside than the one it replaced, but that was 10+ years old so I would hope this one has more internal room. It has the same external dimensions as the old one, give or take.It works, enough said about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"After only a few months casual use, the buttons failed to operate.

This is a sharp looking microwave and it works as great as it looks. We last bought a microwave about 5 years ago. Can't believe how the cooking speed and thoroughness has improved.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 2 months","review":"Good size microwave. Used very little but only lasted 2 months.Will try to deliver to a Sharp service center and will report back.Not so easy to figure out the controls. After 2 months it makes a noise and does not heat up the food.Sharp repair center fixed it for free. Only had to wait two weeks for the repair. Worked for another 3 months. Today I am bringing it back to the repair center again. This could be the last Sharp product I ever buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 14 months....","review":"Wow, I've had an old sharp microwave made before I was born that lasted 18+ years and this thing only lasted about a lil over a year (14 months). It looks to be good quality but it isn't. It just randomly died. I would highly not recommend this microwave to anyone and Sharp has lost my business with them. Looks great but will not last long and that is why it's priced cheaply in most places. I think I'm gonna go buy an Amana brand microwave. Damn you Sharp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 4 years","review":"This would be a nice microwave, if it lasted. After about 4 years, the exterior of the microwave started getting extremely hot while the food stayed cold. It was as if it was microwaving on the outside instead of on the inside. Will by staying clear of Sharp from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Product","review":"Like many other reviewers, the Sharp microwave I used to have lasted 18+ years. Then I got this to replace it and after 18 months, part of the door latch mechanism broke. I heard something snapped and fell within the door. So, it won't close tightly and of course the machine won't start if the door is not closed properly. Naturally, it's out of warranty. The initial estimate is $60 + tax if it's only the door latches that need to be replaced. Who knows what else the repair shop finds. Might as well as a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made to last","review":"My previous Panasonic MW lasted 20 years, and while I realize that almost all products produced nowadays aren't made to last, the Sharp MW didn't even last one year. The confusing keypad and shortcuts required referring to the manual ALL the time. It makes a pretty loud hum when it is running -- but you'll only have to put up with that for 6-8 months before the cheap piece of junk dies. I truly believe that it is just really hit-or-miss with Sharp products, and no way no how am I going to take that chance again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carousel stopped working","review":"I've had the microwave for a couple of years but have lived with a malfunctioning carousel for about 6 months, planning to replace it. This is in a vacation home so isn't even used very often. And I don't use a microwave for much more than reheating food very occasionally. Other issue that I don't like is ease of use - not intuitive at all!! I was surprised to see this model so highly rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable microwave","review":"I guess for $100 plus I've got a disposable unit - it died in 14 months.Midlife wasn't pretty either - a rotating glass dish cracked in the process of heating a small frozen dinner pack.Also: noisy when working; very loud door locking mechanism sounding like somebody hit a large empty steel barrel with a hammer; whatever you put in center of the rotating dish will be off to the inner walls by the end of the process (it stands on the perfectly horizontal brand new granite countertop).My old Panasonic had one problem in 15 years - a burned out light bulb inside.Of course, quality is going south in general, but 14 months life? It looks like all mw owens regardless of the brand made on the same plant in China, so I'll have to use my gas range more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melt down","review":"I bought the microwave 5 months ago. Today I discovered that I could not open the door and realized that the front plastic faceplate is distorted, I suspect from the heat created by the magnetron. I thought that this would have been a good microwave but I see that it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp is not what it used to be!","review":"Instead of describing the product as having a \\"stainless steel\\" look, a more accurate description would read \\"aluminium foil\\" used to achieve a \\"stainless steel\\" look.

Upon inspection the product and packaging appeared to be of poor quality. I returned for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 6 months!","review":"This Sharp microwave was very powerful and cooked/heated foods quickly and evenly... for about 4 months. After that, the food started cooking unevenly, even if the item was placed in the middle of the rotating plate.After 6 months, I tried to heat up my stringbeans and it started a mini fire in the microwave! Thinking it was my plate, I switched plates and tried again. 2 seconds into the warming, a mini fire errupted again, but this time followed by a loud ZAPping sound. I am scared to even try again, so here I am, shopping for a new one on Amazon.I would not recommend purchasing this, and if you do, would recommend you stay close to it so that a fire does not start up! It was pretty scary!And lastly, the footprint of this microwave is HUGE and takes up a lot of space... so unless you are constantly heating foods for a huge family, I would recommend getting something smaller!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I purchased this microwave as I needed a larger more powerful model. My previous Sharp was still operating after 15 years. This one lasted only six months. I am told it needs a new magnatron which seems to be a common complaint. Seems like this product should be recalled and Sharp should up their quality control. No more Sharp for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with the quality","review":"6 weeks after buying this, 2 of the quick buttons (\\"melt, soften\\") stopped working, so we lived with it like that until after 2 1/2 years 75% of the number pad stopped functioning. The minute plus button and the 1,2,3,5,8, and 0 buttons quit as well. We still had our 15+yr old Sharp microwave in the basement so we went back to using it. The newer microwave definitely had a lower quality feel about it in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp once better quality, no longer; 14 months then dead","review":"Had very similar Sharp model in bisque that was solidly made and performed well for years and years, used daily. When it needed replacing, was delighted to find it in stainless since bisque impossible to get. However, was rather suspicious of the model when I found it displayed in a local store -- it seemed more flimsy than my old Sharp. When purchased, deliberately did not buy extended warranty, since I knew I'd switch brands if this one proved lousy.For 14 months it worked fine and controls similar to previous model; however, was noisier and tin-like (not really the robust feel of stainless, just the appearance). It stopped heating and I kicked it to the curb (actually, taken in for recycling). Now trying out GE with extended warranty. My guess is that manufacturers are putting better quality into models with convection and/or range-hood installation (higher priced more profitable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Sharp as a headache...","review":"This microwave was great...for the 4 years that it worked, and that is just a household with just 2 people and less than average use. The Sharp customer service rep I talked to today said it's typical for this model to stop heating in that amount of time. The part could still be under warrantee but all service centers are over an hour away...and I don't live in a rural area. Do NOT buy this microwave unless you like the idea of throwing it in a landfill in 3-4 years and buying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned obsolescence","review":"This is the second Sharp microwave my wife and I have owned. Both worked fine through the warranty period then lost functions. In the case of the first - the clock/timer/display no longer lit making it difficult to set up anything more complex than reheating. The second developed a problem with the door latch this morning. Sharp has built in a safety feature that won't allow the oven to work when the door isn't securely closed. I suspect they are complying with a federal regulation. Fortunately, if I really slam the door, it will work, however, I'm sure it will crap out at the least convenient moment. No more Sharp nukes for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice while it lasted!","review":"The Sharp replaced the horrible Kenmore which replaced the wonderful Panasonic, which replaced something else, but now we're going back over 10 years.

A rather happy marriage follows but all does not go well. Hugh is ensorcelled and 'Belle from Hell' (or so they call her) goes after him, assisted only by an apprentice falconer. Yes, it is as far-fetched and outrageous as anything, but Bertrice Small books are a delicious hoot. And sometimes, in life, one must hoot. There is improbable lovemaking and mind-blowingly stupid behavior from intelligent characters, but one just has to embrace in admiration this talented author who teaches you a fair bit of history even as she finds the Nip/Tuck-ness of the 15th century. Who knew?"},{"rating":"2","title":"my first Bertrice Small book - NOT my last!","review":"Loved it - I enjoyed the story, the historical facts and the steamy sex.

I felt sleazy just reading it and didn't even bother to finish it through.

I teach some research topics too so this book helps me with some of my class notes. I have suggested that those researchers who want to be able to read some of their early documents obtain this book and others to help them read and understand what is written.

I have found several problems with it already. I found that it is just a fraction too large to fit the Bosch RA1100 adapter I use with my routers. (The RA1100 allows Bosch routers to use standard Porter-Cable style bushings, which it otherwise does well, so it should fit.) I also found that the alignment pin is useless as it does not fit into the bushing. Again, it's just a hair too large. I also noticed that the rubber O-ring that retains the removable bushing gets pinched and tears a little bit each time it is removed and replaced. So it is beginning to self destruct already. Considering that this is an accessory designed to do a precise operation, the quality is quite poor. (Note: it's made in China.) In my opinion, this is not a good quality tool. My recommendation is to find a more accurately made set. It'll save you a lot of headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alignment pin not correct size","review":"The alignment pin that came with the kit is too small to fit a 1/4 inch collet, and too big on the other end to fit into the bushing hole!

I need to do more sanding than I'd expect, which usually leads to poor fitting inlays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!!","review":"Thank you Amazon for making so many of these works so easily accessible.

Keep that in mind when you listen to these galvanic but tense readings, marvels of conductorial control and orchestral unity, but not the gneial, smiling Strauss you might be used to--or desire. I respect this CD but rarely play it, preferring Karajan quite a lot over Kleiber in this material. But Kleiber's complete Fledermaus sweeps the field, as others have noted.There are two New Year's concerts from Kleiber, by the way, this 1989 occasion and one from 1992.

Bei uns z'Haus, Op. 361, was cut in order to fit this concert onto a single CD. It remains on theDVDrelease as the third selection. The performances in this concert are among the very best these works have ever received on record, but where there is overlap I prefer Herbert von Karajan conducting the 1987 New Year's Concert [CD|DVD]. Karajan elicits more relaxed playing from the orchestra, whereas Kleiber pushes every piece to peak intensity. I consider both performances to be indispensable.

They paste the photos on top of the frames. They only have a few frames that are transparent and let you send your photo to the back.

I have used it for a few weeks only, but the device has definitely contributed already to making my work effortless when making angle cuts. The angles are very easy to set, and the thing is very stable and does not budge throughout the work. Some smaller complaints are that the guide bar is not totally flat, when the end exits the slot on the saw top I need to nudge it down a bit on the return stroke. Also, the screw that secures the flip stop is winged and extends beyond the face of the fence. This prevents taller parts from adjoining the fence while using the stop. Nevertheless, this is one of the tools that really make sense if one frequently needs to cut precise and reproducible angles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Save your money! I bought the EB-3 to use with my Delta contractor's saw based on reviews here. Setup out of the box seemed easy. However, I almost ruined my first project because the crosscuts were not square.

While his colleague Berg has his music played more frequently, especially the Violin Concerto, it still is not performed very often.The music of the Second Viennese School offers much to the listener. It challenges you. It is music that one simply does not put on in the background. However, if you give it a chance, you may come to like it.All of Webern's works are favourites of mine. His works are fascinating for their conciseness. Each note matters. If you approach his transcriptions of the works of Bach and others, you can appreciate what a great musician he was.This recording is wonderful. I cannot speak highly enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat's Meow ... this is good stuff","review":"This touchpad actually works with XP!

In the case of my jig, it uses a 5/8 bushing for half-blind dovetails. More to the point, the 5/8 Porter Cable bushing is an absolute industry standard. This Shop Fox kit is essentially a box full of Porter Cable style bushings.The irony here, is that the Shop Fox bushing is unusable in the very type of jig they were designed for. The outside diameter of the bushing is too wide by a very small amount, i.e. it jams in between the fingers on the jig rather than sliding in and out easily with a very small amount of clearance. I want to like these bushings, but I have to stick with the steel PC bushing.These bushings appear to be nicely machined, unfortunately they are out of tolerance and completely unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure...Keep or Return...","review":"I am not happy with this set, the workmanship is poor, threads are tight in spots on most of the guides, hard to start nut onto guide.

I had an issue with the CableCARD reader, and all I got was misinformation and delay tactics from customer service. I upgraded the software, and got the cable company to come out 3 times for various tests all demanded by Philips, after which they assured me they would fix or replace the set. After 4 months, they finally admitted they weren't going to fix the problem. \\"You bought the TV, so it's your problem not ours\\" was basically their answer.

Bosch blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service but no smile!","review":"I've owned this planer for almost two years, within that time the sole units have never been aligned correctly and the dust chute is constantly clogging. I returned it to Bosch just outside of the warrenty period and they re-aligned the shoe for me without charge, but within a short while it was all over the place again. What a shame, if only Bosch could make their machines as well as they can organise their customer service side of their business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree about poor quality","review":"Most of my tools are made by Bosch, but recent purchases have made me concerned about the direction of the company. I'm willing to pay a premium for higher quality tools, but will not pay more for a brand name. This planer is an embarrassment to the Bosch name. Zero setting removes material and the sole plate is completely out of alignment. It might be suitable as a rough material remover but not acceptable as a finishing product. Bosch needs to improve the quality of their products or start charging the same prices a Hitachi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of power","review":"This is a great planer. Has plenty of power to shave doors in old houses. The depth setting is eash to adjust. Bosch blades hold up well. I recommend purchasing the bag to collect shavings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch 3 1/4 inch planer","review":"Planer works great. Having seen the carrying case included in the kit, I don't see any reason to buy the metal carrying case which is suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Monster","review":"It removes a tremendous amount of material very quickly. Have the work firmly held in place and use both hands in a fluid motion -- there is really no way around that. You will also need a lot of space to work the tool and a strategy on how to tackle your particular project. Take light passes. Woods with a lot of moisture may clog it, if that happens try slowing your feed rate. Get very familiar with how it enters and leaves the material before using it on your project. If you get distracted you will have a very large amount of material removed from a place you did not mean to. Once you get used to it, it is a very rewarding and very productive tool. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold up to use every 15 min","review":"We have had this plainer for a view years and it did occasional jobs but last week we started to use it to take off layers of paint with very thin cuts. The cycle was to run for ~1 min of use then sit for ~15 min. After two days of use it had start up problems and I tracked it to the bearing for the cutter head, once I opened the case up I found that all the bearings in the planer were running rough and some of the plastic around the drive side bearing on the cutter head was melted, so this will be tossed and a new more robust planer will be purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Planer While It Worked","review":"I bought the 240v version of this planer. It was nice while it worked. Now it's been almost three weeks and I'm still \\"waiting for parts\\". Nice planer, shocking support."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than no planer","review":"I bought this tool this morning after reading all the reviews and deciding that it was the top of the line tool. I've been consistently happy with Bosch tools. This one, though, was terribly faulty. The planer soles were so misaligned that it was impossible to plane wood flat. I returned it, hoping to get a replacement. The only other one at the store was similarly misaligned. The clerk told me that others had been returned for the same reason. The alignment was so off that I can't believe that Bosch would put out such a lame tool. Perhaps the store got a bad batch, but I wouldn't buy one of these without looking at it first to see that the soles are in the same plane, not kinked to allow the tool to dig a concave hole in your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"Like an earlier reviewer, the unit I purchased had shoes that weren't in alignment with each other. The front (adjustable) shoe seemed twisted, and wasn't aligned to the blades. There is no obvious provision for adjustment.It was quite a disappointment, as Bosch makes some fantastic tools, and this planer has some great features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Planner","review":"I purchased this tool several months ago and have been very disappointed with it every since I received it. I first noticed that the front and rear soles were not in alignment so it is impossible to make an even cut. I took the thing apart to see if there was an adjustment to level the soles and found none. The problem lies with the case which itself is misaligned. As I see it, the only way to fix this problem is for Bosch to retool the mold for the plastic case. Also the spring for the spring loaded park rest is not strong enough, so the park rest hardly ever drops down. After using the plane I have to let the motor come to a complete stop before I set it down. The only use I have for this tool is for preliminary rough surfacing of hardwood which has been cut with a chain saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"This may be a very good planer in many respects but for me it is almost unbearable to use for one reason: it clogs up constantly. I cannot even think of using the bag but even with the chip exhaust wide open it clogs up in just a few seconds. I must stop after every pass and dig down in the opening to clear the chips and turn it on and off to clear it out. It takes me several minutes so that I can make another 5 second pass.Since I see no one else with this complaint it makes me wonder if I am doing something wrong or if my model is defective. I would be glad to have any suggestions but until then: Bah,humbug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Fence","review":"Bosch should be ashamed of putting such a poor quality fence on this product. As other reviewers mentioned, it is almost impossible to get it to 90 degrees. You're more likey to get an accurate cut using the tool without the fence and estimating the angle. Aside from the fence issue, the tool is well built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"door\\" planer","review":"What I should say is: It is not for a door expert. The planer is great but the bevel guide adjusts in the opposite direction from most \\"door\\" planers. This is a problem because if you have the door on a saw horse, you will have to flip the door over to get the bevel going the correct way. Also then your marks would be on the opposite side if you mark on the high side. Otherwise is very nicely made with good features.I bought this for another door installer and he promptly returned it due to the backwards fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Given as a Christmas gift.","review":"This was my son's choice for Christmas. I'm sure he researched what he wanted. I haven't heard any complaints from him, so he must like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame","review":"Bought a Bosch Planner because of the usually good name they have earned. This planer clogs constantly. Cannot go more than 4' on a 2\\" wide board before the ejection chute becomes totally clogged and starts to interfere with the planner blades. This thing is useless, guess I will go back to the Makita which I had used for 6 yrs without any problems until I finally burned it up.Dont make my same mistake!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing lines up!","review":"The front and rear shoes are not on the same plane and the blades do not line up with either of them. If set at zero, the planer would remove material...but only on one side! I'm glad I read these reviews so I knew what to look out for when I purchased this soon to be returned item. If you decide to give this one a shot, take a straight edge to the bottom of this turd and hope its all on the same \\"plane\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"1594K Planer","review":"I have several bosch tools and I am normally a fan or their products, but this planer was likely one of the worst purchases I've made in a long time. Like many other reviews have already stated, the front and back sleds of this planer do not lay parallel to one another and there is no method for adjusting the angle. I've tried adjusting the blade to align with each plane, but it still seems to cut with a slight angle. Can't seem to find a use for mis-aligned cuts. Needless to say, this planer is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent enough tool for the professional","review":"the planer is very light in weight, which has pros and cons. i agree with one reviewer about the fence inadequacy.i will own up to my own mistake, i over looked the shoe size (I guess it does matter). going mainly by the pic, and skimming some details i failed to note that the plate is ONLY s little over 11\\" long. short is the plate is not good in getting a nice level cut over a distance. my friend had hand planer with a 24\\" plate, now that is what i had in my mind and assumed...assumptions get me into problems way too often.i do wish the fence were more substantial, that there was dust collector other than the small easily cloggeg bag, and that the shoe-plate-sole-whatever was longer at least 18\\" would seem to me to be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Alignment","review":"This is probably the worst tool investment I have made in years. The problem is: The front bottom plate is not parallel with the rear bottom plate. If you eyeball from the front one side of the front plate is about 1/16 out of parallel with the back plate. Edges are not square, surfaces have deep edge gouges. There is no way to adjust this. The body is a cast hard plastic and in the case of my tool (and a few others I've seen in the reviews) there is a misalignment that causes the front plate to cock to one side.I'm saving up for another one. I will buy the next one after checking the alignment in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Need To Re-Think The Fence","review":"Overall the unit is fine, but the fence is made so cheap that you cannot set it to 90 deg. without doing some filing on the slot. This is a very poorly engineered fence and is not like Bosch to put something so cheap on their tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a trigger lock, not a trigger safety.","review":"Alot of tools these days have trigger saftey guards, especially cordless tools. While this may seem safe for your average homeowner, 90% of the guys on my crew always swear at them. Why? Because they want the dexterity for controling the cut, many of which are made in precarious unleveraged positions. Sound dangerous...well thats building. I'm not saying take your blade guard off and install a trigger lock on your skillsaw; but when I light up a planer, I like to lock it on and tune..less trigger fatigue...ask any one with framers elbow. I have a Hitachi F30A, two Makita 1900Bs and a Ryobi L1121, all have trigger locks and when its time to rock n roll and straight edge, the crew leaves the Bosch in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hidden history of freemasons from Rome to modern times","review":"The hidden history of freemasons from Rome to modern times is revealed in a survey which traces modern freemasonry back to colleges of artisans in ancient Rome, and their organization evolution to the Arab turuqs, brotherhoods of builders created under the Knights Templar. Spiritual, social and cultural history blend in a survey which examines both Freemason history and spiritual concepts and how they changed from early to modern times. The Secret History Of Freemasonry: Its Origins And Connection To The Knights Templar provides fascinating and informative chapters covering everything from cooperative masonry associations to speculative masonry rituals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"This is a book that merits a shelf all on it's own.

The elastic waist makes makes it easier on the lower back when sitting, bending, and standing. There are no back pockets, which looks great. The legs are tapered, so these jeans don't look baggy while wearing them.

I was not even sure what size to order, so I ordered 2 different sizes. The 18\\" are roomy and comfortable and the 16\\" were just fine! Maybe the 16\\"s are better for going out, and the 18\\" better for lounging around or hanging out. I got the bleached ones in both sizes and love the color. The elastic waistband is just great. These jeans are soft on the eyes and the material is soft too. I am very, very happy with these jeans, Amazon just needs to fit their pic to the product. Getting long pants when you are expecting Capri's might be very upsetting to many people. Anyway, they are comfortable and look great.

I have never been able to wear Lees Jeans in the past due to my long waist line. I hesitated to buy these Jeans because I felt they were pricey and my past experience with this brand wasn't good. I am thrilled I gave it a try because working for ten hours straight in Jeans can be very uncomfortable on my stomach area.

Parents will enjoy this as much as their kids. Although it is about Bugs, that proverbially school project, (and we all had one like it), I found there is allot more to it. As I read about Megan and her brother, Alexander, and their sibling rivalry, it reminded me of my own childhood. I especially enjoyed the friendship that grew between Megan and Charlie. I was impressed by the author's ability to demonstrate a healthy way to solve a disagreement between Megan and her parents. It is very subtle lesson, kids might miss it, but it is very constructive.And the bug storyline is so clever, honest, thoughtful and funny, who knew there was so much to know about bugs!

It's just too bad Disney has put so much other garbage out there - it makes me really think twice before buying any more Princess DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"My daughter, age 2 1/2, is really into the princesses. I bought the first DVD and she really enjoyed it, so we added Beauty shines from within, thinking that it would be a very empowering, positive message type of stories. Wow, Disney really missed a great opportunity. This DVD was just ridiculous and a little scary. I was pretty angry when we watched it. What a complete waste of $20. I definitely wouldn't recommend it. It has \\"disappeared\\" from my daughter's movie drawer into the trash, where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheezy, but she LOVES it...","review":"My three-year old is a devoted princess fan, and we got this for her so that she could watch a princess movie without spending an hour and a half in front of the TV. Both the Ariel and Jasmine sections are from the Saturday morning TV shows, and Cinderella is a retelling of her own story. Yes, *I* think it's boring and low-budget, but my daughter loves it and that's what matters. Plus, since each section is only 20-minutes or so long, she doesn't spend as much time in front of the TV.As for it being too scary, I don't think there's anything scarier in these stories than in the original disney movies. Jafar turns into a snake, Maleficent turns into a seriously scary dragon (not to mention those goblins), Ursula grows to enourmous size then gets stabbed in the stomach....if your kid isn't scared by those things, I doubt they'll be scared by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: May Induce Nightmares","review":"I'm usually pretty careful about what I let my 4 and 2 year old daughters watch. Beauty Shines From Within sounded harmless enough. The back of the box mentioned fun tales about Ariel, Cinderella and Jasmine. The description on the box failed to mention that Jasmine is turned into a red eyed, fanged, spike tailed giant hooded green snake by a shape shifting evil sorceress cat person. Thanks, Disney. That's what I get for not previewing the movie first. When my 28 month old came up to me in the kitchen and asked me why Jasmine had red eyes and told me she was scared, I went in to see what was going on. I got there as Aladdin decided that if his true love was going to live life as a snake, so was he, so he rubbed the magic lotion on himself and became a giant, pupil-less blue snake. I guess that's true love for ya. These images are going to stick around in my household for awhile (they tend to pop back up at bedtime, imagine that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is a complete cd from start to finish.

You will not go wrong purchasing this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAL GIULINI","review":"Esta versión de los Cuadros de Mussorgsky es realmente aburrida, Giulini maneja un tempo muy lento y una concepción carente de expresión, que diferencia con su versión anterior, con la Chicago SO en DGG.

This work felt more like something on PBS than A&E. Usually, A&E Biographies are bright, light-hearted, and chatty. This one kept it somber based on the seriousness of the subject. The work doesn't make this connection, but I immediately thought of Jim Jones, Stalin, and many other self-destructive and genocidal leaders. The work doesn't mention the United Nations until the very end. I kept asking myself why didn't the UN do more. This disc also goes from discussing Pol Pot in the 1970s then jumps to the 1990s. Why make that leap? Why was nothing done in the 1980s? Much is mentioned of Vietnamese refugees and immigrants in the US. Why don't people talk about those in the Cambodian diaspora more if they faced such a tragedy? It's not that this is a bad documentary, it's that the subject is so tragic and frustrating. I hope nothing like this and on this scale happens during this new century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good manual/course even for homeschooling use","review":"The Prentice Hall Biology course is a very good one - generally scientifically rigorous and fairly thorough. I'm currently doing the labs for my own son as well as a couple of other homeschooling teens, and it's worked out nicely.

Get the one on Varese Sarabande!!","review":"I already owned another \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" on \\"Varese Sarabande\\" recording label. I have to say that this version (on \\"Sony\\" music label) is not as good as the Varese one. The Sony recording is boomy and somewhat loose. The Varese is very tight and with better sound all around. The orchestra on the Varese is the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Varujan Kojian and their performace beats the one on this CD. Yes! Even if this one is conducted by Mr.Williams himself. Trust me. I've been listening to classical music since I was a child and I can tell a good performance from a not-so-good one. For instance the timpani (the big noisy drum) in \\"The Asteroid Field\\" goes pratically unnoticed on the \\"Sony\\" recording; on the \\"Varese\\" you can hear those timpany loud and clear! The tempo on the \\"Varese\\" recording is not loose as it is on the Sony recording.

Each track has its own personality, from the serious and fast-paced to the calm and heavenly. It has a good mix of music from the \\"grand\\" orchestra style to the simple tunes of a country dance to some more modern versions to the way I think it could have been played originally. There isn't a single track I don't like (no \\"cheesy\\" music). I love to listen to it while I work (I'm a writer) because it motivates, moves, and inspires me. Some tracks, like the one from Riverdance, I like especially for the way the fiddler almost seems to improvise, as though she were moving with the music instead of just reading the notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"A great cd, with an array of different styles of Irish music.

Can actually hear the shouty wind reeds buzzing at the level of all 30 accompanying instruments (no, not a bagpipe drone!) Upper bass is mixed too much forward and there is so much cumulating distortion that I donated this to the Salvation Army (keeping the rest of conductor I have loved in person Lockhart's work.) Still waiting for proper treatment of this fine body of music outside movie soundtracks themselves. Hollywood composers/recording engineers know to keep orchestra spacing in at least 3 of the 4 playback dimensions. (Here, the timing and/or pitch veer off occasionally--the 4th dimension does not hold.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever!!!","review":"I listen to this CD all the time. I like how it has a mixture of tunes of celtic origin and how the orchestra seems to put an extra...something to all the songs. Being a bagpiper myself, I would prefer a little more of the Highland Bagpipes though. Also, I think Keith Lockhart's poses are kind of girly on the CD case. But still, I thought the music was excelent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall pretty unremarkable","review":"The only thing missing from this album is some music from Titanic. Perhaps they couldn't get or afford the rights. Otherwise it has every Celtic cliché of the late 20th century. Anyway, if you have to have a Celtic album in your collection, this is as good as any other. At least it has Scotland The Brave.

Yey!Unfortunately, I think it's very difficult to find a good one of these anywhere, since HP does not make brand new ones anymore and you can only find refills.

It's too long, though. I'd say this book could be one third the size and be 10x more enjoyable. There are just too many very, very long descriptions of situations, people, places and items which are just plain boring. I found myself skipping over these long interludes.Also, I was disappointed in the end. Not because it didn't wrap everything up in a tidy little bundle, but because the thread he chose to resolve was the least interesting, in my opinion. There were lots of other threads that were completely unexplored. Perhaps the rest of them will be tied up or discussed more in future novels?

The main problem, I think, is that these four songs were recorded here without composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim's supervision, and that makes all the difference in the world. Left to his own devices, Mandy Patimkin greatly distorts \\"If You Can Find Me\\"'s melody; Bernadette Peters's voice is under the accompaniment on \\"I Remember\\" (although she's faithful to the song at least, unlike Patimkin and his arrangers), and the arrangements on \\"Dress Casual\\" are over-elaborate, gooey, and unrestrained. Neither singer effectively plays his character.I didn't care for the other stuff either, but that's your own lookout. Just don't do as I did; don't buy this for \\"Evening Primrose\\".

It was written, one supposes, to give a \\"woman's perspective\\" on TR, but gives that genre -- if it's a genre -- a bad name. World War One is given the same weight as the arrival of pet squirrels and children's coughs. We get a slab of family life and then a slab of contemporary politics, and then a slab of family life and so on throughout the book. There is no historical perspective or synthesis that might move the reader to a greater, more thoughtful, height. The only reason I give it two stars is that there is a great deal of fact in the book, and it isn't poorly written. But go somewhere else for a bio."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best biographies on TR","review":"I thought it might have been a big hype over how good this book could be but when I was done reading it, I realized how great this book turned out to be.The author, Kathleen Dalton, did a fantastic job in writing a honest biography on Theodore Roosevelt, a man which in many ways, a walking contradiction. TR's muliti-complex personality and behavior proves to be a impossible task for many historians to grasp but Kathleen Dalton make it look pretty easy.The author ensure that there was nothing simple or sternotypical about Theodore Roosevelt. In many ways, her work is quite comparable with Edmund Morris' work on TR although one author emphsis more on one subject matter compared to the other one.A must read book for anyone interested in the life and time of Theodore Roosevelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acclaimed \\"by far the best one volume biography\\" of TR","review":"The New York Review of Books has just praised Kathleen Dalton's book as \\"by far the best one volume biography\\" of Theodore Roosevelt!

The settings and everyday details of life in Joseph of Arimathea's world are so descriptive I felt like I was really there. But the author uses coincidence too much as a plot device. She also introduces details that seem unbelievable. Example: Ella tells others that at age 8 (or so) she \\"didn't know about God\\"--what? A child raised in a Jewish household two millenia ago didn't know about God? Also, NONE of the Phoenicians Joseph sailed with for years as a young man EVER find out that he has befriended the Celts, for which the (implied) punishment would have been Joseph's death. I also tired of reading about Joseph's sexual (mis)adventures--a lot of that seemed added in for titillation.

Most of the hits not included (\\"Big Shot\\", \\"Pressure\\") are ones I don't care to ever hear again. However, one egregious omission is \\"Only the Good Die Young,\\" so you need to also get the remastered version of \\"The Stranger,\\" which is worth having not only for that, but also for the title track and \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\" (also not included here)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATest hits!","review":"This cd only has three problems with it, it does not have: only the good die young, just a fantasy, and and so it goes. Other than that, this collection is the one to own. It condenses Vol. 1 and 2 and Vol. 3 on to one CD, and saves you the money of buying all three to get the hits on this one collection. So, go out and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Collection","review":"The Ultimate Collection being a double-disc compilation released 2000 and is a mix of pop, rock and adult contemporary. Here we get classic tracks such as \\"Just The Way You Are\\", \\"My Life\\", \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"We Didn't Start The Fire\\". All the lyrics are included and we also get well-written linernotes in the booklet written by Patrick Humphries. Allmusic gave this release 4.5 and I up the ante and give it a 5. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's Sister a Great Choice!","review":"This is an excellent tale for families on both sides of the adoption fence. Sam's Sister shows an endearing and insightful little girl's viewpoint and questions she has, about her younger sibling who will be adopted to another family. This is a side of adoption rarely seen in children's literature, and has been written in a very tender manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's Sister is an excellent book about adoption","review":"A great children's book for use with any children who are touched by adoption especially a young child a birthparent is already parenting. I bought a copy for our birthmother and kept one to read to our son to help him understand his birthfamily's feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adoption plan a child can understand","review":"This book helps expecting birthparents explain to their older child at home why they need to make an adoption plan. I recommend this book to all that are making an adoption plan, with an older child at home. I loved the compassionate approach Ms. Bond has taken in making a complex subject simplistic to a child's understanding. The illustrations are realistic and appropriate to the tone of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough resource, wish there was a second one!","review":"Follows a tried-and-true formula: mixed vocab, dialogues, and applications, with important language points interspersed throughout the book. Good transliterations, perhaps a few minor errors, as a previous reviewer pointed out (but, as a learner of the language, you feel kind of cool when you find the discrepancies! Well, I do... erm...) I didn't see anything in this book that warranted taking away a star. The variety of subjects covered in this book is a welcome feature, and the cultural notes add to the feeling of completeness.Excellent for laying the foundations of understanding, and gets you pretty comfortable with forming sentences. Very recommended. I don't think there's a second book, but I'd definitely buy it if there was. I only wish my paperback copy from Borders had included the audio CD... Would be very nice to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrew course for beginners moves quickly into advanced mode","review":"My Hebrew tutor loaned me his copy of the course, and I found it so useful that I purchased my own copy. It starts with basics but then advances quickly. The lessons are compact and require review several times over in order to become proficient. The accompanying book is necessary for the first time or two, but after that listening to the CD's alone is instructive. Mastery of this course will place you far beyond the beginner stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colloquial Hebrew","review":"I agree with the other oppinions that this is probably the best Hebrew textbook for those who can speak or understand English. Anyway, it could be better if all units had a parallel English translation, not only these from 1 to 8; and the transliterations for units 10-14 were placed after the corresponding texts, not at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable CD","review":"When the package arrived, I opened it up to discover two CDs in a standard \\"Double CD\\" crystal case, but both of the CDs were COMPLETELY UNREADABLE, not from any obvious defect like damage related to shipping, but much more likely because they weren't even formatted to start with.So far as I can tell, both of the CDs are completely blank, and have no tracks on them at all.On one side there is a label, and on the other side a nice shiny surface. So at least they had the courage to put their name on the CDs.But there simply isn't any data on either of them.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the name dropping, a great listen","review":"This CD leaves you wanting more. You like Paul DeLay's harmonica, you'll want more harmonica. You like his singing, you want more Paul vocals. You like his selection of band members, you will want to hear more of each of them. While this is a showcase for Paul Delay, he generously gives up the spotlight to other players/vocalists while still letting you hear the DeLay touch. I think a highlight of this CD is Zora Young singing \\"Come On Home\\". A great song with a plot twist ! And now I'm trying to find more Zora Young. You can tell that Paul is excited to write and perform with a different band, but I could do without the kitschy intro device on \\"El Train\\". The song is good enough without it. DeLay continues to provide great blues with a special edge for today's listeners. Don't forget to pay attention to Jimmy Dawkins' guitar and Sho Komiya's bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"deLay Does Chicago","review":"Save your money on this dud. DeLay is a great lyricist, vocalist, and harp player but his talents are wasted \\"getting back to his roots\\". He is much too improvisational to perform this tripe. More jazz than blues and loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"I've had this book on my Kindle for several weeks and just started reading it yesterday. Synge's word pictures of old Ireland are beautiful. His writing, subject and style, remind me of Horace Kephart who wrote Our Southern Highlands.

It could be tinned copper, or aluminum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product it misrepresented - DO NOT BUY without reading reviews","review":"This product is grossly misrepresented.

I was short by 4' so now I need to but another roll and make up the difference, not VERY happy! with this at all. I had a feeling I should have unreeled and cut what I needed first then do the tinning. but that was not the case.Other than that the wire seems to be good quality, just not enough of it to do the job right.Be careful if you need 50' order two reels instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"true 12 guage wire / not a full 50ft","review":"In my mind, as long as the guage is accurate, speaker wire is speaker wire.

To me, it is terribly conceited to assume that a regular Joe, a person with a passing interest (and a regular job) would go hunting down doctoral theses or academic publications, as though anything less were childish or sensationalist. Most people read to find out, and find out they will with this book.In terms of accuracy and organization, this book seems to be very well put-together. As another reviewer shrewdly noted, it only takes one proven inconsistency to shatter the biblical infallability notion, and Callahan has plenty more than that.If you've ever wondered what to say when real Bible believers start throwing prophecy and its fulfillment at you, this is a great place to start...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred prophesy or poppycock?","review":"By an intelligent theological layman for other intelligent members of the laity, this brief but scholarly book unmasks the deceits routinely practiced by Orthodox Jewish and Christian fundamentalists. Critical in the best sense of that term--i.e., consistently using his formidable analytical reasoning powers--Callhan makes mincemeat of the sophistry offered by true believers to buttress their beliefs in supernatural magic. A fine addition to any skeptic's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring read","review":"I purchased this book expecting it to be an enjoyable read and see how unbelievable the christian beliefs are, just to amuse myself. What I got was a book written by a layman not for laymans, inside were page after page of tedious, painstaking presentations of the history of Israel, detailed analysis of the social conditions etc. that fit more for a student of bible criticism. Actually background info. about the prophecies are necessary and required, but to present it in such a tediously detailed manner only kills the interests of the average reader.

If you are interested in understanding more the rich meaning and implication of this crucial doctrine to Christian life both from the side of Catholics and Protestants, this book definitely meet your needs. It helps me a lot in making sound judgment on the issue whether there's really no fundamental difference between Karl Barth and the council of Trent (in general between Protestant tradition and Catholic Church) on the teaching of Christian doctrine of justification by faith, as Hans Kung had calimed that over thirty years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justification","review":"This is a necessary read for anyone working with the concept of Justification.

Courage, self-sacrifice, and luck determine survival.

The album 'Sanctuary' is the best yet from this new age medieval chant group.

This is the best from Magna Canta to date and in my personal opinion it has leaped over Lesiem in originality and execution of all the blends of styles and beats. The song 'Lux Lucies' is a prime example, dance beats with harmonious gregorian chants.This is now a favourite CD of mine and is in my top 20 CD list of most listened.

It's easy to drink and is very relaxing. As far as price, which I noticed some other reviewers complaining about, I think it's worth it if you know anything about Numi.

While the story starts with 2 best friends and a woman they both loved in 18th century Africa, the journeys their descendants take introduce us to the budding jazz movement and beyond. Unfolding the branches of the family trees through the generations and unraveling how they each descended from the 3 original Africans in the midst of all the music and tribal magic kept me turning the pages.I would have liked more details rather than passing references to Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, King Oliver, and Fate Marable, but that would be my only criticism of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"It is difficult to write outside of one's own idiom, and this book demonstrates this clearly. The so called African passages are entirely contrived - the names, the cultural references, the characters and the ceremonies are totally devoid of any depth of feeling and context. The other parts naturally flow from this. Clearly,the context is alien to the writer, and a lot of the dialogue and the descriptions for the African American/New Orleans experience border on being downright offensive. References to Jigs, bush negroes etc are out of context and culturally irrelevant. A compelling story, but perhaps readers would be better served by reading a biography of Louis Armstrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Neal","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. As usual, Neal Stephenson has served a delightful mix of technology and speculation that ties in with a slightly off-center cast to make a highly entertaining story. However, it suffers from the problem that much of his work does. The ending is abrupt, although not to the same extent as The Diamond Age. If the finish was executed better, this would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Read!!","review":"This book will satisfy every type of reader,from the historical fiction fan to the science fiction fan to the corporate drone who likes to dream. It is a book that spans half a century, from Japan in WWII to to the Phillipines today. It is a romance, an epic, a war story,and a business story.I have two critiques to make about it, however. It instoduces a fascinating female character who is plenty strong, then undermines her and makes her as weak as stereotypes would dictate.The ending is open, and makes me wonder what either possibility means.That's it. Otherwise, it is interesting, captivating, and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid writing, almost always interesting, funny","review":"Good plot, writing and characters. Terribly funny (one of the best I've read in awhile). A bit contrived at points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Read","review":"This is a fascinating read. Well researched, and the characters are very human. I made the mistake of starting this book when I was pregnant. Once into the book I realized that it was not the funny, light hearted (albeit stimulating) book that \\"Snow Crash\\" was. I put the book down thinking that I would read something less 'head heavy'. After obsessing over what I had read so far, I knew it was a lost cause. I finished the book two weeks before my baby was born.

Each chapter did leave me feeling tantalized and somewhat experienced.I thought I was ejnoying myself, as it turns out - I really wasn't. After about 50 pages, I found myself cringing with doubt every other chapter. Is it just a dream sequence - or is it a time jump?Getting to the heart of the story is allot like deciphering a code that you did not agree to look at.If you enjoy that sort of thing, and want to read a 900 pg book filled with very interesting side notes, and the author holds the plot over your head like a bully's game of keep away, then dive in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, but THIS IS IN GERMAN","review":"This book is sublime. It is fiction in the sense that none of the events depicted actually happened, but it is true in a deeper sense in that something like it almost assuredly did. BUT THIS IS IN GERMAN!!! The irony of reading Cryptonomicon in German is not lost on me, but I would like that to have been clearer. I know it is in the \\"Language\\" section of the description, but I think something as important as that could have a more descriptive listing. Why would the German language be the first one to come up anyway? Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel best left on the shelf","review":"Neal Stephenson's writing may appeal to some readers, but not this one. I review a lot of books and rarely if ever do I find one I just can't finish! Enter Crytonomicon. This was just a terribly uninteresting, intellectually vacuous piece of literature. It seemed to flop all over with disconnected rambling and boring episodes; although initially the beginning of the novel seemed okay, it progressively got worse as I read on.I don't know whether the novel ever recovers as the end approaches, I couldn't get there. As a consequence of the extreme difficulty I had with the book, I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. You will have to decide for yourself whether you will take the leap and read it. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One book too many","review":"This is the title that closes the chapter on Stephenson for me. I'd enjoyed Snow Crash enough to overlook the accumulating cuteness that gooed up the end, and I found sufficient merit in Diamond Age to offset the even larger splashes of the same defect marring that volume. Despite its ambitious conception, however, Cryptonomicon is a showcase of sloppy writing and errors of fact. The tone throughout is cleverness so precious it gags. Cute. It's just so preciously cute. Disappointment is compounded when a talented writer mistakes energy for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading it with about 50 pages left....","review":"Have you ever kept reading a book just because you had already invested so much time into it you feel like you have to?

He should have cut out the sub-plot of Bobby Shaftoe and sold it as a separate book...it would have actually been good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a little too long","review":"This is a great book and was very enjoyable to read, a real page-turner like a good Clancy or King book that you can't put down. However, at around page 500, I just wanted this book to be over. I really wanted to find out how the story ends and find out what happened to the characters, otherwise I probably would have stopped reading the book (which I'm glad I did), but in the middle of the book it seemed more like the quest for the Holy Grail than a book.The details in the book are amazing, Stephenson's sure done his research. Most sci-fi books are lite on true facts, just throwing in mumbo-jumbo to make it sound techie, but this book has the technical details right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal gets it right.","review":"I read both \\"Snow Crash\\" and \\"The Diamond Age\\" and had the same feelings about both: amazingly interesting concepts, good execution for the first 75%, and then a complete and total collapse in the final chapters. With \\"Cryptonomicon\\", Neal Stephenson finally gets it right. This book is an absorbing read from cover to cover and combines fiction with history and technical details in an extremely entertaining way.Now if only he'd go back and re-write the endings of his other two books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The characters all seemed the same","review":"A seminal work /that I just couldn't get through /I'm a geek failure"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exquisitely Crafted Tale","review":"\\"Cryptonomicon,\\" like much of Neal Stephenson's work, defies easy description. His ideas are so involved and interwoven with the text, it can be difficult to unravel the story as a whole. \\"Cryptonomicon\\" deals with the ideas of codebreaking, information security, Holocaust morality, global economics, the evolution of mythology, and the inherent insanity of war. He includes complex descriptions of encryption schemes and expositions of many complicated ideas, yet somehow manages to maintain a slick narrative.I really cannot praise Stephenson's literary genius enough. Having read five of his books now (\\"Cryptonomicon,\\" the Baroque Cycle, and \\"Snow Crash\\") I feel that \\"Cryptonomicon\\" is second only to \\"Snow Crash,\\" and vastly superior to many books I have read. He manages his multiple-perspective narrative skillfully and creates fascinating characters in a wholly believable world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took me a year but it was worth it","review":"Enjoying a writer is not a passive process. One has to work at it and here one does. At over 900 pages with many diversions and side stories the story all comes together. The plot is very straightforward and the narrative is easy to follow. I learned a great deal more than I already known about many issues - cryptography, ww2, philippines and much more. There were some real laugh out loud moments. This is a book that will stay in my head. I'd rather have 900 pages of this than 10 books of mediocre nonsense. I was sad to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Stephenson's most satisfying novel yet","review":"Be warned! This book WILL consume your free time, and probably start stealing your sleep. At over 900 pages, it's a hefty read, but I'm glad Neal Stephenson was able to get the entire length published. Not a word is wasted.My grandfather was a cryptologist in WWII, part of the Asiatic fleet, and so this book had particular relevance for me. I have shared this book with him, as well as many hours of discussions and tangents as a result.For the reader who enjoys Cryptonomicon, I also suggest as further reading:Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park by Hinsley and StrippandThe Puzzle Palace by James Bamford"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievably good book","review":"As a writer, there are very few books that awe me. Cryptonomicon is one of those few. I've been pushing this book on everyone I know. I knew Stephenson was a good writer from reading Snow Crash, but I never would have guessed the depth of his genius until Cryptonomicon. In many ways, this book reminds me of another novel that awed me -- Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Perhaps it's the surreal WWII setting. More likely it's the amazing genius evidenced by both books.So what's the downside of reading this book? Well, if you're a writer, you'll come out of it convinced you should just give up and leave the novel writing to Stephenson, because you just KNOW there's no way you'll ever write anything near as good. Neal Stephenson, you've just made your way onto my Top Ten People I Want to Meet list. I can't imagine the fascinating conversations you could get into with this guy! Amazing writer, amazing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I received this book from a friend who said he could not put it down. I am sorry to say that I have 50 pages left to ready and I find it painful to pick up. The book an interesting historical side to it, but beyond that it frequently wanders off into irrelevant tangents that are excruciatingly painful to slog through. Cryptomonicon turns a tale that can be portrayed in 300 pages into a 900 page novel full of noise. The author feels compelled to fill the book with statistical techno-babble that is interesting the first time but annoying as the book proceeds. For the last 300 pages of the book I have skipped entire sections of the book when I encounter one of the author's fits-of-jabbering over some trivial point in the book. Finally, the author's 3rd person writing technique reminds me of my own dismal attempt at writing in six grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Stephenson's next sci-fi -- this one's not it.","review":"Totally unlike Snow Crash or Diamond Age, this novel lacks any sci-fi imagination and instead is a disjointed journey from WW2 cryptography to modern data warehousing.

Also there are typos in the book a spell checker would catch."},{"rating":"1","title":"800+ pages of bad road","review":"While I like Stephenson's earlier work, I don't much care for his latest attempt at literature. With convoluted interlocking plotlines, sketchy charecterization, obscure math jokes, patronizing footnotes, and the most inexplicable sex scene I have ever run across, this doorstop of a novel was not the pleasure I had hoped for. A groundbreaking work in the field of literature intended exclusively for hard-core coders."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an absolute delight.","review":"I hate to write \\"reviews\\" because it implies that I'm in qualified to judge the text in some way. I have no business criticizing anyone's literary work, but I can't resist sharing how much I enjoyed this book. Every now and then I stumble onto a book that's so fresh and so much fun that it's a genuine treat. That's what this one was for me. After reading the 900+ pages, I asked myself what really happened in the book. Well, everything and nothing happened. How a book so economical on plot can be so exorbitant on compelling storytelling is a mystery to me. Boggles my mind. I can't recall another book that taught me just as much as it made me laugh. I'm really struggling to avoid the \\"journey is it's own reward\\" cliché, but I can't do it. It's the truth. I was sad when the journey ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"A truly enjoyable read! I found the story compelling (though it may be a bit technical for some readers). Even the book's digressions were packed full of inspired ideas and arcane historic fact.

Ludlum et al couldn't carry Stephenson's mouse pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Asiatic view","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Stephenson's engaging novel. This despite the typos. The strength of the novel is the way plots are interlaced and in the power of description, specially the scenes in Manila.

Loved The technology angles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is bad! (Sorry, Neil)","review":"First, I must be honest. I only managed to complete 732 pages of the 900+ in this book. (I swear, each night more pages seemed to be added.) I am an avid reader, probably my biggest vice. I even made it all the way through \\"The Bell Curve.\\" However, this is the first book that I have ever stopped reading because it was so badly written, so badly constructed, and had such weak character definition. I kept checking my wine glass for traces of a mind-altering drug, the book was so bad. Please, please don't buy this thing. It stunk, to use the vernacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to quit","review":"I am 38 years old, and have read hundreds of science fiction books. This is the first one I was unable to finish.

The back cover suggested a really cool story, but many of those elements are not introduced until 200 pages in. By 400, only halfway through, I could not go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"has a major problem","review":"Stephenson has some really good works out there, this isn't one of them.

For a better Stephenson novel try Snow Crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, SELF-INDULGENT, BORING","review":"This book was an incredible disappointment. The plot was VERY thin, not even as interesting as the jacket blurb. The style was self-indulgent, as if the author took his diary/journal and worked every buzz-concept and wired side box he had ever heard and melded it together with banal dialog. I took this on a 12 hour flight to London, and wanted to jump out of the plane after three hours. Terrible in concept, terrible in detail.

Comparisons to Gravity's Rainbow may make good copy, but the idea is laughable and absurd. Pynchon is a serious artist and novelist. Stephenson is a word-drunk, abeit clever, pretender. True art should teach, not simply flaunt itself on the back of the latest \\"hot-button\\" techno-craze. Unfortunately, a serious waste of time and space. Relentlessly unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and pointless","review":"I couldn't finish this book, finding I had no desire to read any more after I got about halfway through. There are several concurrent storylines, none of which have anything to do with each other except in the most peripheral sense. The book spends so much time plodding along, I found I had a surge of excitement when he finally got to the announcement of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. At last, something was happening! Unfortunately, the next page began \\"Three months later,\\".

Turns out I was happily turning pages all the way to the end. Like Stephenson's other books it's built around an interesting view of the future, in this case an \\"off-shore data bank\\" service that depends on excellent crytography. The book is really two separate but related stories, one set in WWII and one a bit in the future, with the text jumping back and forth between them. Now, if someone had told me that before I started I would have groaned, but Stephenson holds it all together and makes it work beautifully. Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book edition - beware!","review":"A great book, but beware - the \\"unabridged\\" audio book edition is actually \\"unabridged excerpts\\" from the book Cryptonomicon.

The WWII parts of the book are often hilarious and have a 'Catch-22' tone to them. The portion of the story set in the present varies in quality from blah to excellent. A firm editor that limited Stephenson to perhaps 700 pages would have made for a better pace without sacrificing all of his exquisitely detailed digressions. I found the novel as a whole very entertaining and erudite, and would reccommend it to anyone, with the caveat that some undergraduate history classes and a little math make the book a much more fulfilling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"High entertainment","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish, and went right to the computer to order more books by the author.The style can be a little trying -- the metaphor density is about 6 to the page -- and it can get a little arch. Still, most of the flourishes are pretty fresh, while some are genuinely startling.One review on this site complained of the overly \\"freakish\\" characters. That's certainly fair. If your taste doesn't run to characters who are extreme outsiders, you won't enjoy the book. Personally, I found the characters engaging.Science fiction writers like to work a Theory of Everything into their plots. This author has a handful of Theories of Everything. I didn't mind. Most of the theories were interesting enough to serve as enhancements of the story rather than annoying digressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Coincidences","review":"Read this book on my son's advice.

I spent a few moments trying to properly pronounce the title. After reading the synopsis inside the covers, I was hooked. This book can be confusing & even more so the more you think about it. So, I just read and enjoyed myself. At times, I enjoyed the WWII segments more and other times I prefered the modern era more. Randy & Lawrence are protagonists are a bit more technically literate than average but are quite likeable and truly find yourself rooting for them. Their discussions with others can be deep and insightful but there is a humorous aspect that keeps everything enjoyable. Cryptography and history may not be the most interesting subjects but they are combined in such a way that you can't help but feel as if you've learned something. This book has stong sense of human nature (past & present), and technology, and where both are headed. I would recommend this book to all anyone who has an interest in either or both subject(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"kudos from a retired cryptanalyst","review":"A wonderful journey through history, personalities, and technology.

The arch antagonist (can't even remember his name) was like an afterthought, can't even be compared to Raven. The characters' preoccupation with sex was funny for a while, then got tedious.

And while I found his inability to write an ending only mildly exasperating with TDA, it was wholly unacceptable to me in this book. Because? It felt like nothing had happened. I know a lot of stuff happened around the characters, but Bobby and Randy and Amy didn't seem to grow from it. This is the one book of Stephenson's that I've read so far (up next, the Baroque cycle) where he's allowed the technology to overwhelm the characterization. It was disappointing, as he's always been excellent at balancing the two before."},{"rating":"1","title":"much weaker than Stephenson's other work","review":"I consider Snow Crash the best cyberpunk novel ever. Diamond Age was a bit weaker but still good. After reading the others I ran out to buy this book. Cryptonomicon is much weaker than these earlier works. The pace is slow and Snow Crash has more creative ideas on one page than this whole book on 400+ pages. I ended up selling it which I almost never do. I disagree with some of the other reviewers.

This book increased my fascination with the subject. Cryptonomicon is filled with excitement especially if you enjoy German, Japanese, and Math like I do. The book is filled with things that made me laugh out loud such as the geometry of Cap'N'Crunch, using a supercomputer decide who gets posessions, the mathematics of a bad bike, Bletchly Park sending messages so that the Germans would attack their own sub, and many more. I believe that the ending could have been better, however, I guess it was the only way to end it.

This adventure will leave you feeling good and wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! The best book I've read in a long time!!!","review":"Exhaustively discriptive in a similar way to Tom Clancy, I could not put this book down. I loved the way the story jumped between and successfully intertwined the WWII and present-day storylines, with all the main characters represented in both generations. The story itself was mesmerizing. I found myself laughing out loud at the dry humor of the characters and the author's comically sarcastic descriptions of people, places, and things. The third-person, present-tense style of writing feels like the author is sitting in your living room telling the story to you from personal experience. I loved the hell out of this book, and look forward to more if its true about it being the first in a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to disagree with most of you, but...","review":"I found this book very hard to get into, and in fact finally gave up on it after a very turgid 200+ pages. The author jumps from the 1940s to the 1990s at will and his characters are two dimensional and did not seem real to me. The story had to do with the creation of a \\"data haven\\" in the Phillipine Islands, but the author never fully explained the significance of a data haven or why it would be important. The editors should also do some fact checking. For example, I don't think the Special Air Service (in the British Military) existed during WWII. I had high hopes for this book as I worked in a related area while in the Air Force, but I was disappointed, and I'm afraid that many others will be as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This was a real waste of time...with very few rewards for allthe tedium. ...'vainglorius'...I totally agree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Math textbook or fictional novel?","review":"I did not think this book was poorly written, but I did think the story was dry as day-old toast.

The book could of been about 150 pages shorter, but still keeps the readers attention. The story goes back and forth between 2 men and their 2 grandkids in different times in history. Although this can be confusing sometimes, the ideas and concepts, like all Stephenson's work, is very timely. The hope for a \\"data haven\\" is something that is in the mind of every person, or will be after reading this book. All in all it's a very witty, real, and great written story. We'll see if he decides to make a series out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, But Well Worth It","review":"'Cryptonomicon' is a novel about cryptography. Sounds kinda boring right? This book is as far from boring as you can possibly get. It jumps back and forth between the present and the past - dealing with World War II and codes such as the enigma code/machine, and with modern cryptography and data protection issues. It takes these technical aspects and throws in adventure taking place on pratically every continent, likeable and interesting characters, and an excellent ending.These ingredients make this book hard to put down once you start reading it. Stephenson has perfected the technology-based adventure novel genre that Crichton started. If you like Crichton, and haven't read Stephenson yet, start reading this book today - you're missing out. Even though this book is a lot longer than your everyday novel, you still want more of it to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptonomicon: a cyberanarchists dream","review":"Well, it seems that Neal has done it again, made a damn fine read that is. The book starts a little slow, mingled with world war II anecdotes of sorts and cyber crime/business (arent they one and the same?). The dream is clear but the plot isnt, data heaven, a place for every high time crim to place their not-so-secure funds to make them 100% secure.The book has a tight plot with loose ends that are quickly bundled into a firm rigging. The end leaves a little to be desired, but I wont give it away. Just think cheesy. The end was the only reason I gave it 4. Otherwise it's a modem masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Stephenson's Best Work to Date","review":"This book grabbed my attention from almost the first page. Even though it's huge I read it in just under a week. The amazing story weaves through different times while still connecting within itself. I got a lot to think about from reading this book and it's full impact has probably not set in yet. Highly recommended, especially if you like his earlier work. (Snow Crash, for example.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a story of computer geeks stumbling onto history","review":"This is a story of World War II and a story of computer geeks stumbling onto history.Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is the main character. He has what may be Asperbgers syndrome. In college he meets Alan Turing and a German, they are all math wizs. The story in the book bounces around with several characters being important. It gets to the point you can see all the story lines will meet. It makes a really good story.The computer geeks are starting a company to do something and stumble onto scavenger treasure. The Japanese build a mountain of gold and bury it. This does get to be a bit of a complex story, and knowing that all the story lines come together, you read on to see where and how. It is most interesting that the author does introduce masturbation and sexual relief. You know that this stuff does happen, but authors do not generally bother to mention it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptonomican","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

Stephenson weaves the story back and forth through time and place expertly.This is a big story, with tons of details and characters.

I really wish it had a better ending -- there were a lot of little strings that didn't quite get tied up, but at least he got the major strings, which is definitely an accomplishment.The most interesting thing about this book is that the central concept is coming true...or perhaps it's just *going* to come true. Whatever happens, it'll change the world.Worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"made it to page 150...","review":"chalk it up to A.D.D. The beginning for the first 50 pages held my interest then it didn't interest me. The WW II aspect of the story started off interesting. I did not care for the modern characters.

To me this was a five star read, BUT I expect that for readers without a current subscription to Cryptologica it might be considered a difficult read.I would therefore rate it with 5 stars for those with a computer science and cryptography background, 4 stars for those with a computer science background alone, and 3 stars for those willing to dedicate the time to learn both on the fly.GVS OM"},{"rating":"1","title":"1st half: brilliant; 2nd half: severely wanting","review":"This novel starts off as a brilliant exploration of determinism and randomness. The characters bounce from one part of the 2nd World War to another, often with little idea as to why they've been told to do the things they've been ordered to do. The whole aura of the writing is distinctly Pynchonesque, although with not as much satire.But, by the end of the 1st half of the book, Stephenson's origins as a thriller writer really start to come to the fore. It seems that he can't help but put in a rather cheesy plotline about treasure-finding. A disappointment after such high hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Slog","review":"Picked this up with high expectation--disappointment grew with each passing page.

It's difficult to hold in your hand, even, like an overstuffed sandwich. It's also difficult to slog through because it's so slow and irrelevant in so many places, has many anachronisms (careless on research other than endless tech details), and filled with overwritten, convoluted prose. Some of it is interesting, much of it is clever, all of it should have been cut by half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Disappointing (but still a Stephenson fan)","review":"I like everything Stephenson has written -- until now. This book needed the hand of a strong editor. The story was conceptually engaging, but I was disappointed by the cluttered writing, distracting tangents, and (in too many cases) absurd and stilted dialog. Even more distracting, however, was the sheer volume of typographic errors. The book was clearly spell-checked by a computer, but... if eye had two reed won moor page wit miss spelled oar wrong lee used words, I thought I was going to scream! I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but this was truly ridiculous!Either someone is getting too big for his britches and refused the help of an editor or someone else was clearly in too much of a hurry to get this book onto the market.Save your money and wait for the paperback -- maybe Avon Books will have hired a good old-fashioned proof reader by then (if not an honest editor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the coolest book I've ever read","review":"I've read Cryptonomicon twice now and am convinced that while this is very tough read, it is both highly entertaining and extremely educational. Stephenson has a tendency to weigh the reader down with minutae, but it's the kind of information that'll make you hit the internet to learn even more about. The plot switches back and forth between two eras: 1940s in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of WWII and in present day. If you're a technically minded person interested in historical fiction, cryptography, and the evolution of currency (i know, sounds weird but is highly interesting written by Stephenson), this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptonomicon is a great read","review":"Fast-paced and funny, Cryptonomicon deftly zips through multiple generations and subplots. The storylines are vast and intricate, and the synchronicities are resolved even more neatly than in NS's previous novels (which I loved).While Cryptonomicon isn't science fiction (it's more like Zodiac than Snow Crash or Diamond Age), it does have a high geek quotient; the main characters break into elaborate mathematical expressions as if they were songs in a Broadway musical. Equations and graphs are used to develop funny and endearing characters (really!). If NS wrote textbooks, I'd have looked forward to my 8am calculus class.I missed the clever gadgetry and stunning imagery of Snow Crash and The Diamond Age, but I think Cryptonomicon is probably the best whole work yet from NS. The story sustains itself consistently, and it's a great read all the way through; as complex as the plot got, I never found myself floundering in the story's wake.Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptonomicon","review":"Neil Stephenson is operating in another dimension from the rest of us. This book, which is probably his best, not only keeps you guessing, it makes you think as you go on. A delight to read w/ fresh, direct storytelling dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, gripping read","review":"Wow - what a trip. Kept me engrossed for a week. Don't get put off by what some of the other reviews have said - the book is not too long (but then again my previous book was Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy which is substantially longer - so maybe I'm a sucker for punishment).The small details MAKE the book. Take the time to read the math sections slowly and don't skip them as others have suggested - you'll actually learn something.I have to admit the ending was weak which turned a 5* book into a 4* - but the rest is well worth the trip. Can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes nowhere.","review":"For the 910 page investment you get no payoff. His writing is witty and clever but way too wandering.

It's like watching the charactors go shopping for 910 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon to be an NBC miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain","review":"Ignore the comparisons to Pynchon and David Foster Wallace; what \\"Cryptonomicon\\" really is, is a next-generation James Clavell novel -- \\"Shogun,\\" (or, more aptly, \\"Noble House\\") with Internet access. As other reviewers have noted, this is something of a departure for Stephenson, and readers expecting \\"Snow Crash II\\" or \\"Diamond Age II\\" are likely to be disappointed. But it's their loss -- this is a fun, engrossing yarn, and I can't wait to see where he takes it in the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding especially if you have technical skills","review":"Being over a 1000 pages may put some people off this book but it was an amazing read and wished it had gone for couple of hundred extra (it seemed rushed at the end). It may seem chopped between multiple dissimilar plot lines over a complex array of characters but the underlying pattern locks into place. Like the rich puzzle the book actually is. The rich plot lines are added to by a detailed technical aspect of the book which may have you cracking the pages of \\"applied crypto\\" by schneier. Though it work perfectly well without knowing that book. I have not enjoyed a book as much since the \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, but it isn't another Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has managed to release another great book, once again incredibly well-researched.

I never really thought cryptography could be interesting, but it was..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Addictive Experience!","review":"Who would have thought that a book full of equations would be a great read? Very different from Snow Crash. I wasn't much of a crypto buff before I read the book... but I am now! I LOVED the description of the Capn' Crunch dining experience: a 3 page exploration of the taste sensation of one of my favorite cereals. Also, he deftly skewers all technology start-ups with his brilliant summary of the biz planning and money raising process. I'll use his template for my next plan.

It's about as engrossing after page 10 as it is after page 890. (& I kept thinking it had to get better!)

Stephenson can just about make the reader not care about the outcome of WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 1152 pages?","review":"Mass Market Paperback: 1168 pages - mine only has 1152.

Well, this is one of those, but it doesn't. The novel's template/structure is based on an array. But it's an array with a heavy loading of plot(s). I liked \\"Snow Crash.\\" (his breakout book). But it had its gonzo/WWF excesses. This book is more reasonably excessive. (ex: The oxymoron as a point of praise) If you buy the book & don't like it, you've at least got a nice looking doorstop for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Picking up this book is daunting at almost 1,000 pages. However, I soon came to dread the end of the book; a great--and rare for me--sign that I'm enjoying the hell out of a book. Diamond Age it ain't, but one can hardly blame Stephenson for failing to top that masterpiece.The story and characters are very interesting and believable. Stephenson is in rare form in Cryptonomicon, with his wry humor and penchant for balancing hyperbole with understatement. The story soon sucked me in and had me laughing out loud at times.If the book has a flaw, it has to be with the spell checking. Seriously. Where the hell was Stephenson's editor? I found no fewer than 6 typos (I'm sure there were more) that, ironically, were caught by Stephenson's spell-checking program but not by the human editor who is supposed to ketch such thongs.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is involved with technology, be it working in the industry or just fascinated by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid read, absolutely riveting, but the ending ??","review":"As noted above, a great book, a great read and very stimulating. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the whole essence of the book, but as noted by some other reviewers, the ending kind of \\"damp squibbed\\" me a bit. I didn't want to finish it; I do hope he writes a sequel - but will it actually tell us where the story is going?The crypto is excellent and the use of the first person really draws you into the book; however Andrew Loeb's character is sorely underused and relatively unexplained and then completely discarded, and the germans in the book get a poor run (Rudy and Bischoff; did he survive?)Ah, well, still a great book and well worth the extra shipping to read in the UK before it gets out here. Buy it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing, intellectual novel","review":"From the onset of this novel I was engrossed. The characters are slow to develop but part of the enjoyment of reading is the depth that they develop as the story builds.

This is a novel that will appeal to left brain thinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Long, Very Boring","review":"Snowcrash was a work of rare brilliance.

He regularly goes off on worthless tangents which provide nothing to the story. The characters are not at all believable, nor consistent nor well supported by background detail. At one point a character dies then magically reappears later in the story. Then there's this bad guy who shows up in the middle of jungle in a suit and tie and no real reason to be there to wreak havoc and invent some real conflict in this slow moving waste of a book.SKIP THIS ONE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever heard of a plot?","review":"After reading Snow Crash and loving it, I was very interested in reading this book.

The features of the book that are lauded in the reviews are not present in the audio version."},{"rating":"2","title":"gustav8191","review":"Having read so many complaints about the book's ending, I feel compelled to throw in my own two cents (without giving anything away). I thought the very ending-- with the symbolic and poetic power of its final image, with its resonance with (and contrast to) the claustrophobic secrecy of the whole book up to that point-- as well as a further development of the Lord of the Rings resonance-- was beautiful.Not the greatest book I've ever read; it certainly pales compared to Gravity's Rainbow (which this book feels like, at least for the first half).

This book needed an editor BADLY. It's hugely over-written; so much so that characters and plot threads disappear; some drop out altogether. However, it seems that in our culture Bigger is Better and this book has everything in it including the kitchen sink.

I would also add: modesty. Read something else ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was bored all the way through but kept thinking it would get better with all the reviews.

I only lasted 53 pages, or until I got to this zinger of sentence: \\"Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't.\\" Oh, the tension. Stephenson attempts to write a cross-generational, wide-reaching tome of Pynchon-esque proportions, but misses by a wide, wide mark. And then, after basing his title on the work of the great H.P. Lovecraft (Necronomicon), he admits to never having read H.P.L.!?! The cover blurb of my borrowed (and soon to be returned) copy quotes the Washington Post Book World: \\"Intoxicating.\\" Perhaps it should read Intoxication required. Despite all the glowing reviews here, my recommendation is skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about overblown!","review":"This book is fine. Nothing spectacular about it. Those who have compared Stephenson's now more digressive style to Pynchon or Dilillo are either big fans of Stephenson, or are intentionally denegrating postmodernism. This book reads like any other long and well researched piece of genre fiction. Comparisons to Clancy are apt. It's unlikely that anyone will be dazzled by Stephenson's wit or his genius, though they may eventually be bored by his plodding and repetitive and relatively simplistic style. I wish this book had lived up to it's press. We need another Great American Author -- unfortunately Stephenson isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes nowhere","review":"Whereas I found the premise interesting, Stephenson's novel falls apart due to implausible characters and a shaky plot. Instead of building a strong, convincing story in the 900+ page devoted to Cryptonomicon, the author chooses to spend chapter after chapter describing technical jargon and cryptography gimmicks that, in many cases, have little to do with the actual story. This over-attention to detail would be forgivable if the plot actually went somewhere, but the novel doesn't seem to have much of a point until around page 850. Even then, I found the ending to be horribly anti-climactic and left feeling completely underwhelmed and unsatisfied.In short, a passable book if you find yourself really bored or interested in code-breaking, but a waste of time for the casual reader who enjoys a plot or, if nothing else, a point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun!","review":"This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey is the reward, not the ending.","review":"I found the ending of this 918 page book to be something of a let down, but the journey was most rewarding. One of the most irksome things was that a character crucial to the ending (Andrew) was barely covered in the early portions of the book. Andrew needed more fleshing out.The author left plenty of avenues to explore in a sequel. I hope Mr. Stephenson does so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptography over Three Generations","review":"This tome by my current favourite author is, can you guess?, amazing. The book runs like I think; a stream of consciousness (at times) adventure that covers three generations, and jumps back and forth between World War II and present day. The book's main topic: cryptography and the ethics of the whole arrangement appealed to me. As did the extensive use of crackers and computers. I greatly enjoyed this book. There was a great deal going on; and the author's use of language (especially for humour) is awesome. I think this is a fringe book; for those who like computers. Although there is enough war time action to tide another audience (military buffs) over between what might be perceived as dry bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"p 434","review":"My first Stephenson book, and maybe my last. I was interested to read other reviews that indicated that this book was not reflective of his talent. I certainly hope not.The book was overwritten and boring. At page 434, I had invested some time but I just could not care what happens to these boring people in their mechanical lives. Where's the story, I kept on thinking to myself, this will get better, there is so much potential here. I can't help but feel that if he edited the book down to 434 pages, it could have been a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good editor could have done wonders. And should have.","review":"Stephenson seems to have gotten in the good graces of his publisher to an extent where no one reined him in. The premise was great; the characters fascinating and then the book dribbles to a nonsensical conclusion as if Stephenson really didn't care that much and wanted to move on. Too bad as it's now a huge blemish on his reputation. Hope the next one is tighter. Hear this Neal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book disappointing ending","review":"i loved this book, found almost every page to be a pleasure. I loved the length and the complexity. I was, however, disappointed with the ending. In fact, it didn't really make sense. why write this fantastic 900 page tome, and then pay so little attention to the ending? Suffice it to say that the closing scenes and the ultimate villain just weren't believable. it seemed like stephenson was just tired of the book and wanted it to be over. i also agree with the reviewer who was irritated by the loose ends. Who WAS responsible for putting randy in prison? If it is the person who seems like the only possibility, it is hard to understand how he had that kind of power. Next time, stephenson should take a break if he gets tired, but come through with a better finish. p.s. i love lawrence pritchard waterhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big book that is worth the effort","review":"This is one hell of a story. Somehow, Stephenson weaves a World War II plot about breaking German codes with a twentieth-century plot about a group of would-be entrepreneurs setting up an off-shore \\"data haven.\\" Did I mention buried treasure was involved? Yes its almost 1,000 pages long, but the story will make you feel smart and entertain you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I was skeptical to read this book for two reasons: size, too many technological words in Diamond Age (his last book). Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. Somehow I polished it off in a week.It is well worth getting through it. A friend mentioned that he couldn't get past the 250 page mark. I urge you to read on. Once the story comes together it is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book, but then this. The plot is lame, the characters lack any depth, and Stephenson's normally superb writing style is at its worst. Only halfway through the book, the general idea becomes clear. After that you hope for something to happen but the story doesn't take off. The worst thing is that dozens of pages are devoted to absolutely irrelevant topics (eating cereals!). The only good part about this book is the good explanation of crypto-systems but then you don't buy a novel to read about technical details. Conclusion: Don't buy this book. Go and read Zodiac, Snow Crash, or Diamond Age, they are a lot better. (Hopefully Stephenson's next book will rise up the old level of writing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, very long","review":"If someone should ever ask me about Cryptonomicon, frankly I cannot imagine an answer better than \\"Well, it's a very long book...\\". It is my first book from Stephenson (and probably the last one) and my opinion is that a writer should be less presumptuous and should not release a 918 pages volume before being prepared to that. The story is too fragmented, the plot - if any - is not tangible, and there is an evident intention to reach the 900 pages target. The same subject is covered in 1996 Robert Harris' novel, Enigma, in a better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordy but provocative","review":"Right. By now you know that he could have cut out several of the Stephen-King-reminiscent verbosity, but for idea generation it's a gem. The way he deconstructs academia is worth the read alone. I agree that it will appeal only to certain types (the scientifically inclined and hackers, nerds and literati) but for those it will thrill. Stephenson is showing real signs of improvement; this exceeds Snow Crash or Diamond Age by leagues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of promise, never gets going","review":"This is the first book I have ever failed to finish. This is out of thousands upon thousands of books, I read nearly continually. I've read long meandering epics etc. and loved them, but this one just did not have anything going for it.I only made it to page 300 and the entire time I was wondering when a plot was going to be presented to the reader, a central story. A REASON to keep reading beyond just reading about these completely separated characters in two different time periods. I kept thinking that the story was going to get started after the author introduced the characters a bit more, but at page 300 I realized that this was all the book was going to be . . . character introduction and lots of it.Maybe these characters all tie together in a wonderful and thought provoking way around page 1000 or so, but I'll never know because the author never gave me a reason to want to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sprawling powerhouse of a book - a 'must-read'...","review":"Stephenson is once again showing his chops. The comparisons to Dickens (even absent the cutesy intentional anachronistic neo-Victorian touches of The Diamond Age) are becoming almost cliche but ring true.Considering the challenges of a 900+ page book (cf. Infinite Jest, the Otherland series), the fact it takes place in two intertwined time-lines, throw in the present tense, multiple POVs, use of historically real characters (Turing, Reagan...), scientifically valid yet readable expositions of cryptography, van Eck phreaking, and the Riemannian zeta function -- you got to give the guy credit for hanging it all together pretty darn well.I usually rush through books in a single sitting, but this one I'm savoring as I go (so I'm really only reviewing the first 400 pages - a normal book!) It's got a lot to chew on and is *amazingly* stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Also October 1999 National Geographic Magazine","review":"For a fascinating nonfiction glimpse into the salvage of a Japanese submarine carrying war gold between Japan and Germany, read the article entitled, \\"The Last Dive of I-52.\\" The parallels are stunning, and I can't help but wonder how much of this true story Stephenson was aware of when writing his book. The lead technical contractor for the salvage operation was Seattle-based Sound Ocean Systems and the dust jacket tells us Stephenson lives \\"in the Pacific Northwest.\\"National Geographic's teaser above the title of the article sets the stage: World war II in the Atlantic...German U-boats...Secret Codes...Gold Bullion...A Rendezvous at Sea...American Flyboys..Sudden Death...A Salvage Hunter...The Lust for Gold...And a Japanese Sub on...THE LAST DIVE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"Great book and very timely for me. The comments involving Asia travel were hilarious, as I was reading on a trip in Asia. I was sad to get to the end of the book.Up there with Snow crash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate!","review":"Don't waste time with this review, buy the book NOW! Delightfully convoluted! Neal can't seem to keep his eye on the plot for more than a couple of pages, but you don't mind, because his departures are always entertaining, and they usually set a point of reference for later asides and references in the book. Case in point, throughout the book he describes old, heirloom quality furniture as \\"Gordon Blaustrade\\" furniture. You would have no idea what he was talking about except for a long-winded treatise on the sexual habits of the wife of a tertiary character that has you rolling with laughter! After that you have a vivid image whenever he uses the term. Disappointing ending, but it's the trip, not the destination with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edu-tainment","review":"This book is extremely entertaining, educational and excellently executed. (Pardon the alliteration) Stephenson's prose is quick and to the point, his mathematics are easily explained and his characters are vivid. But... where's the plot? I mean, who really cares about Enoch Root, or any of that \\"mystery\\"? If you're going to read to this techno-tome, please try to ignore giant plot holes and silly \\"twists\\", enjoy this novel for its edu-tainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephenson's editors should be fired, quickly","review":"I have no comment about the content. The length, however, is unforgivable. This work was 50% longer than necessary, and Stephenson suffers for it. Bad editors, bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and self important","review":"Plain and simply, this book is a chore to read. The concepts are interesting, but Stephensons digressions into math theory or the minutiae of business start-up planning or the neurosis of post-structuralist academics are overly detailed, self important, and dull. Many of the main characters are not developed. In the case of the nearly autistic math genius Waterhouse, this is perhaps a literary mechanism. In the case of the other characters it is unforgivable. In addition the women in the book are one dimensional, they only exist as objects of sexual interest for the men. So think twice before buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy knows his tech","review":"What I really love about Neal Stephenson is that he is not merely enamored with technology; he understands it. William Gibson, for example, arguably invented the cyberpunk genre, but had never owned a computer at the time he wrote it (this is not to imply Stephenson is a cyberpunk writer, he isn't). Neal Stephenson, on the other hand, clearly comes across as a person with extensive personal experience with computer technology. I've been both a programmer and a network engineer, and I can't call this guy on anything. Not so with any other computer-technology-oriented writer I've read so far.Cryptonomicon is not a vision of the technological future, it is a combination of the history of the beginnings of computer technology and the implications of current computer technology. It's still delightfully geeky, however. I loved it. I hope you do, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Code Book\\", but with a plot","review":"I bought this book and the non-fiction \\"The Code Book\\" at the same time. I found this book covered much of the same material - especially post WWII - but with the added enjoyment of an action adventure story that kept me turning pages way after my bedtime. Sort of \\"Indiana Jones meets Alan Turing\\". An interesting bit of prediction - shortly after I finished the book I read in \\"Wired\\" about an operation to set up a real 'data haven' like the fictional one that the characters in the book did. A great read. Not reccomended for the faint of brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-Freakin-Tastic","review":"Finally, a book that actually enters a new realm. I am so tired of the same plots being revampd over and over. Stephenson writes a book with clearly dilineated plots and characters and most of his techinical discourse should be readable, if not understood, by the non-technical. Speaking as a highly technical person myself, it was refereshing to read a story that was technically accurate. None of this psuedo-\\"I own a computer so that makes me technically literate\\" junk that many other writers use to pass for technical-literacy. Stephenson obviously either knows his stuff or found someone who does.Aside from that, the book was a page turner. He did a greate job of keeping the two stories separate, but related, and I never got confused as to which plot was being described at any given time.Definitely gonna check out his other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocrity made pulp","review":"What a dull, tedious, artless black brick of a book. Stephenson is not a bad a writer, but he's not talented enough to write a good book that's this long. He's no story-teller: his characters are cartoonish and forgettable, and he has no knack for language. But at least the book is funny in spurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, Louise ...","review":"Well, I gave what I thought to be a valiant effort at 260 pages, then had to say: no more. I'll admit it - I'm 53 years old, and while I have worked with computers for the past 30 years, to look at me you wouldn't think I was a computer geek, but perhaps I am. My beef is this: I grew up with the novels of Arthur Hailey (remember Airport?) where he spun out 8 or 10 storylines, then began to tie them together. Stephenson never ties them together. Perhaps you have to be 14 years old and have the attention span of a gnat to appreciate this (new?) writing style, but it's not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent-- agree with the reviewer from NY below","review":"I enjoyed the depth and breadth of this novel. Wish people wouldn't be so nit-picky with their reviews. I agree with the reviewer who recommend Robert Doherty's AREA 51 series. I've been reading each one with fascination as they come out and look forward to many more in the series. I also enjoyed Doherty's first book, THE ROCK-- not the motion picture story by the same name but a cross between thriller and science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"From go to done, I was staggered by the authenticity of not only his algorithms, but of his take on \\"geek\\" society as a whole.His attention to detail, both topical and humorous kept me embroiled to the point where I had to stop myself from reading, and finish other pursuits (like eating and work).Thank you Mr. Stephenson, yet another marvel."},{"rating":"1","title":"really liked his previous work","review":"such as Zodiac (a little rough, but his first novel), Snowcrash and the Diamond Age. I have re-read Snowcrash twice and The Diamond Age 4 times.Struggled through this one, hoping that eventually it would start to have some sort of cohesion that would bring it all together. Never happened for me. I did enjoy some of the details and side tangents, but they never really factored into any of the story threads.Finally finished it and then realized that around 200-300 pages in I had the insight that it was not really going to go anywhere - should have gone with that and abandoned at that point. And yes, I am a computer geek/professional with interests in encryption so it should have been a rewarding read. No dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fragmented,and long","review":"Although the story had a potential there is not a cluster of more than three pages which can keep the readers interest for more than a few minutes.Overall the book is way too long and too fragmented between one too many settings to be a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone finish this book?","review":"Oh my god... this book is SO boring! I love Stephenson's writing style, and his witty observations on the world. But I don't read stories for that. I read them for an interesting plot and characters. This book has characters, but no plot. Can anyone even say what the point is, apart from a few drab men wandering about breaking codes in WWII while in the future another sets up a company laying pipelines? Is that fun reading? Whoever finds that enjoyable really needs to get out more, I think. Either that or I'm just not wild and crazy enough for a book like this.I read 500 pages in hopes that a plot would develop and I would be rewarded at the end. Alas, I couldn't make it through and began reading a much better book (A Game of Thrones). Computer geek or not, you need a lot of free time and patience to finish this sleeper. If you don't have it, please don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another overrated mess","review":"Another book with critical acclaim making a great deal of noise and signifying nothing. I'm a computer nerd myself and frankly by about 1/2 way through the book, I stopped caring about any of the characters. When you stop being impressed with Stephenson's wealth of knowledge, you're left feeling like you've been had. The ideas are old sci-fi mixed with every second rate espionage thriller you've seen in the movies over the past four years. I read through it, but frankly....the author tries too hard, and it's too long. The whole thing could have been done in 200 pages. And this is only the first part?! Please, spare us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapburger","review":"When this book came out, quite a few of the people I knew in the hacker community were reading this book. I'd read that he was from central Illinois where I was living. So I gave it a try. This book is like a boring version of the lord of the rings where all the interesting content has been replaced by silliness (some people felt Tolkien was verbose... man, they never read Stephenson). I never finished it because it was SO TEDIOUS. The scene containing a description of the hero eating Captain Crunch is a good example. Even without having read the book, I think we can all agree that's really tedious. Can't we?Years later, I still recall a few of the scenes and some of the writing. So \\"haunting\\" wouldn't be inappropriate. But I am as \\"haunted\\" by the horrific parts (e.g., the outcome of the WWII romance). I wish there was a way to flush this book out of my memory.Alas, all I can do is write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Geeks Only!","review":"This book could easily be cut in half. It rambles in so many areas -- going into mind-numbing detail about unimportant subjects. Don't waste your time unless your idea of a good weekend is writing new computer operating systems. (And I'm a computer consultant.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cryptonomicon or a lesson in tedium","review":"I found this book to be tedious in the extreme.It is way too wordy and is very disjointed.I am an avid reader but the only thing I could look forward to with this book was finishing it so I could finally put the darn thing away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But what's it all mean?????????","review":"He writes well about - nothing. If a sitcom could become a mega-hit, perhaps this plot-less novel could do. Only problem is, its over a thousand pages looooonnnnnnggggg, and I'm only on page 250. Help! Make me stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid by the word","review":"The book was terribly long and boring. The author obviously is paid by the word. I regularly skipped 2-4 pages out of 10. So, roughly 500 of 1100 pages were useless description and digressions that did nothing to further the plot or characterization.I'm sorry I spent 8 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, ponderous, and self-absorbed","review":"I was only able to get to page 64 of this clunker. Genitalia is mentioned often; the author even manages to slip in a reference during the attack on Pearl Harbor.I should mention that I am not a fan of cyberpunk, and thought Snow Crash was only OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book for computer types","review":"Most fiction books that involve computers and math tend to either get them wrong or only skim the surface. This book goes into these wonderful subjects with more depth than is typical. I must thank the author for writing a book that was for me; Not a baby boomer interpretation of me (skate boarding, red bull drinking, hack the DoD in 30 seconds) but a real person who works with computers. Yet this more detailed view of technology does not make the story boring and as for the story it is fun and the characters are good.I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an IT background."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique style","review":"The author has a unique writing style; often dispensing background information in pithy and vulgar many-page rant-lets. Highly enjoyable as long as you don't mind some gruffness.Virtually all characters have humorous elements, but with equal depth. The plot is advanced via at least three different threads in alternating chapters. To the authors credit, all of the threads are engaging.Computer science content is remarkably plausible (read: well researched and presented by an expert), with almost no hand-waving. Can't comment on same for historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Winter Gloves I've ever owned","review":"What I like about these gloves:1. Actual sizes instead of the generic Men's Large. I wear a Medium and they can be hard to find.2. Super soft deer skin leather. Much easier to break in than cow hide gloves3. Very warm but not too bulky4. They stay dry on the inside.Worth every penny. They are well made, and excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits good, cheaper quality","review":"I love the feel of this glove but when it came to the durability, they just didn't stand up to what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of light duty gloves","review":"I love these gloves. I got them mostly for driving, and I've made a few trips now. They keep my hands nice and toasty, and the deerskin is great material--it grips the wheel very firm, doesn't slip or anything like that. The lining is very soft and comfortable and the gloves have a lot of mobility, and slide on and off the hand easily.I think they changed the construction of the product versus what's described and pictured. Instead of \\"Thinsulate\\" mine came with \\"Thermofill\\" insulation, and doesn't have the \\"Thinsulate\\" tag. Still very warm though, and still 100% polyester insulation.Oh and while they're not for heavy abrasive work, they're still tough enough for most things I would use gloves for. On the other hand the deerskin is super soft, so I could see it getting scratched, embedded with dirt, etc. really easily. I think they're tough enough for light-to-moderate tasks and just for keeping your hands warm while doing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"As usual Mr. Cook's style of writing was superb. He continues to be my favorite read. The shocking ending caught me totally by suprise and left me shaking. Another great one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book for Mystery Lovers!","review":"I really enjoyed reading Cook's Instruments of Night. I, being the mystery reader I am, thought that this book posessed all of the qualities a good mystery book should have. Suspense, horror, chills, good detective work, etc. The twists and turns in this book were unbelieveable! It seemed like once you had gotten your mind set on one thing, another thing would present itself, changing your whole perspective. The ending was amazing finding out who Sykes was and how Faye really died. This was the first book that I read of Cook's and will definitely not be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling all sadists","review":"Do you enjoying reading about the gruesome suffering of innocent victims, in a great variety of torture - physical, mental, bloody and gory? Then rush out and buy this book immediately.I honestly don't know what happened to the author between The Chatham School Affair, which was an excellent and haunting book, and this bloody mess. Whatever it is, I wish him a speedy recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy one of his other books!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Cook's and have read every single one of his other books that are still in print. So I looked forward to this one with eager anticipation. It is just dreadful. I cannot believe it was even written by the same man who wrote the Chatham School Affair or Breakheart Hill. It is mawkish, amateurish and a couple of other -ish that don't immediately spring to mind. Poorly written, an unbelievable plot, awkward in concept and execution. Buy one of this man's other books and you will be hooked, but I'm afraid this one is a turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instruments of Night","review":"In view of the fact that I never received the product, I would like to give it a rating of minus 100!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I found the idea of Paul Graves, a mystery writer, being summoned to an old, wealthy estate for the purpose of solving a 50-year old murder improbable and unbelievable. I kept hoping for it to get better, but it didn't. Too many gruesome details of Graves' sister's death. I think the author could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed, unmemorable","review":"This novel has many serious flaws, beginning with the author's turgid, overwritten style. I honestly don't think I will remember much about it three months from now, so I wouldn't say it is memorable. The premise -- a mystery writer asked to solve a fifty year-old crime -- is not believable. The dialogue writing is painful. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismayingly unconvincing novel from a gifted author.","review":"While this book will appeal to hard core Thomas H. Cook fans, it is far from the standards set in his other efforts or even his early nonfictional work EARLY GRAVES. His character, Graves, lacks sufficient depth and the book breaks down into a very unconvincing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Child Cruelty--Too hard to read","review":"I started out liking this book but the more I read, the more horrible it was to read. Sick as a matter of fact. A night long torture and murder of a young girl...every detail sicker than the previous one. Any reader should know this before starting it. Its'a horrible horrible read that made me sick to my stomach. I put it down before I could read any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused.","review":"First, I have to say that \\"Breakheart Hill\\" is one of my favorite books. I buy copies whenever I see them so that I have them on hand to give to friends. So I expected great things from our boy Cook.But Instruments of the Night left me cold. The most difficult part of the book was the way-overboard extremes of graphic sadism, violence and cruelty (think James Ellroy). The writing is, as usual, masterful, but in addition to the disturbing gruesomeness, I found the end confusing (I've read hundreds of mysteries, and this is probably the only one that I just didn't \\"get\\"). I assumed all along who Sykes was, and think the ending confirmed my supposition. But who killed Faye? I'm still not sure. Perhaps I had too many expectations going in, but I found the book more frustrating and nasty than enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"crashed and burned","review":"Simply stated, this toy does not fly. Instead, the launcher sends it approximately 4 feet away, and as soon as the momentum from the launcher is expended, the toy dives into the ground.

Make sure you understand that this book is a compilation of a series of articles that appeared from mid-1980 to mid-1990. Two problems arise: 1) Since each article is brief, there is no depth to the subject matter, and 2) though a valiant attempt was made to organize the articles into logical chapters and categories, the truth-of-the-matter is that the flow of information from one article to another can be disjointed and difficult to follow. With all due respect, the author points this out in his Introduction, but alas, I had already purchased the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for an aficionado.","review":"This book was pretty interesting and had a lot of detail to the history of manufacturers. My one complaint about the entire book is: I would have liked it if a 4th Edition were available, with updtated manufacurers and their histories. The author is very proud about his knowledge and definitely comes across pompous. I would recommend it to a cigar smoker...but at these prices for the 3rd Edition...I think you can do without the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is one great book!","review":"This has so munch info, that you will read over and over again, and the price I got it for was ridiculous !"},{"rating":"2","title":"book in great condit price good delivery fast","review":"The book was fine, the price great, the delivery fast and the credit card number I used got phished and was abused.

It is definitely loud enough to disturb your TV experience, especially in a quiet room/area.At first, I thought it was just a defect on that particular set but that is not the case. I exchanged it for another of the same model and found the exact same problem. Although it is easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good, the sound of that buzz killed all the good stuff.

I would try one of the Korean authors cookbook if you want something real."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDonald's?","review":"I shy away from cookbooks written by non-native authors in general, but I do give them a chance. And whereas this cookbook is slightly more comprehensive than most Korean cookbooks, there are no pictures and without them one is left to one's own devices when it comes to food presentation.Another concern: the author admits in his preface that during his trips to Korea, he'd \\"take breaks\\" from the cuisine by visiting McDonald's to \\"sooth his tongue.\\" If the author doesn't enjoy the cuisine he's reviewing/compiling, perhaps the McDonald's Corporation might be willing to subsidize his next project?I re-sold my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but would you make it if you had never seen it?","review":"This book does cover many Korean recipes, but it misses a few very common Korean foods (like kimpap, etc.).

The brooding George Hamilton and the kooky Bill Hutton keep the girls om their toes.The sad story line of Yvette Mimeux as the pretty girl who doesn't know her worth and suffers because of it is a surprising and touching addition.All in all, I give it a 4-star rating amd suggest it for slumber parties, sick days and rainy days when this glimpse into the sunny 60s Ft.

Delores Hart shines in the leading role as Meredith, a mid-western pharmacist's daughter who is already on her way to becoming a woman. Paula Prentiss and Connie Francis provide the comedy with their boyfriend's antics. Yvette Mimieux is the young gullible and overly-romantic girl who gets seriously involved, and then abused by a bunch of seemingly good handsome boys (who are nothing but thugs).Some parts of the movie are silly and stupid: the story involving Barbara Nichols, and Jim Hutton's infatuation with her. But that storyline isn't long enough to ruin the movie.The ending is not that predictable, but you end up feeling that these girls have grown into womanhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Hamilton please.","review":"This movie was one of the overlooked beach party movies.

Great Movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone waits for me.","review":"It's funny how some movies can take hold of you for a good part of your life. I was 12 when i saw this movie and i fell in love with it, the music, the cast and the location. Many years later i ended up living in Fort Lauderdale and before they torn the street apart where much of the movie was filmed i'd walk along that same streatch of sand, go into the same bar and the same hotel which later became a gay hotel and unfortunately now torn down also. But all this was such a romantic and simplier time.This is a great motion picture of a more trusting and honest time, a era that will never be seen again except thru the flickering of the motion picture projector hearing Connie Francis singing, seeing beautiful romantic Deloras Hart who is now a nun, and just a wonderful walk down memory lane. And as the song goes,,,,,\\"Someone waits for me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"I have to admit I liked this movie. Sure, the premise was great, and it looks great too. But that could be said about a lot of movies, and eventually few of them live up to the expectations. This ain't no masterpiece, but it is very funny, has quite a lot of great location shots, especially the last one on the beach (adding a great title tune with great voice, courtesy of Connie), and great scenes like the one where Connie Francis and girlfriend go to the bar and order hot water because they can't afford anything else and slip tea bagas into them, or when all the cast jumps/falls into the saloon acquarium. I was unsure whether Yvette Mimiuex was raped or not because for 1960 I have rarely seen in movies, but after reading some reviews I was right. And the scene where she zombie-walks into traffic is very good (to look at).All in all, a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great!","review":"I love the music, the setting, and ofcourse the theme...college kids on Spring break. But this movie is about more than just having fun in the sun...it's about life and growing up. This movie introduces Connie Francis to the screen and the title song is beautifully done by her. All the leading actors Delores Hart, Ivette Mimieux, Connie Francis, Paula Prentiss, George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, and Frank Gorshin carry the movie beautifully. The special feature commentary by Paula Prentiss is great and gives you a different perspective of the film. The dialogue, which I imagine must have been a bit racy for 1960 (especially when Delores Hart is speaking to her professor in class) still holds up today. This is one of those films that will never go out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Sister Joan really doesn't mean to become involved with all those murders that keep happening around her. She can't help having a suspicious mind, an observant eye, and a vocation that leads her to help all those who are suffering.This is another excellent entry into the Sister Joan series of mysteries set in England.

Generic advice doled out in a wafer-thin dose. My daughter received this as a gift and read through it in minutes. Interested parties could merely read any interesting sections while browsing in a bookstore.

However, it is so amazingly basic. I guess common sense in this world is truly uncommon. I read each chapter and said to myself-\\"Where's the revelation here?\\".

Stop, stop stop stop. Don't try to justify the low price in your head as qualifying it for a purchase. This is a Blu-ray title where the transfer wasn't done well at all. The video quality drops noticably multiple times. The story isn't really a comedy, as the advertisements try to sell it. This is an occassionally interesting peek into the attitudes and mindsets of Hollywood towards Cold War era espionage, and as such it's amazing to see how much the writer and director try to sugar over the obvious danger and tension of the times. The acting was okay, but the script and everything else struck me as lame. There's no passion to this movie. I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon. Like the misguided Hollywood mindset of that era, I'd prefer to let this movie become a thing of the past. Once again, it's technically flawed and thematically underwhelming. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, and too scary","review":"My three year old daughter loves most things Pooh, especially if Roo and Lumpy are involved, but she did not enjoy this movie. The embedded \\"flash-back\\" was a boring, obvious filler, and the rest of the movie relied on scare tactics instead of an actual storyline. Half-way through the movie my daughter just got up and wandered off. I'm glad I ordered it used for just a couple of bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay movie","review":"Overall, I think kids will enjoy this movie. In my own opinion, the piglet segment went on for far too long and really got off the track of what the movie was supposed to be about -- which was Roo and Lumpy's quest to save Halloween. Also, I didn't like the fact that Pooh selfishly binged on everyone's candy, leaving none for anyone else and really didn't seem all that sorry about it. I bought this movie based on the fact that it was a Pooh movie, but in retrospect, I don't think I would purchase it again. My advice -- rent it first. If you like it, buy it. At the very least, it's worth a rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This movie was a BIG disappointment. My daughter and I are huge Winnie the Pooh fans, and we had been looking forward to the release of Pooh's Heffalump Halloween ever since we saw the first Heffalump movie. Unlike that movie, which was charming and endearing, this one is ponderous, uninteresting, and contrived. The previews show only the good scenes and leave out the sleep-inducing flashback to a previous Halloween where Piglet was scared half to death. And the movie ends with a yawn; the theme of unconditional friendship never really came out like it did in the original Heffalump movie. And where was Owl? He has been MIA ever since Piglet's Big Movie in 2003. I give this movie two stars only because my daughter and I love the characters so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Low Even for You, Eisner","review":"I have never seen nearly an entire old video embedded in a new one.

So when it arrived, we sat down as a family and watched it. My husband and I were both kind of confused. It is so different than the tone of the other movie. The whole tone of this movie was sad and scared. There was nothing fun loving in it at all. Lumpy doesn't want to celebrate because everything scares him... so he shivers, whimpers, and cries over EVERYTHING, ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. It was depressing lol. Our little boy did not enjoy it. He didn't smile once, he just looked concerned the whole time and after a while just wanted us to turn it off. We were really bummed, I don't think we will be watching this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"**It's a cute movie!!**","review":"I read the previous negative reviews, but decided to buy Pooh's Heffalump Halloween movie anyway for my 2 1/2 year old son who has recently become very fond of The Hundred-Acre Wood and all of its characters...since I gave it to him days ago on Halloween-we have watched it numerous times, and he loves it!! There is nothing wrong with this movie!! I think its cute, has a good story line and has a number of cute songs featured throughout the movie sung by Tigger, Piglet, Roo and Lumpy. There is a flashback when Roo is telling Lumpy about a previous Halloween involving the other characters-i don't think its boring at all. My husband (and others) say the movie is \\"unimaginative\\"--but i don't agree!! Personally, I'm glad I didn't let the other reviews dissuade me from buying this movie for my son.

This toy also is great for teaching cause and effect(put play-doh in here it comes out here), fine motor skills and dexterity(it takes a little manuevering for a 2year old to get the play-doh into and out of molds).

In the story titled \\"Birthday\\" one of the kids spills cake batter on the other accidentally, and the other kid calls him a dummy.

It didnt match up at all to the original Carebears movies and show, and several of the voices were quite awful!

The show comes off totally genuine, not contrived, like most garbage of the genre. Our family loves this show to death.The DVD presentation is about as average as could be, and sadly quite expected from a siily network that only airs the show once a week while lesser crap (read Ghost Adventures) runs all the time. There are no extras of any kind to be found on the DVD, all they did was print what has been broadcast and slap it into a crappy, ugly, completely uninspired package design.Glad to have it, but Travel Channel could not have put LESS effort into the presentation of this phenomenal show. Lame effort.I'm giving it a 2 out of 5, because I didn't buy a digital download, I bought an entire package and the company should put a better effort into their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boo!

This is my first exposure to Mieville's work, and I'm very impressed. These are not \\"light\\" stories; they require your full attention while reading them, or you will miss something. Some of them are somewhat uncomfortable, and a couple of them made me look at some pretty commonplace things in a whole new light!

The novel form gives him the room he needs to develop his ideas and evoke the sort of bizarre, surreal, often grotesque milieu (often just a sideways step or a blink of the eye away from reality) at which he so excels.The short story form doesn't really give him the room he needs to work his magic. Oh, this book does have its moments, definitely. One story in it is even in the New Crobuzon universe of some of his most successful novels and gives a bit of backstory to one of the legendary characters in those books. However, on the whole the short stories are not quite up to the quality of his novels. They're just a bit lacking in depth.On the other hand, if you've already read all his novels or are looking for a book of short weird fiction, by all means pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"First exposure to Mieville","review":"FascinatingInsightfulPoeticEruditeAddictingI found it during a random library search, browsing Science fiction- Fantasy.

There is a bit of variety here in the stories told. While Mr. Mieville does have his own style (especially in his novels), his short stories show many stylistic similarities to that of Thomas Ligotti. The pieces \\"Looking for Jake\\", \\"Different Skies\\", and \\"The Tain\\" are especially so. My favorite work is without a doubt \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\", which is easily worth the price of the whole collection by itself.

It was, as the rating suggests, seriously disappointing. Almost all of the stories lack Mieville's characteristic voice and he seems to be fundamentally perplexed by the short fiction form - all but perhaps one or two of the stories lack the \\"punch\\" that I expect when reading short fiction.

The story was just so insane that I had to share it with my friends. I told them all about it. If these are supposed to have a moral, no one got it because they were so busy laughing at the farting and the fart catching machine.This book might be so hilariously bad that I enjoyed hearing it.

And at the end fakes love for the dog for the press and cameras!I am also shocked that there are parents out there that actually heap kudos on this kind of junk (just because their 4 year old liked it and laughed at it!) and can't see that they are teaching their kids to be immoral!Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walter the Farting dog Farts again vs.Trouble at the yard sale","review":"I order both Walter the farting dog: Trouble at the yard sale AND Walter the farting dog:Farts again, they are the same exact book!!!!I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses the first book.s sweet spirit","review":"From the moment Dad sells Walter at the garage sale without so much as a second thought, this book heads down the wrong path.

The promise of it all was great. But not so, the execution. There are elements of intrigue and fantasy and adventure here but they are not well meshed. Some of the characters were promising and I did like the attempt to depict the life of the Byzantines on their wharfs and in their palaces. But the mixing of pagan deities with the real world of religious Byzantium just didn't work for me. Although I like this kind of stuff, I put this one down about half way through -- though I tried mightily to see it through to the end. But I failed. And so, regrettably, did this book. -- SWM"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome music!","review":"The first song it just the prelude to an awesome experience.

Not only was Churchill a politician and great war leader in World War 2, but he also participated in 5 wars beginning with the 1898 Battle of Omdurman where he was a part of the last great Cavalry charge in British history. If all of that wasn't enough, he has had more words published than Charles Dickens.This book does a decent job of introducing Churchill to those new to him. If this book whets your appetite to learn more of Churchill then by all means read the biographies penned by William Manchester, Roy Jenkins, and Martin Gilbert. Churchill's own writings also give great insight into the man. I especially enjoyed his \\"World War 2, The Gathering Storm.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Expected Hero","review":"Paul Addison has written a competent introduction to a life more interesting, in the sense of history, than any other of the twentieth century. His book is enlivened by many vivid quotes from a broad assortment of people who had reason to know Winston Churchill. However, I think the author, in an excessive attempt at balance, bends too far over backward in making use of certain highly negative assessments-- such as one offered by Evelyn Waugh at the time of Churchill's death.While he may have had feet of clay, his name remains remembered in Westminister Abby--and elsewhere over the globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for your service.","review":"The shipping was a bit slow, other than that I'd like to add that the book came in a very good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What awful reproductions!!!","review":"The first purpose of an artbook is usually to showcase fine art with high quality reproductions. This book certainly packs in ample artwork, well supported by Sister Wendy's colourful commentary.

This one is so sloppy that it is disrespectful to the artworks and is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Story of Jesus Painting","review":"More than two thirds of the book is dedicated to paintings related with Christianity. And the real arts are either completely ignored or dealt carelessly. For example, The whole Van Gogh's paintings are described in mere four pages, while each of so may Christian related paintings by some obscure painters, is shown using four split pages. If your religion is Christianity and your objective is to investigate Christian paintings, this book should be fine. But for the rest of us who are not Christians, this book is not worth reading or looking at. There are so many other good art books out there without religious bias. This book is not about painting as described. It is about the Christianity religion disguised with \\"Painting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for historians, fantastic for the many","review":"I'd just like to comment on how some reviewers found Sister Wendy to \\"narrow\\" and focused on Christian paintings. These people should look at the whole of art history and how influential Christian art has been over the years. the \\"minor\\" artisits she devoted so much time to are in fact huge in the art world and Van Gogh got four pages which is a lot and hes only one aspect, just because hes main stream dosnt mean she should devote more time to him. The Christian religion had a huge impact on the art world over a very long period of time, this should be taken into consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've liked the book very much.

It is beautiful and thorough. Sister Wendy covers every major time period with overviews of the most significant artists while including comments and close up studies of specific works. This book could easily be an art course in itself- it is comprehensive and the illustrations are just what you would expect of a DK book- beautiful and with accurate, vivid color.

I think I've repressed most of it, but I still get haunted by memories of iambic pentameter, sonnets, metaphor, synesthaesia, metonymy, yada yada yada. So I was very suspicious when a friend handed me this book and said it was \\"nothing\\" like the poems I'd read in junior high. Much to my surprise, though, she was right! There's no metaphors or similies, no \\"prosody\\" or rhetorical structure, etc. You get the sense Ms. Laux is just like me, unable to see what (if any) relevance Dickinson or Pound or Keats or the rest of those boring old guys and girls have for poetry. Instead, these are GOOD poems, about feelings and emotions. Look at the title poem--there's not one metaphor in it!

After a month of reading I went back to read again and I'm sure that one half-drunk afternoon I'll pick this work up again and see what I missed on two reads. \\"Kissing\\" made me cry and \\"This Close\\" reminded me of someone I'd like to see again.

First, Pollack and Naxos have assembled on a single disc Barber's complete output for solo piano. Secondly, Pollack plays the music with passion, commitment, understanding and breathtaking virtuosity. For those who know Samuel Barber's music only from the Adagio, this music will come as a profound shock. It's tough, overtly modernistic, almost constructivist, if I might use that word of someone wholly American, and rather conservative to boot. Its rhythmic intensity is quite astounding.

After the second wash, this got even worse and I was afraid they would leave red spots on the white cookies I was baking.

It turns out that was the wrong thing to do. Baltsa never had a full integration of her lower and higher registers, and the breaks between the two are especially noticable here. It becomes especially apparent in coloratura runs that circle around this area of her voice. The singing tends to be effortful, and she really has no business singing \\"Bel raggio lusinghier\\" when she ducks all the high notes and omits a decent cadenza. Coloratura, contrary to my expectations, too often sounds laboured. Occasionally though, you get a glimpse of Bltsa the great Rossinian, with some intelligent musical insights and rythmic touches. On the whole however, you're far better off with Podles, Horne, Kasarova and Larmore, all of whom have produced Rossini discs of far greater distinction..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely worth while!","review":"The first time I heard this CD, I could not help wondering when I would hear Baltsa produce some dreadful sound on it. In other words, I felt she was walking on very thin ice. Well, she did not produce any horrible sounds so I managed to listen to the CD more relaxed the second time and have since then played this disc over and over again. Eventhough some people may feel that Rossini should be sung with more 'finesse', if that is the right word, Baltsa approaches each aria on this CD well-thought, intelligently and - most important - without making a showcase of the arias, as so many singers do with Rossini. The Maometto aria is a pure gem! But I guess as is always the case with Baltsa, you either like her, or you don't, there's no inbetween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocally disastrous","review":"I listened to this disc in horror. The break in the middle of Baltsa's once-magnificent voice was so huge at the time of this recording that I had a mental image of her attempting to leap across the Grand Canyon, (vocally speaking). Surely she must have been in tears to hear her amazingly wide range now in two separate and separated pieces. How could she have permitted this disc to be released???

It smelled terrible. I opened it up to put some on my skin just so I could smell it & my hand instantly started breaking out in hives! That has never happened to me before. I've never been allergic to anything in my life or had a reaction like that from a product (I've tried a lot of different products, food etc.). I also thought it was an oil not the thick cream that it turned out to be. Worst of all the bad smell is hard to get rid of. I just washed my hands and I can still smell it. Anyways, I will more than likely throw this away if I cant find anything else to use it for which I doubt I will.

Each CD comes with 2 discs, one with music and one without. I personally prefer the one with music, it was very soothing. Listening to Jeanie tell you how important, special and unique you are, it can only make you feel good.

For the rest of the population, this is a gentle and harmonious collection of songs, largely sung by ace tenor James Griffett, usually with piano accompaniment. In the time before television -- before radio, for that matter -- families would gather round the upright and sing songs like this, when they weren't singing Gilbert & Sullivan or working down the mines. It's beautiful and mellow, good music for when you're coming down off an absinthe binge or fastidiously at work on your latest monograph. The most famous song here is probably \\"The Lost Chord\\" by Arthur Sullivan, which was featured in the film Topsy Turvy.

The cut out for the nose is too high and was always rubbing him. The plastic surrounding the nipple is flat and hard, not curved to fit the face at all and my son hated that.

This is definitely a great way to reinforce learning. As a matter of fact, I played a youtube video of a giraffe & elephant and he was able to point to the tv and say them both out loud while pointing. I'm continually impressed my the products put out by Learning Resources. Some complain about the scale but I feel the details help children learn identification. (It is funny to see the dog & cat from a separate Learn Res. animal set the equivalent size as the elephant and gorilla) The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating for durability was the tail on the elephant looks like it could be pulled out as a child grows. Otherwise they are realistic looking for learning purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality not high quality","review":"These are medium large light plastic animals.

I wasn't a huge fan of Kenny Loggins, but I bought this DVD on the recommendation of a friend. The sound quality is AMAZING. This DVD truly delivers the realism that DVD is capable of offering. The sound is truly magical, even in regular stereo mode. The music completely envelopes you. I thought that nothing could sound better than CD, but this DVD truly sounds incredible.

He had some really talented guests and a great backing band. I particularly enjoyed the addition of Sonny Landreth - the hands down absolute best slide guitar player in the world, into the band. And of course, Michael McDonald's vocals are always fantastic even if just in a support role. I wish he would have let Michael sing on more than the one tune. \\"This Is It\\" would have been my choice.

Also read complaints about the door latches being too flimsy and they are thinner/flexible. I have always tried to make sure not to bump them on any unit I have ever owned so is not an issue for me. Another complaint I read a lot was that the start buttons and stop buttons and some of the other functions were not well placed...that I have to disagree with.

I also have an early 90's Sharp Carousel that still works without flaw. So when I unpacked this unit I was pretty jazzed. Unfortunately it wouldn't start. Although the door seemed to close all the way, it was not latching properly and there was nothing I could do but return the unit or call for service. I decided to return the unit and call my kitchen contractor back so he could build an enclosure for a more expensive GE range-top unit. I'm also very disappointed in Consumer Reports, they gave good ratings to this model. Something's just not right these days.

This is a great introduction to the genre!","review":"For being such a quick read, it is commendable that the author was able to touch on so many different aspects of Sci-Fi. Without really fleshing out any one aspect, you will find many different types /styles of Sci-Fi being introduced: Military flashbacks, Augmentation, Cloning, Alien Mind Control, Genetic modification, CyberPunk, Space Cowboy, Manifest Destiny. All of this is delivered using a soft approach which doesn't take the reader out of this solar system and doesn't jam any hard sci-fi or new vocabulary onto the reader. In this aspect it is much more approachable to readers who are new to Sci-Fi. Moreover, the plot and sub plots will keep even the most seasoned Sci-Fi readers well entertained and suitably misdirected until the last page.

Everything is predetermined and calculated. If one finds 5 minutes of decent piano playing on this CD one should be happy. The lack of natural talent for music is obvious with this pianist. Particularly, that there are so many other phenomenal recordings of this repertoire, also from EMI catalog. One wonders why would EMI release something like that?! On the other hand, it seems that EMI took a step in the right direction: no new releases of this pianist are seen on the market. Looks like Ms. Rubinova's \\"star\\" is not there to \\"shine\\". The good news: one uninteresting pianist less! Rather, Martha Argerich or Murray Perahia, to name a few. This CD is NOT RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb saga","review":"I have just finished reading the Irish century series up to date within the past few months, and 1972 is just another link in a fine chain on novels by Llywelyn. From the first book (1916) with a young Ned Halloran all they way up to Ned's grandson Barry in her latest masterpiece 1972, Llywelyn tells the story of the Republican movement from the Easter rising to Bloody Sunday. It's amazing how in 1972, she is able to approach all angles of the Troubles in Ireland. From the facture of IRA and the emergence of Ian Paisley and the Provos Llywelyn takes the confusion out and shows the futility of Irish politics. These books have brought to light a heritage that I have never been aware of and that has escaped my family over the generations. I would recomend this book to everyone with an ounce of Irish blood or anyone interested in the troubled history of modern Ireland. I can't wait for her next installment in the Irish Century series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"People from the prairies of South Dakota and North Dakota aren't pretentious.

Your own family and home may be very different from Hasselstrom's, but through her writing you'll gain a better understanding of your own people and place of origin.

But most of all, it goes to the heart of the disease--why you have cancer--and explains treatment for the possible CAUSES of the disease in each person. For those who are in agreement or wish to explore some of the treatments described in this book, the trick is finding a center that will treat using these methods, and in being able to afford this type of treatment which is rarely, if ever, covered by standard medical insurance.

It's kind of like the story of the ugly duckling who turned into a swan.. the seed doesn't believe in its own worth, but its planter (known as The Nice Lady), believes in the seed.

The songs are great, and the excellent sound quality really brings them to life. Percussionist Burhan Ocal is a master finger drummer, and the other members of the band play excellently on mostly traditional instruments such as the oud and the quunun. The violin on track 2 add a very nice touch. There's good balance between the more festive numbers (tracks 1, 2) and the mellow ones (track 3).

Too bad they didn't put a little more life into their portrayals. Based on \\"true\\" incident, the movie follows the psychotic crimes of dentist Corbin Bernsen who has been offing people for about twenty years. He is currently married to Markie Post (who appears to be on Sominex), and has a sleazy mistress (Suzanne Barnes, over the top indeed) and an ex-con sidekick (Don Swayze in a wasted character). He confesses his latest crime to Markie and she goes to the FBI (a stoic Kelsey Grammer) who uses her to get a confession out of Bernsen. Corbin's real life mom (YOUNG AND RESTLESS's indefatigable Jeanne Cooper) also appears. There's little suspense and a very wimpy climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd had this book when I was a kid!","review":"If you know a kid who's interested in racing, there's no better introduction to big-time motorsports than this book. It takes young readers (probably age 8 and up) inside the world of Champ Car racing, with thorough discussions of the drivers, cars, teams and events. When I was a kid, I had little concept of racing beyond the Indy 500, but a book like this would have added immensely to my understanding of the sport. The book's only shortcoming is that the information is somewhat dated now, but its young readers probably won't mind a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growl","review":"Great artist!

He asked, \\"Are you including Dylan?\\" I was thinking about whether to include Dylan in the category of \\"our time,\\" and must have thought quietly for awhile, and before I could answer, my friend said, \\"wow.\\" I guess that was an answer. When I listen to this album, the most vivid images wash through my head. He has an uncanny ability to present profound issues, mixing it with prosaic, folksy phrases. Who else could replicate the freedom of Nirvana with riding on stolen horses. You sense that you are in the hands of a master, stretching you in ways you've never been stretched.

As far as the book goes, it's full of cute stories but as a practical speculation tool, it's downright comical. The authors cite the VIX as their favorite indicator and present a brief study of the market's performance after the VIX hits a certain absolute level. Hello Grandma, the apple pie's already been baked! The VIX ain't that easy any more, but the authors pony up their hypothesis as if it were an earth-shattering insight.

This book shatters many investment and trading beliefs. Although I do not agree with everything between these covers, Practical Speculation is an excellent book. Niederhoffer's knowledge of applied statistics is obvious throughout the book, and he has many ideas clearly presented.

That difference aside, this book is one of the best financial books I've picked up in a long time. Not only does it bust the myth that \\"the trend is your friend,\\" it also shows you how wrong it is to be consistently bearish, how mechanical and devoid of thought most CNBCish news is, how hubris signals downfalls and the truth behind Wall Street's earnings propaganda. It's got plenty of wonderful anecdotes, excellent recommendations for further reading, and advice real traders can use to make real money.

One half of the book's content looks more like a collection of the emails and letters from the author's buddies, who, by the way, did not succeed in the trading business. The other half of the book consists of some details of the author's biography, what is also of no help for the readers who bought the book in hope to gain some new knowledge about markets.After reading this book, I think that it was written just in an attempt to recover at least some tiny portion of the money which the author lost during \\"practical speculation\\" with his own trading capital.

His exegesis of laws of thermodynamics, the history of King Canute, and theories of probability distributions seem intended to show how smart he is and not to communicate anything useful.

But instead the authors filled it with gimmicky, extraneous filler to get to their point, which is ultimately not very prescriptively helpful. The authors arguably -- and I am not even sure of that -- succeed in getting investors to doubt certain pieces of conventional wisdom. But all they do is debunk. The whole second half of the book was meant to be constructive, to give investors real information that you can use. But when you get down to it, there is scarce little there.

On the positive side, I find that I get warnings as far as 1.5 miles away on a strong signal (I was driving toward one of those speed trailers that says \\"Speed limit 65, your speed: xx\\" on the freeway with the detector set on \\"Highway\\"). Under more normal conditions, I usually have somewhere around 3/4 mile which gives plenty of time to check and reduce speed if necessary.This paid for itself a few months ago after detecting a cop around a corner of a large rock face.

I was intrigued by the cover and title of the book and couldn't wait to start reading. Let me tell you, it was a struggle from the first paragraph. However, I dutifully kept reading expecting the story to pick up but it never did. The characters were so boring that I started to root the bad guys on and there was very little plot to get immersed in. Stevens' writing was poor as well. I am sure she could do better. Maybe she had a great initial idea gone wrong.In short, if you really want to read this book, get it out of the library if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"I read alot of books and I make it a point to finish them. This is the first book I have not finished since I learned how to read. I stopped more than halfway through (I tried to give it a fair chance).The story is completely unrealistic. This woman sort of stakes her claim on this young girl she finds covered with tattoos. This would never happen. There is no depth to the story or the characters and I didn't see anything inspiriational or moving in the first half of the novel.Tattoo Girl came recommended to me by a friend. I went to 6 different bookstores searching for it and none of them had it. I WONDER WHY!?!?! Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate and entertaining page turner","review":"Emma, the title character in Brooke Stevens' new novel Tattoo Girl is mysterious and compelling in ways that few literary characters are. When we first meet her she is mute, covered on much of her body by tattoos, and clearly fearful. The mystery of how she escapes from whomever is tormenting her and the potent bond that is created between her and the other powerful character Lucy, gripped this reader from the beginning to the last page of Tattoo Girl. Mr. Stevens writing transcends anything he has done before and he establishes characters that are highly believable even within the unusual world that they inhabit. The world of these characters is both familiar and loving but also full of imminent danger. The story unfolds in a deliberate and frightening manner that kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","review":"A thriller about a girl, a woman and to a lesser extent a dwarf trying to reconcile themselves with their pasts. The writing is simple, deceptively plain almost, but somehow it has a dream-like quality that makes what's happening in the book feel like it's happening to you-it's extremely believable, though the story is highly imaginative and ultimately powerful. I haven't come across a more captivating novel in many years. I read a review of it that said that it is as much about being sad as it is about being frightened, that's a very good description. Having just started the author's first book, I'm finding it similar in many ways. I believe this writer is a master of suspense, but he's doing more than just making you turn the pages. The novel was passed along to me at my office. I'm glad it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"an astoundingly philosophical message from a touching story","review":"I was reading Nietzsche's \\"the Antichrist\\" at this time and read this on a whim.

To think such a great work of fiction can have such philsophical significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild, strange, fascinating, terrifying ride...","review":"Let met say that again, a wild, strange, fascinating, terrifying ride... I got a stiff neck while reading this book-I tried to put it down and do other things like eat and bathe, but I kept finding myself sitting back on the couch with the book on my lap. A lot of times I don't even finish a novel. You can't compare it to anything. Is it a thriller, horror? Parts of it are sort like Geek Love, other parts have the same kind of tension that you get when reading Stephen King. All of the characters are freaks, in a way, but I totally identified with them. On the back cover Francesca Lia Block (in my top five list of writers) wrote that it's tenderly human and nightmarishly surreal. I didn't know what she was talking about, but now I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, didn't live up to potential","review":"I bought this book on a whim based on the title and back cover description. The writing was so poor that it distracted me from the story and in the end I couldn't decide whether or not I liked it. The author repeatedly talks about the characters being captivated by each other, but he didn't manage to captivate me. The story was somewhat predictable, somewhat improbable, and didn't get me invested enough in the characters that I was willing to suspend my disbelief.I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money-no better than the online docs","review":"I purchased this rather expensive set of texts after reading some \\"reviews\\", expecting to see an improvement over the dismal online documentation.

It certainly has ample space for these items however the \\"compartments\\" it has for that is - just throw it into the case. There are no blow mold clamps or pockets to hold them in place.

I recommend it as the best practical book on developing usable software (although I also recommend other books, such as Nielsen's \\"Usablity Engineering\\" and Rubin's \\"Handbook of Usability Testing\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Practical Guide to Usability Testing","review":"This book is real thorough, right up to the point of listing suitable topics for small talk with your test subjects :-) If you are doing guerrilla usability testing, most of the forms and checklists in this book may be overkill, but there is still a lot of useful information... I appreciated a lot that statements are in general backed up with literature, not just common sense reasoning. The only drawback of this book is that it feels a bit dated (i.e. pre-Web). It does seem to have been revised and puts emphasis on iterative testing etc, but doesn't mention more recent techniques such as eye-tracking, or using the Web for recruiting test subjects or identifying potential usability problems via request logs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for starting","review":"It is a very good book to start learning usability.

One thing I read while researching the D2x was the noise at ISO higher than 800 and it is true. I try not to push my camera beyond ISO 640-800 as I find that the shadow noise is unacceptable, even with noiseware software. I have a D700 for high ISO shots.

It is virtually indestructible, small in size and fairly priced. It comes loaded with the U3 system, which allows me to run my key software (Firefox, Thunderbird, and Roboform) on any PC without worrying about leaving sensitive information behind.

If you travel frequently, a U3 Cruzer is ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indestructable!","review":"Finally a thumb drive that I won't have to worry about replacing for a long time. It has already been stepped on and dropped on hard surfaces a few times with no more than a scratch. The retractable USB attachment keeps it from getting bent like my other drives, and the sturdy steel case seems like it'll never break or come loose. The read/write speeds of this are also significantly faster than the other flash drives I've owned, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking at a large thumb drive as more of an investment than disposable storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the game","review":"SanDisk's sliding connector is definitely the best around. After four months of abuse, the connector is rock stable and shows no sign of fragility. The casing is only very slightly scratched despite being mixed together with keys, spare change, and an occassional pocket knife. It's simply the most durable thumb drive I'm come across.I'm not sure what the U3 scandal is about. I use TweakUI to disable autorun on all devices. And I'm a disk image junkie (Acronis is my first choice now that Symantec has corrupted all things good.) So although U3 support software may have been installed on my system early on, it is not on my system now nor will it be in the forseeable future. In other words, I don't see why U3 would be a show stopper. I certainly don't agree with assigning the drive just one star in protest. It's easy enough to circumnavigate the issue altogether.Great device. I wish more usb mini devices would adopt the same retracting connector. The tooth paste caps are worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Macs","review":"A solid, durable drive. Unfortunately, it's not clear on the packaging that it's not for Macs. However, when you mount the drive, an extra 'CD' drive containing the U3 software mounts as well. I've seen this on other drives that include Windows utilities, but have never had a problem deleting and reformatting the drive to get back that lost disk space.Unfortunately, the Cruzer is not configured this way. On a Mac, you will never be able to get rid of the extra U3 disk that mounts every time you mount the Cruzer, and you will also have to eject BOTH disks when you done using it. Finally, because of this issue, you lose about 60 MB of drive space.So, it's probably a great drive for PCs, but not for Macs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick little tool but","review":"I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that I'm a Mac user and there is no way to get rid of the U3 System Launchpad for Windows that also loads upon insert. Unfortunately Amazon's website did not mention this U3 smart thing when I bought it. The price was right but it darn irritating to have the U3 System load up with the drive. Whose dimwitted idea was this? Other than that, it is sturdy and quick. No problems with the flash drive except for the aforementioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: VIRAL software. Don't buy this device!","review":"While this could have been a good product, from a company I once considered a top supplier of Flash memory, MP3 players, and other products, this device includes U3 VIRAL software that takes over the host PC and forces itself into the system. The maker, Sandisk, claims that it can be removed, but that is a blatant lie. The software resides on an apparently permanent partition of the device, making the device a 1.9GB storage rather than the advertised 2GB. The accompanying software that is supposed to remove the U3 virus from the device does not even recognize that the device is attached, then fails to remove the offending virus. There is NO WAY to use the device as a normal flash drive.Despite the previous dozens of Sandisk products I own and use, this is the LAST time I'll EVER buy a Sandisk product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandisk Review","review":"I never received the item.

Works fine, but two things about it I don't like:1: The U3 Smart software partitions the drive, and you always have this pop-up menu of stuff like Skype and password manager, which you can't delete easily because it is seen as a CD drive (read-only). You have to download the uninstall program from SanDisk, and they make it hard to find. I wasted a good hour on it. Some folks might love the U3 stuff, but I don't.2: The LED stays lit, whether it's seen by the computer or not. You have to pull it out. When you do, it's very warm from the light- that can't be good for the longevity of the drive. But why not have the light indicate that it's recognized as a drive, and not just powered up?

I know some of the \\"purist\\" fans here think he might veered too far away from what he usually does but I think it's refreshing. One of the first things that come to mind when listening to this album was, \\"Geez, this sounds like BBMak on jazz!\\", \\"Hmm, heard this somewhere on Top 40 before!\\". However, when the smooth sounds come in, there is no doubt that this is a jazz album. For me, his music brought me to places and inspired me. It is definitely and easily one of my Top 5 for 2005. Definitely a fan now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"What was Steve Cole thinking of? This CD is dreadful. This is not Smooth Jazz. It's a mixture of country & western sytle folk sounding guitar with bluesy arrangements. Sure, steve plays his sax well, but hardly any essense of smooth jazz to be found. The only track i liked was \\"Serenity\\" This has all the quality trademarks of Steve Cole of old but one track does not make an album. If you are a Steve Cole fan DO NOT BUY BLIND LIKE I DID!! Listen first. I read somewhere that steve cole described this album as his best work. May i suggest Steve that you consider being a folk/country and western music performer if you're going to insult your fans with this dribble. There are one or two good moments on this CD but overall it's a waste of money and yet another dissapointing release for 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lost fan","review":"Steve,I have been one of your best fans.

Don't buy this CD until you preview it first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"This is by far the WORST CD of the century, if I could have rated it a 0 I would have. At first, when I looked at the credits and didn't see Brian Culbertson name as the producer/song writer, I was disappointed because I love his style and knew the CD would be good but I figured you wanted to do it alone and bring your own style to the CD. PLEASE bring Brian Culbertson back, because you need him. What happened? I have heard you play without the help of Brian and you were just fabulous. If you want to sell any more CD's to a Jazz fan who owns all of them, choose either C&W or Jazz.

Actually it's probably better than that. The intro says these digital re-masters were done by a company named \\"US Television Office, Inc.\\". For goodness sake, every person or studio who has old prints TAKE THEM TO \\"US TELEVISION OFFICE, INC.\\" AND GET THEM RE-MASTERED. Platinum has released 8 volumes of these Hoppy feature films and I own all 8. But for some strange reason, probably only known to some \\"power lunch\\" executive, they did not number the volumes...so you will just have to tell the difference by the numbers Amazon gives them. They are worth twice or 3 times the price. There were 66 Hopalong Cassidy films made starring William Boyd, and you can own 40 of them with these 8 volumes at a slim price. The 5 Hoppy adventures on this volume are:1. Border Patrol 19432. Doomed Caravan 19413. Fool's Gold 19474. Forty Thieves 19445.

I count four selections (Over the Mountains, Little Moth, Charle is My Darling, and Ca' the yowes to the knowes) where I would have preferred to hear another singer handling the duties. She does strike me as being a bit arch and not in control on these selections. I say this not as a trained singer but as a musician. Otherwise, I found the duets to be quite wonderful, and I thought Pitt's solo on \\"If Love Should Pass Me By\\" to be one of the better selections on this CD. The other performers are very good --- I especially enjoyed David Wilson-Johnson's work on The Arnold Songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Volume III of a 3 volume set!","review":"When will you have volumes I & II? I purchased the paperback edition, and am glad to have access to an out of print book. The print is occasionally slightly \\"blotched\\" which might be expected from copying an old book, but as they say, it does not impede the reading. But, when will the first two volumes be reproduced? This site is a little pricey for a paperback reprint, IMHO, but worth it if it's the only way you can get a copy.

This method book does a nice job, with useful, and very musical, exercises built around (mostly) familiar tunes from the traditional, country and Hawaiian repertoire.

Admittedly the African system of divination is far superior to that used by modern wiccans. Mr. Plaisance goes so far in trying to imitate the dillogun by attaching Greek dieties to each pattern. Non-initiates do not have the ache needed to interpretate our divinaiton system and wiccans should learn to stick with their Tarot cards.

The book is a little confusing so make sure you read the introduction before you beging using it (the main reason I only rated it 4 stars.) I really like that the layout is grouped by classes: Anti-infectives, Anti-inflammatories, Cardio meds, GI meds, Mental Health meds, etc. It has helped me focus in on specific side effects of classes, which I am told is the best way to remember them.

However, I received an email from Kaplan that advertized these flashcards, and once I purchased them, I saw the benefit. By the time you graduate, you find that you don't need all of those details, just the main necessities. There is room to place your own personal notes, and convienent to carry around.

It is hard to judge wether Mit Gas is really better than the debut album. It is quite not as rock-orientated as the first one. The Guy who sold me the album said it is better than the first one since it sounds less like Faith No More, but you can hear FNM especially on \\"Rape This Day\\". Not just for Faith No More fans, but for anyone willing to experience great music with open minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel sorry for you","review":"First of all anything Patton creates is exeptional. He will be different in other band because it has different people! He didnt want lombardo(good drumer) in Tomahawk because he wanted a smoother drummer to it. So really your just discrasing yourself to be angry with Tomahawk because they already have come this far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break this band up","review":"After buying there self-titled album, which was decent, I had high hopes for this album.This is not a good album. \\"Rape this day\\" is the only half-way listenable song here. I cringe to think that Mike Patton went from Faith No more, to this. Do yourself a favor and let this one collect dust on the rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more focused album than their self-titled album","review":"With Mit Gas, Tomahawk has refined their sound into a hard hitting, concise explosion... much like the missle with which they share a name. Mit Gas is better than their first album in about every way. It sounds like a mix of Radiohead's Kid-A and pre-Nevermind Nirvana... with extra testosterone. And of course, you get Patton's amazing vocals on top of that. I look forward to see what these guys do on their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mit Gas","review":"This is a fantastic CD. Just the right mix of the weird and the conventional. It is easy to listen to, sing along, and get into, but don't worry, it will still scare the straights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first album","review":"They still rock, a few tracks I really dig. But I have to say I still like the first release better,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomahawk outdo themselves!","review":"This album is very very good. I instantly appreciated some songs and others grew on me but overall I love the whole album. I certainly think this tops there Debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Patton","review":"Loved Faith no more and Mr bungle and Fantomas but cannot get into Mike Patton's other, other project Tomahawk. Tomahawk falls somewhere in between his other bands. Its not completely insane like Bungle or Fantomas, but doesnt rock out or empower you like Faith no more either. Its just wierd, but unengaging and boring wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIRED,REHASHED, NOT IMPRESSIVE","review":"What a shame that Mike Patton has given up on Faith No More and Mr. Bungle for this...The 1st Tomahawk album was great but this effort is sad and tired..For those wondering what a bad Faith No More album would sound like check out this album....Horrid production, Mike's vocals have bad effects, for some reason he doesn't sing into microphones anymore without using samplers..2 good songs and it is no coincidence that they sound liek songs from Mike's more original and more successful bands..'Rape This Day' is like Digging The Grave Part 2 which makes it great and 'You Can't Win' sounds like it could go on the Mr. Bungle debut album..Everything else isjust filler"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gassed Up... Ready To Go","review":"I can see where some might think the music on this album is more straightforward than their previous album, but that doesn't mean it's of lesser magnitude. Just listen to the aggressive \\"Rape This Day\\" or the haunting \\"Aktion F1413.\\" This is definitely my favorite work of Mike Patton's, and the music is heavy and solid with loud guitars, which works very well here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise To Patton","review":"This album was strange at first...it really is a new genre that Patton et al have created with this and their first album. The more you listen to it, the better it gets...it just keeps growing on you. Everything Patton does seems to be brilliant. Seeing Tomahawk perform this album in concert makes it even better. Pass it on - to the young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Braudel's books are more interesting and enjoyable by far than the dull political, military, and social histories.

The music and backdrop make this video a great experience. I wish she would make more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!!!","review":"This album captures a mood. It pulls you in from the first song and makes you feel good. The acoustic drive is something that many bands can not pull off, Toad has no problem with it. If you like music not noise you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toad...overlooked.","review":"Pale was the album that introduced me to toad the wet sprocket, and sparked a ten year love affair that has left me standing in the rain waiting for standing room only space when they played Deep Ellum in Dallas. I am forever lost trying to figure out why people never catapulted them to the stardom they so richly deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous!!!","review":"This album is one of those ones that have really helped me deal with a lot of stuff. The lyrics are so emotional and insightful. Really, a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"colorless Pale?","review":"Toad the Wet Sprocket was one of those bands I loved when I was younger that just seemed dull to me as I became aware of more and more music. Yet I still return to those albums sometimes for that quality of innocence in their spare guitar-driven progressive melodies, and so the band tends to be fairly innofensive and even dull at times, they have moments of real transcendence. That, at least, is what I found recently listening to Pale, which has its share of doggerel, but occasionally, there's a song like \\"Don't Go Away,\\" which is ebullient and heartfelt, or \\"Liars Everywhere,\\" which is as powerfully felt as any song of the REM-lite genre of prog-rock (if not any song by REM). This record doesn't always shine, but it's bare and moving where it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prelude to \\"Fear\\"","review":"I would love to give this CD a five star rating, I really would. In fact, this disc is my favorite Toad the Wet Sprocket album. BUT, it is not perfect. I am not really able to put my finger on it but something is off about this album. Taken individually, almost all the songs on Pale are solid. Songs like \\"Torn,\\" \\"She Cried,\\" High on a Riverbed,\\" \\"Corporal Brown,\\" and \\"Chile\\" are outstanding but as a whole, the disc lacks flow. Perhaps it is due to Toad's \\"curve\\" at this point... whatever the reason, Toad does not achieve the full sound that they do on their seminal album, \\"Fear.\\" Still, \\"Pale\\" is a worthy album and well worth the price to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Zimmer's most unique works","review":"I hunted around and bought this CD as soon as it came available. This CD has moved me to tears so many times...it's incredible. John Toll, the cinematographer of the film and also a man I look up to, created such amazing images that they are now permanently fused in my head and come out whenever I listen to the soundtrack.Often, I am reminded of the village attack scene during #3 \\"Journey to the Line\\" (my favorite on here). This scene, along with the music (eventually crossing into a classical song by Charles Ives when Charlie Dale is lying the wounded pile of Japanese) is by far one of the most powerful scenes in any film I've seen.The movie wouldn't be possible without the music, no question about it. Some of the later tracks get a little tired for me, but the first 6 are great, some of the best I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the movie. Loved the soundtrack.","review":"The music to this movie is not like the music to other war movies. It is very melodic and very moving in how you are supposed to feel in each scene. I enjoy Hans Zimmer music and I was pleased to hear a piece of it in the trailor for \\"Pearl Harbor\\". I also suggest that people listen to the companion CD by the Melanesian choir which is also very beautiful. This is such a wonderful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtile","review":"Hans Zimmer d'une sensibilité et d'une subtilité désarmantes, qui rappelle celle de James Newton Howard (mme si leur style sont non-mélangeables, à mon avis). Étonnant de la part de Zimmer. On reconnait certains moments d'Inception et du Dernier des Samourais. Bref, de la bonne base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Gold","review":"What can I say? Any movie score composed by Oscar winner Hans Zimmer is a masterpiece! This score is absolutely no exception to that rule! Whether you be a Hans Zimmer fan, an avid soundtrack collecter, or just love good music; then I enthusiastically suggest this wonderful musical score as a worthwhile addition to your music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving. [20 bit HDCD]","review":"The philosophies explored and the score were the best parts of the film. It had been over a year since I'd seen it in the theater and a piece of music kept playing itself in my mind...almost bringing me to tears. I couldn't figure out what it was or why it did that to me. Then it hit me...it's from the Thin Red Line. That's how special this music is. Both this one and the Blade score, among MANY others, were mastered by Joe Gastwirt, one of the most experienced in the industry, at Oceanview Digital Mastering and sound absolutely terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SoundTrack ..but one question","review":"This was a great soundtrack; even better than Saving Private Ryan's. My only question is does anyone know who sings that angelic voice that is played at the very beginning of the movie when Witt is first shown? That song is not anywhere in the soundtrack, and I agree with the previous author below that they should release a full soundtrack version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanz Zimmer's Best work","review":"This soundtrack is Melodic and Haunting. It is different from most of Hanz Zimmer's other work in that it is less action driven. This music will definately help anyone relax in almost any situation. The music is absolutely beautiful, and it's too bad that it was overlooked when it nominated for Best Musical Score. There is one Melanesian track on this CD that is in the movie, the rest can be found on a seperate \\"Melenisian\\" CD, and just like Hanz Zimmer's work, they are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin red line \\"Masterpiece\\" Jan 2000","review":"The film is a masterpiece and I feel it was the music that truely made it so . As soon as I heard the main theme I new straight away I would buy the soundtrack . I'm a bit dissappointed in a way because alot of the beautiful chants were not on the disc. Track three journey to the thin red line a magical piece of music so captive and mystical so deeply moving you could possibly walk away after hearing this music and not carry it in your heart. Zimmers work on this soundtrack is fantasic a real masterpiece in creating the intensity and life these men had to live through ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thin Red Line does not deliver","review":"Beware that this CD does not include many of the fantastic tracks in the original movie. It is just the incidental compositions of the principal composer, not all of the compositions by other composers that were added into the movie soundtrack. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ghostly and iridescent...","review":"I haven't actually listened to the album yet. But I've seen the film twice now. And the music (one orchestral theme and the chants in particular) is some of the saddest, loneliest music I've ever heard. The film itself is remarkable. As complex as \\"2001\\" and more haunting than anything I've ever seen in my life. And I've seen upwards of a thousand films. Movies are my life. And this one has captivated and challenged me more than any other. The score has only heightened its effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zimmer's lesser pieces","review":"I was a bit disappointed with Zimmer's score on this particular soundtrack. There weren't any driving themes or rhythms. Just ambient Zimmer... Where did the main film theme go anyhow? It's not on this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zimmer's most understated score yet.","review":"I purchased this score album without ever having seen the film (and as of yet, still haven't) simply on the reputation of its composer alone. A longtime fan of Zimmer's work, I had come to expect rollicking action scores and powerful percussion, none of which were to be found here. Instead, I found a thoughtful and moving score with very little resemblance to any of Zimmer's previous works. Particularly touching were the climactic \\"Journey to the Line\\" and \\"Light\\" with its glorious harp ostinato. An incredibly well-composed and well-recorded disc (in HDCD, no less!), this is some of the most relaxing and thought-provoking music I have heard in a long time (yes, relaxing music from a war movie!). Fans of traditional Zimmer may be disappointed, but those who have an ear for a more mellow score may want to give this one a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice work","review":"I give it four stars and not five, but only because of the way the music is edited on the CD. For instance, the opening organ music (which accompanies the appearance of the crocodile in the movie) is way too shortened to evoke the hallucinatory quality of the movie soundtrack. This is wonderful stuff -- its clear that Zimmer has been listening to Gorecki, among others, and has produced some wonderfully minimalistic string writing here. This is one of the most effective and standout film soundtracks since John William's \\"Star Wars\\" theme (if you can remember the impact that that theme made at the time and separate it from the cliche that its become since then)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply moving score","review":"In my humble opinion, this is Zimmer's best work. \\"Journey to the Line\\" and \\"Light\\" are beautifully arranged and speak volumes during the film. Some of the tracks are a bit irratable but most of the scores have the ability to produce great waves of deep emotion, especially during the film. I recommend watching the film first, it captures the poetic depth of the film perfectly. Also, do not listen to this track if you want to be in a jolly mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borya and the Burps is More for Adults then Children","review":"Borya and the Burps An Eastern European Adoption Story by Joan McNamara looks and feels like a children's book but once you start to read it clearly is for adults or for older children about to add a sibling to their family via adoption. This story explains what it is like in an orphanage in some far off European country, who takes care of the babies and what the routine might be like. The book focuses on a baby boy named Borya and what his routine is day in and day out and how he feels when one of the 7 babies in his room adopted, and finally how he feels when he is chosen by an American family. This information maybe very helpful to parents who want to acclimate their newly adopted child into their home.Having said that, Borya is often confused in this story and has his own special concerns and worries.

The art work is charming and the story quite sweet. Like other reviewers, we have avoided the term \\"orphange\\" at our house, and I almost didn't get this book after reading the comments about it. With so few choices for books about Russian boys, I decided to give it a try, deciding in the end, I'd rather he heard the word from me than others. It hasn't been a problem at all.

The listing gives no idea that the cord is included so I ordered the cord too. AMAZON did give me a full refund on the cord which was nice.Not sure why the instructions say it has to be torked to 360fp + 3fp. It comes with an o ring and that seems like a lot of tork. Been working on Diesels for myself over 40 years. Can't imagine why you would need to use that much tork.

It's an ok, unoriginal story, but if this had been the first Melanie Rawn novel I encountered, I would have been GREATLY discouraged from reading another. In any case, it's definitely not one fo those books I'd ever read twice, more the kind that would make me shudder were I to pass it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much fluff","review":"Excuse me, but when I read a book, I don't want to be bored to tears. Last time I checked, good books shouldn't put you to sleep. If it weren't for the fact that I wanted to see what was so good about it, I never would've finished it. Can I just say this without being burned at the stake for sacrilige by all the millions of loyal fans this series seems to have garnered? All the major charectors acted like they had had frontal labotomies halfway through the book. Rohan was a moralistic idiot. His actions had little coherence. No one's going to rape his wife after refusing to have sex with her because HE just had sex with some other chic, even if they had just suffered brain damage. Let's just say this; I don't like soap operas, even ones involving magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I kept hearing about this series and how well Melanie Rawn writes yet, while reading this book I found myself constantly skimming the pages. I really struggled to finish this novel.I found the romance between the leading characters to be unoriginal and simply boring. I found Rohan to be too perfect and excruciatingly dull. I also thought that Rawn's attempts at sexual chemistry between the characters was mere child's play. I should warn you that while the book advertises dragons as major players, they are in reality background props. This is not a book worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compelling, even for the younger generations","review":"Being only 14 when I read this, it's amazing how Rawn can make her books appeal to all generations. Even Rohan, who was a good 7 years older than I at the very beginning, seemed to have retained some of those adolecent traits that I could relate to. I found all the characters very interesting and each one appealed in his or her own way.The story line itself jumps forward a bit a couple of times and that's the only reason I gave the book 4 instead of 5 stars. The good part is that there are admireable characteristics in ALMOST everybody. And there are characteristics that aren't admireable in everyone, yes everyone. Again, Rawn does a good job of making the characters realistic instead of some super, demi-god figure that no one can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I think Dragon Prince is a good book because it has lots of action and a good plot. I would certainly recommend this book to older readers because it has lots of violent scenes but it's still a very good book.I liked it because it described all the places they went to.

The characters are one dimensional. The evil people are purely evil, no one is a shade of grey, everything is done in black and white.One of the saddest, most pathetic things I ever saw was what the main female character had to do to become a woman. At the age of 16, she, like all Sunrunners, must have sex in the dark with a strange man she has never met, thereby losing her virginity. Doesn't this author know having sex does not make you a woman? What kind of message is she trying to convey to young girls? You are not a woman until you have sex and it may as well be with a stranger if you are not yet in love with someone you know. I thought it was sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent marred by politics","review":"When I buy a fantasy book, it's to ecape our world, not read political opinions of fantasy writers. While I give credit to Miss Rawn for her talent it's sad that she had to ruin a good fantasy story, and well crafted world by turning the final book into a political document. If I had known that the purpose of her books was to promote a Pro-choice / Anti-Church agenda, I never would have given Miss Rawn a dime. This is a good example of how to lose readers, both for the author and the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this provided many dull moments.","review":"Someone recommended this book to me, and I thought he had taste. Until I read it. Rohan and Sioned's relationship did seem like it came right out of a romance novel, and pretty much digusted me. Granted, it got better by the end, but give me a break! Rohan himself was pretentious and arrogant, with his same thoughts repeated over and over throughout the book. Give me something new! not the same thoughts repeated in different words. The last five or ten pages seemed like a waste of paper, and believe me, it wasn't a big finish but a dull anti-climax. The book would be better if the editor had had more guts. Cutting out a few repetitious sections would have been a huge improvement. And all the references to sex seemed very juvenile in my opinion. So, if you're fifteen you might like it, but for those of us with more demanding tastes: it's a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Absolutely terrible.","review":"I don't know what the other people here are thinking. This book sucks. I couldn't distinguish one character from another. They were all the same. The \\"good\\" characters were like saints, while the \\"bad\\" characters were so pathetic and easy to defeat, I actually fell asleep when I was reading the scene where the good guys win.

After reading it, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I'm not really sure that it is the first part of a trilogy so much as it is the first encapsulated story in a series of adventures that the main characters go through. Trilogies leave more loose ends or do in three books what this one did all by itself. now, that is not a bad thing, but it means that instead of wanting to run out and buy the next book in the series to find out how so and so solve this problem or that, I want to find out how the next adventure of the characters goes, which is something I'm not used to in my fantasy novels. I'm still going to buy the next book, but I do hope that there are more loose ends in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"why all this trouble over one book?","review":"i didn't find it either as magnificent or as troubling as some of the other readers did. just boring. there was nothing that made me want to keep reading it. frankly, it bored me to tears. the characters were ok, if cliched. the reactions and actions were unrealistic. if it weren't for the fact that the author obviously went to a lot of trouble to think this up, and did take some risk, i'd have given it one start, to reflect personal enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Fantasy","review":"I adore this book series. I first read Dragon Prince when I was in the hospital recovering from Appendicitis where I quickly fell under the spell of the Princes and Sunrunners. I was so enchanted that I would be lost to the world for hours at a time. It took my mind off of the pain. The book itself is very detailed and highly enjoyable. The charecters are 'real' in the fact that by the end of the book they feel like old friends. The book has everything a reader could want; humor, good dialog, plot, and action. I really don't understand what these other reviewers are talking about when they say that it is a 'shallow' story and that Ms. Rawn is a racist. The book is written on a level that isn't seen much anymore, with thought and feeling. I'm just sorry that my review won't do it justice.P.S. Dragon Prince is my personal favorite of the 6 book series and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"I picked up this series because it was given good reviews by Anne McCaffrey, an author I have a good deal of respect for.
