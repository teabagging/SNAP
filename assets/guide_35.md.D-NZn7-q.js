Amanda Root is a much better Anne. In this version Sally's 'acting' was basically sighing her way through the story. The film went quickly without jeopardizing Jane Austen's storyline. But Sally Hawkins ruined it for me - especially the longed awaited kiss that focused on her mucus laden teeth. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What price time constraints","review":"Having watched the PBS release of Persuasion, I found out that the film was heavily edited from the BBC version.

WHY?????","review":"I love this book and love everything Jane Austen. I am a huge fan of the 1995 version and I had really high hopes for this BBC masterpiece theatre version. But sadly, I was very disappointed. The characters were unbelievable and the screenplay was horrid. The casting of this production was poorly done. None of the sailors looked like weathered sailors that went through a war! The acting was sub-par and the plot seems all over the place. Captain Wentworth was good key candy but that is not enough to save this movie. I basically cringed through the entire 2 hours or so and I actually covered my eyes at the ending. The most painful scene for me wasn't the running but the actual kiss at the end...It was so incredibly painful to watch!! Sigh...I really really wanted to like this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A new adopter of Jane Austen fiction, I recently went on a campaign to watch every adaptation of my favorite novels. After watching the 1995 version of Persuasion, I must say that I am very disappointed in this recent take. Although I wish the 1995 actors were as handsome as those portrayed in the 2007 version, the 1995 adaptation is much more fluid and romantic. The actors portray the characters very well and look natural.Although the cinematography is better in the 2007 version, it seemed very stilted and focused more on the facial expressions of each actor rather than the actual storyline. I feel it is rushed and disjointed. The music is a bit dramatic and the acting is overdone.If you are interested in purchasing this film and have not seen it yet, I highly suggest you rent it first (along with the 1995 version) and come to your own conclusion. I am glad I did not purchase it in haste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring Compared to 1995 Version","review":"Having recently watched the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version of Persuasion on PBS, I consider myself fortunate not to have invested in its purchase. Compared to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciar��n Hinds, Persuasion 2007's script leaves much to be desired. The actors were another problem; they just seemed to put very little emotion into their characters. While watching the current one, I kept asking myself if I would have understood the depth of Austen's story had I not been familiar with the 1995 version and the answer was no. Do yourself a favor and skip Persuasion 2007 and purchase the wonderfully produced Pursuasion 1995.Persuasion"},{"rating":"2","title":"The score is incredible","review":"I just watched this version of Persuasion for the second time. The person who arranged the music deserves an award (maybe they did?). Sally Hawkins also deserves accolades for her performance. Even though the film is not true to the book, both the music and Ms. Hawkins make this version of Persuasion an enjoyable way to spend an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"Overall I think this movie imitates the book pretty good. I like all the actors except Anne. She seems a little too timid and can barely get a word out which is kind of annoying at times. The movie does have places where it doesn't follow the book. I think they tried to bring in some excitement and 'suspense' to the movie so they added some stuff that wasn't in the book. But like I said the rest of the movie is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jane Austen movie!","review":"This is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's book. If you're a fan of Masterpiece Theater and Jane Austen, you'll love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH","review":"It is hard to imagine why anyone would make a film of Jane Austen's Persuasion without any respect for the majesty of her words. This production pales in comparison to the complexity of the book and serves as a reminder of how wonderful the 1995 film staring Amanda Root was.Just a couple thoughts: no well-bred young woman would run wildly through the streets, certainly not Anne Elliot. And why have the book end with Wentworth purchasing Kellynch? Isn't the reason that Mr. Elliot is in the book because he is going to inherit the entailed property and wants to insure any way he can that nothing comes between him and his inheritance? He courts Mrs. Clay because he thinks that Sir Elliot may marry her and produce a new heir who could then inherit in his stead. The ending was just plain dumb. This film lacks the tenderness, the thoughtfulness, and the regret that are the hallmarks of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good","review":"reading Persuasion for me was dificult but i did cause i love Austen books. now watching this live and so very well acted, I'm totally transported to the book. its sweet and lovely.I think its ver dificult the task adaptating the book to a movie. but this its a Wonderfull adaptation. i love it, i get nervous, happpy and suffer with every thing that happend to this carracters.then after i finish the movie, i go back to the book and then back to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional","review":"I must admit that I didn't get very far into this film.

If you're fairly blind to cinematography, you might like this thing, but otherwise avoid it..especially if hand-held camera makes you sick. It's sad that cinematogaphy is getting so unprofessional in so many movies, especially on television. We're entering a dark age."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"I have enjoyed many of the new BBC Jane Austen productions (Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility), so I had high hopes for Persuasion, my favorite Austen book. It started out well, and I rather liked the choice of a younger less weather beaten Captain Wentworth. Yet by the end I was shaking my head and couldn't wait for it to end. Sally Hawkins was a mopey Anne, who never did seem to get her bloom back. And the scriptwriter--what happened? Did he/she get drunk halfway through and decide to toss Austen's book? Key bits of dialogue were shifted around, and then ending with Anne running a marathon around Bath was a disaster. And the ending scene was a bit odd, too. It's not as if Anne was longing for a house for eight years...Luckily, we still have Amanda Root and the wonderful film from 1995."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superstars!","review":"If you haven't heard Back Door Slam, you haven't heard the newest superstars in blues rock!

He recounts many of the horrors of the brainwashing process, sleep deprivation, starvation, and imprisonments during the Communist regime. He continued to find opportunities to talk to other prisoners about God's work of salvation. Haralan comes across as a humble man, serving God in each circumstance with grace for each day delivered by the God he served and worshipped.

The game's play objectives were challenging - make a grammatically correct sentence using the bits and pieces pictured on one of the five edges of the 10 cards in your hand - but it also made for a lot of laughs when players read their sentences to the group.The only 'mushy' part of this game is that there's no way to prove that any given sentence is grammatically correct, since there's no reference that can determine that. The game's rule is that, if the group agrees on the correctness of the sentence, then, it is so. Kind of chancy, I think.All in all, the game is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This is a fun education game. You've Been Sentenced kept us entertained for hours.

I tried two major brands and found their scanning software lacking; I couldn't keep them from defaulting to the simple idiot-scan or automatically cropping and \\"fixing\\" the orientation of my scan materials (note to HP and Epson: those are nice features for some people, but please allow us to turn them off). The Microtek scanner has everything I was looking for, and so far has not let me down. The only downsides I can find are a slightly flimsy lid, a minor crash while i installed it on XP, and for some inexplicable reason it scans upside-down (which I got used to). If you want a scanner that gives you complete control, get this one and use it in expert mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all-around scanner","review":"I was lucky enough to receive this scanner for Christmas, and have been very pleased with it. It's probably better than what I would have purchased myself, as I don't do that much scanning, just a few photos now and then. But I was amazed by the superb quality of scans, and the ease of use of the scanner. The software wasn't that hard to use. Basically, scan everything at 50%, leave all of the other settings alone, and you should be good to go (100% images are HUGE).The only negative about this scanner is that sometimes the scan light (the one inside the scanner, not the LED on the front)stays on, indefinitely. To get around this I pull out the power cord if I don't plan to use it for a while... no power switch... because I don't want the light to burn out. Other than that, it's a great scanner. Combined with my HP-5550 printer, I can make perfect copies of anything, including photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time.....","review":"Purchased Microtek ScanMaker 4850 in spite of reading all of the not so favorable reviews.

Windows XP can't find the scanner. I give up. I've owned this pos for over a year and have yet to get one scan from it. Their website is equally useless.

Let me say that I really loved my Visioneer. First of all, the scanner installed pretty easily, no problems there. But... when I reboot XP, it takes 60 seconds just to boot the scanner before most of my other programs can load. Also, you have to manually open the ScanMaker 5 program and click the scanner control button and then close out of the program to get the light to go off. I wouldn't ever buy another one of these. I've also had a big problem with lint inside the machine under the glass, causing big problems with clean scans. I've tried about everything I can think of and still have the problem.

The CD concludes with a pretty melody on the upbeat \\"Home for Now,\\" \\"You know that I go home to my sleeping misses and shower her with my lazy kisses.\\" Patrick Park's debut full-length set is a varied work with strong songs, quite pleasurable listening. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp singer songwriter","review":"A worthwhile listen, especially the first half of the album, and the last 2 tunes. Patrick is not afraid to be outdone by the drums, and guitars (like many singers), and lets them flourish within many of the (best) tracks. Honest Skrew, Your Smiles a Drug, Bullets By the Door, and Home for Now are some of the standout tracks. Great bargain at these used prices. This cd is good enough that I may be interested in investigating his back catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Be Tricked","review":"After reading all the reviews of this album, one would be lead to believe that upon the first few listens, this would be a great album.

Don't be suckered and/or swindeled by people who knock Patrick Park---they're probably the same breed that get off listening to Jessica Simpson and other horrible pop culture music. Indie lo-fi is the new hip music---and it's not to be ruined by radio. Patrick Park exemplifies this through the outstanding uses of banjo, harpsichord and harmonica, among many other instruments as well, in a non-bluegrass way yet still possessing an enigmatic touch of twang. The music is melodious, heavenly and sublimely complimented by his sweet retro voice that tells tales of folklore through his life. In the film Contact, Jodie Foster says \\"They should have sent a poet,\\" marveling at beauty of an unfathomable degree...and Patrick Park is that calibre of poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"I just found out about this guy a couple of weeks ago.

They do not have to be used together, and using only one does not in any way diminish the effectiveness. These videos have been a key component in my stress reduction program. They work better for me than Yoga because you are actively moving with control throughout the routines, which I find keeps my mind from being able to dwell on whatever is stressing me. By the end of each tape, I feel relaxed, centered, and balanced (which is quite an accomplishment!). Both instructors have pleasing voices and demeanors.

I applaud Mr. Barabba for breaking that mold. He lets us see the context of uncertainty that surrounded decisions taken in GM's transformation. He gives us the added benefit of laying-out the theories behind the decision making approach. I found his concrete recommendations on dealing with organizational complexity and identifying key market development assumptions to be very useful. His discussion of deploying a \\"Sense & Respond\\" business model in spite of GM's financial stress gives great examples identifying the opportunity costs from alternative strategies. Lastly, his discussion of using the destination-focused, \\"Anticipate & Lead\\" business model is an eye-opener of everyone dealing with rapidly changing, turbulent markets.

The simple fact that General Motors, once the poster child for big, entrenched industry, is now in the transportation services business vice just selling vehicles should be a powerful eye-opener! If GM can do this, so can our federal bureaucracies.

They played many of the songs on this CD at the concert, many mostly acoustically. A warm and wonderful sound. The song \\"Teresa\\" is among my favorite Los Lobos recordings, and their version of Gunatanamera is by far the best I've heard. Probably my favorite track, after Teresa, is Maricela, on this CD more lively and immediately personal than versions on other CDs. The more instrumentally spare, but warmer versions of \\"Two Janes\\" and \\"Saint Behind the Glass\\" on this CD are great, as well.

There's even a song about THE VIRGIN SUICIDES that's lovelier than the Air movie soundtrack. In addition to the guitars and strinsg Flare is known for, there's an emphasis on the baritone ukulele (Beghtol's ax of choice) as well as sublime vocal harmonies, subtle keyboards and hushed drumming. And the cover of Kid Montana's \\"Anywhere (Like the Moon) should become a classic. All and all a treat for folks who like Low, Magnetic Fields, Will Oldham (though Flare is more complex and sophisticated) and just good songwriting and arranging in general. The production is complex but transparant - listen in headphone for maximum swirl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Like You Ain't Afraid to Die...Just Enjoy the Ride","review":"This album covers some new ground with a peppy Cajun number complete with squeezebox and French words to go with the English ones. Chris holds true to form and has some rip roaring toe tappers that are hard to sit still for. The first video from Horsepower is on his website. All Wound Up is my favorite on this album. It's hard to get out of your head. Like a book you can't put down. Songs for every age. Good clean fun.

I've been looking for something like this for a long time. The only problems I had at first were minor. The chain was too small for me to wear comfortably, and for added protection, I doubled the hoop thing that the necklace goes through. Other than that, I was happy.But after wearing it a couple days, I've noticed the back of the pendant has started to wrap/bubble. And it kind of creeps me out. I don't know why. I guess it seems kind of cheap. The main reason I wanted to buy it was to wear, but I don't want to wear it if it'll disintergrate on me, or have the bubbling become worse.Still.

We will be excluded from bonding with colleagues because we won't be able to play on the company's softball league and it would be inappropriate to join the men at bar for drinks after work.

In a fast-moving 48 pages, this book packs a lot of information and answers almost every potential question the young reader may have about these amazing birds. Author Ruth Berman clearly communicates her love for the subject and introduces new words without writing down to her readers. Richard R. Hewett's beautiful photographs do an excellent job of illustrating the text.There are only three species of peafowl, and the focus of this book is on the common, or Indian peafowl. We are shown their natural environment, their feeding habits, displaying their train feathers, and their families. Considering how popular these birds are, it is surprising how few books there are written about them. Even though this book is intended for grade-school-age children, any adult interested in learning more about peacocks and peahens will be greatly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense of Fear","review":"I enjoyed Devil's Footsteps for many reasons, but it lured me in mostly by the fear.

The doll does not sit on the bike seat. When her feet and hands are attached to the appropriate places(handlebars and pedals), her bottom just hangs in mid air and her head falls backwards, so she appears to be riding her bike as though she's fallen asleep. Her legs do appear to be pedaling(for a short while) and the bike moves only in forward and backward motions. She can't do wheelies on her own, you have to attach a clip from the bike to the cart and it allows the bike to ride with only the back wheel on the ground and the front wheel raised in the air. Also, her feet constantly fall off the pedals. The little hooks that attach to her feet are not big enough to fit into the holes on the bottoms of her feet, so after she pedals three or four rotations, they just come apart. This was a disappointing toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her feet fall off the pedals","review":"My daughter had to have this, however....as Sarah goes around the house, her feet keep falling off the pedals.

She is a bit difficult to get on the bike because her feet won't stay on the pedals and she absolutely won't sit on the bicycle seat when her feet are on the pedals and her hands are properly positioned on the handle bars. That is a bit disappointing. The remote is very easy to use, especially once you get the hang of the back and forth movement to turn Sarah. This is certainly not the best toy out there, but seeing my daughter's face and listening to her squeal with joy has been all worth any minor troubles."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Food Combos for Stews","review":"I find myself pulling this book off the shelf again and again.

Unfortunately that's about all he is. Overhaul is jointed in a way which, while excellent for putting him in dynamic-looking poses for a display, is all but useless when it comes to actual play. (He can't even achieve the \\"stand perfectly straight with one arm pointed forward and the other down by his side\\" pose popularized by the nearly immobile early Transformers toys.) His gimmick is weak, too: apply excessive force to his \\"Cyber Key\\" in an unsuccessful attempt to get it to stay in the little slot on his back so you don't lose it, and he fires a missile THROUGH HIS OWN CHEST.Overall, an unexpectedly weak toy among the veritable avalanche of awesome that is Transformers: Cybertron.

I just wonder why talented artists who clearly have an abundance of creativity cannot find their own voices and instead insist upon copying Ani Difranco's style. This makes the album painful for me to listen to. Clearly, Alix is an amazing poet. However, hearing her recite them is like listening to someone trying to mimick Ani Difranco. She is great at sounding like her. I honestly could not tell the difference. Sorry, but I think thats kind of lame. I can't listen to Alix. I think she is extremely talented...yet this whole business of stealing Ani's style... I can't stand it. It happens to often and it is just..kind of lame. What happened to originality?

This certainly wouldn't be a story I would give to my parents to make them understand better about me being a lesbian, and it does contain some sex so I wouldn't recommend it to kids, either. The language is at times really confusing but I found it better towards the end (I'm not exactly sure whether I myself got used to it, or it's just that the first chapters were written with a lot less~~ experience than the latter ones). Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this book since even beyond all her cynicism the heroine still had the sort of excuse I guess for her darkened vision of this world and she showed times and times again that she can be quite tender and loving.~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like crazy","review":"After initial assembly, there was a small leak on the back. I wanted to wall mount the unit, but the leak prevented that. I worked with an ESU (the manufacturer) support engineer to resolve the problem. I cracked a part following his instructions, which made the leak worse. The engineer sent me a replacement part that did not fit. At this point, I gave up on asking the manufacturer for help.Finding a replacement part that fit was a major hassle as the instructions don't include any sort of part list. Finally I located the part and replaced it. No sooner was that leak fixed than the increased pressure (from no longer leaking) caused another part of the unit to leak. By now the filter is out of warranty and I have to set it up on top of the washing machine so water doesn't go everywhere.

Too bad these scenes couldn't be included in the director's final cut.

You'll find a few sections where you'll chuckle, but it is certainly not a comedy. A slow moving plot that should STAY a short story and nothing more. More of a movie where the main character learns and grows, but even THAT is stretching it since it is so drab that you don't even care what happens to the guy.

The theme is that Will Ferrell, our alcoholic protagonist, loses his wife, his car, his house and his job - all on the same day - and ends up living on his front lawn. Not even close to being believable.Why is every character an alcoholic or down and out/out of control and then the focus of the movie is the character being redeemed?

He comes home to see his stuff on the front lawn and the door locks changed and bank accounts frozen by his now ex-wife who of course is seeing his trusted friend (on the sly).Formula, redundant, copycat storytelling where the ending was as predictable as taxes.Same predictable scenes of, of course, a lawn sprinkler coming on to soak the stuff on the lawn; attractive female with her own issues across the street; weird neighbors; and the predictable kid coming by to act as antagonistic foil to our protagonist who is sitting on the lawn with his stuff and acting helpless.Acting was very audition, read the lines, bland with the exception of CJ Wallace who gave the best performance of all by saying the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"i didnt think ferrell was capable of putting out such a poorly made movie---looks like a weekend project effort----------PITIFUL----NUFF SAID"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"I read the cover and knew somewhat to expect but didn't like it, none the less I guess I expected some humor since Will Farrell was in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent inspirational tale of an almost broken man.","review":"Lemme just say WOW.

This is just an awesome feel good film, in the sort of sense \\"Its a wonderful life\\" was and it makes you reflect on the difficulties you may be facing in your own life and how good it feels to know there is no greater than the gift of being alive and the ability to transform, reform yourself to grow and get back on your two feet.

I saw a preview for it and knew I would rent it. I like most of Will Ferrell's movies, and I thought Stranger Than Fiction was great. But this movie is really contrived. Not showing his wife as a character? Ironic, not creative. The depressing friend Kenny? Been done way too many times. Wife cheating on husband with friend? Been done to death! It's easy to depress people and have trendy ironic plot gimmicks, but it takes a little more to entertain. I watched it with my girlfriend and we both decided that we want our 2 hours back.

He just needs better scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but needed to follow through","review":"Not a bad movie. Will Farell has shown he can act (Stranger Than Fiction - go watch it), and he does a good job here. The kid (sorry, missed his name) did a wonderful job. Acting was really good all around. What was lacking was the script. Or rather, the ending. Given the final bits of the movie (Nick giving away the last of his stuff), the implication to me is that he was going to kill himself... and we get no indication of that. There's no indication of *anything*. He gives away his stuff, he hugs his neighbor, fade to black... um. I didn't expect an actual resolution, but some indication of what happens next would have been a really good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Must Go","review":"This is a great movie with a great actor (will farrell). it is a funny and serious movie, shows how hard it would be to give all of your stuff away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you appreciate yourself? If not, watch this.","review":"Long, boring, slow, depressing to the tenth degree, and a very realistic story. Yes, there is a moral or two, hidden or lost in delivery. In short, if you are looking for a good time, or are even bored, keep looking 'cause this is not even a good time waster while sitting snowed in at the airport, or 8-hour train layover at the Chicago train station.

Not Will Ferrell's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, sad, tender movie","review":"I love Will Ferrell's slapstick comedy, which just makes this film all the more impressive. Much more about alcoholism than about living on one's lawn. Great complex characters. It's plenty sad, but with a glimmer (not more) of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Ferrell in a - more or less - serious role!","review":"Everything Must Go, starring Will Ferrell, was a big surprise to me. I expected the comedian Will Ferrell. Instead, I got a serious Will Ferrell in a movie about relationships, alcoholism, friendship, AA, and more. Although I would never claim this was a fabulous movie, it did tug at the heart strings, and the viewer was kept wondering where the plot would lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Painful","review":"I love Will Ferrell movies...except for this one. I kept waiting for some sort or even a hint of action or life in this movie. It never happened. I was looking for something upbeat and something that had his usual charm.

Horrible, pathetic, and very lame movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie. Ever.","review":"Awful. Simply awful. I watched thirty minutes of this slow, unfunny, pathetic excuse for a movie.

We rented it because Will Ferrell is a comic genius. However, this movie was really poorly produced and provide little to no laughs. Save yourself the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic portrayal of alcoholism/addiction.","review":"I work in the field of addictions and found this to be an honest look at a man faced with the impact his drinking has had on his life.

It is a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done - but not a comedy by any means...","review":"Never cared for Ferrell's acting, but in this piece, that dopey expression, played for pathos works quite well. Good supporting cast and a Raymond Carver short story at its heart. As sad as it may be, it does not abandon hope. Surreal moments that work well. As well, a well-played commentary on contemporary life for about 15% of the American people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really happened.","review":"There was no real conclusion. The movie was slow and dry. I dont recommend it. I want at least half of my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad movie, good acting","review":"This is a depressing movie. Will did an incredible job acting and the story itself was somewhat original. However, this is far from a funny movie or a satire. This movie is just plain sad, so it should be in the drama category. So, if you like watching people at their rock bottom in life then you would enjoy this film, if you are like me and do not then skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny -- Not Interesting","review":"We watched this with semi-high hopes since it stars Will Ferrell.

Good writing, an interesting plot, and a story that seemed to move at just the right pace. Good character development and interesting dialogue.The story takes place in WWII, but the situations could still happen even today. It's a story of an earlier generation, but still applies to modern day.This isn't a book that takes a long time to read - it would be a great beach read - but it remains interesting all the way through.

Since then, she plays with this toy EVERY SINGLE DAY and she's become a pro at her alphabet at only 2-1/2 years old! In fact, she just came in and saw the picture on the computer as I'm writing and said &quot;that's my radio&quot; and brought it to me! She can sit and play for hours and gets me to sing all the songs with her! I love it, she loves it, hurray for LeapFrog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little radio","review":"I love that you can ajust the volume, when it's on the lowest setting it's not that bad. After having it for nine months we just replace the batteries today for the first time, which is great. This isn't one of my kids favorites but it's still cute. The songs are kind of annoying for the parents but the kids like to dance to them. I would reccomend this toy, it's cheap and entertaing which is always a great combination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for 2nd Birthday","review":"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday and loves it. The sound is SO CLEAR. We have other toys that say the ABC's and many sound distorted. Not this toy. It is great. When she isn't playing the individual letter songs she is dancing to 4 other children's songs. She is still a little to young to play the find the letter game... but that is ok because this toy will grow with her!! Also, it's the perfect size for little hands to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a bargain","review":"I actually bought mine at a thrift store for $8. It looks brand new and works perfect.

It was a Christmas gift and I almost returned it and I wish I had. She would much rather use her imagination or sing the alphabet than use this. It has no learning value except repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good toy for phonics","review":"My son got this toy for Christmas just before he turned 2. He loves listening to the few songs that are at the end, but otherwise, the toy is useless. It is very hard for me to understand the differences between some of the letters- I have to hear what word it's using as an example. It's a fun toy to tote around and listen to the songs, but as a learning device, it just isn't as good as other leap frog products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best in the Leapfrog lineup, but it is ok","review":"My daughter HATED this toy when she first got it. Actually, she was afraid of the voice, and refused to use it (she was almost 2 years old). As she got older, she would turn it on, but really didn't enjoy playing with it. The toy is kind of boring: turn the page, press a button, hear a song (and the same song as many of the other Leap products \\"B says BEE, every letter makes a sound\\" etc). Not much else. She prefers the Leapfrog refrigerator magnets better for learning the alphabet. For the price, I thought this was a sure hit. I'm glad I didn't spend more on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy","review":"My son had this toy and he loved it. He learned his ABCs and the letter sounds from this toy.

This toy met both of these urgent 18-month old needs. He just loves it! He already really loves books, so it's a bonus that that the front of the radio has pages that turn like a book with all of the different letters. We have only had it about half a week, but he is still fascinated with it and plays with it for long periods every day. He is very active so anything that can hold his attention for any period of time is a godsend. We love Leapfrog toys in general and already have the Alphabet Ball, Learning Drum and Phonics Bus. I think these toys are in large part responsible for helping him with starting to learn the Alphabet song. He knows a few letters and hums the tune when he wants us to sing it and there is a lot of \\"a, b, d, b\\" type singing from him. It's very cute! Thanks Leapfrog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value for the price","review":"This toy is not a good value.

Such, however, is Book Of Life, a film that posits a kinder, gentler, Armaggedon. Jesus Christ arrives at the airport December 31, 1999. He's expected to open the 4th-7th seals on the Book of Life, thereby unleashing Armageddon. He begins to have second thoughts, however, as he looks around and examines humanity. This causes trouble with God's lawyers. Besides the uniformly excellent writing, this movie also recalls Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, in that both movies hold special delights for those well-acquainted with the source material. The movie, shot on a digital camera, doesn't suffer for it. For Hartley fans, well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating concept, curious execution","review":"I love the quirkiness and daring of Hal Hartley but I must admit that I do not intend to keep this one in my collection.Having said that, a negative review would not have stopped mefrom seeing this film. I enjoy the difference that Hartleybrings to film. I watch the short \\"Surving Desire\\" regularlyand I also love \\"Simple Men\\", \\"Trust\\" and \\"Henry Fool\\".Basically, I wasn't convinced of the necessity of thecamera contortions and I didn't follow what he ws trying to saythrough his charachters. Hartley's technique walks a fine linein his films and sometimes a viewer simply says \\"Oh, please!\\"Didactically, I don't think you can learn anything in \\"Bookof Life\\" that hasn't been said in his other films.Of course, if you're a Hartley fan like me, you'll see this regardless.

Grokking the GIMP is the first book I have found which properly explains the relationships between masks, selections, and paths, and how to best use them to work with photos.

This book will make my work with the GIMP much more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way-cool for non-artists","review":"The GIMP is a wonderful tool, but I have never been able to do very many useful things with it because I lacked sufficient understanding of basic concepts like masks and layers.

Enough said.For those who are interested in learning why this book can be proven false in every way- Atkins wrote a partially completed, autobiographical work shortly before her death, in which she recants everything she said in the trial, and in this book, and states that essentially, Bugliosi forced her and Kasabian to testify that Manson was a murderous brainwashing hippie satanist commie-fascist guru, in order to make sure Bugliosi had a hairy, scary looking man to crucify so that he could write his bestselling book.And that, folks, is the truth behind helter skelter- it's complete fraud foisted upon us all by a willing, sensationalist media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got this book when it was first published and tried to read it with an open mind. sadly Susan Atkins did have a rotten childhood. But she also chose the path she went on long before joining Manson. I think regardless of Atkins background she was going to commit crimes. I have never beleived in her so called return to Christianity. Miss Atkins was a fine little actress and unfortuantely as given a life sentence when her death sentence was over turned. I have yet to see any memeber of the Family who has come clean so to speak on their roles in the tragedy that took so many lives. They all dump it on Charlie.

However, I could not stop and think that most of what she wrote in this book was contradictory of what she previously said-- and what she said after. It was obviously written in hopes the parole board would read it and be somewhat influenced.She seemed to accept some responsibility, but also pawn off responsibility on others. She made Manson seem like this all-powerful man with hypnotic powers and we all know that's just total BS. Manson had no powers, no more than you or I.All in all the book was kind of dull and rehashes tired stories with twists for personal gain. It's not as bad as Helter Skelter, but only read this if you have thoroughly researched the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunting, shocking, fascinating","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was a teenager. It goes to show you how morally adrift you can get when immersed in a world of drugs, booze and sex. I don't believe that Atkins would have done half the stuff she did if she hadn't been out of her mind on drugs. She had a really self righteous tone though as I recall. It seems that she implied Sharon Tate et.al. bought on their fate because hubby Polanski was dabbling in Satanism!

Just like the last reviewer, I had to remove his back panel and tighten the screws to keep his wings from popping up. I do not care for this PLANET KEY gimmick at all, at least with ARMADA you had an extra MINI-CON robot.

True science does not utilize scare tactics. While amalgam may not be pretty to look at, it has a proven record of efficacy with low adverse reactions (approx. 100 cases of true allergy in 150 years). These are the same people that are against fluoridation. A dentist who promotes no amalgams and no fluoride to their patients can expect a larger profit margin from the increase in decay and the inherently higher cost of the resin material used in place of amalgam. People who think that professional organizations such as the ADA and AGD are perpetuating some sort of cover up for their own benefit are sadly mistaken. Do me a favor- Take a good look at who is operating for the benfit of whom."},{"rating":"1","title":"fear-based and with no credible evidence","review":"As a practicing dentist, I am aware that silver fillings have been around for 150+ years. During that time, people are living LONGER. But, it's not due to the mercury OR the silver fillings. In fact, people eat more seafood than ever and get more mercury that way than from silver fillings. Finally, the plastic replacement fillings leach out formaldehyde over time. The only true replacement (if needed) is gold or porcelain at $800-or-so a tooth. I have silver fillings in my mouth. There is no free mercury. They are safe.

They are consistently firm and bursting with flavor. They are not mushy and bland like the other leading American brands and off-brand candies. They are still soft, but they are not too squishy. If you like firm bears, these are for you! They are also much more flavorful than other gummi bears I have tried. I am not positive that Haribo uses real fruit juice, but I think they do. It tastes like they do. Each color of gummi (I think there are 5 colors) has a unique and delicious flavor. Unlike many of the other brands of gummi bears available on the market, which often taste the same and are not as interesting. Haribo bears are sometimes available at the \\"regular\\" grocery stores, but you can definitely find them at World Market. I highly recommend theses bears to anyone that would like a more delectable gummi bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Web information is much cheaper than this book","review":"After reading this book, I am truly disappointed.

I think of the my many relatives that have had cancer and could not eat.Even though I think Sheppard has some great connections about food and addiction, I think her approach is too extreme and not mind/body focused enough, and frankly I just didn't like her.

I highly recommend this book for those who a diet has not worked for and will not work for.

She said eating should be a pleasure and these addictive substances gave her pleasure. The most telling thing she said was that she thought about her many relatives with cancer who could no longer eat.We now know that refined sugar and wheat, food additives, and a lack of whole vegetables and fruit in our diet has been linked to cancer.

She possesses a remarkably nuanced, emotive voice with a huge range able to fully command so many different musical styles. La Dona: Somewhere between sexy jazz, a bit of near-rap, and smooth funk with some latin flava. This CD has lots of stylistic diversity and La Dona allows other to share the stage with her. What doesn't change: Her fabulous voice, excellent production, flawless backup vocals and arrangements. Something else to mention: This CD is practically a double album -- lots of material, and all worthwhile. Thanks Lady T!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I guess I am in the minority here because I bought the CD over the weekend and hated it. All of the songs should have been performed by anyone other than Teena Marie. They all sounded quite similar in that she talks on each one and the constant reference to being Lady Tee was annoying. I'll take her old style of music like Ooh La La La, Square Biz, Lovergirl, etc. Leave the moaning and talking to the current wave of no-talent songbirds that are out there today.

I was really disapointed with this CD, and 'High yellow gal' yikes! I find her references to her daughter's skin color very creepy. Before her albums always had a great blend of musicians, vocals and artwork design. This one had none of it. Even the pics - why did they make our girl look like a mary jane girl re-tread!?

I have been listening to Teena since \\"It Must Be Magic\\" came out and everyone body was talking \\"Square Biz\\".I love \\"Honey Call\\" and \\"Off the Chain\\" Teena would have not have done anything like that without the Cash Money Crew. \\"Still In Love\\" is the first time she ever sampled someone else.Classic Teena is \\"My Body's Hungry\\", \\"Baby, I'm Your Fiend\\", and \\"Black Rain\\" her duets with Gerald Levert and Dee Dee O' Neal are excellent.This album is worth the wait and the money, if anyone tell you anything else they are hating.

All songs were coproduced with someone else, most of them were written with other song writers and it features alot of guest artist. It is their attempt at updating her sound to the current hip hop beats that dominates the air waves today.It works to an extent and it is refreshing to hear the musical makeover but what it lacks is the melting pot of styles that makes her so brilliantly great. Her music was always influenced from numerous genre of sounds,jazz,pop,R&B,soul,and rock. They are rarely shown here. Her trade mark jazz tinged vocals are really held back as well. It only shines on a few tunes like in \\"My Body's Hungry\\". Not at her best here but just happy to hear something from a great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teena, Welcome Back!","review":"Lady Tee is back y'all, and she ain't playin with y'all neither. With her mix of r&b, jazz, and rap she shows she can still reclaim her thrown that was taken from her for the past 15 years. My favorite songs has to be 'The Mackin Game', 'Off the Chain', 'Makavelli Never Lied'(a nice tribute to all the r&b and rap icons), 'I'm Still in Love' and 'Honey Call'. Teena, you really put it down on this one. Plus, Birdman and Mannie Fresh should be given themselves a pat on the back for getting this hit maker on their label.

However, La Dona doesn't disappoint me at all - it's brilliant, every bit as great as Irons in the Fire or Robbery or Magic.

The Vocals are strong, the Lady still has it, but the writing and production are weak. I have every one of Lady T's albums except the previous release about 10 years ago. Can't recall the title but one of the single's was If I were a Bell. This CD is comparable to that one. Weak. I think she is trying to appeal to a younger audience with too much hip-hop intonation. Lady T...please go back to your roots with some good old fashioned R&B. You don't need the rappers in the mix. Girl you can sing...so Sing.

Unfortunately, this is what the Met is doing with almost all their new productions.First, there is no logic in saying that this opera takes place in three kitchens. It does not; it takes place in the cottage, in the woods, and at the gingerbread house. Waiters in pig faces have no place in the story. And the greatest travesty of all is the Jerry Lewis/Three Stooges approach to the witch. She (he) is supposed to be frightening, not maniacally hysterical.

True, it's not as godawful as the ENO production of a few years back (that takes place in WWI England, the sandman is a coke-snorting wastrel and the mother and witch are portrayed by the same singer) but I wonder how awful opera productions have to get before we all scream, Enough!If you get this one, turn off the picture and just listen to the music.

The music and performances were top notch. but the plot and characterizations with pig faces .

Some good items in the front but then Fenster let his left-wing liberal views shine as bright as his negative attitude toward virtually everything. Not the least bit cute or funny. He should have quit while he was ahead on a few items, instead, it looks like he tossed about for any liberal trashy ideas to insert as filler. Don't buy this one. Thank goodness (and there is goodness in the world!) I only paid one dollar for it at a book sale.

Trashaway! It deserves a zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, negative one star...","review":"This book annoyed and angered me all the way up to page 120 where I had to stop reading it. It's either poorly researched or just full of outright lies. Some of it is amusing, some just snarky, but a lot of it is just false.The author makes some claims (typically about the Middle Ages) that are just completely made up. No basis in fact.For starters, as a student of that time period, I was really annoyed to find he didn't know the difference between The Dark Ages and The Medieval Period. The two are no more interchangeable than \\"Germany\\" and \\"France\\" or \\"The United States\\" and \\"Mexico.\\" They are completely different things, one ending where the other begins.I reluctantly threw the book away, in the garbage, just now, because it's just wrong.Get any edition of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader over this worthless tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is a waste of paper and time.","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. Luckily, I found a copy locally in the bargain bin for $1.50 and even that was more than it was worth. Besides ruining what could be considered potentially good satire and comedy with the bias and commentary of your average six-year-old, the book has become an example of its title by repeating urban legends and quoting historical \\"facts\\" that are unverifiable by established sources. Considering its bias, the historical fallacies and the urban legends presented as fact, the only conclusion one can come to for supporting this book is lack of education or a simplistic and easily amused mentality. Too bad 1 is the lowest number assignable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid book","review":"The first couple of chapters, which probably sold the publisher on the idea, are amusing enough, but I was constantly irritated by the author's opinions and snide comments woven throughout the book. As one reviewer put it, it's as if he thinks the reader isn't smart enough to understand the humor of stupidity on its face.The book steers clear of controversial subjects that show the history of stupidity, such as sexual ideals developed during the Victorian age. Thus, it's nowhere near a complete history. It's not a terrible book to keep next to the toilet, but the author's comments only add to the stink in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"Bob Fenster's DUH is a remarkable piece which demonstrates that the funniest characters are those which are real.

It is, however, easy to say that The Celestial Steam Locomotive is highly original, thought provoking, and very entertaining. It does exactly what a good science fiction novel should do. It's sequel, Gods of the Greataway, is equally entertaining. However, I found the third book in the series, Fang the Gnome, to be quite disappointing.

These characters -- the Bonner family and the people who work for them -- are believable and sweet, and I cared deeply about them. Zafris, more than anyone else I've read, is good at showing the complexities of the male gender, its paranoias and fears and desires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class, Comedy and Conflict","review":"The fact that Zafris is a Flannery O'Connot prize holder doesn't necessarily suggest there should be echoes of O'Connor in this work. That there are is part of the pleasure in reading it. The vivid portrayal of the underclass, the natural comedy and rhythm of their actions and dialogue, and the frank and touching insights into their thoughts are a confirmation of the writer's own inner life and savvy for understanding others. Forget he formulaic \\"name\\" novelists; give me more of Zafris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Often funny twist on family characters w/ all their issues","review":"Who would have thought a story about a family who owns a metal shredding business would be a lot of fun.Lots of dry wit, interesting characters - family and associates who all have their own issues or distinct color, a great \\"oh-oh\\" moment when I dreaded but couldn't help turning the pages fast enough, and even the process of mashing a car down for its various metal components is interesting in this author's hands.I could have done with a little less Hayley - she was fun in the beginning, but her incessant hitting on Olivia began to get repetitious.What seemed to keep me fully absorbed was the writing though.

Filling the tank is easy even though you don't know when to stop (I overflowed the tank and had to wipe up excess). My heater would not start from the automatic lighter. I suspect it was because of the first time operation and did not have the kerosene \\"wicked\\" up high enough to catch. It is easy to start with a BBQ lighter though and burned well over 8 hours on my first tank. Heat zone is pretty localized but I expected that.

There was a minimal amount of assembly and I had harder time finding a place nearby that sold 1-K kerosene ( OSH ) . The assisted lighting works great and flame is nicely regulated, the only negative is the kerosene smell which is a given with an open flame. I live in a 1200 sq. ft. house with one wall heater.

The handle is flimsy, but you just have to be careful. The wick adjustment does not lower the wick enough, but at it's lowest setting it burns at just the right height ( I guess I got lucky). When we replace the wick, I will make the proper adjustments. This unit will burn for probably 6-8 hours on a tank at the correct wick height. Bottom line is that it is doing exactly what I want it to do and I jus have two issues (handle and wick height). It burns clean and there is minimal odor. Of course there is more odor when you start and when you turn it off. For $119.00 I got auxiliary/emergency heat and am quite pleased.

I could not get the flame to blue no matter what , although it may have just needed a new wick. I wasn't going to try to fix something that was suppose to be brand new. It is good workmanship, but filled the house with kerosene smell no matter what I tried as far as adjusting wick and using k-1 fuel. I may have had a bad wick. I really wouldn't try this brand again myself though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defect with auto shut-off mechanism.","review":"I've had this heater for a few months. It would be great if it didn't keep shutting off when I try to turn it on. I think there's a design flaw with the manual shutoff button and dial. It's incredibly finicky, I'll turn it on and try to adjust the flame and then the knob automatically rotates back to the left and shuts off, emitting kerosene fumes in the process. When I do manage to get it to remain on, it might turn off at a slight nearby movement. At first I thought it was a manufacturing defect with my unit, but I've seen other reviewers with the same problem. Any known solutions? There seems to be no simple way of disabling this faulty auto shut-off mechanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!","review":"Does get really hot as most reviewers have noted.

I had no trouble assembling the heater, but when I lit it for the first time I couldn't get the flame adjusted to the level shown in the instructions. Even on the lowest setting the flame burned about two inches high. I let it burn outside for ten minutes, then allowed it to cool down. I brought it indoors and in the process dropped it on my hardwood floor because the poorly designed handle popped out of place.When I lit the heater my house quickly filled with smoke and fumes. The top of the heater is blackened. There is something about adjusting the height of the wick that isn't right, and it's not as simple as the directions describe. I read one review that suggested taking it apart and trimming the wick with scissors to correct this problem.I have another suggestion. Buy a different product. I'm going to. This thing is going back tomorrow morning. There are multiple quality control issues with this heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss leading BTUs","review":"While the 23,000BTUs sound wonderful in an uninsulated garage it is worthless.

Does that mean it has thicker metal or something else. I don't know but that was the first thing I noticed.It was very easy to assemble. The handle is better than the other unit becuse it does not pop out. After five minutes I had it fueld and later lit the unit. The unit started properly and heated my garage to 53 in about 4 hours. We live in Tahoe so it was about 32 in my garage when I started it.Of course there was a lot of odor from the new start but after a few hours it stopped smelling.So far it is working properly.

The handle did seem a little flimsy (as other reviewers have commented) but I thought it would have held up fine. The deal breaker for me was that is left a kerosene odor when it ran. The Sengoku 10,000 and the Mr. Heater give off no odor. Maybe the trade off is to be expected - quite a bit more heat but some odor.I returned this one and purchased another Sengoku 10,000."},{"rating":"1","title":"quick delivery, good box, very flimsy construction","review":"I have had kerosene heaters before - several times. This one was very flimsy despite careful assembly. The carrying handle, as others have noted is weak, flexable, and thin and ALSO will not stay installed. As others have also noted, I should go to a hardware store and get wire clips - hoping they know what I am talking about. The top sheet metal \\"hat\\" pops off and the base does not stay attatched well after sliding the main section sideways under the clips (epoxy perhaps?). I prefer to refuel outside (just a few feet) but this unit is made to be installed and never moved. I am surprised some federal agency has not gotten into this. I hope some clip and a few sheet metal screws can upgrade this unit. I wonder if $1.00 extra at the factory would cure these problems.

She liked it so much that I knew, when the time came, I would purchase it for my own son. It is small enough that it doesn't slide off his lap in the car when he is drawing or reading.

But it's awful. The tempi are far too slow and laboured. The whole effect is as if the orchestra and organ are desperately trying to find some middle ground. They never do. Fast passages on the organ are missing or \\"thrown away.\\" I tried to take this CD back to the store I bought it from, but they wouldn't accept returns. Why the E Power Biggs recording on Columbia is no longer available is a puzzlement; this was one of his best. Copyrights, perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Good quality, just as described, quickly shipped! No complaints. Would recommend to anyone interested in this book.

The number of exercises in the workout part of the DVD is very limited, and instruction is given too fast. The DVD keeps \\"Freeze Framing\\" during the workout.

Don't make the same mistake I did. I am going to try and return it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, but very informative","review":"I'm new to pilates and I wanted to find a dvd that breaks down the moves and that shows me how to do the moves correctly in order to get the full benefits. This dvd does that and give you very helpful information on each movement. This video is very slow, but it has plenty of info on the movements. It plays more like a documentary than a workout video. This dvd breaks downs each movement step by step. There is a woman and man on screen that shows you how to do each movement while the announcer (voice over) tells how to do the movements. Also has a great background, it takes place on what looks like a mountain side (very relaxing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad production","review":"I'm a newcomer to Pilates, and I admit that the parts of the DVD I viewed, I liked. Unfortunately, the DVD production quality is so bad that about 10 minutes into the mat workout (the really important part of the disc) the DVD hangs. No problem, I thought--I just ordered another one. Believe it or not, it had exactly the same problem in the same place.Both DVDs had small dappled spots on the surface in the same place, which I assume is what was causing the problem. There are several tracks that are completely unwatchable as a result.

Howell came to the research with some background, but more importantly with the ability to get these people to let him into their lives. He tells a compelling story. I have used the book for a Qualitative Methods class, and the students are impressed with both the writing and the characters. Anyone who wants to get a good look inside the lower middle class in this country should spend a little time on Clay Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Never Forget It","review":"This one is too good to be out of print. Hope someone will re-print it.\\"Clay Street\\" was written before the term \\"underclass\\" entered the popular vernacular, but the book is even more relevant now than it was in 1972 when it was first pulished. Howell followed the lives of two families of \\"hard living\\" whites who had migrated from the rural south to Washington DC. From a middle class point of view, their lives are horrifying, marked by an inability to plan, save, think about the future... Life is just one damn thing after another.

But that's because it is solid, heavy duty, smooth acting, and it comes with a number of mounting options. My old monitor arm cost half as much but it was too short and not as adjustable - I had been getting neckaches for years. The upgrade fixed my neck problem. I can place my monitor in any 3-D position floating above my desk - and it will stay there.You will need a sturdy desk to mount it on, with a big overhang on the back. Failing that, you can unbolt the clamp unit and drill a hole through the desk - for this they include a bolt and a backing plate and instructions on how to use them. The same method could be used to mount the arm on any solid surface.Everything is adjustable - including the tension on the spring pantogram mechanism, which you may need to adjust depending on the weight of your monitor. The adjustment tools are included in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The product works great! Used it with a 22\\" Samsung LCD.

Very clear in the instructions, but Amazon didn't say anything about it. I hung my 19\\" Viewsonic on it, and it drooped. Not the main body of the arm, the joint for tilting the monitor.

The book is also, unexpectedly fun and naughty. Personable and smart. And a quick read. Bravely anchored in the gritty stuff but hinged to the tranforming moment. Like folk song. Zen meditation.

I can't tell you if it's the phone or Windows Mobile 6, but regardless of which it is it makes the use of the phone frustrating and almost downright worthless.Because of all the problems I'm switching over to the Blackberry Curve.

I've had it for about 5 months now and I use it for phone calls, email, and web surfing. Every now and then it would freeze and would have to be rebooted. Sometimes it can be very slow. Sometimes service disappears and doesn't come back for some time -- while the phone remains in the same place where it was only a moment ago.

Bless the dead and if you buy the Dash, be prepared for a disfunctional relationshp that will come to a complete and utter end when you least expect it. You may try to reboot, but in the end all will fail. So stay clear of this device and read the reviews; find out what really works & make an informed purchase.

I'm sure the screen would break if you rammed the phone into the little pocket of your two-sizes too small jeans on your way to the hamburger stand. Yeah, that will cause the screen to crack. Or, you could hit up weightwatchers and actually use the included case with the phone and then you won't have to worry about a thing. It's good looking, it's got great call quality, it can be used as an mp3 player and all that jazz.

However, after 6 months my screen cracked while the phone was in my pocket and I was watching TV. No rough treatment and not dropped. The warranty doesn't cover cracked screens regardless of reason. A phone that you can't put in your pocket without risking a cracking the screen and having to pay $200 for repair is very poor in my opinion. Search for \\"T-Mobile Dash Cracked Screen\\" before you make your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great phone but far too fragile for everyday use","review":"I have had this T-Mobile Dash for about a year now and I am on my second one. I cracked the screen on the first one by putting it in my pocket without the case. I had to pay the whopping $110 that the insurance company uses as a deductible. What a rip off. That is probably what they pay for the phone wholesale. I then had the next phone for about four months before the same thing happened. I am not sure how it cracked this time, but it did. In my opinion, they shouldn't create a phone that cant handle a bit of pressure on its screen before cracking. I am very seriously thinking about dumping this phone because I can't afford to spend $110 every few months or so to have this phone.

The alarm goes off even if you turn it off, and if you change the time for it to go off it will go off at your previous time AND your new one, making for a rude wake up call on the weekend mornings. No ring tone choices, the keys are so small it is easy to mispell words counfusing the people you send messages to. Also, the phone will take FOREVER to load up when you turn it on, you will absolutly dread having to turn it off. Also, the phone sends your messges to the wrong person often, this causes many relationship problems!

They trailed off and were thoroughly disinterested by midway through. There is no story here for kids, per se. It is a disjointed mish-mash of what I can only perceive as nostalgia by the author which I find is lost on children. My children did not get the \\"fep fep fep\\" whispers about the sounds of snow falling (\\"Snow doesn't sound like that, daddy!\\") as well as many other images presented within.

Therefore, I am putting the word out to NOT BUY BOOKS FROM INTERNATIONAL BOOKSELLERS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful....","review":"After taking the NET I found this book helped me with the math portion but not with the reading portion. The reading portion of the actual exam was much harder than in the book. If you need to brush up on your math skills, this book is excellent for that. But make sure you prepare for the reading on your own. (Inferences, predicting outcomes, etc.) The guide book is very expensive for the size, but if it helps you it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it for the NET","review":"I was annoyed buying this small study guide (2nd edition) at my college book store for $36 but it was worth it. The author of the study guide also writes the actual NET exam so all the practice tests are modeled after the real test. Although I did use other books to practice/review math concepts I think this study guide is the best thing to help you prepare for the actual entrance exam. The guide is not very big only 168 pages but it will give very good insight to how you will perform and your areas of weakness. For example the practice math exams are set up: basic math 12 questions, decimals 8 questions, fractions 8 questions,percents 8 questions,conversions 16 questions, and algebra expressions 8 questions. The real exam had the EXACT same lay out and EXACT same number/type of questions per section as the study guide practice exams! This study guide also covered reading comprehension and some basic test taking strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good prep, especially if you time yourself","review":"I found this book to be a good preparation for the NET, although my test didn't have any grammar questions at all on it. When you do the 2 practice exams, SET A TIMER. If there are 30 questions, set a timer for 30 minutes. That is how the exam works, and you need to practice under real-world conditions. There weren't any surprises at all on the NET, but be warned that the reading comprehension questions are as tricky as everyone says they are. You can also take an 85-minute practice exam on their website, [...], which I found very helpful. Again, there were grammar questions on it, but my NET didn't have any grammar questions. But the practice exam, which costs $[...], is worth it for the math and reading portions. To sum up: buy the book, read it, do the practice exams (timed), and take the online practice exam if possible. Even if you only use the book, there won't be any surprises on the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"The book was horrible it had no science and the math was ok.

I would not recommend or every buy again for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was looking for a book to teach me about steaming and to get suggestions on how and what to steam but sadly this is not what I was looking for. This is a really small older book with European measurements. Looked it over and than it went right into the donation bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming can also mean mad. Disappointed is more accurate!","review":"I received this book today. Ordered it because I have a steamer, and thought I might find some good recipes. I am greatly disappointed. I did not see that the book is written by, and primarily for the British. I would have to google many ingredients that are used in recipes to even know what they are. I think petit pois means small green peas?Whatever a courgette is, the recipe says to cut 16 thin slices from it. Aubergine is used in a recipe for stuffed peppers. One recipe calls for 4 back bacon rashers. Shredded suet is called for in more than one recipe. What is tagliatelle; caster sugar? This book seems like something I might have picked up at an old book store, certainly not on a modern day magazine rack here in the U.S.! I think shoppers should have been given a better description of the book. I hope I can find a few usable recipes. A lot of trouble to return things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to handle, delivered with a deep cut into the book starting at cover, better for the UK - ingredients na. in US","review":"This book is really not for use in the US, many foods not available in the US or suited to tastes of Americans.Product ad. did not say it was for a stove top steamer, needs conversion to the electric stamers most often used in the US. Since the book arrived damaged it is hard to open and generally stiff. I am not pleased with my purchase.Celia Snyder, USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're someone who likes journeys that don't go anywhere interesting, this should be right up your alley.","review":"If you're the kind of person who likes reading Umberto Eco and watching French films, you might like this. Otherwise, happy slogging. Trying to read & enjoy this book is like trying to play chess blindfolded without anyone telling you the rules - some people can do it, but whether you're one of them is another matter entirely.The first story, Dark Piper, isn't too bad. The second story, Dread Companion, can be read entirely separately from the first, which is actually not a point in its favour. It would be a much better story if its middle 80% was chopped out and the story continued from where it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real fantasy classic","review":"I was skeptical when I read the glowing reviews of this book -- after all, comparisons with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith are easily made, but seldom realized. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Brian McNaughton is indeed worthy to enter the pantheon of the great dark fantasists. This book concerns ghouls, and if you have a distaste for the undead and the things they dine upon, I suggest you look elsewhere for your reading enjoyment. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a worthy successor to the mantle of the late Clark Ashton Smith, you need look no further. Earthier than Smith was permitted to be in his day, these stories still have the same ability to transport the reader worlds away to exotic cities, vast necropili, and other locales near and dear to the dark fantasy-lover's heart. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic in weird tales","review":"I am entranced by this book. I just finished reading it for the first time and loved the characters and situations they find themselves in. I am now starting it again trying to document McNaughton's world and the inter-relationships of the characters, gods and places. I highly recommend this book. I am giving copies as presents to people I know that I feel will appreciate the style and stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghouls Night Out","review":"I am a newcomer to McNaughton's work. But evidently he has been producing high quality weird fantasy for quite a while, as evidenced by several ecstatic reviews by some of his longtime admirers. BTW, many of these reviews are superbly written and deserve to be read for their own merits.I hadn't read any of these before I took the plunge based on the book description alone. I got my mind seriously blown by this book. How to describe it?It is seriously dark and gory, yet it exhibits moments of macabre humor and irony. At times I had to pause and wonder did I really laugh at that sick scene.Reminscent of pre- Cthulhu Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith's fantastic settings, this book is virtually indescribable. Ghouls (often minor characters in HPL&CAS;) take center stage here. One of the strangest books I've ever read, and that's a lotta strange books.If you want some midnight shivers, you'll find them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mixture of fantasy, horror and dark humor","review":"Thrones of Bones takes the Lovercraftian ghouls and give them a depth of character that I thought impossible. McNaughton has a amazing talent for the strange and the macabre. Tales where explicit violence and sex, terror and revulsion, are masterly mixed with dark wonder and an intelligent and sarcastic humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This chick has some demons...","review":"After being pushed back for what seemed like an ETERNITY, Otep's \\"The Ascension\\" is finally unleashed. Its pretty much good old fasion Otep. Pounding drums, intriquet basslines by the very talented Evil J, heavy, fast riffs and of course, the tortured, frantic shrieks and screams that we all know and love. And whats this? A mainstream sounding slow song for Otep? PIANO? Thats right folks. Check out \\"Perfectly Flawed\\". Very disturbing lyrics about self mutilation and loathing translated into a suprisingly beautiful song...especially for this band. Lyrically as well, as usual, this album is gold. I gave it 4 out of 5 because although being a big step up from \\"House of Secrets\\", it still lacked the overall...raw emotion (?) that made \\"Sevas Tra\\" a favorite to me. Either way you look at it, this album is indeed amazing. Check it out.ART SAVES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This album by Otep is simply genius.

Every song hooks you in. The stand out tracks for me are \\"Ghostflowers,\\" \\"Milk of Regret,\\" and \\"Eet the Children.\\" I had \\"Sevas Tra\\" and hadn't listened to it in some time, but when this came out Otep was my new favorite band! This is by far the best Otep album. The musicianship is just insane. Listen to Ghostflowers and here Evil Jay on the bass. And as for the drums Brian Wolff rips it up. He is by far the best drummer Otep as had. And then there is Otep Shamaya, she uses her awesome voice as an instrument. She is better than most male metal vocalists! Buy The Ascension, you will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Otep. When are you going to get help with your problems?","review":"What a waste of money. I was told about this band that was fronted by some \\"chick\\" and was told that she was hardcore. That should of been my warning. Sure enough my fears were correct. Crappy predictable guitars, girly girl topics with a message and vocals that are processed with all sorts of effects because she cant scream by herself. I suppose I am being harsh but I just dont understand what people see in this junk. What angers me more then anything is that she routinely rips off her \\"corpse paint\\" from Mayhems Maniac. Check out the similarities.Any one who likes quality metal skip this. Get some Origin, Hate Eternal or Immolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll put it real simple.....

I was out of shape but didn't have much spare time or energy to jump back into ballet full swing. Madeline Lewis has three kids so she understands how time is of the essence. The power stretch routine is perfect for during nap time. I enjoyed it so much I moved onto doing the AM stretch for a few minutes longer 3x a week. After two weeks, I feel so much more limber and my posture has improved dramatically.

If you do both the am and pm segments you'll begin to see some overlap and where they cross each other into night or day time. Both my wife and I appreciate Ms Lewis' stretching tips, cautionary notes, and balance of stretches. I guess what I'd like to see from her, is a dvd with more extended stretches, and another with more stretches like her bonus stretch on this dvd, which is closer to being an exercise/stretch blend, which is kinda nice. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this DVD to everyone","review":"Since I was 10 years old, I've had problems with chronic headaches. I've seen many neurologists and had spent 20 years looking for relief before I bought this DVD. As soon as I started the AM & PM Stretch, I realized that I have serious muscle tension issues in my neck and back. Now, as long as I do these stretches once or twice a week, I never get headaches. These stretches make me feel great.The PM Stretch is the ultimate stress reliever. After the AM Stretch, I am ready to take on the world. I started doing these stretches 2 years ago and I still do them at least once a week.The events that lead me to buying this DVD: I fell off of a cliff while playing paintball. I dislocated my shoulder. Months later I started having severe pains in my upper back. I saw a chiropractor who recommended I try some stretches. I bought this DVD. No more upper back pain. No more headaches. I feel great!Do yourself a favor and try these stretches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware! Not really stretching","review":"I really wanted to like this, but felt really misled by the title and packaging. I was looking for a thorough stretching routine I could do after exercising or to work out those morning kinks and stiffness. This isn't it. It's really a pilates/yoga DVD, and as such would get 4-5 stars. But I didn't want pilates or yoga--I don't like pilates, and I've got plenty of yoga DVDs. I give it 1 star as a stretching DVD. Stretches aren't held long, there's a lot of bouncing, the upper body is largely neglected, and I didn't get that nice \\"stretched out\\" feeling I was looking for.It's fine for what it is--the scenery is pretty and the music is benign. The instructor doesn't seem to know her right from her left, which since all the narration was voice-over, was distracting, but it doesn't matter all that much as far as doing the routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my AM/PM Stretch!","review":"This video is so peaceful, I really like doing these stretches. First of all, there is no yoga, or weird spiritual stuff in it, which I didn't want! Whew! Secondly, the music is so peaceful, the backgrounds are lovely and make you want to be there. And finally, the hostess is fun and peaceful herself, and the voiceover is great. I recommend!Oh, and the stretches are sooooo relaxing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the PM Stretch!","review":"This stretching video kept me sane in graduate school.

I've got nerve damnage in my neck and shoulder and I was looking for something to loosen me up in the morning. Wow, this is so effective. I have improved my flexibility but I've also had fun. Its very relaxing. The routines are about 25 minutes long and calming. The music is great and fits with the theme for the work out. I highly recommend this. There is alot of stretching but also some yoga poses through out the routines too. Over all its just a great DVD. Well worth the money and time. Good job Gaiam, and Madeleine Lewis! I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I do the AM stretch before and after my Leslie Sansone tapes as she does not give a very long warm up.I find the PM stretch so boring I almost fell asleep doing it-I stick with the AM. I had to agree with another user that i found it funny she mixed up her right and left, but I didn't even notice until I had done the tape about 10 times. I do wish she'd hold the positions a little longer and I'd like to see more leg stetches.Overall, I love the way I feel after doing the video.Ang"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stretching dvd","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD for several years now. One person gave it a 2 star and said it wasn't stretching, but I have to disagree. In my opinion, it's much more stretching than Yoga or Pilates, of which I also have several DVDs. The instructor is easy to follow and the scenery is very relaxing. I use this after the 2-3 minutes stretch segments most workout DVDs come with these days. I find most workout DVDs don't offer enough stretching and this is a great compliment. I also like the fact there are 3 routines in this one DVD (assuming you get the bonus segment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stretching","review":"I enjoyed this video; however some of the stretches were a little hard for me.

I am so glad we went with this instead!! It is crafted so beautifully, and the details are exquisite. The furniture is heavy duty, and the Barbie and Bratz dolls fit it perfectly, which I was a little leery of because the pictures make the house appear to be a smaller scale than Barbies or Bratz, but they fit perfectly.

If this was intended as an 'homage' to Sayers' novels, I hope Dorothy L. rises up from the grave and tells Roberts to make up his own characters and pay better attention in writing class.If anyone wants to read something more like real Sayers, try the ones co-authored and written from scratch by Jill Paton Walsh - Thrones, Dominations; A Presumption of Death; and The Attenbury Emeralds."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"It was an important cd that I needed because of a song that was to be used in a slideshow.

What greatly irked me is that the author attempted to describe Kant's use of the term 'intuition' (which for the American reader is being used as a misnomer) as \\"phenomenological.\\" Now, the school of phenomenology was founded by Husserl, in the 20th century, and developed from his readings of Kant. How the hell is the reader supposed to know what phenomenology is, and how is that word supposed to clarify a Kantian neologism, if its very existence dates AFTER the book the reader is a virgin to?Unfortunately like many philosophy text, this one is pedantic, and ostentatious.

Man-Made is a quality effort that is more subversive than any of their previous efforts- the wonderful harmonies are still there, but there is an underlying maturity throughout the record that sets it apart as a new direction for a band that was in danger of becoming stale.The increased songwriting participation of guitarist Ray McGinley is probably the major factor in this. His songs have always been the most layered of all the band's catalogue, and on this record he really shines.Having seen them live recently, I must say that they are still one of the best indie bands going around, and while they are not part of the british angular rock revival movement, you can bet that all of the hot bands right now owe a massive debt to this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fanclub Album in Years","review":"This album is so strong all the way though. This time the best songs are written by Gerry (Time Stops, Fallen Leaves) and Raymond (Nowhere, Only With You, Feel and Don't Hide).

When \\"Songs from Northern Britian\\" was released, I was surprised by how the band had matured and became less hyper-frenetic, but at least that album had some soul behind the performance. If you're new to TFC, I'd suggest \\"Northern Britian\\" or any of their Geffen albums over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great disc, so all of you idiots shut you dirty rotten traps!!!!,","review":"This is great.

Ocean Gypsy is a very pretty song, that takes some criticism from non-Renaissance fans. The song doesn't deserve that criticism. It simply rules. Side two is occupied by a 25-minute epic called Songs of Scheherazade, which I used to be bored with, but time has altered my opinion on it. It isn't as great as side one, and it isn't among my favorite sidelong tracks, but I really have grown to enjoy the song. Sure, it has some boredom, but what 25-minute song doesn't? It could have been a little better, but it wouldn't have been easy.

This movie was trite, boring, poorly written, poorly directed and even the actors seemed lost sometimes. The only reason to recommend this movie is that David Boreanaz is unbelievably hot in it, and I'm referring specifically to the dancing scene. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who's not a diehard DB fan and even then, it's only good for a DB fix after you've seen every episode of Buffy, Angel and Bones multiple times.

Anyhow, this film had some redeeming moments. This film is a very high-end Lifetime movie. As another reviewer stated - watch this movie only if you are a David B. fan.

Morbidly curious, I stood there and read it. While it's true that every life is different, and children experience many forms of family situation, it was still sickening to read about how the character's mother told her that Daddy left because \\"he didn't want a family anymore\\"; or that the father, absent from his daughters' lives for less than 5 years, didn't recognize them at all. This book sends the message to kids that if divorced parents remarry, only the \\"new\\" family is loved. I'm very sorry for those people for whom this may be true, but there are many, many stepfamilies out there who DO incorporate, welcome, and include children from previous and current marriages. I shudder to think of stepchildren who will read this book, and remember its lessons when a new baby is born."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK????????","review":"With the amount of animosity, hurt, regret and anger that is involved in a divorce situation I find it hard to believe that someone published this book. The hurt that any five year old would feel at her father's stupidity is bad enough, but to write a book about it? This is PAS at its best.Yes, the father should be ashamed of himself (I am going to assume this was based on a true story), but so should whoever told her daughter that her father didn't want her anymore. In the real experiences of many fathers it is the mother who refuses to ALLOW the father to have a relationship with his children - not the other way around.In divorce there is enough blame to go around, the object of our society should be to protect the children from the ugliness portrayed by adults, not add to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Nothing good to say about this... overproduced and does not capture spirit of the movie.

For those of you who are not from Appalachia, you should really see the movie to understand the soul of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Soundtrack Where Art Thou?","review":"Like many other reviewers, I loved the music from the movie and thought this was the soundtrack. Instead main stream voices (Dolly Parton, Emmylou, Roseanne Cash..) and cookie cutter music were used to destroy everthing that I liked about the songs from the movie. This CD is probably not so bad if you haven't seen the movie. If you have it's a terrible letdown except for the few songs that remained intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songcatcher","review":"After viewing the movie, \\"The Songcatcher,\\" I knew I must have the soundtrack and immediately went to Amazon to order. I have not been disappointed. This CD really moved me the first time I heard it and has subsequently been a real joy. The poignancy and drama of each recording is splendid.

But the reviews I read were correct -- the CD is not so good. I rated it two stars, for the two songs on the entire CD that I enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent on its own","review":"This is an excellent collection of modern folk/bluegrass that should stand on its own. Yes, the movie was pedantic (and I'm a sucker for feminist stories), yes, bluegrass was almost exclusively sung by males in the first part of the century and yes these aren't the voices you hear in the movie. It's still filled with great reditions of great songs and makes me grateful that I live in a time when these great women singers get heard. I would have like to hear a few male voices thrown in, but that's a minor quibble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the real songs?","review":"While this soundtrack is a likable record with wonderful performances, I can't say that I would recommend it. I loved the songs and the singing in the movie, but those pieces are not to be found (or at least rarely found) on this soundtrack. \\"Oh Death\\", \\"Barbara Allen\\" (a snippet), and a piece sung by Iris DeMent are the only songs from the movie. All the other songs are highly produced, slick versions by wonderful, but all too modern artists. Give me Hazel Dickens or more from Iris and I'd send everyone out to get it. And, please, can anyone tell me why the two pieces from the score are included here. David Mansfield is a gifted musician and composer, but these pieces fall on the ear like lead and disrupt the flow of the album. The producers dropped the ball on this one. One quick glimpse at Songcatcher 2 tells me that it is already a better bet than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know what all the conflict is all about......Songs are pretty much the same as the movie...","review":"I love this CD. I think the conflict for people is that this soundtrack CD does not have a \\"score\\". If you are one of those people that loves to listen to the classical side of soundtracks, following each and every undulation of music and change of scene then this is not for you. That being said, if you liked the main songs sung in the film like Pretty Saro, Barbara Allen, Single Girl they are on this CD with the actors from the movie singing them.I personally bought the CD because I couldn't give a crap about a score, I wanted to listen and learn the songs from the film. Sure some extra \\"stars\\" were added to the soundtrack to beef it up, but the soundtrack still captures the essence of the movie.For me, the soundtrack does not wander too far off the beaten path and I'm happy I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have paid more attention to the fine print.

I asked my children for the soundtrack for Christmas and was thrilled when I opened it. BUT I was disappointed when I played it. The music isn't the original music from the movie, it has been changed tramendously! It sounds like it has been mixed in a studio. Some of the songs were never even in the movie and over half the songs from the movie were left out, then to take up space the scores were added as suite 1 & 2. This is hardly what I would have expected from the sound track of such a great movie with such wonderful mountain ballads of my ancestors. Luckily I live less than an hour from Asheville and can drive to the Southern Highland Craft Guild, for some decent mountian music, which this one lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Fine Print","review":"I saw the movie \\"Soncatcher\\". The story about music of the southern states as sung and played in remote hillbilly mountain country circa 1900. In the film, the tunes unfold with sponteneity, most without instrumental background, focusing on the purity of the human voice for expression. This album contains a few songs from the film and a couple full orchestra overture cuts. The majority on the album are sung by country pros who use studio orchestras for all they are worth. It is a mockery of the film and I felt these stars were trying to capitalize on the bandwagon of accollades that will follow this great film. A finely printed sentence below the title \\"Songcatcher\\" says \\"music from and inspired by the motion picture...\\". Too bad for the movie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really a Soundtrack to the Movie","review":"This soundtrack was a BIG disappointment. I thought the music in the movie was amazing and captured the spirit and life of the people of the Appalachian Mountains.But this drivel is more 'inspired' by the movie than 'from' the movie. Country stars riding the coattails of some beautiful, raw music. The best song from the movie (when the couple sings and plays violin on the porch after selling their farm) isn't even on the album.I'm going to try and return this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like elevator music","review":"This was a rip off. I should have read the fine print...songs \\"inspired\\" by the movie. One song by Iris Dement was left intact. The other reason I bought it..to hear the wonderful Emmie Rossum..singing Barbara Anne..they cut her off after only 30seconds.I loved the songs from the movie..but those arent the ones on this CD. These are easy listening studio songs. ECHHHH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very authentic, but a couple of good songs","review":"This is an okay album if you are just looking for some listenable music, but in general the songs are overdone and not authentic-sounding (as in, they don't sound like mountain music but like something produced in some fancy studio). The exception is Iris DeMent's \\"Pretty Saro,\\" which is an absolute gem and perhaps makes the album worth buying for just this one song!!! There are some good songs on here, but if you are looking for real Appalachian tunes, you'll not find much of that. Of course, many of the singers have fantastic voices, so that's one plus. There are a lot of really good authentic albums out there, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Courage","review":"After seeing the movie, I contacted a friend who had performed research for the producer and who lives in the area where the movie was filmed. He immediately warned me off buying the sound track, which other reviewers have pointed out is not actually the movie's sound track.Seems that the movie used a good bit of local, authentic singers -- some of whom appear in the film's background. When it came time to produce the soundtrack, the makers simply did not have the courage to deliver the little known voices who provided the songs for the track. They went with more commercial and more known singers.If you liked the film's songs, the result is a disaster. You may, however, enjoy the CD on its own merits. I'm staying away."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE","review":"I purchased the CD because I really liked the music in the movie. I was disappointed that only 4 of the songs on the recording reflected the music I heard in the movie. Most of the music in the film was acappella, while most on the CD was not. I expected the music on the CD to reflect the music in the movie in both style and content. It failed to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"not vista compatable","review":"I had a very dissapointed toddler and have had to go through Disney support to exchange for another game (they're quite amiable with this exchange), alot of trouble for us though, so caution when trying to run Disney games with windows vista"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK!!!","review":"This software WILL NOT work with:Windows VistaWindows 7Mac OSX 10.5Mac OSX 10.6Our four year old received this for a gift.

I have heard her in person, and have listened to other albums of hers, and she is AMAZING.Sadly, EMI has chosen to implement copy protection technology on this album which prevents me from playing it in my car, or on my PC using my MusicMatch Jukebox player. This is in direct violation of the \\"fair use\\" act established by the Federal Government that protects the right of individuals to make a backup copy of their media, and it also violates common sense when it makes it impossible to play the CD on the only two players available to me. Thanks EMI - brilliant decision. At this point, I'll be purchasing no more music on the EMI label, no matter how much I admire the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"She has a great voice and good songs.

Something about the maniacal laughter and moans of the insane is more unsettling than any ghost. Room 47 is my favorite track. It does a good job of blending the sinister, cruel atmosphere of the asylum with the sadness of the patients, with the perfect dose of supernatural foreboding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Footsteps, knocks & giggles","review":"If you want to listen to something really unsettling, try Brian Eno's \\"On Land\\". It's the creepiest thing I've ever heard - and it doesn't rely on footsteps, knocks and giggles like \\"Gates of Delirium\\" does. Sure, the music here (when it's not overblown) has its moments, but it's really just a cross between a horror movie soundtrack and a Hallowe'en special effects CD. The track \\"Haverghast Asylum\\" reminds me of an outtake from Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\". That might have been the intention, of course, but it adds up to a CONSCIOUSLY spooky listen, not a SUBCONSCIOUSLY eerie listen like the aforementioned album by Eno.If you're looking for background music to a game of Vampire: The Masquerade, I suppose \\"Gates of Delirium\\" will do the trick - but if you want to feel the goosebumps rise, put on a pair of headphones, turn out the lights, and listen to \\"On Land\\". Alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good artist that play boring music","review":"I purchased this cd on an impulse. Mainly because the reviews were great and the art work on the cd is awesome. However, listening to the cd gives me a sense of bordom. The songs are too slow and repetative for my taste. I gave it two stars because there are hints of good music in the cd. Be aware that if you're going to buy any of Midnight Syndicate's albums like I did (in fact I bought the last three albums all at once), thinking you're going to get some kind of hint of heavy metal and industrial into the music you'll be disapointed like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it before. More annoying then entertaining.","review":"The bombastic sweeping music is still in the same style I've heard from this group's other albums. I did not find anything particular new on this cd. What really sunk this for me was the constant 'insane laughter' that punctuated the album, bringing back old stereotypes that we can do without. Now every once in a while a sound effect was well placed and some were shivering, but once you heard it, you heard it. This is not of the their better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice-looking, could be colder","review":"We purchased this to replace an ugly, broken trash compacter in a kitchen where we were upgrading the other appliances. It fits perfectly in the space left by the compacter (with a little wood trim around the edges for a finished look) and looks very clean and classy. In terms of a cosmetic upgrade, this is a great choice, but it's single temperature setting (meant for both red and white) leaves a little to be desired. The white wine often needs a little bit of time in the fridge before drinking, while the red should sit out for a few minutes to warm up.

Yes people do use foul language but it seems as if Dorothy Garlock just discovered these words and sex and had to use it as often and rotten as possible to show she is all grown up. The two bad characters were not well written about at all. They were so in your face and outlandish, it was not at all realistic.

While there is a bit of that information, the bulk of the information in the book is how to be a good OB patient. With line drawings of episiotomies, forceps deliveries, and a few dismissive paragraphs on home birthing and other birthing alternatives, Drs. Westheimer and Grunebaum strive to keep women in the dark about the culmination of the sexual act: the birth itself.

What does make this book charming is that one can imagine walking with Mr. Curley, hearing him recite the literary passages presented here and seeing the sites discussed; indeed, one need not depend solely on imagination since there are a generous number of (black-and-white) photographs included. A very good map of the area is included.But the book fails as either a ramble or a tour guide. If it is a ramble, let there be more narrative; if it is a guidebook, then let there be more information.Taking the walk with Mr. Curley is undoubtedly a wonderful experience. Unfortunately this book does not capture that experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and poor black and white photography","review":"This book is an interesting ramble in and around Hamstead heath.

Scott Fitzgerald is unique among the great American writers in that his most famous works examine the lives of the wealthy elite. This book looks at the Hollywood set of the 1930's, when sound was becoming an integral part of movies, but color was still beyond the horizon. The movie business is big enough and profitable to be respectable and even appealing in the public eye, but also enough to spawn rivalries and politicking among and within the major studios. It is this seamy, backstabbing side of Hollywood examined here. Again, many of the characters have major flaws that make the reader go \\"what is he thinking\\". Alcohol, jealousy, and envy drive this book, making it quit similar to the other works by Fitzgerald. I did not enjoy this book, and found it quite boring. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A number of catchy songs not long progressive works","review":"No one was putting out long rock jams in the early 1980's and progressive bands like Renaissance were no exception. Southern rockers like the Allman Brothers and jam bands like the Dead were no exception. Record companies at the time must have viewed the longer pieces as dated. Yes was able to adapt to this chnaging landscape with 90125 and this is Renaissance's work in that mode.It's the second album with just the core trio and it is step up from Camera Camera, which is their least appealing work. It's still Annie doing most of the singing and she could sing anything and make it sound good. This is really an enjoybale record if you go in with the mindset that there are no \\"Ashes Are Burning\\" or \\"Mother Russia\\" type pieces. I will say John Tout on keyboards is missed but I think the band came out of the studio having done what they set out to do (or possibly were told to do.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Pop songs showing that the group did not know what direction to take. With the loss of Terence Sullivan and John Tout, from Camera Camera 2 years before, the songs presented lacks the creativity of yore, and I, as a big fan of the band, I was disappointed with this release. I bought it just to complete the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"Commercial and overproduced, Renaissance's last album is not their best moment. It seemed to bear little resemblance to the neoclassical group that did \\"Scheherazade\\" and \\"Ashes are Burning.\\" The sound is very 80's, digital, and dated, and the songs sound like leftovers from the Motels or any of the subpar synthpop bands of the decade. Annie Haslam's voice is the only thing of note here, and it's wasted on these dreadful songs. You would be better advised to buy any of their first four albums to hear them at their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Slow","review":"The Slow Air of Ewan Macpherson might've been a better book if the author had an ear for dialog...but he does not. The characters in this book talk to each other in the most oblique manner I have probably ever encountered in a work of fiction. I imagined them never quite meeting each other's eyes, talking to spots several feet to the left or above other people's heads, etc. The very bizarre and unnatural dialog in this book made the story less than enjoyable to follow.The story itself, once a reader is able to winnow it out of the ponderous, undirected dialog, is interesting...but not quite interesting enough to overcome the dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible service, poor product","review":"It not only smells bad (I could live with that), and it is loud - you do not want it in your kitchen or anyplace near where you hang out, it emits a loud buzzing noise - last but most important their customer service is terrible.

However the vise fits drill presses that are larger than the Grizzly G7942 with which the \\"Shop Fox\\" is sold. When partnered with the G7942 Baby Drill Press there is simply not enough room under the drill head to fit the vise in a useful configuration.

The two components are a poor match at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay for what you get","review":"At first glance out of the box, I thought this would be a good buy. Mounted it to the drill press and quickly realized that it wasn't cutting straight.

I started in the middle of the piece and moved it away from me; from start to finish of the entire motion it was about an 1/8\\" difference.I expected some slop in the tool upon arrival (which there is but its manageable).

I enjoyed the book very much, finding Part 2 to be even more dramatic and thought provoking than the beginning. I found the other reviews to be fantastic for content. I would, though, recommend putting Soylent Green out of your mind and take the book as its own entity, which it is.The Kindle edition has many typos. I'm used to finding one or two typos in a book, but this edition is simply full of them. Multiple typos per chapter. Of course, the human brain seems to ignore it and you can easily tell what the word is supposed to be... but that isn't much the point. I previously had difficulty finding this book in print (because I'm snobby and want my books to be new instead of used most of the time) so it was a great way to actually get to read the text. It would be nice if they did an updated version, with less errors. They do get annoying after you've seen 20 or so of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing wrong with the story . . . .","review":"My less than stellar review is based on the ridiculous number of spelling and other editing errors. I don't know it is exclusively in the Kindle edition, but there was even a passage that made no sense, and then that same phrase showed up a paragraph later where it was supposed to be.

Make Room!\\" is hopelessly outdated. Overpopulation is no longer a threat for America, in fact, throughout most of the Western world, depopulation is much more of a problem. This book not only failed to retain its relevance into the 21st century, but it is also a poorly written book. The motivations of the characters are never explained, and their personalities are never explored. Shirl, a major character in the book, is only described as beautiful. Descriptions of her past relationships with her father and her suitors are left out.

There are a number of things that make this a hard sell. One problem with these novels is how long they are verses the writing style in the books. With five books you have a lot of paper to develop character depth and the author tries, but if you have read any of tom Clancy books involving Jack Ryan then you will be disappointed with the result, especially at (...) Canadian per book. The second problem is the Chinese capabilities in the time line the author has set the events are hard to believe, especially the logistic abilities.

It is mostly stunning, but towards the end it goes downhill just a little bit.I would certainly recommend this album to anyone looking for interesting new music, but also direct you towards Kang's other work: 7 NADEs, The Story Of Iceland, Dying Ground, Bill Frisell \\"Quartet\\", etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Keychain Knife","review":"I love Victorinox knives! They are useful, inexpensive, and absolutely refuse to die! I bought this little rally to put on my keychain with my car keys. It's great having an itty bitty tool on hand for those really small jobs that I always seem to run into. From tightening screws on my glasses, to opening a bottle of sparkling cider, to pulling slivers from my hand, to small cutting jobs, this knife is great. My only gripe is that the keychain loop is on the wrong side. It would be better for me if the keychain attachment was on the opposite side of the small blade, but it isn't terribly inconvenient for me. If you have a ton of keys and a really big keychain, it might be an issue. But I can put my keys in my palm or remove the knife completely if need be. Still, that doesn't affect the outstanding quality of this knife, so on that note, I give it 5 stars for being a fantastic knife that you can buy for about $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"Smaller than I expected but makes it easier to carry.

The one gripe I have is that it focuses more on women who are already halfway to rich, working in high paying professions. However it did give me a few ideas for simple steps I can take to get better control over my finances. It also gives you the proper perspective when looking at your money -- she basically says it's your money and you shouldn't have to feel obligated as a woman to give it away to everyone who wants a piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not where you are, it's how to get where you want to be","review":"I was given the book by a friend, and started reading it just because I like reading. As I read, it was a good eye opener for great aspirations. It is not so much about where you are, but if you want to go far, you have to learn to manage what you have currently. It coaches on how to manage your money currently, work at getting better, and hopefully, some day be rich moneywise. There is an activity that analyzes how well you are on your way to getting rich, and I highly agree with that. There are areas that I do not agree with (Money has to be among the top 3 priorities in life) among others, but overall, great book. Her approach is very applicable in life too.I would recommend it to \\"the nice girls\\" out there. Those who find it hard to say 'No\\" and especially to friends, those who think they have to match up a gift,... among others.

I also didn't think the financial advice was nearly as interesting or helpful as books written by finance professionals; the author is a therapist by training.

I liked the story, I liked the charaters, but then the whole book seemed to change gears. It went from a nice little story to torid love scenes. I didn't feel that there was enough transition from flirty to bodice ripping, and it jarred me. The ending was, for me, a little to neat. The villians were a little to unknown.

The clip is very secure, almost to the point of being difficult to un-clip sometimes (I use this to attach a fob to my car keys that is used open the garage and front door to my condo building). The latch doesn't open super far, which makes removing it from a key chain a bit of a task. However, this is exactly why I bought this clip - so that my fob would stay securely attached to the key chain. I'll gladly sacrifice the extra 2-3 seconds it takes to get the fob off for the security.One other note: I bought the black version and the paint seems to chip off semi-easily.

I use these anytime my face is sweaty or dirty throughout the day, like after exercise or just a hot day in the sun. It tides me over well until I can actually wash my face. I also use them at night, after washing my face, to help clear out excess oil and dirt the gentle cleanser may have missed. These can be a bit drying though, so I've cut down on my use of the pads during my night routine since winter started. I use these every other night or less. Doesn't seem to make a difference if I use them during the day or not, as far as skin-drying goes.I'm a big fan of Neutrogena products, and these pads are definitely world's ahead of the other two acne-care face pads I've used before.

It is a lean and mean certification guide, just the meat, no bells and whistles.

In a book of 273 pages the one and only murder is committed on page 181 and it is not even clear (and even not important) why it's done. Moreover one of the heroes comes three times near death because there were some spells in the play he was rehearsing. The reader waiting for a logical explanation will wait in vainly. The author of the play changes the spells and that's it. Therefore we are left with a hugely sympathetic cast of by now familiar characters, very witty dialogue and a story that concentrates almost completely on the adventures of actors in a visit outside London where they are not very welcome.

If you add the instrumental \\"Prologue\\" from the debut lineup for this band (there was one earlier album by the group with a different lineup), and salt in most of \\"Scheherazade,\\" you have this album. I've always been somewhat lukewarm on the \\"Scheherazade\\" album, & feel that this live version is a better presentation of that material.

Unfortunately, our old VHS tape, complete with commercials is worn out and we wanted a DVD version. I purchased this last year and was tremendously disappointed to see that some of our ABSOLUTE FAVORITE quirky moments of the show were completely cut out and were not even in the extra features.

The editing is SO bad, you can actually TELL where things were removed. Such a shame. Here's hoping the matter can be settled, and a fully-restored version offered...though I wouldn't hold my breath.

And we even see a video of a Christmas past when the Muppets were babies. On top of it all Jim Henson, the creator of them all, apperars briefly. It is a Christmas musical which I absoutly LOVE.

I bought this movie so excited that I didnt have to search the Christmas special tape for this one movie! Well,when I watched it I started to sing along with some of my favorite songs, and surpirse suprise!!! I was the only one siging because they had left alot of the songs out!! It was made even worse when you could actually tell where the cuts were made even if youve never seen it before! I was so disappointed!!!

No singing snowman plus no Miss Piggy slipping on the Icy Spot equals no wasting my money on this unfortunate watered down version. And I was so excited...UPDATE: Further warning... I was freaked to find a friend with the earlier 90's VHS release (red box). He let me borrow it, but I was irked (to put it nicely) that it's the same hacked-to-bits shell of this should-be classic.

How could they have taken out Fozzy with the snowman??? I understand that there are legal issues the company has, but I know most people would have been happy to pay a little more to get this special in its entirety.

This tape isn't in the gratest condition anymore, so a couple years ago we purchased the VHS version and were very disappointed. Many people mentioned the missing scenes, but I didn't see anyone mention that because of this, a key part of the story line is missing. In the edited version, you don't have any idea why Fozzie is excited about his new act. The \\"sleigh ride\\" scene, with its series of jokes, explains why he's so excited. I was just checking the reviews to see if this was \\"fixed\\" in the DVD, and evidently it wasn't, so I won't be buying that version either."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Christmas Special Is Now Edited On DVD, Video Tape and TV!","review":"I love this Chrsitmas special or at least the original uncut version and I have to agree with all of the reviewers who said that it really stinks that they decided to release this on DVD and video with things edited out. It's missing the delightful scene where Fozzy is singing and dancing with a snowman and telling his corny jokes. Some reviewers are saying to just record this when it's shown on TV because on TV you will get the whole thing but I don't think they realized that the TV rerun broadcasts are also edited so unless you managed to record the original broadcast you will just see the edited one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got the original version","review":"While this had always been my favorite muppet movie, the missing scenes made this tape almost worthless. I found the original, taped from tv version at my parents house and it's in pretty good shape considering it's from 1989. It has the Fozzy and snowman song, sleighride, the muppet babies song, Santa CLaus is coming to town, Kermit and Miss Piggy singing, Have Yourself a Merry little Christmas, and Miss Piggy singing, there's no place like home for the holidays.

After nine years of waiting after the VHS version was released, it's not looking good. However, I was smart enough to tape the first run on TV with my Sony Beta-Max, without commercials. The cuts are a little ragged but to this day the quality is still as crisp and sharp as the day I taped it.

Also missing are the Muppet Babies singing \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\", and Miss Piggy singing,\\"There's No Place Like Home For The Holidays\\". For some reason the non-traditional songs, such as \\"Pass It On\\" by the Fraggles, were left in. It's bad enough that the movie was butchered, but why cut out the best scenes and leave some of the less \\"Christmasy\\" ones?!

HOWEVER, this version only gets 1 star because whoever released this thing has edited a full 15 - 20 minutes out of it. IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EDITED! In comparison to the original, this version is too jumpy, leaves out entire character developments and funny scenes. The original's pacing allows you to settle into the house with everyone and see how they mix. The pacing of this video barely gives you the flavor.

The catch is that the DVDs are coded for Region 2 (US DVD players are Region 1) and are in the PAL format (US is NTSC).If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.The good news is that these versions are priced fairly reasonable on e B a y and the shipping cost was lower than I expected.

The 'click and go' feature was a lifesaver, it rode really nicely, manuevered well, and I really thought that the $270 was worth it. However, once I put them in the regular seats, I once again was reminded that 'you get what you pay for'. The fact that the seats have only a 3 point harness over the lap instead of a 5 point harness to include the shoulder area is a real safety hazard. Right about the time babies are ready to graduate from the carriers to the big seats is when they are most curious, and my girls have almost leaned right over the side on to the concrete a couple of times because the 3 point harnesses does not contain them.I would advise against this stroller, and recommend to make sure you get a stroller with a 5 point harness-no matter what age your child is.

Now that my daughter is here and we have been able to use with her in her carseat in it and my son in it (He is 3) it still handles great and isnt too heavy. There are two things I dont like though. One is the fact that when my daughter is in her carseat in the back it is hard to see her with the way the cup holder sits. You have to look at her from the side.

Some other problems with the stroller is you cannot get in the basket if the infant carrier is being used because the basket does not lower, and the front sun shade pops off every time you use the stroller and is very hard to get back on. I have several friends that have this stroller and none of them can use the sun shade because it is to hard to put back on.I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone. Graco is not very helpful either when you complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best gift I got for my brother's family","review":"for three children, ages 3.5, 1.5 and 4 days old, my brother was shocked at the durability, the sleek design, the comfort of the seats and safety precautions. The de-tachable \\"cup holders\\" are great for older kids to sit in the front and jump in and out of the carriage without having to climb. The Carseat fits both in the front and back seat of the stroller, my sister-in-law finds this to be a treat as she can sit the baby facing her in the front of the stroller and use the seat in-between them for her bags and other things. It is so easy to steer. It is a a little weighty, but NOT heavy. Closes with a push of a button. My family loves it! Very safe, very durable, has many options and a great design. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stroller!","review":"We were in search of the perfect stroller for our daughters, 22 months and 3 months old, and we found it! We fell in love with this stroller when saw it at BRU, the others just didn't compare! And finally a stroller that ISN'T navy blue.I love the huge storage basket, the enclosed key holder tray, being able to snap the infant carrier in the back, and our oldest daughter loves riding in the stroller with her sister!!!The stroller pushes very nicely and easy to maneuver in store aisles considering it is a larger stroller. It really isn't much larger or heavier than our first single stroller, but is very durable. It has been great for trips to the zoo or the mall, we look forward to using it every time!I highly recommend this stroller for anyone of twins or two young children.If you have a small vehicle I would make sure it fits in the trunk before purchasing, we have a minivan and it fits in the back no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"jksey","review":"After reading the reviews prior to ordering, I was very disappointed in the product after it arrived. On several songs, he seems to struggle (i.e. \\"Words\\" is a good example) and the overall quality of the CD (both audio and selections) can't hold a candle to \\"The All- Time Greatest Hits of Roy Orbison\\".

These things might not show up in all comics sections every week (just like some newspapers still have dailies in b/w) but they're still a major part of the strip and I'd love to see the colors of the logo and drop panels in the Tenth Garfield Treasury.

I kept hoping something would happen to explain those statements. It didn't. There are only two things good about this show. 1 each episode is short, and 2 Felicia Day. Her character is endearing but beyond that this is not a good show. I understand this is a parody of gamers but the characters are not likeable AT ALL, and not funny. Maybe I just don't get it because I'm not a gamer but for the average veiwer I'd suggest watching something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Very Clever - Support the Show, Buy the DVD","review":"The Guild is one of the cleverest series I have ever seen. While each of the 10 episodes in season one are fairly short, they are packed full of good acting and humor that almost anyone who spends time on-line will be able to relate to. Felicia Day is great as Cyd Sherman (an \\"On-Line Game Addict\\") and her alter ego \\"Codex\\" (cleric/healer) who mixes her real life with her on-line life. The rest of the cast are stereotypical gamer geeks who bring great color to the series.This is a very good series and the DVD is reasonably priced. While the entire series can be found on-line, I bought the DVD to support the show.Highly Recommended! The second season is also out,The Guild - Season Two (Amazon.com Exclusive)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings 1st Century Palestine to life.","review":"I've read a fair amount of alternative fiction - enjoying Turtledove and Gingrich greatly - but this book is different. Is the timeline diverting or not? Is this alternative fiction or a just a story about 2 modern people trapped in 57 AD.Ingermanson's story is interesting and compelling, but not quite satisfying. His characters are strong and believable. One really comes to hate Hanan ben Hanan. However, the story doesn't have a strong payoff.This book is a good lesson on honor and forgiveness. As Ingermanson uses Jesus' words wisely to show that honor (what we might call status) is not what God desires, but rather forgiveness. His characters display this powerfully and authentically.There were some gliches such as how many times I had to read that \\"The Romans crucified Jesus\\" and that \\"Christians killed Jews.\\" But overall Ingermanson brings first century Palestine to life without difficult language. A nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premonition","review":"An enchanting book set in Biblical times. I found this book hard to put down, and it read very smoothly.

It added so much to the enjoyment of \\"Premonition\\".

The characters come alive, wrestling and maturing, hating and loving, forgiving and rejoicing: I found it hard to put the book down, except at the moments when I became so involved in the violent storyline that I feared to read what would happen next. Even more valuable, the historical research makes the New Testament milieu more clear than I've seen in any book--including my seminary training. Science, philosophy, history, combined with a life-changing message: I highly recommend both Transgression and Premonition."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed every word","review":"Amazing page turner. I enjoyed every word. I feel like the characters are my friends. So well written, complex in character study and their struggles point to things in my own life, ie control issues, trusting God, etc. Begin reading this book and you won't be able to put it aside without something REALLY important calling your name.

Topics include the purpose of the two separate governments, their unique functions and how they adapted (or didn't adapt) to social and economic changes throughout the developments of the United States. The only problem with this book is that it perhaps does not address the existence of the police power in the federal government as much as it could have.

Inaccurate and careless research, need I say more ? There are plenty of well done tomes on this subject, but this isn't one of them.

The theory behind this is really sound (Catherine Hinds invented the heat mask for the American facial). I've experienced that, which is a very elaborate electric heat mask, and its great cause it heats to the bone. This is a really lame version. You are better off, using a facial microwave gel pack or something similar with heat to obtain the result.What you get is an okay mask product (I like it - as its unusual to find a mask with SA acid in it)... and a heat wand that doesn't really heat up.Not an effective product.

There were several of these. This is one of the weaker ones. Compared to the other ones that were made this one is, well, not that good. BUT, compared to the other children specials out there this is a very well done show. It is based on the secret life of toy during one particular christmas season. This show has heart and is extremly entertaning. It spawned a short tv show on the disney channel and some people think it was the inspiration for the disney movie toy story. This is a exellent video to get to learn about the muppet creations besides the muppet show and is also a good holiday video for kids.

The tracks listed that show a popular figure speaking a famous line from a TV show or movie are not the actual individual speaking the line, but someone doing a rather lame impersonation. This seems like a bit of false advertising to me, to list the track and then the name of the star, but oh well. For the price being charged for this collection, you should get the real deal, but you don't. There are some OK bits on here, but not enough for me to recommend someone purchasing this CD.

To assess the beauty to be found in Pound's work without going the extra mile to understand the constellation of virtues, misapprehensions, and outright blandishments that led Pound to remain in Italy during WWII and endorse the Mussolini regime is to fail to understand what could make a decent, generous man confuse the \\"light of Eleusis\\" with the krieg lights of artistic freedom's enemies. For the Pound scholar, to fail to study the memetics of Pound's poetics is to be little more than an apologist for Pound's mistakes, thus making appreciation of his deepest gifts to culture naive and superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"no english subtitles","review":"i am disapointed i bought it because it said it has english subtitles. it does not have even though they advertised it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main attraction in this soap opera is the breathtaking Gabby Espino, who plays a \\"country girl\\" in Venezuela.","review":"Actually, she grew up on a wealthy ranch in the countryside as a strong-willed cowgirl.Gabby also starred in the telenovela/soap opera \\"Mundo the Fieras\\" with Sebastian Rulli.

Bittman advocates use of options as a complement to regular, non-speculative stock investing. He relies heavily on profit-loss diagrams to make the performance of option positions crystal clear. Only elementary math is involved, which may be a disappointment to those who are not scared off by the mere mention of standard deviations.The software included is based upon the Black-Scholes theory of option value and pricing. It's useful for playing around with the numbers, but don't expect a sophisticated user interface with lots of analytical capability. For that you'll probably have to dish out some real bucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Key word is Enhance","review":"There are things you can do with options that you can not do with any other investment tool.

Animals gather for warmth and sleep and people gather to eat and give thanks. The earth prepares for winter and looks forward to spring.This picture book is warm and soothing. The colors are rich and blurred and the words blend together to give a dozy feeling. As the earth begins to drift off to sleep, little ones may as well. This is a sleepy book, a calming book and I believe it is meant to be read in soft, slow tones. The words find a rhythm, though there is not rhyme to speak of and the feel of the illustrations match the feel of the lines.This is a nice read aloud for the autumn and naptime, cuddled up under blankets and by a crackling fire. This is not a playtime book, a loud book, a busy book-but it is a nice book. It has the potential to be the standard fall read for many, many years to come.Armchair Interviews agrees"},{"rating":"2","title":"book lover","review":"Beautiful book for children.

This weekend the printer would rarely print one page in a row without having to readjust the paper.Scanning pictures is interesting. One day, no matter how hard I tried to make it square, it came out crooked. This was exasperting to the point where I just stopped. I owned an Agfa Snapscan 1212 but it was old and did not have XP drivers.

The printer constantly jams unless extreme care is used in paper loading (and then sometimes too-not a family friendly situation).

It's a poor attempt to make a movie in a raunchy style, but with almost all talk and extremely little action. There was no point to putting this on Blu-ray, because the movie looks aged and cloudy.

This album contains some of the most emotional, beautiful guitar playing I have ever heard in my entire life. The songs still send chills up my spine every time I listen to this album, even after 3 years. I cannot stress enough how emotionally moving this album is.

I became even more intrigued after reading up on the guy and decided to start with this disc as my introduction to his obviously diverse musical history. Granted I cannot compare this with his other works, but I gotta say I found the music on this CD to be sappy, pastel (file under Mauve Rock) and monotonous from start to finish. Nothing dynamic, challenging or all that expressive, and nothing here to really back his virtuosic, avant-garde reputation. This is a flat-liner, plain and simple. Kudos to BH for shifting gears and traveling down different artistic paths, but as for Colma, this is more Yanni than Michael Myers, more John Tesh than Axl Rose.

Unfortunately on Colma all that know how adds up to next to nothing. Even Eddie Van Halen valued melody over heroics. Most of the tracks are filled with so much needless meandering even hardcore Phish fans might fall asleep, and the psychedlic experimentations seem half formed and down right indolent. Ok ok so its sort of commendable Buckethead dedicates the album to his parents, but the fact is any hack off the street can pick up a guitar, learn some scales, noodle around for 5 minutes and call it \\"Sailing Boats with my Dad\\". The only time Buckethead really bares the personality in his sound is on \\"Machete\\" a blast of \\"Kiss my Axe\\" guitar shredding that puts much of David Gilmour's guitar work to shame.

And it's a different sound every time. These breathtaking sounds are assembled into equally breathtaking compositions with soaring melodies, and the beauty is squared, not doubled. Never less than tasty, often truly delicious. \\"Colma\\" reminds me a lot of some of Andy Summers' (ex-Police) solo instrumental work, and also of Mox -- except it's better than either. This is the only Buckethead album I own, or perhaps I should better say it's my first, since I'll be buying more. From reading other reviews of this album it sounds like this is rather different from his other work. A pity, really, though I'm sure his others have their charms as well, which I look forward to discovering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and beautiful.","review":"Sure, I love it when Buckethead picks up his Jackson V axe and just shreds away and dances up and down the neck like lightning, but this is something else! Halfway between laidback contemporary jazz and chilled out modern rock, this is one of the most peaceful and emotional instrumental albums I've ever heard. Ol' Bucket proves he's more than just a masked thrasher, he's a great serenader and one of the most brilliant guiatrist in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versitile!","review":"This ink is wonderful for painting rich black lines and making diluted fills.

The book begins with the difficulties of studying transitory radioactive elements, moving on to discuss similarities between unrelated radioactive substances, the theory of isotopes, and ultimately the Bohr model of the atom. Included is an extensive historical introduction by the editor, along with frequent editorial comments on the papers that make up the majority of the work. These annotations allow even the layman to understand these basic and important trends in radioactive science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info and too tedious","review":"If you've never studied anything of this sort it might point you in a direction to find more as many of the references are good. However ... if you know anything of mystery schools and symbolism this book tells you I have a secret and I'm not gonna share it (although most books of this nature do that but they atleast throw you a bone). Nothing new or revolutionary is shared, the information can be found elsewhere a lot easier. I suffered through this book hoping that maybe some glimpse of a deep initiatic mystery might be exposed and was disappointed time and again. One or two stories were interesting such as the man who worked constantly at just about anything including moving his fingers knowing that any work yields results... but this is no prize. If you're deathly interested take the book out from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Initiation","review":"This is an extraordinary account of initiation; the specific initiation of one man. Occult brotherhoods have existed throughout the centuries but very little has been revealed about them. This time of secrecy is coming to an end, those who dare have access to these secrets. The greatest revelation in this book to my mind is: \\"The purpose behind all initiation is the furtherance of love.\\" This seems to be at odds with our modern life. However, to truly understand the nature of love is the initiation. This is an important book, I thoroughly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informationally great , but claustrophobic and dull.","review":"FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER is a very subtle and understated film concerning, most specifically, the four days in 1969 in which U.S Ambassador to Brazil Charles Burke Elbrick was held hostage by the Student Revolutionaries, the MR-8. This is not an \\"edge-of-your-seats Political thriller that is powerful and exciting\\" (all of terms that critics use). Instead, this film is told in a quasi-documentarian style that examines the emotions of all that were involved in this kidnapping.

Whether it be suggesting that most witches were burned during the witchtrials (when most were hanged), or suggesting that the origins of Santa have something to do with a mushroom, this book is filled with historical misconceptions, enormous leaps of speculation presented as fact, a poor selection of source material (which also seem to have been poorly read), simplification of facts which contort them beyond recognition, and what can only be described as a willful ignorance of actual scholarship.

Be aware, however, that the book lacks the traditional alphabet listing of topics in an encyclopedia, which makes it hard to find specific things you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a bit disappointing as it is not what I expected. It's light and fluffy as opposed to being a serious research guide and informative tome. It reminds me more of a \\"My first encyclopedia\\" type book, something for young teens. So, if you're looking for something to flip through on a rainy day, this is an okay book.

Indeed, it is difficult not to be entertained by the distinctive styles in Ian Rankin's \\"Saint Nicked\\", or Simon Brett's \\"Exit, Pursued\\" (bound to be a hit with Shakespeare fans), both of which lead the reader on a meandering course of false trails before their sly endings. A notable new voice is Mat Coward, whose \\"Too Subtle for Me\\" both utilizes and mocks existing mystery standards.On the other hand, there are many stories in the book that fall short of the complexity that is needed for a mystery/crime story; experienced mystery readers will be able to discover a large number of twists within the first paragraphs. As an example of British crime telling it is patchy, but there are spots of great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Horror than Mystery","review":"I took this book out of the library because my mom loves mysteries.

For one thing, the title is deceptive because the stories do not meet what I had always considered the definition of mystery stories. They are short stories and admittedly well-written as far as content and structure are concerned, but they are not mystery stories in the tradition of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. Furthermore each story was depressing and most were filled with enough vulgarity to make me sick to my stomach. I would be embarrassed for anyone to see this book in my collection.

All of the books in this series are nice, easy, cozy mysteries but this one was a bit weaker than the rest. As a first novel, it was to be expected, but reading some of Churchill's later works first really made it all the more obvious.

The chapters all read like boring bureaucratic reports, and the action never came alive. Perhaps worst of all, the book failed where it should have been strongest, in the area of analysis. The basic causes of each disaster were given, but never in any depth or detail. A reference section at the end of each chapter was of little help as well. Readers were referred to magazine articles again and again, even with disasters as far back as the Hindenburg! Breakdown is a useful book only as a quick reference source.

Add the Kings of Leon to the long list of artists who have sold their souls to the record industry devils. That aside this album as several really great tracks such as \\"Red Morning Light\\", \\"Spiral Staircase\\", and \\"Holy Roller Novocaine\\".I think that anyone who likes their newer albums should give this one a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Gothic Southern Rock","review":"Kings of Leon's first CD is one of the most prolific rock albums of the last 2 decades rivaling Nirvana and other grunge rockers of the early 1990s. With obvious influences such as Led Zep, Neil Young, Velvet Underground, Black Crowes they have taken American southern rock to a new level. By the way, this purchase of YYMH was actually for a friend. I had the album already. My friend left this voice mail after hearing the CD: \\"Oh my God. This is the best rock album I've ever heard. Every song, every guitar riff, every lyric is amazing. I don't know who they sound like. No one really. And Caleb's voice. It's perfect.\\"Anyway, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ole Southern swagger","review":"From the minute the album opens with the excellent swamp boogie of 'Red Morning Light' you're in for one helluva great ride. These Tennessee boys set your speakers ablaze with great whiskey-fueled rock. Aside from the aforementioned 'Red Morning Light,' other favorites include 'Molly's Chambers' and 'Holy Roller Novocaine.' Just a good album from some good ole boys lookin' for a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the Southern Strokes","review":"This is a great album - short and to the point, and most importantly, full of emotion. When you hear a good rock song, by the end of it, you know the lead singer is exhausted, and that's how you feel when you listen to Kings of Leon. That's also one area that really sets them apart from The Strokes. Now, the Strokes are a good band too, but they just don't get into the music the way the Kings of Leon do. Just see them live and you'll understand. This is real rock n roll with some southern flavor and a lot of energy. Plus they're all related and they have mustaches, and that has to count for something. I hope they have a nice, long career ahead of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I think a lot of people are really missing out on what makes this band so good. One word: honesty. There isn't one ounce of pretentiousness on this record. It's all coming straight from the heart. I mean he isn't a great singer, they're not great players, but it all comes together great. But all being of the same family there is sure to be some underlying rhythm. And the tunes are just great. I mean each tune will definitely put you in mind of an earlier band, like the Stones or Tom Petty or the Allman Brothers, but these guys have boogie and they have shake. That deep South boogie and shake mind you. A real ballsy, bluesy kind of thing you don't learn from a book or music lessons. I'm talkin' the take the shoes off, roll down the stockin's, spread the cornmeal on the dancefloor, and get down boogie. As far as I'm concerned any music that makes you want to shake your hips is good stuff. At times ya want to stand up and testify!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected hit","review":"I have to admit, when I first heard of Kings of Leon, I expected nothing. Just another band that I probably wouldn't like, in this bland music scene of post-bubblegum-pop America. My friend Sean had suggested them to me, so I gave them a chance anyway. The first song I heard, at Sean's suggestion, was \\"California Waiting.\\" I couldn't believe I actually liked something so modern. I picked up the album, and played it in the car on the way home. From the first track to the last, I was continually blown away by the perfect mix of all my 70's favorites, but with the freshness of today.Whether it's a mix of Zeppelin and the Who, or CCR and the Allman Brothers, it's certainly a rock fan favorite.This is one of the few albums I will listen to all the way through, without skipping a single track. Believe the hype, this is one of the few bands actually worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha? Did I miss something?","review":"I read all of the reviews here and oddly enough none of them mentioned Ethan Johns. That's funny because didn't he write all of these songs? Southern fried white strokes? More like Southern fried O-Town. Sadly enough, the problem with the album is not only the sordid backstory, but the music is bad, too. That is unfortunate in my book because I am a big fan of Ethan Johns. I think Ryan Adam's HEARTBREAKER might have been one of the best albums in the past 10 years. But this doesn't fare well against his previous work. It's only a matter of time before the Kings of Leon start calling him \\"Colonel.\\" So if you want the Tennessee version of the Monkees, stay here. But if you want rock you'll have to leave this town, Nointegrityville, and head about a million miles north to My Morning Jacket.It's just a matter of time before this album starts to fill up the used bins at your local music store. As a matter of fact there are 30 used copies available on Amazon as I type this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strokes meets the south and thats not a positive thing","review":"Rolling stone said that this was a awesome southern album comparable to the allman brothers band. I love everything Ethan Johns had produced until I heard this. This is absolute rubbish. I couldn't belive that rolling stone even tried to compare them to the allman bros.

I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Youth and young craphood","review":"Not that good. If you like lead singers who sound like they have a mouth full of marbles and predictable chord progressions, then this is the record for you.

Pick up the new strokes record instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inbred Rock","review":"Hey guys, here's a clue. If you got a family that can really write and play some great music but ain't nobody can sing a lick, then you gotta go outside your kin.This band has the potential to be outstanding but I listened to 4 cuts from \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" and switched CD's - the vocals are audibly painful.

I saw these guys open up for The Strokes (go head and say something, i don't care, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING...although they were el-lame-o live). These guys try to cash in on 70's retro rock, but it is evident that they don't know a damn thing about it (music wise) and look and rock out like the emo tools that they really are. You want the real deal buy some Cactus. And if you want something with a modern flair, support a good band that can actually play live and kick out the jams...Nebula is my choice. That was the worst 35 minutes I've ever had to stand through...and i wasn't even sober...wink-wink. good lookers(not by my standards though) don't make a good band. Hopefully, I've helped you all. There are plenty of other bands who write catchy songs and are good eye candy too...choose wisely. peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck","review":"I know nothing about the albums, but saw these guys live with U2 on Thursday and they suck. Everytime the lead singer opened his mouth to sing, we cringed. He is like fingernails on a chalkboard. The band is actually ok, music wise, if the lead singer would shut up. If you go to U2, try to get reserved seats so you can skip this band.

From the first note of red morning light to the last syllable of holy roller novocaine, this album just hits the not perfectly.By the time you have listened to this album 3 times you will never want to take it out for about a month.10 of the 11(i have a british copy) are superb,Caleb has a different voice admittedly,and maybe a bit thick, but the tune works for it.Genius is the song of 2003,no contest. Kings of Leon are the band of 2003, and I hope for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock and Roll is back","review":"It is almost unbelievable that this is the kings of leon's debut album. It sounds like a band thats been around for years and has perfected a style that brings back that southern lynyrd skynyrd flawless sound. In its classic rock feeling, it starts on the same high note as it finishes, with amazing songs like \\"wasted time\\" and \\"holly roller novocaine\\". A definite must have for any self respecting rock and roll lover. This is a band to watch out for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a new band worth listening to","review":"A friend of mine living in the UK turned me on to this great new band. They are apparently huge there. They are soon to be huge here as well. Not too strange that they would make it big 3000 miles away from home before hitting it big here. After all people compare every new sound out there to The Strokes or something equally trite and absurd. No doubt these guys will be compared to all of the moderately talented bands of the past couple of years or so. Dont believe it, Kings of Leon are their own sound and they rock like the 60's have just returned. This album is a dandy indeed...but dont expect to hear any tracks on the radio. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to agree- \\"southern-fried strokes\\": awesome album","review":"I picked this cd up on a whim yesterday expecting not much.

Now it's cool to be \\"raw\\" and every album with this sound is highly reviewed . The trouble here is that this band isn't raw in the stripped down sense, but rather raw in the lack of talent sense. The songs aren't great, the band is pretty average, and the vocals by Caleb are completely incomprehensible. On what level is it cool to intentionally slur your vocals?Yes, they're from the south and have seventies haircuts. No, their music is not even close to on par with great southern rock bands of the seventies. Other than their retro southern seventies image this is a truly unremarkable band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"A solid cd that's good all the way through.

HYPE!","review":"I first became aware of the Kings of Leon when I read an article on them a few months ago. Then I heard a few tracks off their EP at a local record store and decided to buy this album. Two of the store clerks told me my money would be well-spent on something else. Unfortunately, their advice went unheeded. No, the Kings of Leon are not the Southern Strokes in a musical sense; but they are similar in the fact they both received a generous portion of praise from the music press. There are a couple of really good songs on here (\\"Joe's Head\\" and \\"California Waiting\\" particularly stand out), a few allright tunes and the rest are subpar. I would have given this album only one star, but it deserves two since it is better than about 75% of any other recent releases I have heard. And after reading this review, someone out there still decides to purchase \\"Youth & Young Manhood\\" I would seriously advise that person to look around for a used copy"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!","review":"Don't be fooled by all the hype...this band sucks! As a matter of fact they might even be worse than Jet! I'm giving these clowns one star because they can play musical instruments and are at least better than electro-clash, new wave wanna be pap like Fischerspooner. Go buy the first couple of Skynyrd and Allman brothers discs if you wanna pose that you are into \\"southern rock\\", but steer clear of this prepackaged piece of dog mess! The retro rock fad has already gotten way out of had, and this is just another nail in its moronic coffin. Go buy everything by the Hellacopters if you want rehash done the right way...they cover the ground between the MC5, the Stooges, and Lynyrd Skynyrd with some motown thrown in for good measure. Also Check out Radio Birdman as an alternative to Jet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"melancholic, kick-ass Southern boys","review":"I browsed through some of the previous reviews, and frankly, I can't understand the comparisons with the Strokes. These bands aren't even remotely similar, other than the fact that they reside outside of the mainstream (thank God).That said, I highly recommend this album if you like intelligent, bittersweet rock'n'roll from Dixie like the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or newer bands like the Drive By Truckers, My Morning Jacket, and Black Crowes. That's not to say that Kings of Leon sounds much like any of these bands, just that they have a similar attitude towards life & faintly similar musical styles. Perhaps what they all have in common is the ability to smoothly change song dynamics, from an acoustic-driven, bittersweet song (or part of a song) to frenzied rock.I also love the singer's voice (whichever Followill brother is singing, pardon my ignorance), particularly when he screeches and raves like a madman. It's what rock'n'roll is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This is only the 2nd CD that I have purchased in the last couple of years that I am TOTALLY disappointed with.

This cd is definitely one you can sit back with your significant other and just chill. Two thumbs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing......","review":"Well, it seems as her two radio releases are pretty much the best songs on her album.

After listening to only 7 of the 18 tracks I was ready to either pitch it or coaster it. First of all, 18 tracks is way too many for a debut artist to put out the first time around. Especially when most of material is bland and forgettable. A six-song ep would have been fine. Throughout the songs I did hear, there was a hint of a cute riff or a chord change here and there but nothing that kept my attention. It's background music. And the lyrics aren't much either. While Anderson's vocal style is refreshingly thick and biting, these songs don't showcase it as much as bury it. Lastly, this project just doesn't have enough of a distinguihing personality. I heard lots of albums just like it-some done much better like Mary J. Blige's self-titled opus and Millie Jackson even when she's being CLEAN. Hopefully Sunshine will get a second chance to do this music thing RIGHT! Outtahea'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep On Eye On Da Sunshine...","review":"This is a real star on the rise - what a voice. True sunshine!Sunshine Anderson's debut album doesn't look like a first effort at all. She comes over as an established artist with her very own sound and original vibe. Macy Gray, Mary J Blige, Jill Scott and the heavenly Erykah Badu - these are names I give you so you can have a vague idea of Sunshine's sound. But don't you dare label her, she's very personal in her music and stands out from any other singer. The best songs are the hit 'Heard It All Before', 'Better Off' and 'Saved The Day' - but every single song is inspired. A great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit blunder","review":"I purchased this CD on the strength of a terrific single, \\"Heard it all Before\\" and Sunshine's association with the very talented Macy Gray. I must say, I am very very disappointed. Sunshine's voice is marginal at best and the songwriting is inane. I'm trying to figure out how I will dispose of this utter waste of money. This just isn't a very good CD at all. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I thought that this album was going to be the bomb but it totally ...! The only good song on the album is 'Heard it All Before'. There may be two other songs that grow on you but that is it. The lyrics are great but the rythms and melodies are skrewed. All the songs sound almost the same and her voice never really changes....

After hearing \\"Heart It All Before\\" and seeing the video where Sunshine just oozed sass and overall appeal, I had to check out the album. I'm glad I did, cause it's a smooth listen throughout.

SUnshine is a promising new leader of the regular R&B comeup. Every song is hot and shows emotions. She is very gifted and talented as a R&B Newcomer of the year for this year so far. Sunshine deserves all the props and believe me she overshadows MJB, just like Jill Scott overshadows Badu. But these ladies defiantly deliver. So stop the hating and the comparisons and enjoy the music. Pick this one up, along with India.Arie. Sunshine is heart and soul. Hot as she is,talented as she is, yo she can be my woman anyday.

Other than the hit song \\"heard it all before\\", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as \\"light cuisine\\". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surpassing her attempt to be the next Hip Hop Soul Princess","review":"This is one of the better r&b albums out on the market today. She is a mix of Mary J. Blidge with a smoothed out attitude. The title track down to the first single \\"Heard it all before\\" are making a statement of who, where, and what times she is living in. The probable next cut to be out as a single should be \\"Letting Down My Guard\\". A Str8 mix of jazz samples and her smoothed out approach, sounding similar to MJB more than any other cut on the album. What is so nice about this album is that it does not rely wholly on samples, guest appearances etc. Pretty much the gimicks of promoting a new artist these days. She is weighing on her own merits.

Small footprint.The bad: color printing basically makes no sense on this printer, unless you enjoy the various shades of the rainbow coming out unexpectedly. BW printing is too expensive as $30 per cartridge is the usual price for not too many pages. If you do not use the printer heavily, the ink basically dries out, and your $30 goes to waste. Plastic paper guides eventually fell off.All in all, this printer is classic case where you buy something cheaply and pay for it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This Printer","review":"My college dorm owns this printer, as does a friend of mine.

Anyhow, I couldn't find another for months and had to use the reguarl 25 foot white hose. What a pain that is. This stores in a small containter that I keep all my water related things in and is so much neater looking at the campsite. I would recommend this product whole-heartedly.WARNING WARNING WARNINGAfter using this hose for three RV trips of one week each, on the fourth trip I hooked it up and it looked just like a sprinkler system.

Then I received this unit, I was surprised to see how short it looked. Then we went out on our first camping trip, the hose would not stretch enough to reach the faucet and the RV's water inlet. Most campgrounds have all the Hook-ups towards the back of the RV. My RV has the water inlet towards the front, that's what started the problem. I had to use a standard 25' RV hose that reached without any issues and had plenty of length available to move around. I am sure that a 50' coiled hose would have been enough to reach. From what I could see, the coiled hole could barely be extended to half it's rated length. The hose and fittings were of the highest quality though.If you have your water inlet near the rear of the RV, I would recommend this 25' coiled hose.

It is all instumental music (their 2nd studio album has one song with vocals by Mike Patton) on this cd, and the live performance, which this captures very well. You do miss some of the bass quality, so important to their sound on this cd (or is it my stereo) so I can't give it 5 stars, but close.

The commentary of some people that it is just too rigid I dont share, as it is easy to adapt the curved part by bending it more straight, allowing the violin to turn easily in or outwards. A tip for people with narrow shoulder width: Unscrew the lower of the the two screws which attachs the extended curved part to the main body and you can turn this part more inwards in a way that it doesn't touch your shoulder joint, but will rest over the collar bone and the more comfortable trapezium muscle,creating more freedom of movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kid hated it.","review":"My kid wanted this shoulder rest, and he hated it.

After only 7,500 pages, the fuser and roller went leaving me with $550 in repairs. After speaking to Minolta, these items are consumables even though the fuser was supposed to last 100,000 prints and the roller 30,000, so they are not covered by any warranty. Even though this printer is economical at first, the upkeep will be expensive. I would recommend the HP 2500L for $999 instead because besides the toner, there is only one other consumable item rather than four on the Minolta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is OK, be careful about rebate offer.","review":"I bought this printer and it's working OK. The $200 rebate ISN'T. The rebate apppears to be a scam although quite official looking. It's administered by Parago Inc. who return my e-mails with a \\"we're looking into it\\" letter. First they denied my rebate saying I had already had receive a check. When I called their Customer service, they said they had no information about sending me a check but my rebate had been denied... And that they would look into it. Long story short, I'm on my 3rd Black Toner cartrige and still no rebate.

I bought it new for over $900 with a three year warrenty. It did work well for two years with only occasional jams. The colors where great and the speed was impressive. However, it started giving me significant problems within three years jamming intermittently or folding the first page in an accordian-like fashion. It got progressively worse. The national computer chain I purchased it from went out of business a few weeks prior to when I needed to take it in for repair.This machine is cumbersome and heavy making moving it a real feat.When I got an error message to replace the transfer roller, I did so.. but to no avail. I have changed out the blue and black cartridges twice with authentic Minolta replacements. I believe this model has its share of lemons and I got one. I wish I had purchased a different laser printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling ripped off","review":"If you find this printer for a good price, make sure that you buy several of them since they are cheaper than replacing the toner cartridges and drum, even taking into account the crippled \\"low capacity\\" cartridges shipped with the printer. As the other reviewers have said, once the printer decides that you are out of toner it stops printing completely. My printer decided today that there was 0% left of all three color cartridges (what are the odds of that?) so it stopped printing and won't even print black and white pages. Also beware that the low capacity toner cartridges have the same part number as the high capacity ones. Make sure you know what you are ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of CRAP","review":"I bought this printer thinking it would give me quality color laser printing. While it can adequately handle the most mundane chores, if you try to do ANYthing creative whatsoever, it can't handle it. Want to print labels? Transparencies? Envelopes? Anything OTHER than 8.5x11 paper? Forget about it. Not only can it not handle the most basic of paper needs, but the piece of junk regularly screws up PowerPoint presentations (garbled output), Adobe Acrobat files, Excel worksheets, and even screws up MS-Word documents with complex graphics, text, headers, and footers on the same page.Wanna buy mine?

Also clever is \\"The Sweetest Sounds. The second CD is just as enjoyable with Como stringing together several hits and standards. It's awkward having this release as a two-disc CD, since the first disc is barely 30 minutes.

What a dreadful wasted opportunity. If this is the quality of re-releases on \\"Collectables\\" we are better playing the old vinyl.

Paintings on my fridge hold up quite well without ripping at the edges. And the tray is wonderful. My 20-month old granddaughter uses the paper for her crayon drawings as well. The plastic tray that the paper comes in has a tiny lip around the edge, and the lip keeps crayons from rolling off the table -- very, very helpful. When I realized the value of the tray, I started putting other toys with wheels on the tray to keep them from rolling off the table as well.

Fortunately, I don't recall his doing Peggy's tunes other than \\"It's a Good Day.\\" He does several covers of Frank's Capitols here, very well. Perry's weakness in this role is that his emotional range is limited (you can't be noncommital about \\"hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate\\") in addition to which the Ray Charles Singers springing out of the closet at the climax of that ultimate expression of aloneness \\"In the Still of the Night\\" is downright grotesque.I've compared the small-group recordings of \\"We Get Letters\\" to Dean Martin's \\"Swingin' Down Yonder\\" to Dean's considerable advantage. Perry's great in the grand settings in which his hits, from \\"Temptation\\" on, were scored. I'd rather direct new listeners there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a deaf business person in a hearing world","review":"I liked the casual nature of introducing sign language to people that have deaf people in their acquaintance.Sign Language is presented in a context of conversation rather than a dictionary.My staff, all hearing persons, responded very favorably to being able to say things in sign language that pleased both me and them.This is a fresh approach to an age-old subject.There are a million miles to go to be fully functional in any new language. Sign language is a new language. The more you use it, the easier it is to retain it.My simple belief is that all people have areas of inadequacy. Those with a physical disability may only have one.

That is, the grammar of ASL is absent in the presence of English word order. But the way the book is laid out, it's easy to learn! There's little bits of cultural information, how to engage and end a conversation, \\"do\\"s and \\"don't\\"s, and more! I like the little anecdotes, too.Pros: Easy to follow, comes with a DVD to reinforce and clarify signs, decent amount of information for a beginnerCons: NOT ASL (ASL \\"words\\" but not the grammar) and not terribly helpful for those with moderate exposure to sign languageOverall, it's a handy cultural tool that helps you learn a little language :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Look Ma, no hands!\\"","review":"The idiots guide, with black and white pictures, of people with bad 1980's hair, had to be returned.

Perhaps the best thing about the campaign is that the drow are not a part of it. What is intrical to the campaign is diplomacy, rational thought and more than a little all out hack and slash. Something for everybody and enough gaps to have something different happen along the way - that way PCs never feel railroaded into saving their own (and a great # of other people's) behind. Perhaps one of the best CAMPAIGNS ever put out.Still, it would be unfair to warn you that while the first book gives plenty of ideas for sidestepping the campaign, little is done to fill in the underdeveloped underdark. Be prepared to provide some filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, no sting in its tail...","review":"This boxed set is split into three books, of which the first one is the best. The second is the worst, and the third is slightly better than the second. The final encounter in this adventure is a cheap cop-out of which very little is gained. Appropriate for levels 1+ (to about 15th level, maybe 20 if you're a good party)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I am pleased with this frame.

This frame doesn't fit California license plates!","review":"I bought two of these frames for my new vehicle in October. Once I received my California plates, I found that they did not fit inside either license plate frame - not by much, but enough so that the frames would not mount flush with the license plates - they were about a half centimeter too small. I think this is a manufacturing defect with the frames rather than the plates, as I tried another set of California plates and they did not fit as well. Bummer for me was that I purchased the frames prior to receiving the plates, and once I received them and discovered they didn't fit, it was outside of Amazon's 30-day return window.

This cd is anything but a big disappointment and boring. Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio is a classic group of performers, and their young excitement is shown through with this cd. This cd is anything but boring. NOT ALL ROCKABILLY IS FAST AND UPBEAT SONGS. Some people forget that sometimes. This cd is filled with fast songs, as well as slower songs. This doesn't take away from the cd. Each rockabilly artist has their own STYLE. If everyone sounded the same, there would be no music. So yes you may go to Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Billy Riley, or even Elvis Presley's early stuff(his \\"Baby Let's Play House\\" is stolen from the Rock and Roll Trio's \\"Oh Baby Babe\\"), and the list goes on and on...but don't forget and count out the Rock and Roll Trio. Do some research and you will find out: If there was no Rock and Roll Trio, there would be no Elvis!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my money back?","review":"After all the good reviews, I expected great things from this album, which made my disappointment all the worse. Sorry, but this is a complete failure in every way. The arrangements are static or plodding, and the use of traditional percussion (handclaps, for cryin' out loud!) only heightens the feeling that you're listening to a high school band that can keep a tune. I know they thought they were bridging the old and the new, but they've only succeeded in dragging down the exciting into the mundane. Even as a goof, it's just no fun. For the real thing, I strongly urge everyone to check out Empire Brass' PASSAGES, which, while a bit different, successfully achieves the artistic aims this album so completely fails to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windsor Bench","review":"It looks fairly nice for the price, but there were some marks on the wood.

(The delays appear to be as slow as 1/5 to 1/15 of a second.)If you're doing some very specific long-exposure shots that require a fill flash (ie., to \\"freeze\\" some action), this might work.

He did not like the CD at all and cried - the man's voice is kind of creepy on it.A wonderful book to add to any collection.Update: Now that my son is 3 1/2 he still loves the stories and has come to love the stories on CD.

Luke slater has ambient electronic dreamscapes with freek funk. Joey Beltram (JB3)'s forklift is astonishing techno. you have to hear it to believe it . If you want pure techno listen to steve stoll. This guy was once an army guy in desert storm and he had a brief stint in KMFDM. He is amazing. Also listen to Fawn's \\"Vengeance\\" (This is my favorite). This wil no doubt get you off your feet.

Especially when it concerns the tax code, the devil is in the details, and while B&M sometimes go a little overboard in describing the small print of oil depletion allowances and the like, the fact is that Congressmen think that way -- and voters had better know it.

The rest of the book is dedicate to the exposition of very short client situations followed by a couple of paragraphs where the author explains how she did (or would in some cases) deal with the client issues. There is no theory, no real psychology, just the author's opinion. Obviously her approaches to dealing with the client issues are not the only approaches, and may not even be the best ones.

Regardless of how much I tightened it, the thing continued to come lose. Tightening it too much started to draw the wood screw that holds the head on out of the handle. I finally glued the screw into the handle, and the head onto the screw with some Titebond II and let it sit overnight. It's worked fine since then.I was a little leery about buying shop fox tools given their general poor ratings I've come across.

I've seen several merchants explain that they get these from so many sources that it's impossible for them to make any claims about any dates at all. Fair enough. However, if just one frickin merchant would stick to making such claims, and would sell filters that aren't expired, they would get ALL the business.

The book is very well written. However, when I bought this book I was expecting something more informal, more enjoyable to read.

This game is terrible, and it is NOTHING like Max Payne. The graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen in a video game, even for the time period that this game came out in. The controls are also some of the worst I have ever encountered. The worst part of this game, however, is the plot/gameplay. In short - there is no plot. This guy just runs around killing things while his stupid pet does dumb tricks that a real dog would never do.This game is a cheap knockoff of Max Payne, and it performs poorly.

Yeah, Midway was an incredible victory, but there is much of interest here.

The 16 different boarders give you a diverse selection of strengths and weaknesses. I also like the ability to customize your boarder, which can give you the upper hand in a competition. But this doesn't amount to a whole lot. The game is still too slow. When it comes to the tricks, I was just tapping different keys randomly, trusting my luck.

Many have picture Jefferson as the winner, but after reading this book, we see that Hamilton was the true winner of this contest as his policies were the ones that set the US on the path to greatness and economic power. Gordon shows how this happened through Hamilton's efforts to monetize the national debt. Such a decision made credit available to the new nation, and ensured that the US would be able to move forward and develop without becoming dependent on a client state.

One I would recommend to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating read!","review":"This book gives wonderful insite into Hamilton and the amazing story of his overcoming much opposition to create a national bank that allowed the nascent U.S. to survive.

Not only an interesting and educating read but a practical guide which I know I will use as my health \\"bible\\".A client of Joseph Kurian's for the last few years, I instantly felt and saw the positive and life altering effects of Joseph's creams, herbs and oils and rejuvenation treatments. Now I fully understand the history and methodology of his work and why I now feel better than I can ever remember.What a wonderful gift God has given us through Joseph Kurian.

After more hours on phone & tech support (I'd get disgusted & just not print color for a while because I didn't have time to spend on the phone & messing with the printer) the final result is that I could pay $ for Lexmark to fix it (no longer under warranty - you see), never mind that I paid $200 for the original & could now buy it for $98 average price.

One of my college classmates was a member of the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion - the subject of this book - and found the information to be accurate. However, it is a self-published book and suffers from the major shortcoming of that genre: a lack of copyediting and proofreading. The very first paragraph of Chapter 1 contains a typographical error, a punctuation error, and a grammatical error. Because of errors like these, the book is sometimes difficult for a person like me -- a retired editor -- to read. Nevertheless, I found it worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Pleased","review":"I've installed this about a year ago for a customer.

Not sure what the problem is with this cutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tricky","review":"The cutter works great, it leaves clean lines and perfect circles, but its definitively a challenge to cut a circle around an already printed circle or to centralize a picture. It does take practice to get it, and it may result in wasting a lot of paper, so its better to practice for a while before cutting an important picture or piece of paper.

I thought the writing was overly romanticized, and the lead characters annoyed me. Right from the start, they called each other \\"sweetness\\" and \\"bucko\\" far too often for me and swilled Asti Spumanti and scotch faster than I can drink water.

Here the privileged indulge their whims, passions and desires. The book is a page-turner with fast moving scene shifts, realistic dialog, and characters with hidden motives and desires. Thief of Hearts has it all--passion, romance, mystery, betrayal, revenge, and a double murder. The book leaves the reader with a need to quickly continue the Lambert saga in the second book of the series, entitled Forbidden. An exciting and breathtaking read from beginning to end! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy sexy sexy!","review":"Part one of the Lambert series, Thief of Hearts by author Victoria Taylor Murray left this reader so charged up I felt as if I needed to be hosed down...Can't wait to read part two!

Great series, author Victoria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like A Real Soap Opera!","review":"Thief of Heart's (book one in the Lambert series), starts off just like a real live soap opera where the beautiful young billionaire's wife is getting ready for her late afternoon bubble bath. A late afternoon routine where she sips on a bubbling glass of Asti Spumanti as she soaks in a hot bath and writes in her fantasty journal. Suddenly, the bath is interupted with an intrusive phone call that starts the one week of hell for this lovely damsel in distress. Delightful beginning book.

The \\"Lambert\\" series by Victoria Taylor Murray reminds me of those two programs, neither of which I could get enough of.

Thief of Hearts (although not without a few flaws) is a wonderful intro book to what promises to be an exciting (4) bk series. I enjoy romantic suspense novels and this book is exactly that. A story about a young woman that married a man of mystery and wealth. Thief of Hearts has more twists and turns thant the board game twister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Housewives like myself need stories like this one,","review":"First I'd like to thank this writer for writing such a fun story for women like me to get lost in...housewives across the country need a fun way to relax every once in awhile and books like Thief of Hearts, Forbidden, Friendly Enemies, and Le Fin, provided us a wonderful escape. Women like me read for nothing more than a fun time and not to get an education on the do's and dont's in proper English...the plots in a story are much more fun to get into when they are fresh and not overly edited.

I have since TOH hearts read the entire series of four. Quite frankly I had a good time trying to piece the mystery, the romance, and the on going plot together of the four books in this series. I thought overall the story was very good. I would be very excited to read more books by this new writer. I liked Ms. Murray's fresh voice combining mystery, suspense, and romance.

I have never felt compelled to contact a publishing company before to complain about one of their books however I could not let this one slip by. Today I sent an email to Publish America letting them know what I think about their quality of editing. Every page had grammatical errors & as a result it takes so much away from the actual content of the book. I also found the characters to have no depth whatsoever so I don't understand how some of the other readers can rave about the interesting characters. I can't believe the number of people who gave this book rave reviews! It is by far the worst book I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, Compelling & Passionate,","review":"Like most other people that have read this book, I, too, had a good time and quickly ordered the remaining three in the series. I agree with most of the reviews of this series in its entirety, the action is nonstop and the plot only gets better and better. Ms. Murray has become a writer that I will look for everytime I go to buy a new book! I'm a new fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Altho, not without a few editing mistakes in this book, I found the plot of this story a real attention getter. So much in fact, I couldn't put TOH down! I have since finished the Lambert series in its entirety and I just loved it! I think Ms. Murray is a diamond in the rough in the literary world. Her ability to build both suspense for the mystery lover as well as erotic sex scenes for the romantic in most readers is a gift. I will eagerly await Victoria's next novel to be released. Bravo Victoria!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why ?","review":"This is a BAD book.In EVERY respect. In one 15 page section she uses the words squirm, squirmed, and squirming 11 times. During the same 15 pages her lead female character calls someone \\"mister funny man\\", mister question man\\", \\"mister smart man\\", \\"mister fashion man\\", \\"mister chef man \\", \\"mister attorney man\\", and \\"bucko\\". Who talks this way ? The book never improves. Finally she just stops writing. There is no conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating read.","review":"I found it impossible to get past the numerous errors in spelling, grammer and punctuation. This book is too expensive for that. The author's dialog between characters is so repititive, making the book unbearable to read. I forced myself to finish it due to the cost. I will never read this author again. Regretfully, I purchased it after reading the glowing reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soap to lavish in,","review":"The main character in this hot new romantic murder mystery, (Nouri), reminds me of myself in a way especially how she enjoys soaking in a hot bubble bath as she writes in her journal. I, too, started writing in my \\"escape journals\\" while I was in college, of course, my life doesn't come close to Nouri Sommers in other ways, many other ways but when I read how Nouri secretly enjoys soaking in bubbles up to her neck, sipping on wine, and writing about the romance she so craves, I had to chuckle. My first thought was oh, my god...Nouri and I have a lot in common, hahaha... Anyway, I was pulled into this fancy soap right from the start and ended up staying for the long haul of the three remaining books in the Lambert series. This story gave me a ton of pleasure and I discovered a fine new writer that I enjoy in the process. I'll look forward to more books by this writer in the future. I can see why so many quickly become a fan of this fun writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"Thief of Hearts is the first in a four book series by Victoria Taylor Murray. The Lambert series holds a cast of thirty-five exciting characters. Some of which you will love and some you will love hating. Thief of Hearts, introduces about seven or eight of the main characters in this on-going soap-type read. Forget days of Our Lives. Forget General Hospital. As they have nothing on this series! A series that slowly unfolds as the four books connect. I was drawn into the early plot after reading just the first book and was held like a prisioner until after I had finished the last page of the last book, Le Fin. I can hardly wait for this writer to come out with a new series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING START TO THIS AMAZINGLY FUN SERIES !!","review":"It has been years since I have had so much fun reading a romantic drama like the Lambert series!I was drawn into the storyline from the first page and as I finished each book in the series I found myself anxiously waiting for the next book to arrive in my post office box.As the reader gets to know each character they learn to care about them at least enough to want to know how it all turns out.I finished reading all four books in about three weeks and what a fun three weeks it was.I like the writing syle of this new writer and will waiting for more of her books to hit the bookstores!High Recommendation for The Lambert Series !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new writer I look forward to reading more of!","review":"Victoria Murray has become a writer that I look forward to reading more of.

I absolutely loved the characters. I found them easy to care about and I thought the way the writer slowly introduced them into the 4 book connecting plot was a unique one. The dialogue was for the most part fun and lively, and the plot (all 4 connecting plots) had me glued in spot happily flipping away, dying to know what was going to happen to poor Nouri Sommers next! The final ending was wonderful and as promised by this writer anything but predictable. The Lambert Series by Victoria Murray may not be for everyone but it certainly hit the right cords with me! Excellent Story Mate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fantasy!","review":"TOH by entertaining writer, VTM, was a fun start to what will surely be a fun soap. Tons of characters to love and dislike and the slow unfolding of the on-going plot had me glued in front of my fireplace reading as fast as I could. I was so into this story I wasn't ready for this book to end but it did and now all I have to do is place an order for the next in the series. I'm into the Lambert series for the long haul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Thrilling","review":"I've begun Victoria Taylor Murray's four-book LAMBERT series and I must admit that if Thief of Hearts is a clear indication of what remains to be read, then I see what everyone is talking about regarding Ms. Murray's formidable talent as a storyteller. What a colorfully rich imagination! The wide assortment of characters are fully enough to seduce even the most jaded reader already accustomed to scandalous behavior and human reprehensiveness. This is indeed splendid reading. Very Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please heed the warnings!","review":"I realize I am repeating what the other 1-star reviewers have said, but it hurts me to think of someone spending good money on this trainwreck of a book. Yes, it really is as bad as they say. I knew I was in for a rough ride when \\"hot, silky bubble bath\\" and \\"hot, silky water\\" were both used within a paragraph of each other on the very first page. Horrible spelling and punctation, elementary writing style, dialogue that sounds like it is coming out of the mouths of teenagers from the 80s, and shallow characters that are in no way endearing. It truly is the worst book I have ever read. I picked this up at half price at a UBS, but still think I got ripped off. If you choose to buy it anyway, you cannot say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"mislead","review":"I bought this book because it (or others in the series) kept showing up in people's lists as recommended. It was included in lists of mystery books that I have read and enjoyed but....it has to be one of the worst books I have ever read - hopeless!

I loved book one and know I will enjoy all the remaining books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Did Not Steal My Heart","review":"I must admit that I was let down after reading all of the other raving reviews.The book was difficult or a bit rough to read. In several areas there were typos or just no direction and as a result I had a hard time determining whether it was a narration or a character speaking. Plus there were a couple of areas that just did not flow real well. It was like the author was jumping around or lost focus about what she was writting about. The plot was good and had great potential and there was a deal of suspense but unfortunatly the hard spots made it difficult to follow. If you are willing to overlook these items then by all means purchase the book. This author has potential and I hope that she lives up to this potential in the following books."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Thrilling Debut Novel\\"","review":"\\"Thief of Hearts,\\" by Victoria Taylor Murray, has a realistic feel capturing the essence of what a real island paradise should be.

My husband (a doctor) is on call at a local hospital during all hours of the night, twenty-four-seven, year round, and on the nights that he has to get out of bed, get dressed, and leave me, I grab myself a book that I know I can get lost in, (to keep me company until he returns.)

They're fab!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder & Mayhem On A Resort Island!","review":"I throughly enjoyed book 1 of the Lambert seres by V.T. Murray. Mainstream romantic mystery combining passion and intrigue. The story kept me flipping through the pages as I got to know more and more about Nouri Sommers and other characters in the story. I was a little disappointed that the book ended so fast but that's okay I went ahead and ordered the remaining 3 in the series. I have now read all 4 books and would like to say I had a fun time of it and I highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind soap opera!","review":"The first of four in the Lambert series and I am hooked!

But after watching Amy Bento's latest dvd, \\"All Cardio-Hi-Lo Knockout\\" a few more times, I finally gave up and called it a day. This dvd was just too confusing for me. While I did work up a sweat, I was too frustruated after surviving all of the complex choreography to appreciate it. Heck, I was trying so hard to keep up with Bento and company's movements that I barely noticed the allegedly good background music mentioned by so many other reviewers! I recommend this dvd only to those with lots of time, patience, and living room space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense workout","review":"This workout is only for people who are at an intermediate or advanced level. It is an awesome workout. The music is great and the moves are fun. She goes quick when learning the new routines, so you have to rewind and keep trying until you get it. I would suggest watching your heart rate through the workout and make sure it does not get too high. I noticed that would happen to me and I would just need to take out the arm movements or do an alternative movement that is lower impact. The more I do this workout, I am able to keep up more and more. I would say this for all of her high impact workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Crazy!!","review":"I put this dvd in an shut if off within less than 5 mins. I thought this would be a great workout because of all the positive reviews. I was shocked after the first couple seconds that this workout actually had as many great reviews as it does. I have worked out for 12 yrs. using dvds or videos. This is the 1st one I tossed in the trash. I like Amy...she's very nice. However, this is way too fast and crazy. No way to focus on getting a great workout due to the fact that you have to figure out every move they are doing on your own with no modificaton of any kind. It's so fast you can't concentrate. Sorry, but this was officailly the worst excercise dvd I have ever purchased. Thankful that I bought it used!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Giants Monopoly","review":"We bought this game for our 5-year old son who recently realized he LOVES the game Monopoly.

Each of the ten stories approaches a different aspect of love and/or sex and all the protagonists are teens. The first story is about a girl who wants to wait until marriage for sex -- which may put off teens from reading the other stories which are MUCH more focused on sex itself. As the parent of a teen, I squirmed at much of the material -- graphic and lurid at times (which should keep the teens' attention) but all of which will let each reader know that he/she is not alone in concerns about sex and relationships. Various types of attractions are covered including homosexual and inter-racial. Because each story is written by a different author, each has a different flavor and style. My favorite is a spooky, scf-fi type of allegory about control. All are well written with well drawn characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Trash","review":"I work with high school students and I purchased this book because I was told it was made available to the students in their school for sex ed and was controversial. I wanted to see what the big deal was for myself and let me tell you this book is absolute trash. Not all of the stories are bad but there are at least 2 that read like pornography. It is a shame that we live in a world where our public school system is trying to indoctrinate them into an Epicurean worldview. The left screams tolerance except when it deals with being a somewhat moral and decent human being. This book belongs in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, Undubbed, Unlikable","review":"Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.Anyway on to the facts- DVD contains 4 episodes- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs- No English dubAnd lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!

In addition to this \\"less than sleek look\\", the device functioned in a very spasmatic fashion leaving me to think I must be developing MS.I mean seriously, who does Microsoft think they are putting out this level of crap and expecting people to buy it at such an outstanding price?

Microsoft has used their integration with the operating system to make the Bluetooth driver installation PERMANENT, the only way to remove it is to reinstall the operating system, which will require the reinstallation of *ALL* software on the computer. This will prevent the use of other companies' drivers and hence, the other companies' products.If you are comfortable using only Microsoft and Microsoft-compatible products for the rest of your computer's life, then this will not pose a problem for you.

The mouse came with a little Bluetooth dongle for the USB port, but I figured, \\"Hey, it's Bluetooth, that's a standard, it'll work\\". Turns out that this mouse's implimentation of Bluetooth is totally proprietery and it can only work with it's paired dongle. Heck, I can buy a proprietary wireless mouse from Targus or whoever for far less money, the point of Bluetooth is compatability.I returned it for a refund after the Microsoft support team confirmed that indeed it would not work, and was only compatable with it's proprietary \\"Bluetooth\\"-ish interface dongle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Mouse - DO NOT BUY IT","review":"I hate this mouse.

They had me uninstall the drivers - that didn't work. Two days of trial and error without success. I ended performing a clean install of XP, to finally get it to work.It also goes through a set of batteries every 2 weeks. My wife's logitech mouse goes 3 months without needing new batteries.The moulse also don't have drivers for Mac OSX, which means the multiple buttons don't work.

Well, that may be the case, but now I have the annoying task of always keeping a second set of batteries and having to remove and install batteries. What were they thinking? Every product should have an off button ... I guess they were counting on their power management system, which causes the mouse to hibernate to save power, but this just causes a serious delay in waking the mouse up.I was very disappointed with these features and the slow response of the mouse. If you are used to a quick response from a wired mouse, this product will certainly cause you to gain a certain level of patience for your mouse activities.Someone please tell me of a better product that is more traveler friendly and doesn't cost an arm and a leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been using this mouse for 4 months so far and great.","review":"I bought this mouse before Christmas off ebay NIB for less then 40.00 and love it.

Took 1 minute and all worked fine. Actually had both mice working and both blue tooth adaptors work also. I haven't tried synching my T616 phone to the PC using the MS BT Adaptor, but the phone recognizes the orginal BT adaptor with no troubles. I love the form but it does suck the batteries. I spend 6+ hours a day using it and go thru batteries every 3 weeks. I will be investing in some rechargables soon. I wouldn't have spent more then 60.00 for the mouse, but for under 40 NIB, it's a great deal.

After the initial shock (\\"Why the heck would you give me a computer mouse for Christmas???\\") I found that enjoyed having an ergonomic mouse and the extra buttons, and since it's wireless it was a lot more convenient than my old PS/2 mouse with its cord that never quite reached the right-hand side of my desk.However, this thing really goes through batteries. I finally got a package of 4 NiMH batteries and a charger because I was going through the alkaline batteries so fast. Because of the frequent battery changes, I am concerned that one day the battery compartment door or the contacts inside are just going to give out me. And that old PS/2 mouse?

Takes a moment to wake up sometimes if you haven't used it in a while, but not a problem. The one problem is that the mouse is sold only with a BlueTooth USB adapter (and a really complicated one) which I don't need.

With any bluetooth receiver installed on your computer, you should be able to \\"discover\\" the mouse under My Bluetooth Places, pair the mouse, and enjoy.

Both are legitimate uses of the words; the student should be able to recognize and (by upper levels) understand what the similarities are in the usages. Truthfully, most students are more likely to need the non-mathematical usage in everyday life later on. But it does sound contrived.

Our family has adopted four children over the recent years, all in separate adoptions, and I can tell you for a fact that the author is way off base in some of her claims.

The trombone section sounded off key with every one trying to lead. This was a signature of the band and, I am afraid it missed the mark. Now, I know why there was no Ghost Band after his death."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Kenton band!","review":"This is the Kenton Alumni Band and others from a celebration and conference held on May 30 to June 2, 1991.

I have always been annoyed by rolling ball pens that have ink pile up at the tip so you have to 'wipe' it ,but this one does that from time to time. Relatively expensive nice looking pen that doesn't act like it.Sort of like this: you are used to driving an audi and bought a kia, because it looked almost like the audi and they said it performs just like the audi. well, it does not perform like an audi. it only looks like one on tv :)Money saving tip: save your money until you can buy the audi: Montblanc. The 'maybe just good enough ' is just not good enough. Cheap pens do the same thing and don't cost as much. Did I just say that - yes, I did. So that is the best description of this pen.

I made a detailed comparison of the issue index with the author and poet index and found several hundred discrepancies between these lists including total omissions, different names, different titles, etc. This goes beyond leaving differences to determine if someone is taking the contents illegally. This is a significant lack of quality. If corrected, this would be a valuable reference. As it is, it is seriously flawed. but still worthwhile. However, the errors are not as innocuous as the authors would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for short trips","review":"The Lowepro Slingshot 200 is much better than most shoulder bags. It is pretty secure and allows more movement of the arms. Because of the side opening the camera is pretty easily accessible.I use this pack to hold my Canon 40D with a 28-135mm and the 15mm fisheye. I also keep a point-and-shoot with a small tripod and a waterproof case in the pack. With all that, I still have room for two more lenses.Traveling with the Lowepro Slingshot 200 is OK for short trips. Wearing the pack for long periods can really hurt your back because of the uneven load. The pack can not be worn comfortably on the left shoulder, so you may end up carrying the pack in your hand, or leaving it at the hotel after a few days.Overall, I think it is probably much better than a standard shoulder bag, but possibly a little worse than a regular photo-backpack because of the back pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical and good size","review":"I love this bag. It's very comfortable to carry and you can get the camera easily while keeping the bag on your shoulder. I got this size because my 300mm zoom lense did not fit in the smaller version of the bag. I was afraid it's going to be too big, but it looks like a small backpack and is just perfect.My previous bag was a normal square camera bag, but it was very uncomfortable to carry and you always had to put it down to get the camera out. Also, it was obviously a camera bag which I was worried about when travelling, in regards to security.This one looks just like a small backpack and it's easy to get the camera out without the need of showing all the rest of your equipment. I will definitely take this with me when travelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size, great fit","review":"I LOVE my Lowepro slingshot bag. I've had it for over a year now and I still love it. It holds my gear well (I'm a advanced beginner so I have some but not tons.) It's a good weight and it fits comfortably. I'm female but not petite and I find that this bag fits me well when I carry it. I love the option to just throw it over my shoulder or to use it as a sling.The one drawback I can see is it not having a laptop compartment. I don't carry one with me, but if you do, this is not the bag for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hiking","review":"I enjoy nature photography, but ended up leaving a lot of gear behind because it was so inconvenient to carry it using my traditional camera bag. The Slingshot 200 is a clever solution to this problem. It allows both hands to be free when walking and distributes the weight of your gear nicely. The bag slides to your front for easy access when needed and holds a lot of stuff securely. Quality is outstanding. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward for this Lefty","review":"Keep in mind here, that I do not, nor have I ever owned this bag. I'm sure it is a great bag, but as a left - handed person it felt very awkward to have the sling going that way. I was all set to buy it after reading reviews online, but if you are a lefty, I would suggest you try one on before you buy it (check at Costco, they had a bunch when I was there recently). I am probably going to buy the Kata KT D-3N1 bag instead because that one can sling either way or you can wear it as a backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bag","review":"This is a great camera bag with plenty of room and protection for your expensive equipment. Comfortable to carry. Simple to 'sling around' when you want to get your camera out for a shot or two, and then put it back away.

The storage is equal to smaller less expensive bags, the all weather cover is sewn wrong and has a big hole on one side because of the defect. The clips slide on the straps so I have to frequently readjust them. The balance is also poor, no matter how you load it, you have to set it on its' side. It won't stand upright.

The rainfly also packs away easily - a feature not to be underestimated.The sling action of this bag made it easy to access the camera and it's contents in a matter of seconds: flash, spare media cards, lens cleaners, etc.. The secondary click-in strap held the pack firmly in place while hiking and sailing across zip lines.The only thing I would like to see added is some accessory loops on the back to attach a tripod, water bottle, etc., but these can be rigged with a little creativity.This bag is meant to travel and appears as though it will be with me for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for a man","review":"I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.

It's a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BAG FOR NON PROFESSIONAL USE","review":"This bag is fantastic. I have seen some people that said that it did not fit well on men. I am 6' tall and had no problems with the bag. It is the most comfortable bag that I have ever had. It's size may be smaller than a professional photographer might need, However, if you do not carry more than two or three additional lenses, a few memory cards. a few filters, and spare batteries this case is more than sufficient. A larger case would be more awkward to carry and not as well balanced. However I could see that a similar case one size larger could be useful for some people. The instructions are poor with the bag and you need to play with it to get it to fit correctly. Also the weatherproof bag is hidden in a velcro pouch at the bottom of the bag. This is not mentioned or shown in the instructions.Great bag for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea in principle, but...","review":"I bought the Slingshot 200 thinking that it would be great to carry much of my stuff over my shoulder and be able to pull the bag in front of me for quick and easy access to another lens or a special filter or a replacement battery or media. In practice, I was stuck with carrying that weight on one shoulder even with adjustments with no possibility of relief without taking the right-shoulder pack off and tugging it around with the carry strap. It really is my fault (caveat emptor) for not thinking this purchase through. I'll probably sell it on ebay to someone who has a better right shoulder! I cannot fault the quality of the construction; it is superb. I will replace it with a backpack that allows me to use both shoulders and my hips for support. Does Amazon guaranty satisfaction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Access & Good Protection for 1 DSLR","review":"I purchased this to use at a wedding.

I ordered the Quantaray U100 Pro but returned it because it was so heavy, even with nothing in it. The Slingshot 200 was my second choice and I am very pleased. It is a larger version of the 100, and fills my needs perfectly. It's easy to pack in, and is half the weight of the Quantaray. Construction is adequate and I can get to my camera in a flash with the design of the slingshot system. Plus, you can pull out the waterproof coating from the bottom and cover the entire pack in a rainstorm so the pack & contents are protected. It has adequate storage in three places (2 are pouches with zippers). It is pretty much as advertised. Oh, and I now use the old 100 for my Canon S5 super zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't like this bag, sorry...","review":"Well, I know everyone seems to love this bag, and I bought it based on those reviews, but I really just don't like it... I got it along with my new Nikon D300 (which I adore!!!), and I mostly work in the field in Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia. The reviews implied that you could wear this and get to the camera quick - a major plus for me; but...... I have a real problem with the design -- if you DO attempt to unzip the bag quick, and grab your equipment, you have to be realllllyyy careful -- the camera will fall out! What the heck? No, I'm not wearing it upside down. It's just a funny design, and I pray I don't lose equipment because of it, but I'll be looking for a different bag ASAP.

There was enough room left to squeeze in a 17-55 lens, SB-600 Flash and assorted memory cards and batteries.Quality is pretty good but the zippers seem like they might not hold up under the abuse they'd see with my use. I ride an off road motorcycle to locations where I shoot race photos.The deal breaker for me was after putting the Backpack on loaded with gear it just didn't seem balanced.

This way you'll protect your camera from rough handling, and you'll have room for a book etc.* Comfortable to carry.* Customizable interior.CONS:* Nice and firm when it's new, but goes a little soft after a while.* Not perfect for all purposes.

I wore it for 6 hours and felt my right arm going to sleep a little -- granted mine is fully packed with the gear mentioned above. The second strap does relieve some of the weight distribution off the primary strap.Summary: Perfect for the city and short hikes; much faster and easier to work with than a backpack. But beware if you plan to wear it hiking all day it would probably be better to get a backpack where the weight is better distributed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"Great for the photographer with an itchy trigger finger.

If I had a lens hood, however it wouldn't fit, but I use a cheap flexible rubber hood that can fold back, so it works just fine. I really had to fill the compartments in the main bag area though, it is not quite solid enough to support the camera without other solid things to support the velcro sections.

Other characters that you never though had much importance suddenly popped out, tying in events from the previous Fowl book.Another good thing about this book where the characters:Holly, who messed up a little more then you'd like in the first, was back on her toes, thought not a Mary-Sue.

I feel that Eoin Colfer didn't create as much action, wit, or drama as he did in the first book. In this book you see from the eyes of a fairy and a boy mastermind. The plot of this story is complex but basically is based on the fact that a Russian Mafiya has Artemises father, and Opal Koboi is trying to take over the fairy world and eventually the WHOLE world.

This book is nothing like the first one: there is no plot here. Do not let the back cover mislead you; this book isn't about Artemis searching for his father. In fact, he does little to even look for him until the last chapter. Another plot is introduced about a quarter of the way into the book--a plot Artemis shouldn't even care about. The character of Artemis has changed, too. He is weaker, and has a simpler mind. There are typos, point of view issues, and other mistakes in \\"The Arctic Incident.\\" Quite frankly, I'm surprised Miramax even published this book for Eoin Colfer.

I liked the hero being a villain instead of another snotty hero boy (i.e. Harry Potter).The Arctic Incident however, was a real dissapointment. Artemis was the usual \\"good guy\\", there were the usual power-crazed bad guy in search for revenge, and Artemis didn't even come up with any spectacular plans.

The book Artemis Fowl, The Arctic Incident by Eoin Colfer is a good book. It is very action packed and had a great setting! The plot is when the main character, Artemis, is emailed by a man who was kidnapped by the Russian mafia. Artemis meets many familiar characters from other novels, like former Nemesis Holly Short. I thought this book was cool! It reminds me of The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan. Both books involve magic, children and Artemis. My favorite part was an exciting battle with magical creatures. There was also a great chase scene. If you read this imagine that you're in the book. You will have to get used to books like this. It is short and makes a lot of sense.

This book is almost as good as the first. I never really cared for Holly, and this book didn't make me like her any more. But just when I thought Artemis was getting soft on me, he bounced back which redeemed the book in my eyes. It's worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The feelings of a child","review":"This was another excellent book by Eoin Colfer. I have read his first Artemis Fowl book and it completely changed the way I felt about all of the characters in the book. I am 13, and as it is a childrens book, I don't think any adult can give this a bad judgement. I finished it after 3 days which isn't my fastest but one of them, it was a thrilling story line and I rushed through it. I saw the more vunerable and kind side of Artemis, the protective brotherly/fatherly response of Butler and the charm and courage of Root, Holly and Foaly.In reply to another review that I read, this book cannot be compared to Harry Potter books. Harry Potter uses the traditional and educational view of fantasy and fictional tales of old, where as this shows the world turned upside down by a modernized superior secret underground. I give this 5/5 because that is what it deserves after the feeling I had once finished it. Thank you Eoin Colfer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble","review":"Lep is being taken over by Opal Koboi.

Having said that, both kids that read the book loved them and were eagerly awaiting the sequel. The squel definitely was not as well written as the first (but that's an adult point of view and my friend's kids didn't really think so....), and Colfer must have read some of his reviews, because he did seem to put more effort into include more positive themes for the kids, which is good.

It was cool because Artemis was an evil twisted little boy. He was different from other characters. He didn't follow the tired old \\"bad guy turns good in the end\\" formula, he was bad and stayed bad. There was no shame in his badness, he was just bad... Which gave the book a very intense effect, and made it daring and interesting.Apparently for this new book, the author HUGELY chickened out. Artemis all of a sudden has \\"feelings...\\" He does the shy little \\"oh, I'm sorry poor little fairy people... sniff sniff...\\" thing. Plus he and Holly keep having these MOMENTS.

Unlike the first book, there is a lot more character development as you get a better look at the characters from the first book. The largest development comes from Artemis Fowl, who, it turns out, actually does have a heart!!! I must admit, that while I did enjoy the first book, the coldness of the main character really left a bad taste in my mouth. That was resolved in this book. I'm really looking forward to picking up the third book sometime.This book is recommended for kids of all ages... but read the first book first because there is a lot of character interaction that you need to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl Eternity Code","review":"Eion Colfer came out with his latest fantasy book, Artemis Fowl, Eternity Code the third book he made.In this book Artemis Fowl's father was held captive by Mafia for two years, and his father said that he should not commit any crimes. But, Artemis Fowl want to commit one more crime. He created a computer that can do fairy magic that was stolen with fairy technology fifty years before it was even made! It was called C cube. But a character named John Spiro made a trap, stole the computer, and killed a character named Butler. Artemis's, only hope is to make fairy magic for his friend Captain Holly of the fairy police.In conclusion, this book is very good for ages 10-13.

In this book, it changes from the first one because they were enemies in the first one. In this one, they respect each others power and work together to solve both problems that Artemis and the Fairy group have. This book made me want to read the next book in the series because I wanted to find out what happened next.

I can imagine that Metheny and Mays smiled when they listened to this disc. I saw The Pat Metheny Group live two years ago and they blew me away. I have been a fan of his since the Pastorious recordings, and he keeps getting better and better. This CD takes his music to another level. Let's pray that Mr. Curnow will round up the big band in 2000 and do a follow-up recording of Pat's more recent work.

Letter From Home, which was always my favourite ballad from the original album, has absolutely no feeling in it. It seemed straightforward, and very dead, missing all the emotion Mays put into it.Overall great arrangements by Curnow, and with the exception of Letter From Home, an Excellent CD.

One of the things that turned me off on this series was that amount of ships, planes, equipment being used up during these battles started to be so enormous that it was difficult to believe that these loses would not have effected each side's ability to continue. In short read this at the library before you spend your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Tribute for our beloved Grover!!","review":"I must say I was very impressed with this CD. I was curious to see how others could play great classics such as: Lorans Dance,Mr. Magic, and East River Drive just to name a few. I was very pleased especially with Russ Freeman on East River Drive. All of the musicians did a spendid job paying homage to an unforgettable musician, Mr Grover Washington, Jr.I highly recommend this CD. Great Job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy tribute album","review":"When you have a talented musician/songwriter like Grover Washington, Jr., any tribute album is bound to be listenable. One that attracts the brightest lights of contemporary jazz is essential. The all-star cast chooses some of the more familiar of works, including Regina Belle doing a solid version of the crossover pop hit \\"Just the Two of Us.\\" Saxophonists Dave Koz, Gerald Albright, & Jay Beckenstein (among others) do credible versions of other hits, but still don't quite match Washington's level. More interesting is Russ Freeman's rendition of \\"East River Drive,\\" just to hear the song interpretered on guitar, and the 8-minute plus jam of \\"Loran's Dance\\" is a great closer. And for those who this is an intro to Washington's work, go out and pick up a copy of \\"Winelight.\\" You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED BOOK","review":"IT WAS WAY PAST THE DEADLINE FOR ME TO RECEIVE ITEM..

It covers the varied expeditions on the quest for the Northwest Passage. Lots of people lost their lives and ultimately it was not, of course, a really usable shipping route.The Franklin expedition and the various search parties is well covered. The one existing daguerotype of Franklin, which I had not seen, is included, as are the recent discoveries and theories about what happened.At a bargain price, this is a nice gift book.

Chapter two covers this and the rest of the book will put you to sleep. He's long winded, add small type and over 350 pages... it was a struggle to finish.Much of it could have been left out. 50 pages are a review and comments of past years portfolios. Another chapter is on his pet peeves, one on funds, one defending use margin and one on Tech analysis (he doesn't use it for individual issues, but he looks at a few general market indicators to guage risk and overbought levels in the market). Except for a chapter 9 analysis of Ford, there isn't much about selection besides chapter 2.His returns were made using full margin. His best contibution it to say don't be too rigid on the numbers, be flexible. Usually stocks will be undervalued on a couple measures but not all of them.

Ms. DeGroot starts off with a plot about a murder then immediately switches to chapter after chapter on sex. She told me more about sex than she did about the reason for the murder. She fails to develop her characters adequately so that you feel absolutely no concern or interest in them. At the end of the book, I couldn't decide why I had even bothered to read it!

The print quality seemed to me to be pretty much standard for mid-range inkjets. Black text appears dark and crisp, and basic colors on the Better or Best settings are comparable to HP deskjet series printers. I haven't yet tried photos on photo paper, but on plain paper they are passable. The biggest drawback is the cost of cartridges from Lexmark, at $30+ for each (black and color). The color cartridge seems to drain pretty quickly, but the black one, if mostly text is printed out, lasted me over 600 pages, which is not bad. All in all, a very solid buy for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Printer","review":"This is my 3rd Lexmark printer. All lexmark printers that I have owned have been wonderful.

The gems have a rich depth of color and the gold complements the stones well. My problem with these earrings is that of workmanship. The first (and only) time I tried to wear these, one of the posts broke off. I pulled (gently) the back off the post to put them on and the post snapped off at the earring. I haven't been able to wear them at all. I wanted to return these but can't because I have misplaced the receipt.

Somewhere between the author's hyperbole and self-aggrandizing speech, I looked for a tidbit or two of useful, instructional information but found none. In short, McGivern comes across as a blowhard, one who has nothing to offer the reader in terms of advice on shooting. Skip this book---your time would be better spent on the shooting range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult reading, but absolutely worth the effort.","review":"This is one of the greatest books on revolver shooting ever written. The use of run-on sentences and the redundancy make for difficult reading, but Mr. McGivern discusses every last minute detail with respect to equipment and technique. Jerry Miculek may be as fast on man targets, but McGivern's aerial target shooting, hip shooting ability and fanning of the Colt SAA make him the undisputed king. Long live the revolver, and long live the memory of Ed McGivern."},{"rating":"2","title":"never out of date","review":"I first read Fast and fancy revolver Shooting in 1973.

But this by no means says that \\"Delay\\" isn't a worthwhile listen for those into Can's sound, or even those into a lot of what's going on in rock right now. Tracks like 'Butterfly' and 'Uphill' have the same amazing Velvet Underground-ish noise feel of subsequent efforts, and this also includes the trippy beat-poet rant 'Little Star of Bethlehem'. Malcolm Mooney's in fine, crazed form throughout, the only flaw being the general roughness of the release."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Can","review":"Delay is a fantastic album, that, despite being made in 1968, still retains its awe-inspiring, garage-punk intensity. This album features Malcom Mooney as singer, who grabes hold of every song with a crazed determination to hold the listener's focus. As such, it is much more a \\"malcolm Mooney\\" album than \\"Can\\" album. While later Can singer Damo Suzuki was a much more subtle singer, leaving space for the band to improvise, Mooney aims straight for the jugular, comming on like a rabid schizophrenic needing your attention. Personally, I like Mooney more than Suzuki, although conventional wisdom says otherwise. Delay is a fine intro to Can. While some of their other albums are more esoteric, this album is pretty accessible. If you like punk, you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ApproachinG....","review":"this is rough around the edges, sure....but there are some real worthy gems on here. this disc is worth the price for \\"Thief\\", \\"Little Star of Bethlehem\\", and the remarkable \\"Pnoom.\\" certainly not a good starting point for those curious about CAN. but a great little footnote in their history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

However, in addition to being much too long and drawn out, the actual story is rather uninspired and pedestrian. Also, significant portions of the book take place inside the computer system, in a sort of V.R. construct. However, the descriptions of the action taking place there are largely meaningless, being concrete descriptions of abstract concepts. The same is true of the scenes of the Ell \\"bindings,\\" which were full of meaningless, albeit poetic, descriptions of telepathic communication.There are a host of other faults in the storytelling, which I don't care to get into, but suffice it to say that this book is simply not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic story","review":"I picked it up used and was glad that I didn't pay for it!

While it provides useful background and some updated examples, Kennedy weaves it in seemlessly into the old material. What you get is confusion. The first person of Kennedy is mixed in with the first person of Maltz, without being differentiated in any way! So in the same section, you have someone speaking of \\"my patients\\" in the '40's or '50's, and then the same voice speaking of \\"my experiences\\" with a Kevin Costner movie or a Michael Jordan anecdote. There is no change in typeface, or paragraph structure to indicate that different people are writing, one long-dead, the other alive and \\"editing\\" this book.

I bought the new psycho-cybernetics and am greatly disappointed with it. It tries to be too much, almost like they've tried to add several unrelated \\"books\\" of unrelated info to psycho-cybernetics. There are stories and additional paragraphs of information that you're not quite sure what to do with and it clouds the original ideas. Anyone can make a book longer with lots of extra info but a nicely summarized and boiled down series of thoughts is difficult to do so get the original because that's what it is; I just ordered the original again and will leave this \\"updated\\" copy in the hotel I'm staying in right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with the original","review":"I think you really have to question the liberties Mr. Kennedy has taken with Maltz's original material and words.

The \\"secret\\" that Davis reveals is FOCUS. According to Davis, too many messages try to cover too much ground at the same time. To achieve focus, Davis has designed a process he calls \\"S.C.O.R.R.E.\\", through which he helps the communicator narrow things down and acheive a clear-cut focus in his/her message.Davis also includes a few chapters on other aspects of public speaking, like the use of humor, lighting etc, but I found the chapters on focus to be the most rewarding.As Davis him self admits to in the book, after a while this process gets kind of intuitive, and I guess the experienced communicator won't find many new things in this book.

Dare we hope for more? I hope this sells, and people rediscover a wonderful singer who knew how to pick wonderful material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Marilyn Maye is truly marvelous!! It's a great CD. There are very few, if any, who sing as well as she does, or I should say as well as she did when she recorded the songs on the CD. She is still performing today at 81 years of age. I haven't heard her recently, but if she is 25% as good now as she is on the CD, then she is better today than most vocalists out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual activist's must-read","review":"Excellent series of interviews with still pertinent movers and shakers in the realm of spiritual activism.

This is their third full length album and their experience really shows. With touches of the sicko's, queers, and ramones you have got to love them. With lyrics that everyone can relate to, the album really touches you deeply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honoring the self","review":"I bought in April this year this book, together with Nathaniel Branden's \\"How to raise your self-esteem\\". I did not know these two authors. I read about two pages of this book and then put it in an corner.

Paul Henreid is a saboteur escaping from the Nazis via Portugal.The movie is in the original black and white, which is fine, the picture quality is good. What isn't good is the sound. There are no subtitles and at points it is almost impossible to understand everything Henreid, with his tight lips is saying. Much of the other dialogue is soft and muted then the background/mood music is loud and alarms, sirens and gunshots are earsplitting.It's difficult to appreciate a movie when the dialogue is as vague as the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service","review":"The software itself is only okay. Their customer service and technical support are nonexistent. I purchased this software about two years ago and it worked fine until recently.

As I have come to expect from reading her other books, Tina St. John does an outstanding job of putting you right there in the story with her characters. Secrets, danger, forbidden love - this book literally has it all. My heart was pounding through all the scenes of danger (not to mention all of the passionate ones!) and several times I wondered how in the world Sebastian and Zahirah would find their happy ever after. The ending had me sighing and wanting an alluring,... man like Sebastian for myself!This was a beautifully sensuous love story with a highly original plot and wonderful characters. I read it in one setting! I also loved the 2 other books that go along with BLACK LION'S BRIDE. They are WHITE LION'S LADY and LADY OF VALOR. The only trouble is I just wish Tina St. John could writer faster!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"Having enjoyed White Lion's Lady so much, I thought I would love this book, but it was like torture. The sentences were long, drawn-out, you had to read them several times to make sense out of some of them, the vocabulary and style were often wrong, her verbs were all over the place--the editor obviously did not look at some of this, and we romance readers really deserve better.the autor admits herself it took her over two years to crank the thing out. Crank it did.I never warmed to any of the characters except Logan the scot, and he was not supposed to be the hero! the stereotypes and the impetuous and not very pleasant nature of the heroine's real identity make this one a book to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric train","review":"Received it fast and packaged well.

She is a local author","review":"So I really loved reading about her life in Silicon Valley, her engineer husband and her days in Los Gatos. I am so happy I found this book. It is about grief, but a totally different spin on it and in a way it was VERY uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"Good Grief is an excellant book, which I have read at least five times. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are feeling a bit down. It doesn't matter if you cannot directly relate the main character's loss of her husband, because whatever you are going through, this will surely help cheer you up. I always feel optomistic when I finish reading this book, because you see the process in which the main character climbs out of her pit of sadness. It reminds me that nothing is too unbearable to deal with, even if it seems so at first.This book is an easy and fast read. Plus it came out in paperback, so it doesn't cost too much money to purchase. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life at the Speed of Light","review":"The opening chapters of Good Grief had me laughing to myself as Sophie Stanton, our protagoniste, tried getting through life after her husband's death. Touching and humorous, I held high hopes for the ensuing 200 pages.However, this proved to be a typical chick lit offering--tragedy, followed by meeting various zany characters, culminating in Sophie's life being wrapped up in shiny paper and tied in a tidy bow. Not only does she accomplish everything she never knew she wanted to do, she does it all in one year. Yes, roughly 365 days after her beloved husband's death she has the total 'new life' package.If you want a sticky sweet toss-away, go ahead and buy it. The author's ability to generate chuckles in the opening chapters earned it two stars. Otherwise, I would have had to demote it to one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"Good grief is about loss, pain, laughter and finally the road to healing. I am in the second year of being widowed and I felt as though Lolly Winston had read my diary. I laughed, cried and felt hope as I was reading this book.An excellent novel about a subject that most authors can't relate to. Thank you Lolly Winston for the gift of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grief","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I was apprehensive about reading it because of the premise -- I don't like \\"sad\\" books. However this book was not sad. It was uplifting without being the least bit sappy. Lolly Winston is a fantastic author. Her word usage is so perfect! I loved everything about Good Grief. I applaud this book. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grief=Good Read","review":"Good Grief is the perfect book to take with you to the beach this summer. Why? Because it's well-written chick lit with a twist chick lit that will actually make you smile, and sometimes even laugh out loud. Sophie Stanton, the charming narrator of this novel is 36 and recently widowed. Let me warn you, the first several chapters of this novel, while well-written and gently humorous, are sort of a downer--Sophie is pretty much miserable and her life is falling apart. My advice: try to read them in one sitting and get to the more middle parts of the novel, where she starts to get her act together. You can breeze through this novel in a couple of hours. Sophie is a wonderful character--likeable, you'll want to root for her. A fun, light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, accurate and relatable story of grief","review":"Enjoyed Good Grief alot. It showed the funny, angry, unexpected, crazy and sad sides of going through grief. A very easy and relatable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"hhhh","review":"no idea, never read it, but hey it looks good anywayz ...No, just kidding. To be honest it wasn't the best book i've ever read .. try Christopher Reeve or Michael J fox, they're way better reads ... stronbgly recommend them to you all ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but a few flaws","review":"I agree with the reader who put this into the 'likable woman faces crisis category.' I enjoyed the book, but the author lost me on a couple of details. I have a mother with Alzheimer's and would never keep reminding her that her son had died (and thankfully, this is not an issue for us). For a person with AD, being reminded of a loss makes them have to go through the initial shock of grief, over and over. What is generally suggested is the 'therapeutic fib' (from our AD training class). Sophie would have been better advised to say, \\"Ethan is out of town\\" or something along those lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"Very well written and in a new and fresh way that makes me excited to read more from Lolly Winston!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Widows only...","review":"Although the author is not a widow herself she captures much of the essence of the experience of being a widow. She also introduces humor as a perspective.It may be that a 'new' widow, someone within a year of the loss of their spouse, may not be able to laugh at the humor. But as a woman well past her loss, I found much of it uproariously funny and freeing.It is not all about loss and sadness. It is also about change, movement, excitement, fear and hope.My only critique is that many women may find it unrealistic that the main character is able to accomplish so much within the first year of widowhood. That is often not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"I want to be Sophie Stanton (except for the whole husband dying of cancer part, of course.) I really thought this was a fantastic book. I am most interested in character development in books, and this book does a superb job of it. The perfect balance of interesting storyline and time with the characters. Cannot go wrong on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good to be a widow","review":"I started this book hoping for a little depth, some insight into a young widow coping with the untimely death of her husband. Sure some humor and hope are a good thing, but this is so trite and unrealisistic I wouldn't have finished it if not for it being a book group selection. Sophie Stanton tells us she's grieving her husband (and we must believe her-I mean she goes to work in her bathrobe!). However, she seems fairly happy and things seem pretty good for her. She moves to a new town, discovers a previously unknown talent with which she starts her own very successful business, rehabilitates a troubled teen, and has an incredibly good looking and kind man fall in love with her. And all within a year of her husband dying. Gosh, it's good to be a widow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching comeback story","review":"I thought this was a lovely story of handling grief and starting over. It's amazing how we find healing in the most unlikely places with the most unlikely people. At times Sophie's life seemed a comedy of errors but I thought that her story was compelling and ultimately very touching. I thought the ending was full of possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I loved this book. It has more depth and heart than your average \\"chick-lit\\" book. I'd call it Chick-Lit for the Grown-Up Reader. I was surprised at how emotionally involved with the main character I became. Reading about the pain of missing her husband made me cry, and her fears of beginning another relationship felt very real as well. I would highly recommend this book to readers of smart women's fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend to anyone.","review":"I first read this book years ago when I lost my dad to cancer and it comforted me and even made me smile during a time when smiling was just not something I thought I'd ever do again. Now years later I buy it for friends who are going through something similar. I decided it was time to read it again.She does such a great job of story telling and you will truly see the stages of grieving aren't the same for everyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grief is a Good read","review":"The story immediately captured my attention and reeled me in but somewhere in the middle...it loses me. The author used her 'best' material in the beginning (say the first half) to grab the reader then sort of leaves you floundering in the middle to end of the book going...\\"yeah, okay...now what?\\" I will pass the book along to friends and recommend it with a good not great or awesome or thought provoking just good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, not good at all!","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really wanted to. But, I didn't! The characters were interesting as was the story but towards the end of the book the tale just gets wacky and super unbelievable. It was sort of like when your favorite TV show runs out of creative direction so they add a new baby or adopt an orphan.It was an interesting story that could have been so good but the bottomline is that is just got lame with all the fighting in the bakery!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Find!!","review":"The Day I Fell Down's \\"Sweet to be Strange\\" is one of those \\"rare finds\\". It's one of those records that you just don't want to take off your CD player. It seems to me that every song just gets better and more interesting with every listening. I like records like that! The Day I Fell features two distictive and talented singer songwriters: Guitarist, vocalist Robert Dan and Bassist vocalist Bradley Hooper And yes a very good drummer... While I don't know or care who's singing on what song I do know that the blend of their voices together is just sublime, and like nothing I've heard!! I don't like to make comparisons but imagine The Beatles, Radiohead, The Police, a little Jeff Buckley some Sublime all blended together in a rockin, melodious unforgettable Pop circus... Every song is unique and truthfully thier own. My personal favorites seem to change on a daily basis. I like a record like that. 5 stars and kudos to The Day I Fell Down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Eubanks bow at the golfers feet...what a bore","review":"John Feinstein golf books are good because they are extremely detailed. They are not that exciting or insightful and the writing drones on, but the inside information is there. Steve Eubanks attempts this and fails miserably. Covers too many topics that have already been looked at in-depth many times. Looks at all the players covered as saints. Uses too many boring quotes. The writing is bland. If that isn't enough, he refers to Van de Velde & Sandelin as strikingly handsome. Come on, no one cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"As long as you don't mind the racism ...","review":"Decent writing. Rough language (not for those under 18) - it purports to be about the last 2 years in golf but instead of \\"that guy\\" who's won 4 out of the last 5 majors, it's 50% on the Ryder's Cup and 25% on Payne Stewart - who is fairly and honestly protrayed as beloved by his fellow golfers but as the author points out - Payne's not above a little racist humor.That's all fine - nobody's perfect but then the author proves where his money is by using a horrible, hoary racist term to describe Asians - once was not enough - he actually uses it to title a chapter! And the chapter makes almost ZERO reference to Asians - guess he just thought it was funny? Would part-Asian Tiger Woods think it's funny? Never mind there's a giant picture of Woods on the cover.He talks about golf coming into the 21st century and all the changes but the author Steve Eubanks seems to be stuck in the early 1860s'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Fredric Schultz","review":"Sheets that I ordered were supposed to be percale.

The book has stayed with me. Lines from it keep coming back, and stories flow through my mind. It probably makes no sense to call a movie book a masterpiece, but if it does make sense, this one qualifies. I don't know how men feel about the book -- I wouldn't presume to speak for them -- but women who care about their history -- and young women who are looking for examples from the past to steer them into the future -- would do well to buy this book and read it twice. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for it to get better . . .","review":"This book held my interest to a point, but I was truly disappointed. One reviewer said the author was obsessed with Norma Shearer. I found him to be obsessed with Greta Garbo. If I had to read one more passage about Garbo's indescribable beauty I would have thrown the book at the wall. I love all the films of the thirties,and Shearer was a favorite, but I found this book tedious. It did not deliver for me. Sex and power in pre-code Hollywood and not one thing about Shearer's marriage to Thalberg? I found this to be a let down. Pass on this one and save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW I UNDERSTAND...","review":"Now I understand what the big fuss is about COMPLICATED WOMEN. I bought the book last week after seeing Mick LaSalle give an incredible talk on the subject at the Denver Film Festival, with film critic Leonard Maltin also in attendance. This is the most amazing story about women in film, and LaSalle's book is not only informative -- it reads like great fiction. Except it's true. I know what my friends are getting for Christmas this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very deep","review":"This book is ok if you are looking for descriptions of the plots of movies--especially Norma Shearer's. If you want anything more thoughtful--look elsewhere. The author's understanding of the code and its impact on women's roles in movies is very superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny One Note","review":"Mr. LaSalle is a zealot, not a scholar, and it shows. His obsession with Norma Shearer clouds everything he writes. He perceives that Shearer has been unfairly neglected in film history, and his attempt to redress this takes priority over any thoughtful examination of women in Pre-Code Hollywood. The plot synopses he offers are no better than anything on IMDB, his arguments on quality are poorly supported, his writing is clunky and full of redundancies, and his insights are dubious."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING AND INFORMATIVE","review":"I have been a movie goer since I was a child. I grew up in the 40s. Most of the stars Mr. LaSalle talks about in his book are favorites of mine. I found Mr. LaSalle's book fascinating and informative. It deals with certain members of societies efforts to keep women subserviant to men and not give women the freedom we are all guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I owe it all to Mick LaSalle. . .","review":"I owe my old-movie-star obsession to Mr. Mick LaSalle, author of this wonderful book. Believe it or not, I hadn't heard of women like Norma Shearer or Miriam Hopkins before I read it; Jean Harlow, Mae West, and Greta Garbo were just images, not real human beings. But after reading Complicated Women, I have to admit I went a little crazy, reading every biography of these celebrities that I could. I was fascinated especially with Harlow, who is treated so fairly in this book. (Usually, film historians write her off as a bit of a tramp.)Thanks to you, Mr. LaSalle, Norma, Claudette, Miriam, Garbo, Jean, Mae, and the rest are now a permanent part of my world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"989 Studios struggle to do it again","review":"989 took over the Twisted Metal series in order to take the Twisted Metal series to new heights, but 989 studios bored us with rubbish storylines, spoiling the current stories. 989 brings out TM4 with some fresh characters, but a lot of them resembling earlier characters, the stories are far-fetched and the endings are short and pathetic fot the hours of boring gameplay. The only good thing about this game is the awesome soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Compare With Original Twisted Metals","review":"This game is really awful compared to the first two games of the Twisted Metal franchise. When 989 took over making the TM series, it really went downhill. While this game is slightly better than TM3 (mainly because of more weapons and better courses), it still suffers from cruddy car choices and cruddy driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excelent Game","review":"I think that this Twisted Metal game is the best yet, it has many new charicters and great new levels, it is one of the best games and one of the most fun games iv played yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I purchased this game not too long ago thinking that it would be like the first two Twisted Metals. However, it is nothing like them. In this version there is no storyline to be found. It is also near impossible to kill your opponent since both of your are trying to attack each other at high speeds. Playing this game seems like some blurry vision with a lot of explosions. It can also be too complicated at times. For being such a recently developed game, the graphics did not live up to my expectations.The reason I decided to give this game two stars was because of the game music: Rob Zombie, Cirrus, Cypress Hill, Skold, Ghoulspoon, and One Minute Silence.In conclusion, save yourself the money and stick with the first two Twisted Metals. I would recommend buying Twisted Metal 2: World Tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Twisted Metal 2 is better!","review":"In this game the object is to blow up other cars. You do this by picking up items like bombs. Each car has different armor, speed, and power. I think the best thing about this game is you can create your own cars.

Anyway, good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Twisted Metal at all!","review":"This game is really horrible. It does not have the fun gameplay as the first two. The lighting is bad so you can't really see anything at all. When you get up near a corner or wall this horrible camera angle comes up and you can't see anything happening around you. Also when about 3 or more cars are really close together all you can see is a lot of explosions and about nothing else. 989 Studios should not make anymore of the Twisted Metal Series. I'm glad Twisted Metal: Black is made by the origanal makers. Don't buy this or TM3. BY TM1 or 2. I haven't played TMBlack yet but it is probably better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated by Many","review":"What is with all these high ratings for this game despite many claiming that it is only a \\"good\\" game? I will admit to only spending 15 minutes or so playing this game at Target but could easily tell that it was an improvement over TM III. Too many people seem to give a higher rating because of the soundtrack when most would be better off picking up the actual songs and albums. My actual rating would be 2 stars but I had to adjust my rating to account for all these other inflated ratings.I disagree with all those who claim this game is better than Twisted Metal 1 and Twisted Metal 2. TM1 is pretty raw but still a lot of fun to play. TM2 is arguably the pinnacle of the series with Twisted Metal: Black next on my list. To me the music in TM1 and TM2 is just as good as TM4's or better. If you want a great game from that era made by most of the creators of TM1 and TM2 (as well as TM: Black and TM: Head On), I recommend picking up Rogue Trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever","review":"Some good levels, some good cars. Mostly nothing special, though. If you want a good Twisted Metal game, look elsewhere in teh series.

I can honestly say this series is the best car combat series ever made. While TM 1-2 were slightly different from 3 and 4 because of the developers, 4 still provides the adrenaline rush that reminds me of the good old days. Sweet Tooth is still around of course, this time not a playable character, but as the 'Wishmaster\\" and final boss. The graphics are alright, but lack in the multiplayer department. The soundtrack is good, and the option to play as Rob Zombie is very humorous. For any Tm fan I urge you to pick this up. If you're not willing to take the risk of bad graphics and a new developer, wait for Twister Metal Black. This new PS2 game promises to be the best car combat game ever, and take the TM series to a new dimension. This game though is very much enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets Be Serious Here","review":"Wait a minute, how can you be serious with so many explosions all over the place. 989 Studios has revived the Twisted Metal name with this one. I was not pleased with Twisted III and was very skeptical about the release of 4, especially since 989 was still a part of it. They have fully redeemed themselves, now 4 offers packed action, a nice mix of weaponry, diverse levels, computer allies, create a car, and of course total chaos. If you enjoyed Twisted 2, you will probably LOVE Twisted 4. The music, the levels, and the use of memory card, have really enhanced this title. Let's hope the series continues! Bottom line: Great car combat action that is well worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to my beloved TM series?","review":"Wow! thats all i can say. This game should not have the twisted metal name on it. Im not saying that its a totally bad game, its just not a good twisted metal game. There are some features that are its saving grace, like creating your own car, but theres not much depth to it. I liked the ability to play as calypso, but what the hell did they do to sweet tooth! Its just a pathetic attempt to put a fresh new spin on a series staple. I cant recommend this game to anyone but the true TM hardcore fans. I must admit i own this game just for the sole fact that it has the TM name. P.S. i cant wait for TM for PS3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Twisted Metal 1: goodTwisted Metal 2: greatTwisted Metal 3: goodTwisted Metal 4: badAs a fan of the series I couldn't stand this game for more than 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, but with horrible camera angles.","review":"The Twisted Metal franchise was at it's best as far as innovation in the orignial Twisted Metal. TM2 added larger arena areas, but was considered to be not as good as the original. TM3 was horrid. TM4 is more of the same. I have played this game and found the camera angles to be irritating and the control unpredicable. The ability of your car to accidentally drive up a straight wall is laughable, unless you actually bought the game. For the best car combat game out there, pick up last season's Vigilante 8. There is a reason why most video game reviewers compare all car combat games to it. It was innovative and had good control and a unique system which allowed players to tell which weapons the other players had on board. Don't buy TM4 for your kid. And by all means, don't trust what the people here are saying. We sure aren't experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst playstation game ever?","review":"I bought this game with the hope that it would measure up to the usual Twisted Metal standard.

This game is NOT fun at all. All new cars, except they are all very l***. They still don't understand that bigger levels are not better! Some levels are so huge, that it takes 7 hours just to Finnish everyone off, plus they are ultra boring (The Maze is just plain miserable), atleast TM3 had some fun levels.

I thought they would have learned their mistakes from the last one.

The book is weighted towards the pre-1945 era: about one third of the book covers pre-1914 developments with much of the rest covering the two world wars. There's relatively light coverage of the Cold War and present era - less than 50 pages.Category: submarine historyTechnical content: averageOverall: excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"While he seems to have done at least a little research, the author seemed more interested in venting personal differences and stating narrow-minded opinions than in writing a good book.I was hoping to actually learn something useful.Or at least interesting.I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Could Take a While to Read! But It's Interesting","review":"This book was worth buying just to get the story of Black Flag. Fascinating to me. I knew quite a bit about them but didn't know the whole story. He tells some history about Greg Ginn and Henry Rollins and how they grew up. It really helps explain where they went musically and as artists. Azerrad must have spent a lot of time and energy working on this book. This book goes in depth. Cool to see how the old indie world evolved and weirdly culminated in the insane popularity of Nirvana.Please check out my book being a punk kid in L.A. in the early 80s:One Step Beyond: A Teenage Odyssey in 1980s Los Angeles (Volume 1)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anybody Can","review":"Terrific detail, an interesting mix of bands profiled, and one big common theme: get out there and do your thing, write some songs, find your audience, and keep playing. The chapter on Beat Happening underscores this more than any other. An acquired taste to be sure, but once I saw their name on the back cover I knew I had to own a copy of the book, to remind of the time when start-up bands and start-up labels took the music back and blew fresh life into rock. The chapters on The Minutemen and Replacements are excellent. Yes, I do remember where I was when I heard D. Boon died. Readers who enjoy this should check out the DVD about The Minutemen, \\"We Jam Econo.\\" Nice job, Michael Azerrad. Thanks for putting this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the scenes on my favorite bands","review":"Michael Azerrad exhaustively details the ins and outs of some of the greatest punk,indie, alternative bands from my youth.It reminded of me of when I was cool, and music meant a lot more to me.Replacements, Husker Du, Black Flag, Mudhoney.In a fit of nostalgia, I ended up repurchasing some of these albums on Itunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling the Truth","review":"There are only two books that truly capture the reality, theinsanity, of making it on the fringes: Azzerad's Our Band Could beYour Life for music and Ray Carney's Cassavetes on Cassavetes forfilm. The punk scene, in film and music, is brilliantly, scarilydepicted in both--the fate of garage artists who too much of theworld takes for garbage artists. The doom and the horror. Theexcitement and the craziness. Long live indie art, one thing youcan't buy or sell, even in Amerika. Long live Harmony Korine and hisdad John Cassavetes. Long live Azerrad and Carney as chroniclers ofthe real, the beyond the hype, the stuff they wouldn't dare put on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long boring slog through the underground","review":"With the exception of the Butthole Surfers, most of the band stories make for dull reading. I wasn't expecting Hammer of the Gods, but descriptions of J. Mascis squabbling with his bassist for pages on end got tedious.Most of the brand name punk/indie acts of the era are included (in other words--the usual suspects) and frankly, a lot the interviews/stories have been circulating on these folks since, well, the '80s.I'm done with the review, but if anyone cares how I would have improved the book (say, as editor), read on. A chapter on Shimmy-Disc would have been great, since that label released tons of interesting music in the '80s that stood miles apart from the contrived sounds of Sub Pop, Dischord et al. Kramer's legal hassles/personal travails and subsequent loss of both Shimmy-Disc and his recording studio would have made for interesting reading. The Bongwater album covers alone are more exciting than Sub Pop's entire catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, although it was almost a little too much","review":"A great history of punk rock from the late 1960s through the 1990s, when the grunge explosion happened. Azerrad is one of my favorite rock journalists and he doesn't disappoint with this book, although in places it almost seems to get too detailed. It's a series of essays about the backstories of the most influential indie bands - Black Flag, Fugazi, The Replacements, Mudhoney, etc. Each section is dense and this was not a \\"fast read\\" for me. I learned a lot about the history of bands I've been listening to since I was a young teenager. Great for fans of the music genre, but if you are a die-hard fan of an individual band I'm sure you would be better off reading a book just about that band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Bands you are not that familiar with.","review":"Well written but for a few of the bands I was familiar with it was not that interesting.For the bands I didn't know much about, there was something to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a book that does the 80's punk and alternative (when alternative was REALLY alternative) music justice. After reading THE CARPET FROGS by Alan Arlt, (a brilliant novel about a fictional 80's Minneapolis punk band) I wanted to read more about that time and music scene.Azerrad writing is clean and humerous, offering a snapshot of what life was like on the road. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book accurate?","review":"I picked up this book specifically because there is a chapter devoted to one of my favorite bands, Big Black. As I read the section devoted to Big Black, I was upset to find several mistakes regarding song lyrics and titles. The first was when lyrics to the song \\"Deep Six\\" are attributed to the song/title track \\"Racer X.\\" The second mistake was the song \\"Grinder\\" is referred to as \\"Grind.\\" This left me wondering how well-researched and accurate this book really is. If such simple things as double-checking lyrics and song titles slipped under the radar, what else has?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underground Punk","review":"Read this book when I was in highschool, got it from the library, but never finished it. A couple years later I decided to read it again but couldn't find it in ANY libraries. At Borders it was too expensive. Found it on Amazon, used and cheap. Recieved it within a couple days of the order, in perfect condition! The book has a lot of information, also. You get to see how the uprising of punk music started(underground punk music). Very interesting. Might get you into some new bands you never thought you'd like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Subject, Not So Great Book","review":"The birth of the indie rock movement is a very complex and commendable undertaking for the subject of a book, and for that I thank Michael Azerrad. But I was thoroughly disappointed, chapter after chapter by Azarrad's formulaic writing style and abundance of opportunities missed for deeper exploration of narrative threads other than a simple timeline.Broken up into chapters about specific bands, i was expecting (as the title infers) to get a glimpse into each band's life at a point in time. But rather than stepping inside that \\"scene\\", we are firmly planted outside, with Azarrad, as he drolly pans his \\"one size fits all\\" lens from one band to the next.I felt guilty reading this. Like i was reading a tabloid or a bio produced for an NSYNC fan club.Save your money and buy the music he's writing about instead. This is important music history, someone will do it justice soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This is one of my favorite books. All of the band profiles are amazing.

Oh well, buy it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rose colored histories","review":"So much of this book is tripe. What you get is a cut/ paste of old interviews alongside higly romantisized band biographies. Everyone talks so highly of Azerrad's writing, but that's just make-up covering a lack of substance.Its not really a bad book, I just think its a rather pointless book. Like I said, most of these interviews have been around for a decade or more, and I don't really need to hear some fan-boy gush over his man crushes with seminal 80's rock icons.'Cides, if you're into the bands, then you probably know most of this stuff already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blocks view!","review":"If you are using Canon EF-S 10-22mm, at 10mm the view is being blocked by the right and left side!

There are tons of images in the book, most seem to span his career from pencil drawings of his wife to the more familiar works like the one on the cover (which take up most of the works in the book, thank goodness.) The images are laid out with great focus, my only complaint is that some of the images aren't bigger, but then they would have to cut across the seam more.The book is big, it weighs a lot, it has mostly pictures of his works, there is only 1 picture per page (no distracting, busy design), and a small biography in the back.

You might like it.As for me, I found it very dissapointing.I could write a book on the ways the US franchise of Top Gear falls short of the Brits version (and I AM an american)or even the aussie version, but I wont. Even assuming that the US version is a 'stand alone' show that is attempting to be deliberately different and unique, it still fails.

Not very complicated that's for sure. I played it on the most difficult setting and found it to be a little too easy for most of the game. Although some of the \\"bosses\\" were pretty challenging at times. The game doesn't require you to do all that much thinking in my opinion but at random times you will have to think outside the box in order to proceed. Once you beat it you can replay the game on \\"brutal\\" setting because it becomes unlocked. Its half shooting and half hand-to-hand combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Guessed!","review":"i bought this game for 8 dollars, and was hopeful that it would at least be a little fun. within 10 minutes i was bored. i picked it up again the next day and gave it another chance. this game does have a unique weapon wielding system that is interesting for a little bit, however it gets old as you realize thats all you use to fight. every place you go in this game is EXACTLY the same thing. there is some kind of area or courtyard or large hallway that has swarms of enemies coming into it after you get close enough. OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. its the same thing. overall i dont think this game is very fun, it is not worth replaying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great game","review":"This is game is OK. It's not as fun as the other reviewers say it is. The glaive is pretty weak as a weapon. The level designs are nice and the graphics are OK. I would not really recommend this game. If you are looking for a much better game, I would highly recommend Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. I am a little disappointed with Dark Sector."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your many on Dark cheap","review":"I am a shamed to say i purchased this game, it was brilliant until after you kill 200 \\"baddies\\" using the glave it's all the same old splat and blood, only 2 or 3 close range kills that get old quick. Guns sound under powered and uninspired. I feel that i have heard better sounding guns on the Mega drive.Some of the skills you unlock for the glave are fun like shocking people with a flying glave is fun the first few times, but after that it's same old same old. Puzzles are the same one or two are difficult then they get easy.Boss fights yawn o rama just lately i am feeling that boss battles aren't challenging in most games.I am sorry if liked this game, but for what it was made out to be... just a waste of good game funds that could of been better spentNot even worth a purchase from the bargain binThanks for reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark sector","review":"I have heard from a couple of people that they didnt care for this game because they had a hard time controlling the charictor.

The graphics are good and the story is also good, Unfortunately its not my kind of game horror shooters have lost there edge with me.I'd recommend it for people who like horror games with a good story, or for people who want to give this genre a try...I mean for the price what do you have to loose?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite a few hitches, it's a great game.","review":"The story line is nothing spectacular, however gameplay is very fun. The game borrowed many ideas from other games such as the black market where you purchase weapons being very reminiscent of the merchant from Resident Evil 4. The six-axis controls on the glaive felt a lot like shooting arrows as Kai from Heavenly sword. That being said, it didn't stop the game from being fun. I just like for developers to be creative. They could have used a little more variety with the finishing close up kills. The glaive (the knife boomerang that Hayden uses) adds a nice touch to the game. Slicing the creatures and various enemies in half was quite fun. The ability to absorb electricity and fire helped to keep the glaive from getting too repetitive. Boss battles were fun and some were pretty hard. Overall the game was really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Ok i wasnt expecting a whole lot out of this game because i thought it was going to be like every other shooting game.

THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REACH STAGE BY YOURSELF, YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR RAY GUIDE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO KNOW WHERE YOU MUST GO.

May as well have made it an FPS. But then I guess you wouldn't see the dude transform. Wasn't a big fan of GOW, so maybe that's why I wasn't impressed. Incredible graphics. I just didn't like the control at all. A true 3rd person adventure is Uncharted. After playing through that game, it sets the standard. Non of this over the shoulder stuff does it for me. Coming off Uncharted to this one, I was just disappointed. Dark Sector's story is boring.Don't even spend the money renting the game. Download the demo off PSN. It's only about 5 minutes of play, but that should be enough to make a decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely underrated, worth buying","review":"The game is really good for 20 bucks, it's like Gears meets RE4. The only downside is that there seems to be no other difficulty levels but the defualt one which seems to be set to medium. I like a game to be challenging and this is not the case with this game, but it certainly has that fun factor. I'm currently on chapter 5 and the claive seems to be getting stronger as I go on, which in turn is making me unstoppable. Just to let you know I tried playing online and it seems no one plays anymore. A definite buy for $20 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I am surprised this game gets the decent reviews it does. The good first: Great graphics. The game looks stunning for what it is. It controls fairly good as well. However that is where it ends. The gameplay is utterly frustrating it takes forever to beat waves of enemies and even after you get the aftertouch for the glaive it is still an inefficient weapon. The story is essentially incoherent. There are random zombies. No explanation is given as to why zombies suddenly appear. it's as though the developers said \\"let's throw some zombies into the game just to spice it up, and let's make them really annoying\\" I gave Dark Sector a good 3 hours and just said screw it.

I found that some of the information was duplicated in other sections which is unnecessary. I was also disappointed at the lack of variety in cats used for the photos; the same cats appear on many pages. I would have liked to see a range of pictures showing the various colours and patterns. Despite these criticisms, I found the information about travelling with the cats useful and also the section about showing.

Still, as a listener, I get a bit impatient with such indulgence, which is why listening to Buckethead's music is such a pleasure for me. He'll stun you with technique, but he'll also catch your ear with his great melodies. Beyond the thrash, funk, and rock you might except from Buckethead, things gets pretty weird too. Rap?

Just noticed the sample of Robert Duvall from Sling Blade at the beginning of \\"The Ballad of Buckethead\\" \\"Ain't got no boy\\". This guy's mystique, the living in a chicken coop saga along with the tremendous chops make this a bunch a fun. It's not my usual style of tuneage, but real infectious from the git go.

Outside of one interesting drum effect (track 3 or 4) there isn't an interesting musical moment to be found here. Brian May played more exciting guitar back in 1974, people. Boring, boring, boring.

A mix of techno, rap, and guitar music. 2. (monsters) Songs like Primus with more guitar up front (these are my personal favorites). If this sound interesting to you, hurry up and buy it! If not, go buy Satriani or Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"no finer bucket...","review":"buckethead's best work is when he feels free to be himself and not obliged to consider sounding like someone else, and on this CD he is totally at his best; perhaps having claypool around does not hurt either. i have listened carefully to most of his work and this i believe is head and shoulders above the rest. one has to determine what it is they seek from an artist and in buckethead's case it is his raw fingernumbing bunkerbeat and great turnpike sound. i appreciate his ability to be very tasteful and even classical, but someone who calls himself buckethead has to consider his own invention above all else and that's what he's done on this his finest work, in my book, to date! This CD will not leave you twitching for full throttle because it's all there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckethead kicks","review":"I was blown away by Buckethead.

Great cast, very attractive (important in a romance movie). Five stars all the way.Loved the movie, kept me laughing and smiling. It's a romance, so you've got the traditional storyline, but they really present it in a refreshing way. Also a nice change of pace from the crap they make in the United States. I watched it in Hindi with English Subtitles (I hate dubbed movies) and this is definitely a movie I could see watching on a date or an anniversary, or even just with a group of friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This movie surprised me.

Widespread Panic is one of the most talented musical groups out there. In this video you will see that this Athens based musical group is one of the best. The video is great, but if you have not experienced a live show then you have not experienced the full affect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard This Cast at the Kennedy Center","review":"I'm a major Sondheim fan, but save your money. This show - and the mediocre score - is a dud. And that's being kind. To say this is the worst thing Sondheim ever wrote is not an exaggeration. No redeeming social (or entertainment) value. Explore ANY of Sondheim's other shows... \\"Assasins\\", \\"Little Night Music\\", \\"The Frogs\\", \\"Company\\", \\"Pacific Overtures\\" -- ANYTHING else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THen you've never heard saturday night","review":"FOr the guy who was surprise about the mediocre quality of bounce. Sondhiem is a genius but he has made some bad scores the score for a show called Saturday Night is a clear example of another one. but we buy the cd's for postarity as much as for entertainment. And having any musical recording could prove to be handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to those bad reviews!!!","review":"Firstly, I bought this hearing the bad reviews, and likewise, expected a bad score. Not so. In perfect honesty, I think it's my favourite Sondheim score. It's simple, and sometimes less IS more. To take this for what it is, a cast recording, and not a stage performance, I'd highly recommend this CD. The two shining voices on this recording easily are McGillin's and Creel's. I'd fallen in love with McGillin's voice after having seen 'Phantom' on Broadway and I wasn't disappointed in the least by this recording. If any blame is to be placed, it should be upon John Weidman for the book. Like 'Assassins,' the production has a wonderful score, but the book simply cannot match it. Surely the score lacks the brilliance of 'Sunday...' but nonetheless, it's worthwhile to listen to, whether or not you're a fan of Stephen [Sondheim]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: bizarre, capricious censorship","review":"In case you're wondering about this:>Yes, this line sort of makes sense within the context of the show as a whole (...),The ellipsis is amazon.com's, not mine. The omitted sentence comprises three words, the first two of which are \\"Hollis\\" and \\"is\\". The third word is apparently (perversely) forbidden here, so I won't repeat it (I'm guessing it's the third that's forbidden; our host might just as well be scandalized by the words \\"Hollis\\" or \\"is\\", in which case this review will include ellipses too). I'll say this much, however: 1) The third word starts with an 'h' and has ten letters. 2) It isn't slang, and it isn't pejorative. 3) It's critical for any kind of evaluation of the show; you couldn't possibly understand the pivotal relation between the characters Hollis and Addison without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A project better off abandoned.","review":"Having seen BOUNCE at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, and later listening to this recording, in my opinion this work is underwhelming at the very least, and quite possibly an all-out failure. My overall impression is \\"Why??\\" Compared to the gems of Sondheim's canon -- chief among them, COMPANY, SWEENY TODD and the often-overlooked MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG -- BOUNCE would more aptly be titled PLOP.This recording is for completists and the intensely curious only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookend for Saturday Night","review":"This show has the same problem as Boch and Harnick's \\"Rothschilds\\" - lots of craft and obvious talent, but who gives a damn that members of a family cornered the market using questionable methods? It's like spending Thanksgiving with those relatives of your own that you'd rather not.Artistically it's the same level as Sondheim's first show, \\"Saturday Night\\" - interesting but you wouldn't pay it much attention if it's author had never written anything else. Which makes his career arc rather like one of Sondheim's better shows - brilliant with stunning passages, but ending a bit clumsy, unresolved or just fizzling. A master artist like Sondheim you'd hope for some kind of epiphany, a \\"Tempest\\". \\"Bounce\\" isn't a \\"Tempest\\".The recording is a little threadbare - the mother wobbly voiced, sythesizer in lieu of orchestra, bland second lead. In the heightened world of musical theater this just isn't a Sondheim worthy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite...","review":"Sonheim is one of the days best composers, but we all have bad days right? This was Sondheims bad day. The music is boring, Listening to the soundtrack doesnt make you want to see the show, no great ballads, basicly NOT WORTH $20. If you see this at a used CD store somewhere its one to for the collection, but not for any one looking for Sondheim. I would suggest this solely for Sondheim collectors, its not one for listening too. Favorite song: \\"The Best Thing That Has Evere Happened\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly under-rated score","review":"I'm so glad this score actually made it to CD. It's a lot better than most musical theater snobs would lead us to believe. And I must take exception with the previous writer's evaluation of Sondheim's last score....Passion. What DREK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to fix Bounce. My gift to Mr. Sondheim.","review":"You can't mix cynicism with life after death. If the world stinks, then more of the same stinks on ice. Imagine a duet of \\"If you walk in a storm hold your head up high...\\" from Carousel and \\"Bulls**t\\" from Bounce and you get the idea of why this musical flops. How to fix it? If there is life after death, as at the beginning and end of this musical, then Moma is there! There won't be a dry eye in the house. Finish it off with a song about our unconditional love for the people we love -- even the people we don't want to love -- and you've got a musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course, difficult.","review":"Like all other great works in the canon of American Theater, Stephen Sondheim's Bounce is a difficult musical to grasp. And unlike many other fans of the show, I can see why the show didn't work. The score, while very much a traditional musical comedy, isn't very tuneful. Similar to Kushner's Caroline, Or Change, Bounce is filled with lots of repetition of musical themes with lots of great subtle changes each recurrence. Some highlights from the show are \\"Talent,\\" \\"You,\\" \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Addison's Trip,\\" and \\"The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened.\\" So overall, fans of Sondheim should love this great recording and I for one hope Sondheim doesn't tinker around with the show but instead lets it gain appreciation over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"First read Mr. Sondheim's \\"Look I Made a Hat\\", then listen to \\"Bounce\\"","review":"I greatly regret that I was unable to see \\"Bounce\\" while showing at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago in 2003. I remember that the Chicago reviews were mixed. Mr. Sondheim's second book, \\"Look I Made a Hat\\", extensively deals with the three tries to bring the Mizner brothers' story into a musical setting. Evidently the show had challenges with the show's book. After reading Mr. Sondheim's heartfelt account of the many challenges of the show, I downloaded the 2003 cast recording. I do like it and would like to see the show (maybe version #2?) but according to my reading of \\"Look I Made a Hat\\", it will not be with Mr. Sondheim as a direct collaborator. For the time being, we can enjoy this fascinating recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game will make you lose sleep and friends","review":"I bought Gran Turismo 2 on a Friday. By Sunday at midnight I would say I put 30 hours into the game. This game has so many cars it's unbelievable. The racing is a little different from GT1 in that most races aren't in a continuos circuit, rather you race on at a time. The license tests considerably easier than GT1 as well. Even the Super License took less than an hour for me to get. The cars look great and are fun to drive. One warning. This game may absorb all of your free time"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked GT1, you'll love GT2...","review":"Bar none the best racing game on the market.

A must Buy for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twice the game GT was","review":"Right now there are 55 reviews on here, and 50 of them are fivestar ones. Some people say the controls for this game are too\\"hard,\\" try real driving. You can even pick something in the game that makes it even more realistic. Not all video games were meant to be conquered in a week, and the ones that you can do that with aren't worth the money. Practice and earn all the licenses, win some money with an older Celica (or something), then you start winning cars in races, which you can sell or drive.

Being a person who had never even played the first Gran Turismo, I was a little nervous about buying it...but let me say that this game lives up to the hype, and is by far the best driving game I have played yet. It takes a little time getting used to the cars and their handling, but after a little practice you will learn why this game is so popular...the graphics are great, as well as the cars to pick from. The dual analog controller is a must to get the total feel of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not excellent.","review":"This game is HOT! I worked in a toy store when it came out. We got in 12 copies that day and we only had three left when we closed. We were the only store in our area that had any in stock for about two weeks (Christmas Season). enough about that, on to the game. The graphics are astounding compared to the origanal. The selection of cars is awesome. The tracks are unreal, but I think all Gran Turismo fans could have waited for the game to be perfected before it was released. Beyond that, I suggest to all Gran Turismo fans who haven't bought this game to get it. GT2 could possibly be the best game ever for the Playstation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gran Turismo 2","review":"This game is awesome. The best car is the Viper. I own two of them and I kick butt.

Spinning out is way to common in this game, if you are behind a car and try to go a little to the left or right to pass it, you could spin out, it takes all of the speed out of the game, and the tracks are short, boring, and few. I would much rather have less than 500 cars in order to get more interactive tracks, instead of having over 500 cars, which is pointless because you aren't going to use them all unless you dedicate you life to it!! The tracks are one way, there are no shortcuts, no ramps, no signes that you can run over and knock down, nothing. With the bad tracks, too many cars to use, and the terrible control, this is by far the worst racing game I've ever played. It would be a better value to buy San Francisco Rush for $...than it would be to buy this game for $..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This game is horrible. There is a ton of cars and only few tracks. They wasted more time amping the replay of the race then they did on the actual game. I was bored in 15 minutes.

I expected GT2 to be even better and was not disapointed. Until, the bugs that should have been programed out of the game by Sony but weren't because Sony was too concerned about making a quick buck on the Christmas buying frenzy showed up and ruined my gameplay almost on a daily basis. If you buy this game you won't need a memory card. All you data will be lost or screwed up sooner or later and you'll be starting over from scratch constantly. I called Sony and they said they would send me a debugged version if I sent them my simulation mode disc (the game comes on 2 discs). That was over 2 months ago. I've called them once since then and they said they sent me a new disc but it must've been lost in the mail. They offered to send me a new disc and said it would arive in no less than 3 days. it's been a week and I'm still waitng."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is good!","review":"If you like cars then definately check this game out.

Complex and detailed and real make GT2 ( the follow up to Gran Turismo ) the best driving game to date.And coming from a guy that is 34 and who grew up around arcade driving games such as Pole Position, and super sprint, and Grand National 500....they do not even compare. Get yourself a license and feel the real need for speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest racing game for the PSX","review":"This is THE complete racing game. Anyone that has any interest whatsoever in cars, racing games, or just video games in general should certainly check these two discs out. One of the coolest features is the fact that you are not only limited to \\"race\\" cars. You can also choose a car that is not unlike the one that is sitting in your driveway. Everything from a Dodge Neon to a Ford Taurus to BMWs are in the game, and they all respond just as they would in real life. Plus as an added bonus, there is the rally mode where you can purchase the 4WD cars like the Subarus and tear across the dirt trails. Awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Driving Games on PSX","review":"It is a bit harder for a first-time gamer of Gran Turismo series..But GT2 is awesome..It has to be released in 2 discs because it has a lot to offer like more tracks, more modes, cars, etc.Lots of automobiles available but their features are different from each other..I think that driving in manual transmission is easier than driving in automatic mode (I cannot control the car well!! Argh!!)..I'm pretty lousy at racing games but I love this one...The sounds are well done but for the graphics, it's still a pixel frame.Still, I'mgetting more and more addictive in this game,, you just have to get a lot of practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in my day........","review":"This is a great and realistic game. Only thing you need with it is a steering wheel and foot pedals. They are a must if you want to enjoy this game properly. Many people have sung the praises of this game, and I cannot top that. A couple of things bug me about it, though. Things that didn't carry over from GT1. First, the license tests are dumbed down so that anyone with a learner's permit can eventually get the super license (kiddy prizes for making enough attempts get you through). Second, there is no option to qualify for position in a race. Starting from the front row is completely different from starting mid-pack, or from the rear (plus you don't get the pole position bonus like in GT1). Overall a great game, and a worthy successor to GT1; but GT2000 will have to remember its roots better. This is not a game for the faint-at-heart, or those who don't take it seriously. Steep learning curve scares away amateurs, leaving room for racing fanatics to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"This game makes me wonder how I could have spent so much time playing spy hunter when I was twelve. Everything about the game play is so realistic. Your car even jumps a bit when there are small bumps in the road. THe liscences are challenging enough to keep you occupied while trying to get them, but not so hard as to meke you want to give up. I wish there were more rally and endurance races available but there is still enough gameplay to keep me occupied for several hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"Are the people giving this game 5 stars playing the same game I am? The original Gran Turismo was by far the best driving game ever. What happened to the sequel? Choppy graphics and extreme slowness make this game unplayable.There's just no sense of speed like the original, it feels like you're going about 15 mph.

I got GT 2 in February and have played it a grand total of three times while I continue to enjoy the original release. It's clear that the manufacturer rushed this game to market (they missed several target release dates in 99' trying to get it into stores before Christmas). While it's true that vehicle choices are greater, game complexity is too much, race and screen transitions are too slow and you can't qualify your car for a race--instead you're relegated to 6th spot on the grid every time.

If you you want realism its not in this game. Sure its got cars and cars but you have to win races to buy them. There is no dashboard for the in-car view what gives? The games comes w/ 2 CD's an Arcade disc and a Simulation disc. I play the simulation disc and it gets a thumbs down. Do the people who make games like this ever drive a real car? Its easier to drive my real C4 93' Corvette 6spd manual on a canyon road then looping the game simulated Corvette on one of its GTII tracks. GTII negatives include: poor car handling, no dashboard, mediocre graphics, and no car damage. Hey people try Nascar 2,3,4 on the PC if you want to feel what a good car simulator is.

The pattern seems to be that (1) the recommendations for fat are doubled to 3 grams (but the number of peanuts that is said to fulfill that recommendation remains at 6), and (2) the amounts of high-fiber vegetables have increased enormously, for example \\"artichoke, 1 medium\\" becomes \\"artichoke, 4 large\\", \\"broccoli, 1 cup\\" becomes \\"broccoli, 3 cups\\", \\"spinach, 4 cups\\" becomes \\"spinach, 20 cups\\". The curious statement that 1/2 nectarine is equivalent to 1 peach remains, however (a puzzle to botanists everywhere)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great guide to healthy foods","review":"This is an easy-to-read guide to eating the healthiest foods.

What can one expect for $600?? The frame is very strong, and it's important to remember to leave the nuts/bolts loose during setup and to tighten them only when you're done. The panels proved to be the most difficult to put in place and we had to clip the corners in order for them to fit correctly. We found that a solar-powered fan (purchased on eBay for $30) and mounted into the top peak panel was needed to improve air flow and to exhaust the warm air. The panels seem very, very thin at first, but once installed we were amazed at how well they stood up to the weather. Also, you may want to consider spray-painting the frame with Rustoleum prior to installing the panels, otherwise the aluminum and steel parts are prone to oxidation. We like this greenhouse, and plan on buying a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for what it is","review":"Greenhouses are expensive, and I the adage, you get what you pay for is true.

Because the characters' \\"time is limited\\" and the conversations cover so many subjects, the reading tends to be rather discursive, leaving loose ends untied. Clearly this was the author's intention, but it wasn't what I expected. It often requires the reader to either carry the logic on out past the conversation to draw a conclusion, or refrain from doing so altogether. Of course his attempt to discuss these subjects objectively completely makes up for it!5 stars for blowing my mind and getting me excited to give a go at Saving the Appearances. \\"Very deep water\\" indeed.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great puppet","review":"My 3 year old loves dragons and is thrilled with this puppet.

I purchased this book based on positive reviews that confused the distinction between lewd and stupid - lewd I can handle. This book will be relished by life members of the fart & burp club who wish to obtain a graduate degree with the least effort. It largely ignores the concept or utility of graduate education. Perhaps the book relfects the biases of the social sciences, but my grad students in the natural sciences would skin me alive if I assigned a book that squandered so many pages on the excessive trappings of extended adolescence while instructing them carefully in the art of dodging. Its key redeaming features are a collection of excellent quotes and written caricatures of professors in the social sciences and humanities - the authors must know my dean."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Be Able To Put It Down","review":"Oh my God!

The authors have taken the arrogance and pomposity of higher education and brought it down to earth in a humorous way that is sure to have the many self-important snobs cringing...I say its about darn time somebody did! With that said, the best thing this book does is explain the mysteries of the grad school experience in good ole' plain-spoken English (They break it down into three stages: \\"Getting In,\\" \\"Getting Through,\\" and \\"Getting the H--- Out.\\").

Not only is this book useless, but its entire sales apparatus (from the website to these very reviews [mainly written by the authors themselves, which you can tell by noting that anyone giving it five stars has reviewed ONLY this book and nothing else at all on Amazon])is designed to suck you in. You would be very hard-pressed to find one serious graduate student who has read this book and found it to be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing The Game","review":"Playing the Game is a parody of the university world which strips away the robes of pretense.

Between half and three-quarters of the book consists of blank pages with single-line quotes from completely random sources (Shrek, Twain, etc.) The pages that actually pretend to have content are filled with completely obvious statements, repeated over dozens of pages. If this book were 50 condensed pages and one-quarter of the price, it might be worth it for simple amusement. No information in this book will be useful for a potential graduate school student.

While the language in the book temporarily increased my personal level of profanity, the ideas the authors present have stayed with me.

I definatly recommend this book. Unlike many of the articles I am assigned to read, this one isn't boring. And while I wondered how I'd find the time to fit in reading something \\"for fun,\\" it was an easy read when I only had 15 or so minutes free, not enough time to get into the \\"heavy, boring\\" reading, or when I got tired of reading big words in sentences that seemed to never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grad students seemed to like it","review":"I haven't had time to read it myself but provided it to an office full of about 8 grad students.

I found myself skimming pages just to get it over with. \\"Bunny Is Good Bread\\" is incredibly sick and perverted.

The main character, Prince Don Fabrizio, is a stout Sicilian noble, head of a deep-rooted aristocratic family, who foresees the inevitable changes with skepticism and sees himself as the last representative of an era condemned to oblivion. Tancredi, his much-loved nephew, personifies the new era, and although vested in revolutionary red, openly claims the great paradox: \\"things must change if they are to remain the same!\\" This novel is Lampedusa's single literary output that was written when the author was 60 years old. It is a work of art that nears perfection, with subtlety of emotions, with so much literary finesse, a delicacy to be savored."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Leopard","review":"This book is a novel based on an ancestor of the writer. This ancestor, living in Sicily during the mid 1800's, had the leopard of the title as a family crest. This period was the time when Italy united under the leadership of Garibaldi and King Victor Emmanuel. It meant the beginning of the end for a lifestyle of privilege and the emergence of a middle class. Such a change promised improvements for many but not for \\"The Leopard\\".

In this episode, Qwilleran and his friends are baffled by the series of fires which are being set in mineshafts and businesses around Pickax. There are also two seemingly unrelated murders. While Qwilleran and his clever Siamese Koko are attempting to solve these mysteries, we become reacquainted with the lovable characters which Braun has created. Qwill and his friend Polly participate in several interesting social events including a caravan to all the abandoned mine shafts. The citizens of Pickax are trying to get in all the fun they can before The Big One (first snowstorm) hits and they are snowed in for several days. The solution to the mystery is almost overshadowed by the interplay between these well-drawn and interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each Cat Who Book is a Fun Trip to a Familiar Place!","review":"I have purchased every Cat Who book, plus the Cat Who Companion, and Short and Tall Tales. I pre-order each one, and I continually read them in sequence. By the time the new one comes out, I have gone back and read every one of them again and champ at the bit for the new one. I am a cyber resident of Moose County! Now I enjoy a thriller as much as the next reader; I enjoy adventure and science fiction, but no other series of books has ever completely captured my heart like this wonderful Quillerain Community! I hope Lillian Jackson Braun lives to be 150 years old and writes at least a Cat Who book every year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Braun really is writing these books....","review":"... because she's turned a 50ish man into a little old lady of 87. I know some 50ish men. They would not be seen dead in \\"jumpsuits\\" or \\"leisure suits\\". They do not spend their time as Q does: eating, drinking coffee, judging children's art contests, redecorating their homes. When they get together with friends it is not to view a new sofa or read aloud a new restaurant's menus, as Q does. (Honestly!) They do not live in woodsy/watery resort areas and then eschew all outdoor activities and virtually any exercise whatsoever. When duties require their presence at some location a whopping 30 miles from home, they do not pack up and move house. I snort my way through these paperbacks (free from the little-old-lady next door) and rejoice that my boyfriend is, in fact, a \\"well-built 50ish man\\" and *not* Qwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant visit","review":"After reading \\"...Robbed A Bank\\" I thought the author lost her touch but this installment is vintage Braun. Though not great mysteries, the charm of Ms. Braun's books are in the characters and the villages visited (Pickax and Mooseville). Except for the murders, deaths and fires, this could be Mayberry and the visit through the pages is quite nice. New readers should go to the first title in the series and read them in order. You'd get a better appreciation for Ms. Braun's writing than if you started here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I can't wait for a new book in this series to arrive in the library so I always buy the book as soon as it hits the stores.

This book provides detailed insight into the planning of covert operations in Afghanistan, and some of the problems associated with dealing with the indigenous population of that region.

If you just like a good yarn, then go for it.Tom Carew, real name Philip Sessarego, is a SAS groupie. I remember him from the years I lived in Hereford late 70s and early 80s. Hereford was home to the SAS and the SAS guys were pretty low-key. Then there were soldiers attached to to SAS, who could be anything from cooks to motor mechanics. A number of these guys tried their best to look SAS, wearing beepers and drinking in the pubs (i.e. The David Garrick) where SAS guys were supposed to hang out. Then, there was Sessarago, who was a category to himself. He left the Army in 1975, having failed acceptance into the SAS. He spent the years after that in a fantasy world, trying to look the part in his Land Rover, and supposedly, dabbling in some occasional private mercenary work overseas.

In general, the graphics are a little bit better than last year's version, but not much. On the plus sides, the college areans are pretty realistic looking, at least in terms of what the court itself looks like. To me, the most obvious flaw in this game are the inaccurate rosters. For exmaple, for the Maryland Terrapins (my favorite team) # 40 is listed as the starting Center. There is no # 40 on the 1999-2000 U of M roster so why is # 40 even listed at all? Also, there is no conference tournament mode in this game--so the regular season ends and you go right to the NCAAS, which means if you've had a crappy regular season, there's no hope of redeeming yourself with a great run in the conference tourney to impress the selection committee enough to earn a NCAA tourney bid. Still, if you're a college basketball fanatic like I am, I think you'll enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ups and Downs","review":"This installment of the Final Four series is the same thing as last year except the part where they have Trajon Langdon walking around everywhere.

Not 17, 117. In a 10 minute game against Utah State I won with Florida 99-15. Yes 99-15. At half it was 53-4. Yes 53-4. Against a great team like Michigan State I still won by 40. Finally, Quinn Buckner is just as annoying as in last year's game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game [is bad]","review":"Okay, the graphics are disgusting. The game control is horrible. It's physically impossible to block a shot, and you can never fail to steal the ball. Shooting is the worst thing in the world. The only thing that makes this worth 2 stars and not 1 star is that it has so many teams in it. I would give it 1 and a half stars, but that's not available.

As you communicate with the spirits of dead people from history, ask them if they know anything about this nonsense.I.e., do not take this book seriously, and be careful. Gardner is cited as an authority in other books of this ilk.And for God's sake, before you make up your mind on these kinds of pop authors, read Umberto Eco's novel, _Foucault's Pendulum_.

I am not a Catholic, but found Garner's position to be very offensive and completely one-sided.His theories on Christ, the apostles, the canon of the Bible, Mary Magdalene, etc. are so poorly done and so out of touch that they are laughable. He does have some interesting historical connections, and the genealogies are nice.

This book is a long, trying yarn about the bloodline of Jesus, where it came from and where it supposedly is today. At the end of the book, we discover that the rightful monarch and descendant of Christ is none other than the Stuart pretender who sponsors Gardner's research. If this conflict of interest isn't enough for you, then the lack of reliable scholarship should be. I found the author's pretenses at historical accuracy to be downright offensive. Not only do you need an \\"open mind and a questing spirit\\" to appreciate this book, but you need to be completely unversed in the subjects on which he writes because his mistakes, intentional misleadings and screwy speculations are legion."},{"rating":"2","title":"All true...no, worth reading...YES","review":"While everything in this book is certainly not perfectly accurate (no account of 2000+ year old history will be), it provides an alternate view of the bible and Christian history, much of which makes much, much more sense than the church's interpretation. I think all Christians should read this book, not because I want them to abandon their \\"faith,\\" but because what they hear week after week after week from the church should be balanced with other perspectives.

It made me think and it contains a mountain of research and 150 pages of references. Because Laurence Gardner restates and refutes many of the traditional Christian beliefs it will be criticized and even villified. He retranslates, restates and reinterprets many aspects of the scripture that we have been taught. He does the same to certain aspects of history.

Instead, the book's focus was split between the parents (Rick and Naomi Weschler) and those closest to them-Rick's office manager (Lillian), the doctor who pronounced Dahlia's death (Michael), and Naomi's aging mother, Estelle. Yona McDonough portrays each character's grief without overdoing it, giving them very human faults that cause them to make selfish choices because of this grief.These choices not only affect them and their marriages, but the lives of the other people around them. For instance, Michael and Naomi's choice to have an affair changed Michael's daughter's life forever. I enjoyed reading this book.

Really about Becker, Navratilova and Sampras. It tells their Wimbledon stories, from beginnings to ends. It tells about their main rivalries, but the only interviews are from those 3 people. It would be nice to have Edberg talk about Boris, to have Chris Evert talk about Martina, and to have Agassi or anyone talk about Sampras. Bud Collins is a person that people either love or hate, but all respect his tennis knowledge, but he isn't on here either. Hard too to omit McEnroe, but this DVD does it. It tries to make a succession pathway from Navratilova to Hingis, but we know that didn't come about. The Navratilova bit is maybe 20 minutes, while the Hingis bit is about 2. Likewise, there was a great succession bit--mainly in interviews with Becker--about the King of Wimbledon going from Becker to Sampras and then to Federrer. At the end is a short piece on Federrer, akin to that of Hingis. Again, would like more interviews!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great grinder at a great price...","review":"After using my Capresso espresso machine for a couple of weeks, I realized I needed a burr grinder.

I'm glad I did.Some complained about the noise and the mess. True coffee lovers realize this is the nature of the beast. It's messy and loud, but not more than any other grinder. This grinder is actually less messy than my previous Krupps grinder. I've learned that putting a paper towel under the grinder before grinding catches a lot of the rogue grounds.The taste of coffee and espresso is much better using freshly ground beans.

I keep the coffee beans in air-tight containers and just measure out for myself the amount I want. Since I often switch the kind of coffee I make from one morning to the next, I really like the fact that the grinder grinds *all* the beans in the hopper, so it's ready for a different bean the next time I use it.

The thing just plain old stopped working for no apparent reason. With just over 30 days of service (less a week of being on vacation). I don't care if the thing turns out grounds that are better than gold, if it doesn't work, and breaks that quickly after meticulous care...what kind of P.O.S**t is it?

I've replaced it twice (throughout occasional use for a year and a half). The first time, the bottom fell out and I super glued it back on for a temporary fix. Once that came apart again, I replaced it with the second container - which cracked and leaked ground.

It's noisy, it produces staticy grounds, and the hopper could stand to be a little higher quality.Now the good. Just went from a blade grinder (10+ years) to this, never had a better cup of espresso. Crema, flavor, aroma - fresh consistent grounds make all the difference.If you want to improve your coffee - improve your grinder. Don't blame your espresso machine.

Having enjoyed Schama's series on great artists and being an fan of British history, I was eager to watch this series. I quickly became annoyed as he glossed over, or totally skipped entire centuries and momentous events. Yet he includes an entire chapter on George Orwell!?If you enjoy Schama's style you may enjoy this series, but please don't take it as a legitimate history of Britain. True, it is a vast subject and hard to cram into a few hours of a DVD, but George Orwell?? Come on.If you'd like to watch a gripping, well presented series that does a good job of following the epic saga, try David Starkey's \\"The Monarchy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable lack of closed captioning!","review":"Once again the History Channel disappoints with the lack of closed captioning on documentary DVDs.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Britain","review":"I initially rented this series from NetFlix, and enjoyed it so much, that I decided this would be a great addition to my Library.As a former British Subject, and a history buff, this package, had everything I wanted and more. It was very well produced and had lots of little items, that I hadn't been aware off.I would recommend this to anyone, who is interested in British History.Even when you go back hundreds of years ago, you can see how much of that History, matches what is happening today.The package is well designed and at the price I paid, was more than well worth its price.If you have a History buff in your family, this would make a great gift for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"With anticipated glee, we bought this DVD series as a Christmas gift for our family; however, as we went through each of the 5 DVD's, we became increasingly disappointed in Schama's \\"history.\\" So much of his presentation seems to be \\"on the fringe\\" and not central to the mainstream of the basic history of Britain. Also, as others have pointed out, Schama seems intent on presenting the \\"gore\\" of battles, tragedies, etc. He also seems fascinated with sex and the eccentric too much. We just felt that we were not getting the fullness of the basic story of Britain's history. It was very disappointing, and we would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is JUST AWFUL","review":"The producers pride themselves on 'disengaging from the tedious timeline of history.' What is history without a timeline? This series is a tedious thread of pictures, images, FEELINGS. Trite drama without substantive detail, pablum for the mind-numb -- the narrator's exaggerated facial contortions gave us endless minutes of mirth (and I use the word 'endless' with great intent). Do not waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focused on the History of the Royal Family","review":"Narrated by Simon Schama, this history starts out well (Disc 1), but eventually evolves into the history of the British royalty (by Disc 2 onwards). Although, British royalty is a huge slice of the British history, I was looking for something which would be more of a socio-political history. I was looking for the societal and cultural development of England in addition to the development of the royal family.This set is like being in a lecture room with Schama (a remarkable storyteller) as the teacher using slides and pictures of old monuments, paintings, and actual places. If you are expecting an entertainment(ish) storytelling, then you must find something else. This set would be equally productive on an audio tape.This could be part of an introduction package to the History of Great Britain, but for a broader look you need to find some other product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reproduction quality was poor!","review":"I received the 5 discs in the set. Disc #4 is actually #5 and #5 is labelled #4. A friend of mine received the same set and lo & behold #4 is labelled #5 and the disc labeled #4 is indeed #4. The result being he has 2 #4's and no #5. You have to do better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial.","review":"It is not about Britain but about Simon Schama [however the last hour of Volume 5 is interesting]. If you still have some doubts: just compare this documentary with Mark Twain by Ken Burns or Thomas Jefferson also by Ken Burns, and judge by yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather uninteresting and pretentious overview of Britain","review":"I purchased this series with high hopes and I found viewing it to be very disappointing. The host was annoying the images added nothing to the presentation and there was way too much time spent looking at peacocks and flowing streams.I suppose that the history would have been OK if it weren't so scanty. This was very much a quick overview, which often left out key facts that would be vital to understanding the motivation for actions in later parts of the series.I commend the idea behind creating a good series in the history of Britain, but I can only suggest that this one be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"make that woman stop singing!","review":"Although I am a history buff and I find English history fascinating in general, I have to say that the music used in this series made it really hard to watch. While the yodeling mezzo soprano (or alto?) mangles songs like \\"The Three Ravens\\" and \\"God Save the King\\" I found it really hard to give the history lesson my attention. As she warbles in and out of key I had to wonder why the director of the series didn't choose silence over this vocalization. Is she some relative?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style Over Substance","review":"This series boasts purple pretentious prose delivered bobble-head fashion, rather than real history. It's like an impressionist cook sampling a smorgasbord of other people's food. A self-indulgent little nod here, a little tweak there, and no substance. I know this is geared toward entertainment, and the bits on Alfred, the Edwards, and the Henrys are good, but we're disappointed. Instead, get theMonarchy Complete Collection, even if Starkey has the same wobbly ways, his narrative is far less florid and far more informative. I highly recommendA History of Scotland. Schama's approach places a modern lens over the past, rife with scewed views and a glaring lack of focus. Schama skips over the the heritage of the Saxons, the fascinating and complex War of the Roses, the Reformation, and so much more. Someday, I must actually read my copy ofEcclesiastical History of the English People (Penguin Classics)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effortless History","review":"Unlike James Burke whose popular connections series made no apologies for appealing to a mass audience, Professor Schama lays out the subject matter and simply assumes one can \\"keep up\\". And indeed, one can. It is a brilliant overview of the History of Britain; moreover, the visual combination of still photos and comtemporary video is mixed nicely throughout. Best viewed with a straight shot of Midelton and a pint of Stout."},{"rating":"2","title":"US version now in widescreen","review":"After reading the old reviews concerning the US versions being in fullscreen, I considered ordering from BBC directly. But I was concerned that it might not work on my equipment. Anyway I ordered the US version and it is now in widescreen, so this is no longer an issue. I plan to travel to the UK this comming summer and while I read a history of Britian a few years ago, this is a good refresher. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"It is true that this DVD suffers from comparison to other, more recent, treatments, but my needs were for the content, not the presentation. This has given me an entertaining, thoughtful high level overview of the chronology of English history (from the English viewpoint) in an easily digestible treatment that I found satisfying. Best of all, I didn't feel like I was \\"taking a course\\" at all, and each year, usually around the Holidays or during a winter blizzard, I sit in front of the fire and watch the whole thing over a day or two. Just what I was looking for, but everyone is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Typical History Book","review":"This is a different type of history, with more emphasis on the individuals concerned. The author narrates the story, in a somewhat sardonic manner, but with an emphasis on the people involved, not just the dates and places. Some of the players are well-known, but he also brings up some of the more obscure players, who never-the-less influenced history.We enjoyed it. Each part is about 58 minutes long, so they fit rather nicely into a TV schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimensional","review":"As another reviewer wrote this is through English eyes. One piece in particular where he claimed the Romans built a wall because there was nothing they wanted in Scotland. If the Romans built walls everywhere there was \\"nothing they wanted\\" they would have spent all their time building walls. It seems like schama is loath to give any credit to the Picts for not laying down for the invaders!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply superb.","review":"As a teacher and Anglophile, I think this production is top notch. It's a great overview; not incredibly in-depth, but wonderful none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which version to buy?","review":"You'll see two versions of the program on Amazon, so which one should you buy? You probably think that this is a no-brainer. The American DVD-format BBS version is a lot cheaper than the History Channel (A&E) one, features wide screen rather than full screen images, and has an extra disk of special features. On the other hand, you get what you pay for. The BBC packaging is awful. The disks are stored in overlapping pairs in their container in such a way that to get to the one on the bottom, you first have to remove the one on the top. And while you expect full screen images to cut off the left and right edges of wide screen ones, in this case the wide screen images of the BBC collection actually cut off the top of the full screen images in the History Channel collection. The BBC version is a bargain at the price, but a bit less of a bargain than you might expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the point","review":"What is the point of knowing about history if not to learn something from it, such as what mistakes people made and how to do things better now, or how a system developed over the years that gradually allowed people more freedom? At the end of each of these episodes I found that I did not feel I had gained in understanding and insight, but only in how brutal, violent, and outright horrible the history of Britain was - at least in the eyes of the makers of this series. Quite frankly, I think they have missed the point. There must be empathy with people to have understanding of them, and instead I felt cynicism. Others, such as Ken Burns, have found how to show who people were, and yet leave you feeling you understood them, whatever their faults might have been. This series left me feeling agitated and actually revolted by how parts were presented. I, unfortunately, would have to say that I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schama's History of Britain","review":"Simon Schama brings extraordinary knowledge, brilliance, thoughtfulness, and presentation skills to this history of Britain, which he has written from somewhat different -- and very interesting -- perspectives than one finds in a textbook history. I first discovered it when I borrowed it from my local library and was immediately smitten -- to the point where I bought copies for my two sons' families for Christmas. In addition, I have promoted it enthusiastically to friends. Further, the special features include a stunning conversation about John Donne and his poetry between Schama and Fiona Shaw. Shaw's readings of Donne's work is magical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A distenting opinion","review":"Everyone LOVES this series.... but me. Yes, it's a fine ambition to \\"bring characters to life\\" but Schama does so without enough chronological context. His prose is florid in the extreme and as a screen presence I'm sorry to say I found him terribly annoying. His melodramtic delivery is so full of gulping pauses and overwraught phrasing it's maddening. Since the bulk of the series covers a period well before photography we are subjected to animal imagery ad nausim. When Schama tells us Eleanor of Aquitaine spoon fed her feelings to her children, we see a bird regurgitating into the mouths of its young. (And he never mentions she was queen of France before queen of England?) I realize I'm in the minority, but I found this set a great dissapointment. (I do hope Mr. Schama doesn't read this-- but there you are.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hated it","review":"This is probably the worst book ever written. I could not even finish it i hated it so much. Instead of focusing on the real issues of the book like her eating disorder she talks about a million other stupid things that are boring and unimportant. The book seems to drone on and on and on . . . don't waste your money, if you really want to read it, rent it from a library or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to come out in print and rushed to buy it and was SO disappointed. In spite of claiming to have collaborated with native Germans, Kellerman's text is rife with German spelling, cultural and grammatical errors. Kellerman invents some \\"German\\" words which are clearly designed to mislead the unsuspecting reader into beliving that certain German words mirror English racist terms. Tossing the \\"n\\" word around and trying to pass it off as a German word is inexcusable for a writer of Kellerman's status. All Germans in the book are depicted as liars, thieves and immoral. Not even children are spared the depiction as inherently evil because they are German. Had the book focused on a nationality other than German, it would be decried as racist to the core. I wish I'd saved my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sense of Place","review":"Faye Kellerman has written an extremely interesting novel set between the World Wars in Munich, Germany. Axel Berg is a Munich poice detective charged with solving a string a serial murders involving young women. In the backdrop is the rise of \\"The Austrian\\", Adolph Hitler, and the atmosphere is one of growing intolerance for Jews, Communists and any other group not associated with the Nazis. This is an excellent book that is actually a story within a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I usually love Faye Kellerman, but I found the violence and sexual content of this book un-necessary and disgusting. I didn't even finish it. I could not connect with Berg, he was not interesting and her attempts to show both the good and the bad side of him as a person simply made him look like a boorish jerk who cheated on his wife and couldn't even do THAT with passion...frankly, Berg was boring, boring, boring. I didn't complete the book, and I'm no expert on German culture or language, but I'm not in the least surprised that there are errors in the book....her book Moon Music had several cultural mistakes as well (she tried to take on Mormonism...and she failed) I wouldn't bother to pick up this book...hopefully she'll go back to Peter and Rina soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Text to speech not turned on!","review":"Book was good but this is her second book after Stone Kiss that doesn't have text to speech turned on. Thats too bad, most of my books I listen to on the way to work since I drive at least two hours a day. The text to speech is a great option because I can read at home or listen in the car. I rarely buy the book if this option is not enabled. Not sure if I'll go any farther in her series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Vey!","review":"I have enjoyed all of Faye Kellerman's books in the past, but she is way off the mark here. Her characters are undeveloped and seem like cardboard cut-outs, rather than real people. Her treatment of 1929 Munich is trite and also comic bookish, with Hitler showing up all over the place very unplausibly. The plot consists of an unending stream of McGuffins, as Berg thinks this one did it, then that one did it. These red herrings are so poorly done and so continual that they become unbelieveable.Better wait for the next Decker book, regardless of whether father or daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I hardly ever do this, but I was so disappointed in this book, I had to speak up. The main plot might have been mildly interesting (the serial murders), but the characters surrounding it were so unpleasant and confusing, I really didn't care what the resolution was. There are so many books centered on that time in history and the brewing storm of WWII, I do appreciate the attempt to point up a situation that could have occurred at any historical era. It is unfortunate that this attempt grossly missed the mark. I won't give up on Ms. Kellerman, though, I will read whatever she puts out next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faye Kellerman Does It Again","review":"Faye Kellerman books are always worth reading and this one is no exception.Her story lines are always well thought out and interesting and her characters are real people not stereotypes. As we read her books we live and breathe along with the characters sharing every detail of their daily lives and their most intimate thoughts.This book is set against the background of Hitler's rise to power and gives us an insight into life at that crucial point in history which makes the book even more interesting and readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The History Was Better Than The Convoluted Story","review":"While it's apparent Kellerman used a great deal of research in writing this book, the story-line never fulfilled my expectations. The plot was complex to the point of being tedious. What made the novel even harder to embrace were the heavyhanded descriptions...descriptions that were repeated and repeated and repeated. As were the deductions exposed by the characters.It was also hard to care for protagonist or any of the other characters. True, these were horrific times and the murders depicted in the book brutal. But the prose was both boring and plodding.If only the novel was as intriguing as the book jacket and the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRAIGHT into Darkness","review":"once again Faye Kellerman's attention to detail has proven what a brilliant writer she is.

When I realized it dealt with Germany and Hitler pre-World War II, I didn't think I would like it...that it would be boring!! Then I decided that since I had spent money to get it, I'd better read it! Well much to my surprise it wasn't the least bit boring and I actually learned some history. Faye Kellerman is wonderful in her descriptions and factual history. Her stories are filled with so many thought-provoking ideas and concepts. The mystery of the murderer weaving throughout was one I couldn't solve in my mind before it finally came to be disclosed. Wonderful reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Faye","review":"Having just been reading a series with a Judaic twist, this novel gives another and darker side (darker than homicide? yes) Here is an honest man caught up in the storms of Munich at the beginning of Hitler's anti-semitic programs.

It is tedious, unsympathetic, and repetitive to the point of distraction.Two points for the research. Wait for the library version.

Hoxey formula can be purchased online and it isn't cheap. But if it keeps you from undergoing the knife and out of the hospital, who can argue? I'm now a firm believer in alternative medicine.

While some of the cartoons were funny and others were interesting and thought-provoking, large portions of the commentary were devoted to promoting Mr. Piraro's own environmentalist, pro-vegetarian agenda. While I am all in favor of improving Earth's ecology (after all, this is the only planet we've got) and have no problem with vegetarianism, I do have a problem with devoting pages upon pages to explaining in graphic detail what the meat industry does and how evil people are who support the industry by eating meat.

So where did this trash come from?The characters are one dimensional. The plot elements read like they are stolen from fantasy written for junior high readers or D&D; fans. I couldn't finish it, reading the stinker just got too painful.Either Lustbader's writing has sunk miserably low, he's using a 14-year old ghost writer or I just liked his writing because I was 14 years old. In any case, get something else. George RR Martin or Robin Hobb are great places to start. So don't waste your time with junk or support mediocre (at best) books with your dollars.

I certainly wasn't prepared for how enjoyable and interesting this story was!It's really a mixture of fantasy and science fiction, and dwells on the debate of faith vs. reason. I found the writing superb as well, sometimes transporting me solely by its literary merit. The other reviewers who panned the writing in this book must be used to a different style; but coming from a background of enjoying scifi, classics and mystical poetry, I found Lustbader's prose to be exactly what I was looking for in a pleasant evening-time read.I went on to finish out the whole series, and while I wouldn't rather the next two books quite as highly, I would certainly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys the fantasy and scifi genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric van Lackluster","review":"The book has many good points and the story moves along at a fairly good pace. However, the author's choice of the names and vocabulary do nothing to add to the story, in fact his invented words deter from the enjoyment of reading the book. We, the readers, are aware of the fact that the story does not take place on earth by the reference to five moons and the physical description of the conquering race without the jawbreaking names. The most disappointing part of the whole book was the ending. The reader knows it is going to happen, you are running out of pages, but then it happens and you have to go back several pages and read it again to see if you missed anything, because it didn't really end it just sort of... stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Silly I Couldn't Suspend Disbelief","review":"Eric Van Lustbader's \\"The Ring of Five Dragons\\" is definitely not worth reading. In a nutshell, the characters' behaviors are sometimes just silly, the writing stilted, the magic system undefined to the point where its use is nonsensical, and some of the major plot mechanisms are jaw-dropping unbelievable. I rate it at a Bad 1 star out of 5. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"long winded and not reader friendly","review":"The first thing about this novel is that it could be cut in half at a minimum. There was so much unnecessary, extraneous information. The characters did not fell real. The story was convoluted. In the world of the story, the Vornn are the invaders who have taken over the planet inhabited by the Kundalan. Despite this, the Vornn male seem to have no interest in the females of their species, but are overly enthralled with every Kundalan female on the planet. The story line is so convoluted that I can't even succinctly explain it. It does, however, involve a ring and the fate of the planet. The part that really lost me was when the main character, a Vornn male transforms into a Kundalan female. Yeah, exactly. Not to mention that if I see another word with three consecutive same letters, I might have to scream.

What makes it all the more sad is that his recently published 'epic' is nothing more than a re-hash of earlier ideas and bitter polemics with very little content that is new or original.In this book more than any other, Kung comes across as a very bitter old coot with a perpetual axe to grind against the Magisterium -- to such an extent that on several occasions I had to suppress the urge to throw the book down and scream \\"ENOUGH ALREADY!

Fortunately, I had read other much more comforting books on the subject of pregnancy/infant loss before opening this one. I never completely got through this book, it was a theological discussion and not comforting. I needed to read books written by people who had gone through loss, who were offering comfort and support.If you are reviewing this book because you have lost a precious baby. First, my heart goes out to you. It is a devastating and soul-wrenching loss. Secondly, I would recommend my two favorite books on the subject: Silent Cradle and A Deeper Shade of Grace. In both these books the authors share their personal stories of loss, healing and hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for grieving parents","review":"First of all this book is not for grieving parents. The author's objective is not to comfort, but to convince of his way of thought. Stealing a title such as this is a wrongful use of it for those who may truly be seeking answers to the loss of a child at an early age. All the author does is try to convince the reader that they must believe what he believes and that the opposition is wrong. The first half of the book soundly deals with the problems with other, non-Christian views of death, salvation, etc. However, the second half is purely a debate of that the author is trying to prove to himself that he is right. It is a disappointment to me and I'm sure it is to parents who were sincerely looking for comfort. The selfishness that the author has to try to steal a title that could be put to useful purposes and try to persuade those of his Calvinist thought disgusts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a Baby Dies","review":"This is the first book to be published on this subject in almost a century.

As a result, the stories stand up very well over 60 years later and the art is still wonderful to look at. This is a great format for owning the comics.

Its a book about a boy who finds all kinds of different Wockets all over his house, in his pocket, in his trash baket, in his bureau, in his closet, in his curtains, behind his clock, up on a shelf, in the sink, in the lamp, in the pots and pans, in a bottle, in and in his chair, they are everywhere. This book is a great book if you like to rhyme words, some a tongue twisting, and some are funny. In the end the boy talked about how he likes where he lives because of all the Wockets there. The reason I liked this book is because it was tongue twisting and it rhymed."},{"rating":"1","title":"abridged -- in a bad way","review":"As previously mentioned, this does NOT contain all the text or pictures of the original. In and of itself, this is understandable since the original story is long. But the abriged text in particular is really despicable -- it unnecessarily changes the wording; so random and infinitely inferior.The only thing this edition has going for it is the fact that it is sturdy. I would not recommend it. Just buy the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of There's a Wocket in my Pocket!","review":"I thought the book There's a Wocket in my Pocket! was a good childerns book. The book had weird ryming words, funny creatures,and excellent pictures. The weird ryming words were ryming words children never have heard before making them all the more funny. Dr. Seuss used his imagination to create these weird yet funny creatures. Lastly Dr. Seuss drew excellent pictures to illustrate these creatures. In conculsion we see this is a good childerns book because of its weird ryming words, funny creatures, and excellent pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a Wocket in My Pocket!

IT would be good to read to young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny book about made-up monsters","review":"This is a great book for kids who are afraid of what lies behind their starircase or under their bed. It makes up silly names for mosters and its shows that they aren't mean or scary just funny looking. It's not only a great book for kids who are afraid of monsters but for any kid who loves to read books that rhyme and joke around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Another great Dr. Seuss book. The silly rhymes and interesting pictures keep the little one's attention. And as many times a day that we have to repeat the same books, it's nice to have one that isn't boring. We can recite a few lines from the book while changing diapers and it catches the childs attention long enough to finish. Dr. Seuss is always a good choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seuss w/o the Seuss","review":"We have both the real versions of these Seuss classics and a few of these \\"bored\\" book versions... they have most of the original drawings, but not all. The text is quite different, especially in Wocket. The fun, clever rhymes that have charmed generations of kids are missing here -- the versions in the board book are quite different, and not as charming. Get the real thing, your kids deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This is a delight for kids and adults. It's fun to read out loud, with goofy creature names like yottle, nooth grush and quimney. I've read it many times to my two kids without getting tired of it. The artwork is fun and playful. What else would you expect from Dr. Seuss?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids learning about rhyming words.","review":"I am a first grade teacher in Chicago. My students came to me, most of them not understanding rhyming words. Although we did many rhyming word activities I still had students who struggled to understand and make the connection. It wasn't until I read this book to them that those last few struggling students were able to understand! I was just as excited and had just as much fun reading this book to them as they did listening and telling me the rhyming words! They even got up to dance as I read the last page really fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter Loves It","review":"My 18-month-old daughter loves this book. We read it several times a day. A lot of nonsense words that I'm slightly concerned she will think are actual words, though. That's my only caveat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and silly in a fun way","review":"We really like \\"There's a Wocket in my Pocket\\" because it, like several Seuss books, is very silly. However, what most appeals to us is how the book is designed to teach your child the names of things in the household by providing rhyming \\"clues.\\" For example, \\"there are nub boards in my ... cup boards.\\"My child really enjoys being able to complete the sentences, and this book is in her top fifteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Book for Toddlers!","review":"I have so much fun reading this book, and my children love to hear it. It is educational and silly at the same time. It is an excellent example that learning and reading can be so much fun.

All of Dr.Seuss's books are wonderful and this book is just one more example of his amazing work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this too, was not the full story","review":"This is the most disappointing for me...there's no bofa on the sofa! It was supposed to be hardcover, but it wasn't...it was a board book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure pataphysics","review":"The tone of There's a Wocket in My Pocket is whimsical, playful, and fun. Full-page, colorful illustrations in Seuss' unique and eccentric style will win over second-grade readers. Dr. Seuss, in contrast to many authors, offers a world all of his own design: lamps, clocks, and other objects are imaginatively and creatively represented. The central innovation of this book is the replacement of the first letter of common words. \\"Pocket\\" becomes \\"wocket.\\" Readers are challenged to read words phonically rather than by recognition. Dr. Seuss, having thereby invented an imaginary word, then invents an imaginary creature to correspond to the word. The central character finds some of these creatures more to his liking than others. The book is a marvel of pataphysics, a companion to the work of Lewis Carroll and James Joyce."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original!!!","review":"I just purchased this book for the second time. The first time was 14yrs ago and it was one of my & my daughters favorite bedtime books. THIS BOOK IS NOT THE SAME!!! I don't know why they changed it but it doesn't have the same feeling or the same flow! It's a very poor representation of a classic with awful attempts at rymes mixed in with Dr Suesses original brilliance! I was so mad when I got this version home & went to read it to my pregnant belly!(which btw helped my 13yr old become the best reader in her class & has always been years ahead of the rest of the kids)So please beware & try to find the original version! I truly believe that origional Dr Suess gives kids the best start in reading & learning to love books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of the better seuss","review":"my daughter does not care for this book. i think it has to do with the obsered things he calls things. they are also hard to pronounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting.","review":"I found my baby (who is 13 months old now) totally not interested in this book at all.

If you like vibes in your jazz, you get live vibes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but not as great as other Helix albums.","review":"Half Alive is the latest effort from the Canadian rockers, Helix. Fans of earlier Helix may be somewhat disappointed upon first listen. I know I was! But by the second time, the songs grew on me. The \\"live\\" portion of the album IS classic Helix. Though, due to the untimely death of guitarist Paul Hackman, the original lineup is not responsible for the live portion, Brian Vollmer's vocals are in top form. For ANYONE who has had the pleasure of seeing Helix live, I recommend this album strictly for that. If you have never heard Helix before, I suggest some of their earlier work. For true fans, though, this is a good listen!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocked. Whether your a helix fan or not","review":"When i first heard the new songs i did not like them to much.

I've enjoyed the fresh interpretations of some of his best music and the variety this adds to my music collection. All but 2 of the songs are enjoyable... \\"Calypso\\" is flat and under-sung so I skip that one. \\"Fly Away\\" is just awful... frightening, dark and sinister, amusing for about 30 seconds but way too long to tolerate. I could do without the incest overtones of \\"Mathew\\" but it's still fun. The other songs are fairly well-done.Besides, it's fun to put in at parties... a way to sneak a little JD into things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incest, Murder and Inbreeding couln't save the plot","review":"The only interesting element of this book was the freakish personal life of the family it portrayed. The only survivor of the murders, the dimwitted son Kenny, was one of two illegitimate sons born to parents who were also brother and sister. The sons, the parents and two elderly aunts lived in such a state of squallor and filth, one can scarcely imagine it. The book takes you through the long family history, the unsolved murders, and the trial that resulted in the acquittal of the only suspect. Long and unsympathetic at times, this book ends abruptly and with little closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Documentary about the people in Bigfooting","review":"This is a new documentary produced and directed by Todd Partain and his family, and it's a great one. It features Todd's story, as well as the testimonials of Bob Strain, Scott Herriott, Mike Hall and Richard Noll and their experiences. There are recreations (very professionally done) of each story, including the Skookum Cast incident. The recreation actor is also very good, the one in the Sasquatch costume. Dr. Linda Brent, a primatologist is also interviewed about her views on the Sasquatch phenomenon. It is quite a professional and well-done documentary, and highly-recommended. 5 out of 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Some good moments, but over all a lack luster production and effort compared to other Bigfoot videos to be seen and owned. If you are new to the subject and want a good jump start on bigfoot info, I would start elsewhere on higher rated videos. If you own it all already and this is your last bigfoot video, then by all means pick it up. Just OK. Not bad but certainly not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are a Sasquatch researcher I could imagine this documentary to be pretty interesting, but for the average curious layperson like me it was pretty boring - just a bunch of interviews.

They all wanted to follow in the footsteps of their idol, Reika. After dealing with jealous classmates and a pushy partner, they finally get their own gig together. But still alot of problems evolve, as they normally do in overdramtic shoujo anime like this. The major problem that this series has is there are WAY too many musical montages in it, including one scene in episode 5 that almost looks like a live-action closing credits piece. There are other decent anime titles that are about girls becoming pop idols, although they usually include magical pets that transform them Sailor Moon-style into idols! But then again, this series probably could've used some annoying talking cats to make it more interesting. For J-Pop junkies only!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book *ever*!","review":"The first book I ever read by M.L. was, By The Sword.It definately spun it's web of wonder around me, I now tryto read as many of Mercedes' books as I can! The latestbook I read was the Herald-Mage Trilogy about Vanyel, one ofthe most heart-touching books I've ever read. The beginingstarts out a tad bit slow, but from the point when Vanyelbreaks his arm, the books grow into a great action/romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misty at her best","review":"When I first started reading Lackey (Arrows of the Queen), I had no intention of continuing on to The Last Herald Mage series. I was younger then, and my first thoughts when reading about Van's -the main character- *ahem* sexuality, I was like...ew. So a few years down the road and quite a bit more experience, I finally decided to give Magic's Promise a go. Less than a week later, I tearfully closed Magic's Price. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be gingerly setting this series on my overcrowded bookshelf. This is, by far, Misty's best series. Nowhere else is there such tragedy in Misty's works as there is in this series, nowhere is there such love, hatred, suspense, magic, and self-discovery. I cannot recommend this series enough. My heart always breaks a little whenever I finish a book, knowing the characters I had grown to love will never return, but at the end of this series, it shattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"One time great fantasy!!!!!!","review":"Mercedes Lackey has a talent of putting hurt, love and hate into words. The whole Trilogy gives you a powerful sense of feeling. At first, I was pretty disappointed to learn that Vanyel was a gay, but I actually grew to love him and because of Mercedes, I believe I'll face this world liking all the gays. I think all shaych (gay) people on earth remind me of Vanyel and I've learnt not to despise this special group of people. I nearly cried while reading Magic's Price. It was very touching and it reached out to my fragile heart. After reading the Trilogy, all I could think of was Vanyel and his tragic end. All the way, Vanyel and Mercedes Lackey! By the way, I hope someone could seriously seriously consider making this into a movie cos' I believe it will gain lots of support from Vanyel's thousands of fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prue Magic","review":"Heartbreaking and beautiful ending . Oh boy do I cry when I read this one . It's hopeful too . Vanyel always knew he was going to die . Violently facing an army alone .

The romance and love between Vanyel and Stef is warm and wonderful . The price payed in the end is breathtaking and heartbreaking .

I respect it, and everything that it stands for to no end. The depth of emotion and reality in it draw the reader in instantly, despite a number of writing flaws. This isn't the best book ever-written, just to let you know, although some of the other reviews on this page would have you believe just that. In no way can this hold up to books like Tolken's, Robin Mckinley's, of Patricia Mckillip (who's writing I adore), but it is still good. The writing style isn't that amazing, but the story is. If nothing else read this book for the story, which is splendid. Every time I read this book, be it the first time of the eigth (I know that's rather obsesive), I'm struck by my love for it. Okay, I guess there isn't anything else worth saying, so I'll just stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truely masterful piece","review":"I began reading this trilogy backwards, stumbling upon a copy of Magic's Price before seeking out its predecessors. Even without prior introduction to the series or the faintest notion what it was about, I was immediately absorbed. Vanyel's isolation, devotion to duty, compassion, and morality are touching alone, but the tragic, though infinitely satisfying, plot and bittersweet ending moved me to tears. Though Lackey's works are, in general, amazing, the Last Herald-Mage trilogy is outstanding, Magic's Price in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Had this for 2 seasons now & it still is cooler outside than in next to this air conditioner!

Even though they are fairly short, they are all worth a read if you can find them. The others were Alien from the Stars (an ET-type novel), Lord of the Stars, The Boy Who Had the Power, and The Programmed Man.

Fourth album is surprisingly great and it is quite regrettable that only a few rock fans can ever listen to this masterpiece. It is no doubt one of the finest rock albums in 1997. With the exception of SIX LITTLE TWISTED MIND derived from discarded COCKROACH, the songs included are upbeat somewhat like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Goo Goo Dolls, Cheap Trick and Aerosmith, mainstream American pop rock. CAPTAIN BRING ME DOWN, AFRAID OF LOVE and JADED are my favorites. In a way it is more catchy than the next one and their best effort THE RETURN OF GREAT GUILDERSLEEVES. Only thing they need is more label support and I hope they will be back big commercially in near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just get it!!!","review":"I've listened to Danger Danger for a pretty good while now.

I tried several positions for my 1 month old, and couldnt get a comfortable fit for me or my baby. The cradle position squished her neck and head. I tried the upright position (her chest against mine), but couldnt tighten the sling enough to hold her in. The major problem is the padding, which doesn't allow the wearer to tighten it enough. And, I couldn't tighen it while wearing it. I had to constantly take it off and adjust it over and over. Overall a huge headache. I returned the thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sling is favorite carrier, though not this brand","review":"Dr. Sears books have proven to be the perfect compassionate parenting text. And his reccomendation for the sling carrier has made my baby a very happy one. It took me awhile to get the hang of it (2 weeks), but it's been worth it. My baby loves it, everyone comments on how happy and good she is, I take her everywhere, even to my medical school classes. This brand has the strap in an awkward spot, and does not come in varying sizes. So if you're not of average weight and height (5'5\\"-5'9\\"), I would not get this. Motherwear and One Hot Mama (both have websites) both sell versions that come in different sizes. Petite, Regular, Tall, and Large."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Breastfeeding Moms!!","review":"This sling is great for the breastfeeding mom! My husband and I like to eat out, but it seems that whenever we sit down, our daughter wants to eat too. With the sling, she snuggles next to me and nurses while my hands are free to continue eating. The sling is so comfortable she often falls asleep after she is done eating. It allows me privacy and a warm meal! We had a Snuggli front carrier, but she couldn't nurse while she was in it. It also smushed my breasts, was hard to get around my post-pregnacy waist and (I know this sounds weird) people (strangers) kept touching her when she was in the Snuggli with her feet hanging out. In the sling, she is in my \\"personal space\\" and people seem less likely to just reach out and \\"touch the baby\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Thing We Own For Our Baby...","review":"I got this when my baby was 2 months and started getting fussy in the evening. A month later, I am an sling enthusiast. I never use my stroller anymore because both baby and me are so much more comfortable in public places using the sling. I am not stressed out trying to navigate through crowds with a large stroller and he loves being close to mom. Breast feeding in public is a breeze with it because the baby is in such a good position and the sling provides good coverage.

I am of average height but on the slimmer side. It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain. I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone! I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me. If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.

I tried it a few times and my son seemed pretty squished in the \\"cradle\\" hold. He's only six weeks old. Also, because his weight hangs from one shoulder strap, it put strain on my back and made me feel physically unbalanced.

Perhaps I wasn't using the sling correctly...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you buy/register","review":"I'm sure this is a product many enjoy, however, I would borrow someone's after the baby is born to see if your baby will enjoy it.

While it was a bit awkward for the first couple of months, I soon discovered that our infant loved to snuggle up against my chest in the sling (couldn't with Mama...). Then as she grew, both my wife & I used the sling to travel with & soothe our daughter. She's now a year & half and we still use it as a hip-carrier - and she often asks to ride in the sling for some parental comfort.Most baby gear is totally excessive, but this is simply essential for the whole family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Start early","review":"My newborn wanted to be held all the time. My arms would get so sore after hours of holding him. Based on a suggestion from the pediatrician, I bought this sling for my 4 week old baby. When I put him in it, he peered up at me for a few seconds, arched his back, then started screaming. After a week of trying I gave up and returned the sling. I think if I had put him in it after coming home from the hospital, it wouldn't have been such a problem.

I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Over the Shoulder Baby Holder instead","review":"Neither my husband nor I could live without a sling for our newborn! We got this one as a gift but quickly concluded that it just has too much fabric, which makes it difficult to position the baby properly and securely without \\"drowning\\" her in it. And the shoulder pad is huge -- can't get it to sit right on my shoulder (and I'm not petite).We then got a Maya Wrap, but either we're not \\"advanced\\" enough sling-users or it's better for bigger babies. Too little padding. (This is beginning to sound like the three little bears...)So now I have an Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, which is just right!

We've tried the carrier occasionally since he was born and he's now 4 months old and the reaction hasn't changed. He looks as if he isn't being supported properly when he's in the sling.This is, hands down, THE worst baby product we've encountered. Spend the money to get a Baby Bjorn carrier which is comfortable for both my husband and myself and has enough support so your child is secure and well-positioned.

She's 5 weeks old and sleeps like the dead when we walk around with this. Right now we use the \\"backwards\\" method so she'll have enough support and the video that came with mine was really helpful in finding the best way for us to use it.

I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky!

I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old. I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!

I tried them all and the BEST is the Maya Wrap sling, which is so very beautiful (don't you think the Nojo sling is kinda ugly) and very versatile--I've used it as a sling, a blanket, a dog leash, a harness, and a belt. I have two and love them both. The Nojo sling cannot be adjusted well since the padding gets in the way, and cannot be packed away easily.

I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect baby sling, especially great for a preemie!","review":"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable. My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months. After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it! The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it. In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us. We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.

I tried putting the baby inside of it and he always looked to be in a very awkward position. One half of his body was twisted one way and the other half was twisted the opposite way. I just feel bad that I was unable to return it. It was a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us........","review":"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one. We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little bulky, but i still love it!","review":"Of all the places this works best for us, it is at church. I bring it with us and plop my 11 month old (25lbs.) son into it. He loves it! It keeps him happy and looking around curiously during the service and when he inevitably gets tired, I lay him down in it and he zonks out! True that it is a bit bulky, but I still love it.

However, I know the artist personally since he was a child. I have seen his work on painting dinosaurs before he was ever published and other works that he has done. I remember that you could almost feel the hair on the bodies of the Animals that he has drawn. His devotion over all his life has been to realism in his paintings and without even seeing his book, I know the quality of his art. Just buy the book for the illustrations and it it will be worth its weight in gold to the art lover. I predict that he will be one of the great artists of his time.

When news came about the release of his new book, I was delighted. So delighted that i took a copy off his desk. I hope he doesn't notice. I wasn't about to pay 30 something dollars for a book.

And it remains solid throughout with the exception of the \\"Three Minute Warning\\" and \\"Chris and Kevin's...\\" Those are both boring and stupid, respectively. Otherwise, this is the album that many Dream Theater fans had hoped the band would release the year before, instead of \\"Falling Into Infinity.\\" These are great instrumental jams with so many parts to them you lose track.

El Heavy es una serie de clich��s, estereotipos y f��rmulas ajenos a cualquier desarrollo o evoluci��n. El rock progresivo es, o deber��a ser, todo lo contrario. En este disco se dan ambos elementos, es cierto, pero de forma sucesiva, nunca al mismo tiempo. Tras un tema o parte de un tema tipicamente heavy se sucede un desarrollo progresivo que podr��a ubicarse en cualquier disco de King Crimson o de Yes, pero acto seguido esto desaparece para estar, de nuevo, alte el t��pico riff guitarrero de cientos de miles de discos metaleros.En definitiva, no pierdas el tiempo con este disco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your dough","review":"Okay, it's not as bad as one star, but I had to bring down the average.

Well, apparently it works in music as well. There's no doubt Portnoy, Petrucci, Rudess, and Levin are masters at their respective instruments, but throw their egos together in an instrumental jam session and their relentless persuit of speedy riffs and long solos sounds so manufactured that it undermines any emotional response from the listener apart from the occasional foot-tap. Take Rachmaninov, strip away the beautiful interplay of piano and symphony and you're left with most of what LTE represents: fast, well-ordered noise which most computers could be programmed to generate. This album does little more than prove that technical perfection alone doth not good music make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instrumentalists, not musicians","review":"I tried, I REALLY tried to like this album. I've been looking for good jazz rock, prog rock or whatever you want to call it. So after having read the RAVE reviews on this web site I bought the album. It is true that these guys can play; the mastery over their instruments is truly virtuosic. But for my taste they lacked musical ideas. Regular I, IV, V progressions played with astonishing virtuosity. But just no real SOUL to the music. No themes, no well-crafted melodic shape, just a flurry of notes for the sake of it. If you are looking for something with strong melodies, interesting modulations that are integral to the structure of the music rather than tacked on, something that bears repeated listening, this ain't it. We have a word for this sort of music in England; Fretwanking. Empty virtuosity. I'll give my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious rock.","review":"In my opinion, this is a nothing more than a technical statement. Go listen to Death's \\"Symbolic\\" or Celtic frost's \\"Into the pandemonium\\" if you want real progression. They run circles around these fools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Unnecessary","review":"After reading the reviews of this I expected something special. Instead it is nothing less than derivative garbage with artists that can play fast and without soul. Tony Levin has sold out to play with these losers. It would take and untrained ear to think this was something great. It's like reading a book with 1000 pages that supposes to be great because of its great number of words. They even result to whistling in unison - what a joke. Don't waste your time. This stuff belongs buried in the seventies where even die-hard fans of Yes and KC would laugh at it's bomastic tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"More listens - more ...","review":"I have to say, I've listened to this more than once and more than a few weeks apart. In many ways it is like elevator music. The keyboards are reminiscent of Utopia from \\"Ra\\". Unique then, derivative now. The guitar playing has no edge. The bass, of course, is great - but even Tony Levin is muted by this rag-tag team. If you like easy-listening, this is the music for you. If you want something challenging, try the Projeckts by the fractalized King Crimson or Polytown by Torn, Bozzio and Karn. That music will challenge your senses. This is rock for the \\"in\\" crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"To you who loved Metal in school and thought you'd outgrown","review":"Holy Cow!I'm an avid music collector, over 1000 discs now, and the first time I listened to this I said \\"oh yes, this is what I have been waiting for...\\" I graduated high school in the 80s and loved all the heavy metal that was popular back then. Of course as I've grown into my 30s my musical horizons have been expanded beyond belief, into jazz, ambient, alternative, space music, you name it. The other day I got my hands on this and it's just the ticket. All the technical mastery you could want, but in a band that delights in playing AS A BAND and not just shredding into oblivion like Yngwie. Crossed up with some funk and enough other influences to really keep you captivated. It's great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An omen of what to come","review":"Absolutely killer record. Just remember - as advised - to hit the stop button before the improvised, way overkilling last jam. That's really overdoing it - but one is faily enough warned on the back cover so no complaint - just a piece of advice.LTE \\"1\\" is stunning but lacks some of the highlights (acid rain, when the water breaks, liquid dreams) from the LTE 2 disc, so I'm saving the 5 stars for that one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dream Theater spin-off","review":"What comes to mind if you hear the names Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci, and Jordan Rudess? Right - Dream Theater! This highly creative DT subset, augmented by no less a person than Tony Levin on bass, has produced a highly impressive ProgRock album in relatively short time. Much of the material was contributed by keyboarder Jordan Rudess, who replaced Derek Sherinian on DT's latest \\"Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes From A Memory\\". Unfortunately, this record also contains a great deal of improvised music, which sounds like filler material at times, and is probably due to the short time these guys could spend together in the studio. That's why I can give them four stars only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Instrumental Rock Album I've Ever Heard","review":"Simply put, this is the best instrumental rock album I've ever heard. There is a strong influence of many of the bands these men have played with or been fans of: King Crimson, the Dregs, Dream Theatre and others. All of these influences are mixed together in an astonishlingly diversified manner with music ranging from metal anthem to experimental to ambient. These are musicians that simply decided to play whatever they wanted and are skilled enough to do just that. Despite their incredible level of individual talent, each lets the others shine, revealing a band with exceptional chemistry. This album is a must for fans of instrumental rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This is a great album! LTE is incredible! I purchased both and I actually enjoyed the second more than the first. That being said, both are really great.

If you like prog, then you will enjoy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fusion","review":"There is a great variety of instrumental rock fusion on this album. Every song has a great grove to it, and there is a great breadth of sounds. It has become one of my go-to albums for putting on my headphones, cranking the volume, and getting stuff done. Petrucci is a fantastic guitarist; however, he doesn't ruin it by over-dominating the album - this sort of sensibility is rare and greatly appreciated. Very well written and produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-RATED","review":"I don't have a large budget to spend on progressive rock CDs, so when I plunk my money down, it had better be good from start to finish or else it gets dumped on Ebay. Sadly, this one is Ebay-bound.After the initial excitement of the hot playing wore off, I realized that for every killer riff, there is an equal amount of aimless noodling that goes absolutely nowhere. But such is the nature of \\"improvised\\" music, as this purports to be. If you were to get together with your band and jam for an hour, there would be some sparks of brilliance which you would extract and build a song around. There would also be a whole lot of mediocre junk which would remain on the shelf.In the interests of being extreme, Petrucci (guitar) and Levin (stick bass) also occasionally wring some horrifically ugly sounds out of their instruments.The second LTE album is more focused.

Its lots of fun with well animated characters and tracks. The music is light, as if ripped straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. Honestly, great for kids and adults alike. And while I love racing alone, I can't emphasize the true joy of TEAM racing. Grab a multitap for your PS1 or PS2 and round up some friends. This where CTR truly shines.

I like the tracks better (much better) in CTR, and the Drivers are good (both games need improvement, the driver's skills are very close and not unique, such as, one specializing in speed, or, one with really good handling) But one thing that they tie on is Weapons.

The reason I bought this budget title on VHS in the first place is the inclusion of all those trailers, but the tape was low-quality, and worst of all, the letters GT (for Good Times) was bugged in the bottom corner of the screen, which is a personal pet peeve. Lo and behold, that annoyance has been digitally remastered and is a constant on the DVD version. Major letdown, but typical. Additionally, new (sub) titles have been added on each trailer, listing the title and date of the film at hand. In other words, if you are a fan of the novelty value of trailers, like me, then don't waste your money on this, since they get demolished on this collection.

What I got was a list of 500 obvious ideas that any idiot could have thought up, given the time. 'Put addresses in your address book in pencil so you can update easily.' Duh! These ideas are too basic and really didn't help me at all. And if I had time to implement the 500 ideas in this book, then I wouldn't need the book at all! A big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent book, some ideas dated","review":"For the price, this isn't a bad little book. For the reviewer claiming the ideas were \\"obvious\\", well, no one can possibly know everything. Any book you read will have ideas that may or may not be \\"new to you\\".Some ideas do seem dated, when the publication date is so recent, like file cards and Rolodexes where many would use PDAs or other devices. On the other hand, if you are the type who doesn't trust computers because you've had a data crash, or you just prefer paper files, actual address books and so forth, there are several good ideas here. For people who organize visually (use bulletin boards and clear files on the desk), this is not a bad book.My biggest gripe with the book is that she mentioned a lot of helpful organizing products that are either unavailable, or available only through retailers, as opposed to ordering direct from a company. And the products were mentioned throughout the book, so it could have used a separate \\"product source\\" appendix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the content, hate the form factor","review":"There are a number of book publishers out there that make books that are physically uncomfortable to read. I never thought that O'Reilly would be one of them. While I really like the content in the book, I hate the form factor. The pages are too small for the book's width.Anyway, enough said about that since it's not the author's fault. What the author has control over, the content, is great. All the basics are covered in a practical form that's easy to read and understand. The graphics drive the messages home without being overly complex.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming part of the project management cycle of their application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art of praising oneself","review":"Ah yes, the ART edition! Jolly good! The contents were promising. The editor's outline looked encouraging. And I delved into the first section: \\"the history of project management\\". It was just a shell. There was no history. There was only the author's experience at Microsoft. Yes, IE and MSN. Disappointed at that section, I flipped through to the next chapter. Same thing. A shell with no real substance. Zoomed ahead to the next chapter: again, a description of what he did at Microsoft. IE and MSN. I am glad that I just borrowed this from the library. Lots of great chapter headings but nothing substantial or useful for the practicing PM. By the way, I congratulate the author on being the PM of the MS Internet Explorer and MSN projects. One can only get better: lots of lessons to learn from those projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pratical book about team leadership","review":"There are many books about project management, and most of them focused on managing the process instead of the team. This book is unique in its focus on the project manager himself, describing his balancing act among conflicting forces in the practice of project management. It promotes the idea of \\"art of project leadership\\" instead of \\"science of project management processes\\" for the success of PM. Its emphasis on communication, leadership and good decision making is very practical to day to day practice of any PM.The only drawback is that there are no enough graphs, images or diagrams that can increase the entertaining experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift","review":"If youre thinking that The Gift is perfect for a Christmas gift, you're right.

Most of the book is written almost as an advertisement for the author's own PCOS clinic. She spends so much time touting how wonderful that she is that it is hard to read the book. It also made me wonder how accurate the information is, or if she just wanted to brag on herself and her clinic. If you get this book do not make the mistake I did and also order \\"The Savvy Women's Guide to PCOS\\" by the same author. They books are almost EXACTLY the same.

I have been a temp, and I went through many of the things these girls did. I don't want to watch a movie about it!!!

All this & the other 3 just rag on her at the end! It was so depressing how these girls fizzled out from each other & went down their own lonely paths.

It's easier to run than the hard black plastic ones but not as flexible as the fully clear expensive ones.

It arrived with a good kink in it from packaging, so I sent it back. But for people who are interested: The hose translucent, not clear. It is also very stiff. It can bend, sure, but it is not like a wire spun hose or a shop vac hose.

I would NOT recommend this book unless you enjoy being left hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of her worst books!","review":"I love Anne McCaffrey, but in my opinion this is one of the few books that she has written that is not very good. I did not like the book and had a hard time finishing it. The second book in this Series, Sassinak and third Generation Warriors are both very good and I would recommend them, skip this one unless you have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"Other reviewers may not have liked this book, but Mom & I both enjoyed it. Great concept, and it leaves things open for GENERATION WARRIORS to continue the story. Lunzie's frustration over being in cold sleep so often adds to the story tension, leading the reader to wonder not only if she will succeed or fail in what she does, but if she'll find herself in cold sleep again, and have to re-certify herself as a doctor -- again. Deals with issues that most authors may have forgotten about, such as having to get updated in technological and medical advances that occurred while she was asleep, and the whole issue of back pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the sequel?","review":"This book suffers from the ills of collaborative efforts. Although I don't know any of the details of the arrangement between McCaffrey and Nye, I'd guess that Nye wrote the book based on McCaffrey's concept.Half way through the book I began to wonder if this was going to be another of those multi-volume stories where seeds planted in the first book bear fruit but are never answered six or ten books later.If intended to be a one volume book, as another review has pointed out, this one has no ending. Nothing gets resolved; very little is learned; the main character has not changed in any remarkable way; and the story is not over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more time (no drum roll please)","review":"Poor Lunzie, nothing every goes right for her. The concept of stasis and passage of time is a conflict that many story lines have examined. I do like the problems that she faces, but I wish she would concentrate more on picking oup the pieces. I don't know about you, but most people would never leave a planet again. This is a light read and is enjoyable if you have read the other stories including the Sassinak series and dinosaur planet. Some of the necessary character development is missing in this book and relies on the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am in agreement with previous readers who found the numbers disturbing.

My child really enjoyed the illistrations and the story. I was really disturbed though when I got to page 19 and right in the middle of the steer was the numbers 666. Well, we finished reading it and afterwards I went back through it and discovered that there weren't any numbers, symbols or anything on the other steers or anywhere for that matter. So, why such a negative number on that one steer? Well, I guess I will just have to pay closer attention to what my child reads. I didn't think this happened until they got a lot older. The biggest kicker of them all is the fact that it was brought home from the school library.Sincerely, K.

It really supplements where the book fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement!","review":"The explanations in this book could be more concise for students who have other assignments to study and fulfill. Throughout all my years in reading mathematical textbooks, this one does not head straight-to-the-point.

I went to microtek support online and tried the two procedures they suggested in their FAQ's. When that did not work I emailed them with my problem. After 3 days I received their response. I seems that after spending $120.00 on a scanner and using it 6 times that my scanner has to be repaired. Their repair facilities are located in Southern California or Canada (since I am in Michigan that does me alot of good).

While I shipped it priority, they sent it back to me via ground. It took 2 weeks. When I opened it up and tried it, the screen had a bluish tint and it made noise. After more calls, they agreed to replace it with a new machine. They arranged for ground transportation and sent a \\"new\\" one back priority. The new one also had a bluish tint and made a tinny noise when scanning. After more phone calls, they felt that the scanner was performing within proper ranges.
