The gear box came, no belt, Have gotton 2 postcards saying that \\"due to the large request for the belt, it is on back order, but to expect it in 3 - 4 weeksToday is June 1, 2004, still no belt. I tried to call customer service this a.m., busy for over an hour. Tomorrow I contact the BBB. What a waste of money, although, the stores around here seem to have a hugh supply of the ultra shark cordless sweeper, makes a person wonder. The product may work good, BUT when it breaks down, you might as well throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect replacement parts.","review":"The sweeper works great. after a few months of use the battery got so hot that it melted the plastic around the terminals. I emailed customer service and got no response to the question. I also asked them how to get replacement belts, they directed me to their web site. I ordered the belts the first week of 12/03 and my credit card was promptly charged. I have never recieved the belts but I do get a postcard every 3 to 4 weeks explaining that they are on backorder and should arrive in 3 to 4 week. Well they haven't but the post cards keep comming.Customer service at 800-798-7398 has no answers. The phone at 866-694-6401 rings once then goes busy.

I ordered two new handles because the handles seem to be very weak in December 2003. They charged my credit card. I have waited since then without receiving the handles. I have called the customer assistance center on multiple times. They have sent me post cards saying that my parts are still on back order. It's hard to believe that the company can't produce simple spare parts but it seems to be the case. I am now totally frustrated and the have my money.PLease be on guard if you need service from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pfft... Not the quality you'd expect for the price","review":"Bought two. One broke inside a week. The other lasted 6 months - about average for our operation. Neither picked up particularly well when they were working. They certainly didn't pick-up better than any of the $40 vacs that we'd used before. The Shark Sweepers look like they are made of a higher grade material because they're silver in color; don't be fooled, it's plastic and light-weight plastic at that. I won't buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept but TOO BAD IT IS MADE SO POORLY!!!","review":"I fell for the infomercial so I went out and got one at Sears. I used it and thought WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT! But then it started happening... First, it didn't keep it's charge. Used it for about 5 minutes and it would stop. I returned it and got another one, thinking maybe it was just bad luck. Started using the second Shark Cordless Sweeper, about 3 days later, it would not turn off. NO matter how many times I hit the power button. So finally I got it to stop and then 5 minutes later, it turned back on, ON ITS OWN. Spooky!Took it back to SEARS and the Sales Rep told me that about 75% of all the Shark's Cordless sweepers that they sold was returned due to some sort of defective. TOO BAD!! It is a good product and concept but made SO POORLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THE SHARK!","review":"I have two dogs,hardwood floors and a wood burning fireplace and the shark picks up the hair, wood chips and dust bunnies beautifully.

I'm not kidding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Unfortunately, I am not impressed with the Shark Cordless Sweeper. I have 2000 sq.foot home that is tiled throughout.

Since I have recieved the Sweeper I mostly used it in the kitcken. I was amazed when it pick-up sticky rice. I no longer need a broom and dust pan. It works best on floors and rugs. It is weak on my thick carpet. I use it every time I feed my 17 month old. I normally do not write product feed back, but this is the first time a product has lived up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best garage sale find ever!","review":"Picked this up at a garage sale and love it, love it, love it! I use it everyday to freshen up my carpets! Because it is cordless I can zip through my entire house in about 10 minutes and my carpets look refreshed! It picks up everything except my pet bird's feathers. Don't know why it won't get those. It is so lightweight and zippy my kids can quickly do their own rooms as well.I have read the negative reviews but so far, I just can't relate. I bought this VERY USED sweeper at a yard sale five months ago and it is still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine was horrible","review":"All the stupid sweeper does is pick up things the size of a grapefruit, leaving what you really want to clean up such as dust and dirt, tossed around so much its now on your ceiling and walls, and any where else besides the vacuum dirt compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shark was WORTHLESS on typical household clean-up","review":"*** It was WORTHLESS *** I disappointly just returned my Shark sweeper.

Stick with the brand name product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I purchased this machine a couple of months ago and, like most people, thought it was the best thing since sliced bread! It worked great and I didn't have to sweep my tile anymore with a broom and dust pan. As time passed the vacuum got louder and started making that ominous grinding noise. Yesterday it basically quit. The motor hums but the roller brush doesn't move and nothing is picked up. I have owned the machine only two months and I have thrown away the box. UGH!I was thinking that maybe I did something wrong and seriously considered getting another one. I came to this site to see what others had to say about it. I keep seeing my story over and over again. I'm not sure how Amazon is coming up with a high average review, since most of the reviews have been horrible. Anyway, thank you to all who have written. It will save me another $60.00.Bottom line? Don't purchase this item unless you are independently wealthy and can afford to buy 6 or seven of these things a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 time loser","review":"In the beginning I loved my shark. It picked up all the crumbs my kids made and lots of cat and dog fur. I used it at least twice a day. After a month of raving about how wonderful it was, the handle broke off. I tried to get a replacement but the part was unavailable. Figuring I just had a case of bad luck, I bought another one. This time I bought the one with the additional side brush. The side brush was certainly not worth the additional ten dollars as it didn't do any better job than the original one without it. After a month and a half of use the handle broke off (in the same place) on the second shark. Great concept but I cannot afford the monthly replacement costs. I guess it wasn't bad luck but poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Light Sweeper","review":"I have hardwood, laminate, and carpet. I also have 2 dogs and 2 cats.

I have back problems and this sweeper is great, it would be perfect for a child or elderly person.It runs for many days on a single charge. The sweeper works OK on carpet, much better on smooth floors.It is not meant as a replacement for vacuuming, but it is good for a quick daily cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Dogs, 2 Cats, 3 Teenagers and....","review":"thank heaven for this sweeper.

I highly recommend this for any household. It is amazing how light this appliance is... it is so easy to guide it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't pick up hair!","review":"I bought this cordless vac because I thought it would be great to pick up hair in my bathrooms. I have 2 girls with very long hair and the bathroom needs to be vacuumed every day. Since the Shark has a rotating brush, I thought it would be the better than a handheld cordless one. Little did I know that I would regret my decision. I paid 59.00 for this and my husband has had to cut the hair from the brush. Then it rotates and you have to push the hair near a baseboard or else the Shark can't pick it up. When it does pick up some hair, it spits it back out while you are moving the Shark around the tiles.I am very disappointed and I can't even get my money back because we threw out the box.Does anyone know how I can send this back and get my money back. I want to buy a little cordless handheld vacuum for $19.00. It works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best","review":"After reading the previous reviews of this product, I ordered it. It is very light and does a decent job of picking up items off carpet, but when it comes to picking up dog hair off tile floors, it is a \\"no go!\\" Knowing what I do now, I would not have ordered this item. It is DEFINITELY not a 5 star product...\`2 stars is about right and 3 stars would be generous in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and still holding up to abuse","review":"I have 3 Parrots that I don't cage.

I ram the Shark over the mess until it crunches and gets picked up, right through the bird dung and everything! The brushes don't get packed and only need an occasional thread removal to keep on fighting. If you have birds you need this quick picker upper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't plan on having it work for long....","review":"I bought this sweeper/vac for my mother a few weeks back (my husband and I bought a similar type sweeper made by another company quite some time ago and haven't had problems with it ever - but as you can no longer purchase that vacuum in Canada, I ended up buying the Shark for my parents). My parents have a lot of hardwood floor, some tile and very little carpet. Within three weeks and for no apparent reason, this sweeper stopped functioning. I would not recommend it to anyone and I'm hoping the store it was bought from will still return it. Don't waste your money with this one, regardless if you are using this on primarily floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt not Replaceable... Horrible Customer Service","review":"Be very careful before buying Shark Vaccum Cleaners or Sweepers. I bought mine and in less than 2 years it started making noise so I started looking for replacement Belt, and guess what.... Shark does not sell replacement belt. Their customer service asked me to send in the whole sweeper with $20.00 for Repairs and $9.99 for S/L, thats what it costs to buy a new one. Customer service is very rude, all they kept telling is its company policy to not sell Belts... what a policy??? The only most consumed part of any Vaccum Cleaners is not replaceable and not available in market. I would never buy a Shark product again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last","review":"Worked ok - while it worked.

So, I threw it out and went out to buy another one (because I'm stupid that way). I've only had this new one for four months. I keep it clean, including all the garbage that wraps around the roller. Now, it turns on for half a second and the roller won't turn. It will be on the garbage truck come Tuesday. I will never purchase another one of these items again. They are poorly made.

Using it today it was running like normal then all of a sudden a horrible noise that sounded like the gears were stripping. The brush came on and off when it wanted to and when it was on the noise was horrible. I promptly grabbed the box and brought it right back to the store and got my $$ back. I have seen other online places give it horrible reviews and this one seems to have more positive. I am not sure if I will ever get another one or look for a better replacement. I probably got a lemon but it still leaves a bad taste for the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Do not buy this sweeper. Save your money and put it toward a real sweeper. When I received my sweeper, I was surprised to see this is just a piece of plastic, sort of like a child's toy and that is what they should sell it as, A TOY! The sweeper lasted through about 10 sweepings, then died. It won't take a charge anymore. The sweeper brush gets loaded with all the hair and dirt so when you are through using it you have to take it apart to clear all the hair etc. from the brush and in the time it takes to do that you could have hand picked the dirt off the floor. Its such a piece of crap I can't even be bothered to send it back for repair! Its not worth the time. I threw my hard earned money away on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what do you sweep?","review":"The first piece of crap I bought from this brand - Shark.You watched how they pick up those things on TV, and I thought, it's good... bought it, and you know what... it only picks up the things that it does on TV, nothing more. What do you have on the floor most of the time? Hair, dust. After a few times you use it you'll find it's not doing its job anymore cuz hair is all tangled on the motor, and you have to spend half an hour to pull your hairs out, I would rather sweep the floor with a broom. When was the last time you have lots of screws and nuts and m&ms on the floor anyway?Afterall, sharks should live underwater, not on our floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I saw this product advertised on television and read reviews and thought it would be great. Out of the box I charged the battery for 20+ hours before trying it. On the commercial it would pick up bolts off the floor but it failed to pick up dog food bits off of my floor. It seemed to perform a little better on carpet but it's really hard to roll on deep pile carpet. For me it wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love mine - I use it twice a day but it's not a VACUUM!","review":"Too bad so many people have issues with breakdowns. I think I've had mine for 3 years now and it is FANTASTIC! I have a 1 yr old and another on the way and it works great for Cheerios and other things that I don't want to SWEEP - I guess it's really just a fancy broom and dust pan but sooooo worth it for time. Hope they make it in better condition so that it stops breaking down for others.Please understand this is not a vacuum, it involves NO SUCTION at all. There is a rotating sweeping head that spins the dirt into a tray. Again, think broom and dust pan but much easier and faster! Only issue is that if you lay the head on the edge of a rug, the head stops rotating and sweeping stops. Must be used on completely flat surfaces.I've used mine on our deck for small leaves. Also I plug it in and roll it under the couch out of site. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark cordless vacuum","review":"This is the WORST appliance I have ever purchased. It worked well the first month. As instructed I waited till the battery died to recharge it. Once recharged it kept losing the charge. I would turn it on and it would just flash lights at me. I would have to check the belt, clean out the catchall, turn it on and off and pray it would work. Sometimes it would work -- but more often it wouldn't. It was AWFUL! I took it to the curb after 3 months. It's too tempermental and unpredicatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WON'T LAST","review":"I loved my EuroPro Shark, for the first few months that it worked.

All it picks up is the carpet you use it on. We currently use a non electric bissell sweeper on some rugs at our salon and thought maybe an electric sweeper would be more convenient.

I cant fix it and though it is still usable, the handle should not have been so poorly made that it breaks when you use it. I dont think this is worth the buy at all. I thought it was going to be great and it was for the first month or so. It expells stuff more than a regular vac and is a pain to clean. This thing is not worth it and I am very disappointed in it. I would not buy this if I were you... What a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Try getting a replacement battery...","review":"Don't buy this product!

Can I give it less than one star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your vacuum cleaner","review":"The shark is merely a sweeper. It does not handle long hair well, it just wraps it around the brush roller. I think it kicks up almost as much dust as it picks up and it is loud. They must mute the sound on TV.

But it just isn't powerful enough for real household cleaning. It's not low enough to get under furniture, it can't clean ledges and corners, and hates loose material like pet bedding (gets caught inside.)

Fortunately Sears has been forgiving and has replaced each one. I hope they have a charitable attitude when I return number four. The handle has broken on three of them,and two wouldn't recharge. They have all been noisy, and all have been full of hair that is all but impossible to remove from the roller. I have treated this \\"piece of junk\\" with kid gloves because when it works it performs beautifully. The concept is wonderful.

Wow, do I ever wish I would have spent my $... on two Bissell Go Vacs instead. The Shark is not as user friendly - sure,it's \\"cordless\\" and \\"rechargeable,\\" but you have to bend over to plug/unplug the cord which is at the back of the unit, versus lifting the Go Vac out of its cradle and going on your merry way. Then, there's the issue of power. The Shark does not pick up very much with the first pass - more like four or five passes on the tile floor before it makes it into the cup. When you have two dogs that shed, you need for the machine to do what you want it to do on the first try. Yes, it's quieter and the \\"ergonomic handle\\" is snazzy, but it seems to be very cheaply made. The handle broke off after several months. I hate the Shark and will go back to my trusty old Bissell Go Vac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Product","review":"I only used this item 5 times for apx 5 minutes each and it quit working and the battery will not charge any more.

Once you get yours and see how pitifully it cleans, call and ask if you can swap yours for the one used on the infomercial..I did.Keep in mind that this is NOT a vacuum. It is a sweeper. There is no vacuum created whatsoever. If it isn't picked up by the rotating brushes, it doesn't get deposited in the exit box.Since I only paid $39 for mine brand new in the box, I'm not too mad about it. It does an adequate job in my all hardwood home. I still have a stick vacuum to do the real work that this one cannot do.If you can get it for under $40, you won't be too unhappy with it. Pay over that and you're getting ripped off. Check out the many available cordless floor vacs that are at or about the same price.

I even like how you can use it on the stairs. The only problem is that it is hard to maneuver on berber carpeting, which is what I have on the first floor of my home. It still picks up the dirt, it's just harder to move along this type of carpet. It works well on high pile carpet as well as hard floors. I also like how it is so easy to empty out the dirt tray when finished.Having no power cord is a wonderful thing when you have a curious 2 year old that wants to pull the plug out of the wall when you're trying to vacuum!

I call this my \\"travel\\" vacuum because it goes anywhere!

Sure it seems kind of flimsy, but I figure it wouldn't hurt to use it in my bedroom or to vaccumn small areas here and there. It's definitely not something you'd use on your whole house, so I ended up just using it for my small bedroom. It worked great the first time, and then it started to make very loud rumbling noises after the 3rd time.. eventually~ it just died. I think the belt broke after approx. 10 times of use. The machine was so cool until the 4th or 5th time when it starts to die.

That was the 22nd of February. Today it is May 3rd and I still do not have my sweeper. I also sent in $11.95 to have it repaired. I will never buy a Shark product again.

With the exception of the battery not maintaining a very good charge (I could only sweep one room at a time before it would lose its charge) I was extremely pleased with it.However, after a few months it began making a strange sound and quit picking up anything. It appeared that the brushes were clogged and they wouldn't rotate anymore. My husband took it apart and fixed it but it was only a temporary fix.If I could have a new one every 3 months I would love this product. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money on it. I was very disappointed to have to go back to regular broom sweeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great at all!","review":"I would never recommend this vaccuum to anyone. It did not work at all on my tile or hardwood floors. I had to run things over a couple of times before it would pick them up-even little things like a down feather from the couch. Then anything hard would spit out the back. It did not work to get things out of corners. It is very light weight and almost difficult to run.

On their Web site it states that if you return the unit for repairs you have to ship it yourself and enclose $12 for return shipping. Hopefully it lasts at least a year - because it suits my needs.

And I can pick this sweeper up and carry it with just one hand. The dust bin is easy to empty and there are no bags to replace. The charge on this little sweeper lasts twice as long as other sweepers I have purchased, so that's a big plus.

Now I know I could personally lie on the floor and inhale deeply and I would pick up more stuff. All this thing does is pick up some dog hair and then spit most of it back out in big chunks. It is \\"ok\\" at picking up larger things, but if something is that big on the floor, just bend over and pick it up yourself. I wanted something that would really work well on my hardwood floors, especially on the dog hair. The people that post that it picks up pet hair must not be able to see well.

It was quiet, did the job, and I had hopes of getting the floors under control effortlessly! But there is a tiny gear which runs the edge cleaner brush which just stripped out.

No. There is no way to get replacement parts, and now I am outside the free return date...If you buy one, just use it very gently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor quality","review":"Having two young children and not much time, I bought this sweeper to do quickie clean ups on both my carpet and hardwood floor. At first it seemed to work great. The sweeper is light and easy to use. But after less than a month of usage, the handle broke off (this also happened to a friend of mine a few weeks later!). And in order to get this fixed through the warranty, I would have had to pay all shipping costs (for a total of approx. ... -- the product costs ...). It was a lot cheaper to tape the handle back on. It's been 3 months since I bought the sweeper and the motor is starting to make strange, clunking sounds. Maybe the sweeper works well for people with very, very light clean ups. But if you're like me and have dirt, hair, and crumbs that need picking up everyday, I wouldn't waste my money on this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you had a 0 star I would give the shark a zero","review":"I have been trying for days to get through to their phone line ; they tell me to go to their web site.

I have weak wrists and chronic pain, so believe me, I shouldn't have been able to do that if I tried! I called their phone number, which had a message to call another number. I tried that one and the message said it would be a 10-20 minute wait. I called back later, got the same message, but decided to stick it out. The rep that came on the phone said it would cost $8 to replace the handle!

(Now I remember why I stopped buying off infomercials.) Like everyone else who reviewed it, I found the unit to be flimsy but it worked OK for a while. I was surprised, however, when the battery pack went dead after only a few months. I had ordered a spare battery pack with the unit and expected to just pop off the battery compartment door and slide in the new pack. But I think that the expired battery pack must have leaked because the compartment door was sealed shut. So I took the whole unit apart but still couldn't get the old pack out. So now my Shark is a pile of parts in the trash can except for the handle and the \\"feather duster\\" that came with the unit.

She has to deal not only with the life-threatening blaze but resentment from her male colleagues, a sexual predator with a penchant for arson, a firefighting son who has problems with a mother as boss, and an attraction to a married reporter. As the plot picks up steam, its hard to put down, and when you have raced through to the end, you wished you had slowed down and savored the prose of a writer at the top of her craft.

The real problem here is that the ball is too heavy. With Duracell batteries in it, mine weighed three quarters of a pound.

The rim is very flimsy and lightweight, it has a hard time withstanding the weight of the force from the heavy ball.My kids use the rim with another brand foam ball.This is definitely a waste of money & a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Bachardy is lovely","review":"Don Bachardy is lovely and his prose are just as great as his paintings and drawings.

It was determine the subwoofer was defective. On this system all the speakers route through the subwoofer through a specific Bose wiring harness so the subwoofer is the heart of the speaker system. I contacted Bose and they basically said \\"tough luck, contact the seller\\". I had to order another complete system to swap out the gigantic subwoofer. As you can imagine, this was a huge inconvenience. The seller Tiger Direct has been ok as they said they would accept the first unit as a return.

They must have cut corners to make them cheaper because now this is a piece of junk. I had to return one because the butane tank wouldn't hold butane. It just leaked back out after filling. I originally called the company to get a new one, but they wanted me to mail the bad one back and then they would send a new one. It is a 59 item and they wouldn't just send me a replacement. Lousy customer service. So I went through Amazon instead and they sent me a new one and a mailing envelope for the old one.Now a second device has stopped working altogether. But it's been too long since I ordered it to return it to Amazon. I would try contacting the manufacturer but based on experience, I'll bet it would be futile.Additionally, the new childproof feature is far more annoying than the one used on the previous model.

Half the time we did not know if we were going the right direction or not.Many of these hikes are MUCH easier to find and perform than the book describes. You can just as much useful help from the guide and the tourist traps in the area.Pictures of remote wooded areas should also include pictures of the entrance areas and trail heads.The maps are not detailed enough and quite amateurishly drawn. I am not quite sure what \\"accurate\\" means to other reviewers, but here in 2012 people use new-fangled devices with GPS tracking.The historical information is the most interesting and useful part of this book.

The story line is an amoral one if not down right immoral. Gable plays the hero--a crooked gambler. Lombard plays a had-it-up-to-here small town girl ready to escape at the first offer. Lucky girl, Gable is the first offer. They marry on impulse, he thinking it is for laughs while she sees good in him that no one else can see, espcially those of us watching the film.He draws her into his crooked gambling schemes then tries to shake her but see won't leave him. I suppose, if we stretch the point, her love for him redeems him some. Can one be a little bit redeemed?Subject matter, a lack of moral characters, shower and clothes-changing scenes and see thru dresses make this film that was not shown on TV often I am sure. But as the only screen pairing of Gable and Lombard it is worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous Couple","review":"No Man of Her Own is the story of a glamorous small town girl (Carole Lombard) who longs to break free from her monotonous life as a librarian. She finds her escape when she meets Babe the gambler (Clark Gable) who makes his money by scheming with a few buddies. By the flip of a coin they are married, and they find it hard coping with each other's expectations.This film is most widely known as the only film to star the famous couple of Lombard and Gable, often thought to be Gable's only real love. The two have great chemistry and are sufficient enough to have garnered further films together; it is strange they did not, especially after their marriage.This early film utilizes some scandalous images later banned from the screen including Lombard in her underwear and Gable from the waist up in the shower.The picture is great, and the film makes use of some really beautiful shots, especially those set in the library.Overall, this is a good, highly entertaining romantic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"more lombard","review":"The only pairing of Lombard and Gable finally on dvd - thank you Universal.

It was filmed in B/W and this version is COLORIZED, i.e., fake computer generated color was added later. If that appeals to you, great. However, it is deceptive to not plainly state so in the product description. Filmed in color and artificial color added later are two entirely different things. Those of us who would watch anything from the 30's filmed in Technicolor just for the eye candy appeal could not care less about fake or enhanced B/W films. Universal is notorious for this fake COLOR thing, obviously to appeal to contemporary people who won't watch anything unless it is in color.By the way, I downloaded this from a site with a name similar to mooviebarry dot com for 87 cents.

Mr. Clarke is clearly a jazz fan who regards the days of Lester Young, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, et al. as the high point from which we have declined, and sees the present state of commercial popular music as a \\"culture of musical impoverishment.\\" The career of A&R man Mitch Miller, the evil genius whose venality and lack of taste was a landmark in adult pop's precipitous decline in the 1950s, is touchingly portrayed. I think Clarke's conclusions are correct; however, this is a matter of taste to some degree. Many will think differently, no doubt. Read it anyway, along with Will Friedwald's history of Jazz Singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhaustive and exhausting review of music","review":"All good books should tell a good story, but regrettably this one doesn't. While this tome is encyclopedic in its breadth it's lacking in depth or heart and reads like a graduate student's thesis. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfounded opinions","review":"The premise of this book was largely in editorial fashion. I accept this as his perogative however his views were often weakly supported and as a result unfounded. For example he lunches into a discussion about the racial struggles in the music industry. At the end of this section on rap music the reader only comes away with the taste of prejudism in her mouth (and I don't even advocate ganster rap music). The two stars I gave in the rating above were for the presentation of a comprehensive history which I respect. This book is required for a class of mine at the University of Toronto but the material is much too slanted for use as an introduction to the history of popular music. Therefore if you already have a good knowledge in this area and are intersted in new perspectives then this would be the book for you. Otherwise, I would reccomend you read something else first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurotrash of the lowest quality!","review":"The film that almost destroyed Jean Rollin!

Jean Rollin came in to finish it off for Eurocine (According to IMMORAL TALES, the book.) and his career suffered as a result.The story involves a bunch of German soldiers who were murdered and chucked in a lake.

If there were an award for the worst film of all times, this would be my nomination. Everything is bad from the beginning. The story itself is so stupid, that even a child would laugh at it. It is especially funny, when a braindead nazi zombie saves his daughter from another fellow monster! The directing, the camera work the clothes are all simply ridiculous. To make matters worse this horror movie is not scary at all! The English dubbing is totally out of synchron with the original French speech, which only adds to the horror!

The zombie makeup is awesome, they are basically just painted green with black circles around their eyes and throughout the movie the makeup keeps getting either washed off or rubbed off, the zombies do spend alot of time in the water. There is an extreme amount of nudity in this movie and for no good reason except for the sake of nudity (look for the scene with the troop of girls in the VW bus.)

Sure it has lots of attractive naked women, but the quality is so poor I can't even recommend it for that. Your better off surfing the net for porn. The sound effects were so bad, were talking sounds of someone splashing around in the bathtub for the lake scenes. There is no gore, infact the closest they come to it is a splash of \`blood' on a victims neck.

This movie is great for people who don't want to own porn. There really is not a lot of s-x in this film...just a lot of female anatomy flopping around, over, and under. If you don't want to see it as a horror film, then just buy it for it's naked qualities. The story line is basic, yet confusing, yet awful.

Bad drawing (color but not full color like the previous aliens, only a \\"old fashioned colored comics\\"), bad story (nobody wants to visit Earths, even for rescue!).IMHO Skip this comics and go ahead for the rest of the serie.

This is one of these. The author James Fenimore Cooper was of a rare breed who (like Washington Irving & others) were so gifted with a fluent eloquence of such vivid visual expression... As though drawing life itself from their surroundings, they penned their colorful breathing imagery to page with such descriptive intensity, that from the very opening pages we feel ourselves drawn into the lives of our Native American & Colonial forbears of the Hudson Valley & Adirondacks--- becoming one of them again in the present as the written pages fill us with as seemingly familiar recall..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I took the AP US History exam this year and ended up purchasing three review books.

It's 600 pages, but it's a lot better than a textbook and covers everything you'd ever need to know about AP US. If you're really a slacker, you could probably get by using this as your primary textbook in your AP US class and forget those boring college books like The Enduring Vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product Great service","review":"I was very pleased by the quality and price of this product.

I have tested the fancy military matches and they pail in comparison for several reasons.#1) you can hold more in a container because these don't have the unusual fat end that the military matches. Basically your container will hold 2x as many of these matches with a better light.#2) These matches light up right away on the first strike compaired to the military type that has such a thick waterproof coating that it is difficult to get them started. The thick coating on the military type also makes it difficult to light your match on the first strike and the striker will wear out soon, with the coghlan type they consistantly light up smoother with a very hot flame.#3) The shorter shank gives you more possibilities with portablity without compromising function. In short these are the ones to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A basic play gym","review":"I looked at several different gyms got really confused but finally decided on this one because it did not make sense to spend more as my son is almost 5mths old. It does not have all the bells and whistles like the more expensive ones and comes with 5 hanging toys - a flower ring, sheep,some kind of vibrating bug, a horse ( which looks a bit crazy with the eyes they put on it - it was the first thing my son pulled off and chewed on) and the so called melody maker.This hanging mobile is very sensitive and would play music at the lightest touch (thank god for the off switch). I would not exactly call this a musical toy because it plays only 3 or 4 songs less than 10 secs each.But on the up side is it really (really) colourful and captivating and most importantly my son enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Like It!","review":"I bought this a few months ago. At first, my baby didnt know what to think about it because of all of the toys. The second day, she loved it! There are so many things for her to explore both on her back and on her tummy. The music piece is loud as the other reviews suggest, but I put masking tape over the holes of the music box and it made the sound just right! I would definitely recommend this playmat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for a tummy time hater","review":"My 10 week old loves the crunchy parts on the mat and the mirror. The mat is pretty cushy so you can put the baby on it on a hard wood floor. I like that the flowers can be used as a teether and that every animal (except for the horse) makes a noise when pulled on or shaken. It comes with one extra link that I use to hang a little lower whatever toy I'm trying to interest her in. It's expensive but I can see us using this for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I purchased this as a gift for friends and while their baby girl is still a little young to enjoy it, it will be a wonderful addition to her development \\"toolbox.\\" This particular baby gym is bright and colorful, has plenty of toys and bobbles and is inexpensive. Whilst the gym arrived in a box that was far too big for it, shipping was extremely fast. I'm very happy with this purchase, thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, cute, and portable (mostly)","review":"We bought this so that our daughter would have her own space on the floor to play and it has worked perfectly. The hanging items keep her entertained without overloading her. There are even items sewn onto the floor so that she has things to keep her interested while on her tummy. The only issue that I have on this item is that the motion activiated music box is of low quality (have to dissasemble it to turn it on/off, sound quality is bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 month old likes it....","review":"I wanted to plug my ears and crawl under a rock to hide from these guys.

We own all of the Wiggles videos and for the most part have been very satisfied. HOWEVER, the Wiggles put this out as a NEW video, even labeled it 2000. It is obviously their oldest video. The music is boring and could lull you to sleep. It is impossible to believe they are actually calling this a Dance Party. Do not waste your money or your time viewing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggles kicking it old school!","review":"i bought this dvd even after i read the horrible reviews on amazon but after watching it with my 2 young children, i realize it's not all bad. yes the production isn't as high tech as the new releases, but it is nice to see the guys starting out.(i swear Anthony is wearing a greenish shirt. Why did they decide on a blue wiggle and not stick with the green?) Also the two different Captain Feathersword(one being Anthony the other his brother) were no where near as good as Paul(the guy you all know and love as the captain) but it was nice to see how even that character has evolved! Not all that bad dvd and the music still sounds the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son is mesmerized by this one","review":"Our first Wiggles tape was Wiggle Time, which is what my wife and I compared all the other tapes to. When we watched this one, we didn't think our 22-month old son would like it because of the low-budget production compared to the other Wiggles tapes we own. Boy were we wrong. He watches this one the most and doesn't want to fast-forward through any of the songs. Also, because it's not as well choreographed as the others, the Wiggles movements are simplier and more silly, and he tends to imitate their movements more.Definitely a worthly addition to your Wiggles collection. Get ready to Wiggle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiggles cashing out? Not too hot...","review":"Our 2 year olds love the Wiggles, but they actually walked out of the room on this video! Almost looks like The Wiggles are cashing out by publishing obviously OLD videos of theirs as a \\"new release\\". Maybe its their publisher doing this, but the quality is poor compared to more recent productions, and some of the songs are actually pretty lame (also compared to more recent productions). If you are a Wiggles fanatic, you'll probably buy this anyway, but you'll be disappointed. If you're new to The Wiggles, don't buy this: buy Wiggle Time, Wake Up Jeff, Toot Toot, or Yummy Yummy instead. Those will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"We love The Wiggles but..... This was not good!","review":"The new video Dance Party must have been when they just started out cause even the Big Red Car was made out of plywood.

Wiggle Time was a big hit (and still is) with my 18 month old granddaughter but this movie was not. After 15 minutes of watching Dance Party she pulled out the old Wiggle Time and try to insert it into the VCR. I couldn't blame her the video looks worst than my backyard movies, the sound is no better and the foursome act like they would rather be someplace else (not to mention that Henry the Octopus' head looks as if it will come off any minute).

My son received it from Grandma for Christmas and it's the only Wiggles video that I just can't watch... Their clothes and props are cheaply made. They all need to shave. And Anthony's hair! He looks like a wooly mammoth. Even my son, who is three said \\"Those wiggles dirty, need bath, Mommy\\"... It's really deceptive packaging that upsets me with this video.

I think that is too much songs without something else between it that can make the video more entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiggles - Dance Party","review":"As you will see in the other reviews, the quality of this video is less than spectacular. The lighting is poor, the costumes are not first class and the overall production is not up to Wiggles standards. If you have any of the other Wiggles videos, you'll know all the songs. That being said, my 2 yr old son still loves it. Kids aren't as subjective as parents when it comes to production values. And this video has been played at least 50 times since we've bought it. The quality wasn't what I expected from previous videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible--should be reproduced completely","review":"My 2 kids are devoted Wiggles fans (ok I admit it, I like them too), but the production quality of this video is just terrible. This must be one of the first videos they ever made. They don't even have any Wiggles logos on their shirts, and it looks like they woke Anthony up off a park bench and put him in the film. Also, Capt. Feathersword is played by at least two different guys (one of them, yep Anthony), which drew protest from my oldest (I think Capt. F is his favorite character). The Big Red Car is nothing more than a painted cardboard prop. The ONLY thing that makes this video worth buying (and I don't recommend it) is because they guys have their trademark creativity and silliness, which is somewhat lacking in their more recent productions. The songs are ok, and this would probably be a decent video if they would only reproduce it according to modern Wiggles standards. My advice: Buy Wiggle Time instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING-NO PAUL PADDICK","review":"My son loves Captain Feathersword and I bought this video when he was home sick with the flu. He was sooooo upset that Captain Feathersword was played by someone else (Anthony or one of his brothers). I didn't think the video was that bad--I liked the songs at least. But I wouldn't have bought it if I knew Captain Feathersword didn't appear. And I did check the date on the packaging to see how old it was. The packaging says 2000 but it was made in 1995. I do feel cheated and my son was very disappointed. He hasn't once asked to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiggles Rehash","review":"This is really aweful. My son loves the Wiggles so I thought I was buying a new one.... What this tape actually turns out to be is an aweful rehash of the earliest Wiggles tapes.

Even my son doesn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't keep my kid entertained","review":"I felt bad buying this CD for my child ($16 at that). The video was made in such poor quality and it looked like something made back in the 80s.

Sorry, but this video could not keep my little one entertained!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy \\"classic\\" Wiggles","review":"This DVD is awful! My 18 month old can even tell the difference. It looks to be from at least 5 years ago, well before The Wiggles were successful. And it shows. The quality of the video itself is poor, and the performances are not much better. Very amateurish. I strongly suggest staying away from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"An older DVD","review":"I was excited to unwrap this dvd until I watched it. The audio is poor and it is probably the first video they made. It leaves alot to be desired visually as well. They had to start somewhere, but this seems like a bootleg copy of a concert. The wake up Jeff VHS is equally as poor with the audio and visual aspects. The big red car is card board in both videos.Be sure to look at the year of release. If your kids love the current Wiggles they will probably not be interested in either of these.I admit I was interested to see how blazay the Characters were at first and how awful the clothes were. Anthony was Cpt. Feathersword before they got Paul Paddock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading","review":"I admit my son and I are huge wiggles fan but I was very dissappointed in this video i bought just the other day. On the cover it says 2001 and has the wiggles on the cover and on the back as they look today and it doesnt say anything about it being an older video. My son loves captain feathersword and he is played by 3 different people in this video!!! Anthony and his brothers, Paul paddick isn't even in it yet. My 4 year old nephew saw it and said what the heck is wrong with Dorothy! The only thing is it was pretty funny to see how far they have come but it was not worth my [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not recommend","review":"My son loves the Wiggles Toot-Toot & Wiggle Time videos but this one is terrible.

We are very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!","review":"Hi Everyone: I am a Dad of a 2 year old that loves the Wiggles. Actually I wonder if I like them more than she does.

Read the other reviews to get a bigger picture of the book, but if we need any piece of liturature at all, at this crucial time in our history as a species, this is it. Open your mind, and then this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read","review":"Period.Update: It's now a little past ten years since my initial review, and I still heartily stand by it. Seth Speaks sits on my bedside table, and if I'm up in the middle of the night (which I'm finding happens more often as I approach 60), inspiration is at hand. Whenever I reach the last page, I sigh....and start over. Have probably read it 40 or so times by now, but there's lots of light bulbs turning on up above my head with each new reading. Amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fan","review":"First, thanks to all who have so eloquently expressed their experiences with the Seth material. It is re-affirming to know that so many feel as I do when I let my soul dance with the insights offered in the books. The very nature of the book rings so true to me. I was simply astounded when I first read this book back in the late 70's. The material had and has a strong sense of authenticity too it that I felt was legitimate. I felt a strong sense of soul energy at work as I let go and absorbed information that was flowing into me. It's been 15 years since I last fully read the book. I am now re-reading it and it's as powerful to me presently as it was the first time, 20 years ago. Finally, if this is not for you, it's not for you. You will know before you turn to the second page in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read of my life.","review":"If you are looking for the truth. If you have been looking for the truth.

I'm a huge fan of Oi! While the songs on this ablum, like \\"Skinheads in Stapress\\" and \\"Violence in our Minds\\" are definitely classics, often covered, the recordings are so poor and tone-deaf that it's almost impossible to listen to. Roi is definitely not at the top of his game, and the guitar is actually out of tune for half of the songs. Sometimes I wonder if reviewers actually own the album or simply review well from the strength or LR's reputation. If you want to hear the best recordings of LR, get the Death or Glory split. You get their best performance along with some great material from a great Oi band, Combat 84."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Inspires You?","review":"Listening to artists speak about their process helped get the inspiration burning in me again too. A good film for any artist of any discipline ~ and for art students too.Unexpectedly I learned the most from the disciplines most unlike my own -- the choreographer said things which helped me think in new ways (example -- \\"why do artists think they should simplify? Think of a Forest -- a forest is complex, it is not on a human scale -- there is something different to notice every time you look at it. The complexity makes it interesting.\\") Also the concept of time in art -- and when is a piece of art \\"finished\\"? (Nora the sculptor feels something is finished when it feels it has been born; the dancer and choregrapher say a piece is never finished, is always changing) Compelling thoughts too from David Bowie -- \\"People think artists somehow KNOW more than other people.

I have also heard it performed live with Kurt Masur and I must say that this recording is the best of them all. His tempi are sublime, his sense of phrasing is masterful and he doesn't have to deal with time constraints of recording on vinyl so he takes all the repeats that he wants. It is an excellent recording and well worth the money.

If you want to read a really good medieval mystery, prepare to be disappointed. If the choices are reading this or People magazine, pick this up. While better than some others I've read, the ending is so contrived as to be ridiculous. I won't give it away but suffice it to say that it relies on a Deux et Machina twist so hamhanded that it made me regret wading through till the end.Oh, and I agree with those who call Sister Fidelma a self-righteous prig. She certainly is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good second volume in an unusual historical series","review":"Shroud for the Archbishop is a successful second volume in the Sister Fidelma series. The very detailed descriptions of Rome in the seventh century Dark Ages provide a good background to an interesting puzzle that is solved by a well-matched pair of sleuths. However, this second book and therefore the series labor under two disadvantages. (1) A lot of background social and historical information is repeated from the first volume, so smoother narrative for readers of an earlier volume is traded for accessibility to new readers. (2) Characterization falters because the role of Brother Eadulf of Canterbury is weakened. In this second volume, he is much more a Watson-like foil to Sister Fidelma and a less acute personage in his own right. Patronizing replaces parity. For me at least, that reduces the dramatic interest of the story.Still and all, Shroud for the Archbishop was pretty good and future volumes in the series are worth taking a look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Irish mystery","review":"I read an earlier \\"Sister Fidelma\\" mystery and enjoyed it. My local library didn't have this one and it's the next one in the series. This was the first time I ordered from Amazon. Friends have been raving about it for years, but I'm a library person. Anyway -- service was great, the book, although used, was in good shape and the story was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"While this book is, at its best, interesting, it is mainly a mire of predictability and has an overpowering sermonic bent. Sister Fidelma is written as being almost superhumanly righteous. It's quite difficult to like her. The adoration of her ethnic background is heavy-handed. The behaviour of the characters is definitely a bit modern for the time setting. Sister Fidelma is apparently a 17th century Catholic, but her views really seem to differ quite strongly from the religious standard of the day. Peter Tremayne, however, shows some promise as a writer. The book was quite readable, just improbable, and irritating at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended - very cute story!","review":"When Wiggles the Duck was little, the children loved her and played with her all the time. Now no one notices her. Wiggles lives with the Walaces, in the backyard with her three beagle friends. When the children get home from school, they take the beagles for a walk with their mom, and sometimes their dad goes too. But they never take Wiggles.One day while she practices barking, which sounds more like \\"Quarf!\\", she bumps the latch on the gate and it comes open. At last, an opportunity to go for a walk. When a car blares it's horn, she hurries back to her yard. But later she tells the beagles what happened, and they convince Wiggles to show them how she opened the gate, which leads to a scary adventure.Wiggles teaches a great lesson to young children about being happy with one's self. With humor, wonderfully simple art, and a deft touch, Susann Batson has created a lovely story for young children. I certainly hope to see a lot more from this children's author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew out on third flash.","review":"Everything is cheap about this product.

For example, many of the trees do not have photos or drawings of their leaves. Some only show a long distance view of the tree and nothing else.

My husband noticed these and that's a lot to say, he said they were beautiful and very \\"lady like\\". On the small side (check the description) but that's the size I prefer anyways; if you are looking for a statement piece these are not your pair of earrings.

I bought this and the .925 sterling silver princess cut CZ (from Gem Avenue) as engagement rings because some of the reviews mentioned that the 'stone' on this ring was a little larger than expected. I wanted a small (less than 1k stone), and this was just too big on my hand. I had originally really wanted a round-cut but the princess-cut has a smaller 'stone' and I actually ended up liking the cut better after comparing the two. This is still a nice ring for the money though! Gem Avenue's shipping is quick also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and very real-looking","review":"I have to say that the reviewer who stated that the CZ was slanted in the setting was right -- it is! BUT, it is hard to tell unless one removes it from the finger and examines it closely. I am very happy with the ring. I have a real one exactly like this one but since I dropped it down the sink once and had to have a plumber retrieve it for me (paid the plumber $125), I decided to get a look-alike for daily wear. :) I am very happy with this ring and have been a loyal gem avenue customer since I purchased the first item from them in the summer!

I thought it was for children who love puzzles. My 13 year old has put together several of these types of puzzles, this one was not quality. Customer Service seemed to be aware of the issue. They did refund so me being a fair customer tried another and the same thing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"glue and patience are a must","review":"The model is supposed to be interlocking, but due to the low cost of manufacture, the stamp-cut pieces are not precise enough to stay assembled with out glue. If you have lots of time and patience then the model can be built, but we felt that the time investment wasn't worth it and would not be reflected by the average quality of the model when finally completed. My 11 year old son and I quit after several afternoons of working on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not reccomend this product","review":"I bought a few of these for my twelve year old son and they were very difficult to put together.

The puzzle looks really cool but the quality of the pieces is bad. I had many pieces that I had to re-cut holes that were not made correctly and several pieces broke trying to take them off of the sheet to start. Some pieces would not fit or stay in place since it was cheaply made. If you buy this I would recommend having an Exacto knife and glue handy. You'll need both.

When I first started listening to Benson's music, Lapalco ruled my radio for weeks/months. After listening to his music for some time now, I regularly change from Lapalco to The Alternative To Love to My Old Familiar Friend. I have not listended to One Mississippi very much, so no comment, but I will be getting that into rotation very soon. I am very much anitcipating his new album in April 2012 and have pre-oredered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Benson's previous two albums are among my very favorites, but this one--which by the way should not have needed two years to make--is just awful. None of these songs has the appeal of anything on Lapalco, and there are more than a few that outright stink. What happened to Benson's genius for melody and hook? And have I overlooked his overuse of simplistic rhyming couplets before? I mean here everything is truly the moon-june-spoon variety. Once you start paying attention to it it becomes painful to listen to.I suppose it's been the collaborative influences of Jason Falkner on the last two albums that made them so great. It's such a shame, because I'd been looking forward to this for ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated","review":"This stuff isn't that good. There are a couple Cars-eque rockers that are cool but other than that I don't see what the big fuss is about? At the end of the day Benson's work is all mediocre.

The waste is probably mandated by the size of cartridge that is required to fit into the machine. If you can get beyond wasting 100 feet X 9/16\\" worth of material to have a perfect 1/2\\" label, then you will love this machine. I have been using this machine (QL-650TD) for about a year now and have nothing but good things to say about it.UPDATE: I actually use the \\"waste\\" to seal the envelopes I put the labels on.

Granted, there is a shameful (on the part of the manufacturer) waste of paper, but it is cost-efficient for me. As another reviewer mentioned, the excess can be used to seal envelopes.....However,.....the last cartridge (1/2\\" continuous) I received (from Amazon) barely sticks to itself, let alone other surfaces. I still print the labels (for neatness sake), but have to anchor them down with tape. I hope this cartridge came from a bad batch, rather than a change in manufacturing. I'm glad I only ordered one, this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE!","review":"This tape works well and has the required size, only half of the paper is used! The other half is totally wasted since it looks the manufacturer used the same size roll support and paper as in the 1 1/7 inch roll and just scored the strip in half! I have not found a way to use the wasted half, I tried to fool the machine and she (must be a she) is smarter than me. No way trying to roll it back on the support since you have to cut your labels so you end with a lot of tiny blank labels you cannot use in the printer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3\\" Medical Paper Tape","review":"Just what we needed.

Dr. Fleiss and his co-authors have a way with words, bringing the reader through the book with ease and making a very tough subject very entertaining. Yes, 'entertaining' might not seem an appropriate word for such a subject, but when the reading comes this easily - when the ideas and stories seem to rush out from the page, enlightening the reader seemingly effortlessly - then the reader is enjoying a show of wordcraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks for this book!","review":"This book convinced me that circumcision would be a mistake for our baby after about 12 pages.

Nothing in the book led me to believe so, and I haven't looked.There are some interesting historical and business sidelights, however this does not compensate for the lack of solid technical information. The author is now a Microsoft employee, and has taught VB. I certainly would not pay Microsoft's prices for training of the same quality as this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously for beginners only","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a novice beader yet this book was below my expectations. It is my second book I purchased and I am selling it at a flea market. I must say I learned about the difference in tiger tail and flex wire and also how to crimp a bead properly - that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.

On the plus side, there is good information on tools and materials and instuctions are easy to follow with good photos. On the down side, of the 53 projects there are only 3 or 4 that I would actually make and a whole lot (30%+) that would appeal only to pre-teens. Factor in another 25-30% for \\"home accents\\" and \\"accessories\\" (candle decorations, napkin holders, etc.) and there isn't much left if you are interested, as I am, in jewelry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for beginners","review":"If this is your first beading book you might find useful information here. If you've been beading for some time this book offers nothing, the projects are way too simple, more for kids than adults.

This book failed to do so by reproducing a mixture of facts and fiction. Moreover, Chapter 9 is composed of heavily lifted content from various science fiction books and comics (often intended to discredit Tesla's name and work). Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book for any audience.Get the book recommended by American Academy of the Advancement of Science \\"Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla : Biography of a Genius\\" by Marc Seifer.I would also recommend \\"Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla\\" by Pulitzer Prize-winning author John J.

I found the conjecture regarding Tesla being an Atlantean engineer, incarnate; and the co-founder (with Marconi) of a city of the future in South America -- well I'm sorry, but who needs this. On the other hand, the photos of UFOs were as good as any I have seen. On the plus side, the copied material (Tesla letters, patents and court transcripts) was interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin boys love this!","review":"I bought this for our 4 year old twin boys (one is Autistic) and BOTH really enjoy this game.

The twins really love this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"With the amount of available recordings of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony out there, I would avoid this one. While I have heard countless interpretations of this masterpiece, I have never heard such a rushed and impatient rendition of the slow movement. Although the outer movements are not bad, they lack the texture and tone color necessary for this work. The Andante, which many musicologists credit with kicking off the Romantic Era of composition, is played so fast that it is impossible to appreciate. The beauty of art music is that it is open to interpretation. And yes, none of us knows how Beethoven himself envisioned the tempo. What we do know however, is that with all the energy in the outer movements of the Ninth, the slow movement can afford to be played at a tempo that allows the listener to \\"smell the roses.\\" Stick with the Bernstein, Masur or even Karajan for this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Price/Performance","review":"I got this bino at an airport dutty-free as an emergency replacement of my 8x40 bino that was broken by the luggage service at another airport during a trip, my main usage is for birding and outdoor. It is a very good built binocular with a very good optical performance. It produces bright and contrasted colorfull images and 8x and up to the midle of the zoom range. At 16x it still good but not as in the first half zoom range. The optics show very small achromatic aberration and the images are sharp almost from edge to edge. The body has a rubber/plastic armor protecting it that provides a good grip. The controls (dioptry, focus and interpupillary distance) are very smooth, I only miss pop-up eyecups."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as reviews sugested","review":"I bought these for scanning areas for wildlife and then getting a closer view of what I found, but they do not seem to sit well when I hold them up to my eyes and the focus and lens quality on them is poor. I have had cheap zoom binoculors before and these are right down there with the worst. I also have a pair of bushnell 10x42 and these are not great but I have to say i prefer to use them. unfortunatly I do not have $500 for quality bins but these are not good and constantly need adjustments. Next time I would make sure I try the binoculors before I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful for anyone launching an affiliate program","review":"This book certainly helped me organize my thinking while putting together an affiliate program. Although it seems aimed at larger organizations (the authors envision an entire department running the affiliate program), smaller merchants will find a lot of solid advice.

I only had a competitive small blaster in which the darts fell apart in days. I can't say what it was because it breaks the rules of review. The range is excelent and so are the looks, quality and features. Unfortuately mine didn't come with the other blasters but that's because it was an old model. I didn't know any better so I held my peace. It is very high quality and it has a sight. You might wonder why nerf products are always so high rated and just as high priced but they deserve it and are worth it. My recommendation is to people who are always being shot at because first of all you won't be shot at anymore when people see it and second of all you won't loose the tough bullet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nerf-n-Strike 3 in 1","review":"This is a three in one nerf gun with air-driven darts and one air driven missile. The first unit we got had a malfunction in one of the units, corrected in the replacement.Pluses- lots of fun, essentially harmless in the hands of responsible kids, good safety mechanism to prevent shooting oneself with the missile while charging the launcher.Minuses- Impossible to find replacement darts locally. Maybe a little too much technically for a toy- includes a pressure gauge, pass throughs for air so three units can be charged and operated as one. Joining mechanism is engineering plastic and will break sooner than later. Don't get this if you live in an apartment, or have delicate knick-knacks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this gun.

While her father is shooting with the hornet she shoots the scout or vice versa, and they play as a team against the dvd. I personally like the mega-missile!

Santana goes back to the gabber genre with this CD, and it is his most brutal yet. Every song is delivered with extremely intense energy, each beat pounding into your skull relentlessly. While this is Santana at his most intense, I don't think this CD is his best. That honor is reserved for \\"Hardcorps\\", Santana's first gabber compilation on the Moonshine label. Every song on that CD was incredible, mixing brutal beats with actual melodies. \\"Hardcore for the Headstrong\\" abandons melodies for speed, and while speed is, of course, a vital component of gabber, these songs become somewhat repetitive after a few listens. While Santana is still a master in the genre of mainstream hardcore music, he took a step backwards with this compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 star WWII submarine picture","review":"\\"We Dive at Dawn\\" is a very good British production with an outstanding cast.

To destroy their target, they must find their target - somewhere deep in enemy-controlled waters. The captain navigates his submarine past nets, mines, and enemy destroyers, and then must clandestinely obtain fuel and oil from an enemy-held port for the return voyage.This tale of submarine adventure was made with the support of the British military in the darkest days of WW2, so the boats you see really are warships and not Hollywood mock-ups. The plot is fairly predictable and the overall production is hindered by thick British accents at times, but its still a good late-night war movie. \\"The Enemy Below\\" and \\"Torpedo Run\\" are better, but this film is British and made under war-time conditions, so that counts for something in the \\"Authenticity\\" department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Example of Brit Wartime Morale Raiser","review":"This, to my knowledge, is the best available print of this film.

The 1946 Technicolor process is astoundingly rich and most of the movie is filmed outside, against mountains, lakes, forests, meadows, and farmland. The story is flimsy, involving hionest-to-a-fault Dana Andrews taking care of wastrel Brian Donleavy because Andrews harbors a distant love for Donleavy's fiancee, Susan Hayworth. There is a very violent fistfight in a bar, precursor to the famous one in \\"Shane,\\" and the Indians' burning of settlers homes is terrifying.

By the time you've gone through all twelve tracks, you've gone through a gamut of vivid emotions, from the fun energy of \\"Is It for Me?\\" to the angry hell-with-it-all slammer \\"Hold Her Down\\", from the wonderfully dreamy \\"Pray Your Gods\\" to the hear-me-now existential angst of \\"Stories I Tell\\". And it all finishes with the introspective \\"I Will Not Take These Things For Granted\\".A great CD from a great band. Farewell Toad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You may ask yourself, \\"Is It For Me\\"?","review":"\\"Fear\\" is Toad The Wet Sprocket at their commercial peak. I personally like the first two albums more, but this is definitely a great album, and their most popular. Their two biggest hits are from this disc, those being \\"Walk On The Ocean\\" and \\"All I Want\\". However \\"Hold Her Down\\" and \\"I Will Not Take These Things For Granted\\" were also minor hits, and the rest of the album has its share of gems. There's also the retrospective \\"P.S.\\" which has the hits on it, and an excellent live disc \\"Welcome Home\\" covering the first three Toad releases. All are recommended, as well as Glen Phillips last solo disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME.

It's a great CD that sounds like a 'best of'. I would recommed it to anyone interested in good thoughtful music.I'm going to start acquiring some of their other CD's soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest albums since REM.","review":"Toad the wet sprocket's \\"Fear\\" is one of the finest CDs I have ever listened to. Catchy and melodious tunes such as \\"Walk On The Ocean\\" and \\"I Will Not Take These Things For Granted\\" is focused on Nature, and their smash hit \\"All I Want\\" is focused on being you. Their style and creativity in music has originality and the way they deliver it to the people was remarkable. One review in 1992 was right...Toad The Wet Sprocket could be a great threat to REM's throne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couple of awesome tunes","review":"Fear is only my second Toad CD purchase, and I must admit that I'm a little happier with Dulcinea, but it's still a good one.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Awesome","review":"The video quality is not clear and after 5 minutes the content seems repeatative and rather boring.

Found it quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really work at all","review":"I have a few capacitive devices, and I thought a stylus would be good for those cold winter days. This stylus works by compressing an air-bubble inside the tip, as it isn't a solid tipped stylus. Because of this, you really have to jab into the screen to get it to work at all, and dragging along the screen is extremely hard to achieve. Overall, a complete waste of money for the price, as its barely useful as a stylus at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love the movie, i love the show","review":"This video is great all the touched by an angels are great!if you have any christian values at all, i think that you'll just love this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries hard, falls flat.","review":"I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this review, as this film just isn't worth the effort.

One of the least funny comedies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI- would have been rated R","review":"It wasn't what I was hoping for. There were some funny scenes, and it was an interesting slice of life in another culture, however, it was a slice that I found unpalatable. Too much boozing, lack of consideration in intimacy. I would be glad to have most of the characters NOT my neighbors. I purchased the DVD because I like the Laughing Samoans, I have been to a number of Samoan festivities, and I was looking for something light and humorous. I was going to give it to the Pacific Islander Support group on campus, but decided the negative far outweighed the laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sione's Wedding","review":"This movie is hilarious! Well worth seeing... only, I saw this in theaters while in New Zealand. And it could just be nostalgia, but I must say that the US release screwed things up by re-naming it Samoan Wedding.It rather stereotypes Samoan culture and doesn't represent the movie well at all! Considering Sione's Wedding is more about the antics of 4 Auckland guys who try to get on Sione's guest list... and not Samoan culture. The actors are perfect, as well. They are really funny and have the timing down pat. If you've ever seen BroTown (a cartoon from New Zealand similar to South Park but not as brash) then you'll know what kind of humor I'm talking about.Overall, great movie! But PLEASE call it Sione's Wedding!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The male answer to the chick flick with comedy, hip-hop, and brotherhood","review":"I saw this movie at a film festival and I have to say that it's good to finally see a movie from an ethnic male's point of view. The story is about four guys who are into hip-hop, women, and hanging with the fellas. What makes this movie is this look into Samoan-New Zealand culture and how males in that culture deal with the pressures from mainstream society and their own community on issues of dating, sex, commitment, etc. The only time we get to see something like this is in U.S. movies like \\"The Wood\\", \\"Hanging with the Homeboys\\", most recently \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\". So I recommend this movie because it's good to see how other folks around the world deal with the same issues and more than anything it's good to see a movie with an all ethnic cast that has a positive message. Plus if you were thinking about a place to travel, you want to go to Auckland after watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasp+Lock: Awkward Combo","review":"Not that it doesn't work, it does. But it works best when the door and the frame provide a perfectly flat surface for installation. The door I secured, the back door to an old house, is hinged to open inwardly from the outside. The surface of the door is flush with the door frame only on the INSIDE of the house but inset when viewed from outside. (Too bad I wasn't trying to lock things inside the house.) I had to mount the hinged side onto the door frame at a 90 degree angle so that the closed door covered the mounting screws. The hasp receiver I screwed into the door itself. Looks and it is substantial when the door's closed, but when you open the door with the hasplock closed the door will open about an inch before the unit stops the motion. That ruins the substantial look in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I got this for my 2 year old drandaughter .She enjoys it.We have tryed to break her from biting but nothings work and so far this has helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Conflict Resolution","review":"It was so good to see a couple with such commitment to communication.

You can look at dozens of photographs of the artist in his studio or at a local cafe, but it isn't until you put his visage together with his voice, his mannerisms, his facial expressions, and the way he responds to a question that you begin to sense what he was really about. Giacometti was a rarity, \\"the last of his kind\\" as he put it and represents something that may be too often passed off as cliche--a man trying, without pretention, to come to terms with himself in an infinite and disinterested universe. Why four stars instead of five? Because it just wasn't long enough. And I never would've guessed he didn't have any front teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Good to be True","review":"Buyer Beware.Item delivered was correct model but did not have ball bearing slide drawers.

I thought the computer just like warm weather because it start to work in 65 F +.Now it seem like it does not work more that it does in any temperature. Today, I spend most of my ridding time moving the computer around to see if the position has something to do with the pickup. Some time it starts to work and then it's not working again.

I'll try changing the batteries and see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cadillac Girls","review":"This film is actually much better than the cheesy cover indicates. As a fan of Adam Beach (Native American actor)I decided to give it a try...mostly revolving around the central mother-daughter relationship which is tense and sad, the film slowly moves toward reconciliation and discovery for both. However, the film does not have the hollywood ending you would expect (thank God): It is real and sweet but with a bitterness that will make you think about the characters long afterwards. The cast does a great job, the location (once out of innercity California) is beautiful...I only wish the relationship with Will on the daughter's side was played out in full instead of relying so heavily on the mother-daughter traumas. Still, the scene where Page (Mia Kirshner)meets Will (Beach) in the Indian burial ground was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for parents of an Aspergers child","review":"I first saw this book at my son's doctors office and knew it was something we needed.

This is one of many books i have purchased but the first one that BOTH of us really got alot out of. We read the pages together and he works on the 'workbook' part. The instructions tell you to circle the page numbers of the pages that have important things for YOU on them, and he has circled MANY page numbers!

She also explaines how the Tetons became a National Park.

Gun Pon Me and Flesh Axe are particularly raucous, the former's only discernible words being \\"jezebel, prostitute, mongrel\\" and there's a definite preoccupation with ladies throughout, as evidenced by titles like Woman Tangle and A Mi Di Girls Dem Love. Maxi Priest lends some respectability as he duets with Shabba on the radio-friendly Housecall, while the closing track, The Jam, features KRS-1 of Boogie Down Productions. Shabba rants about his hero Yellowman on Where Does Slackness Come From?, and about blue movies and reality, casually dropping profundities like \\"Me I went to high school/Was once a prefect/Took some great subjects English and mathematics/But my greatest subject was sex.\\" (Fist-A-Ris). As subtle as an air raid yet affectionate in a naive sort of way.

Standout cuts include the instant classic title track, \\"Instruments of Persuasion\\", and the excellent \\"Morale\\" which finds the band taking a bit of a more melodic turn, for a while anyway. With guest vocals by Hatebreed's Jamey Jasta and former Dead Kennedys' frontman Jello Biafra, this is grindcore at it's very best, and despite the negative reviews here, this is essential listening for longtime fans of Napalm Death, and it is absolutely a grindcore masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better introduction to CS books","review":"This isn't a book about programming, it isn't a book about laying out a spreadsheet, reading this book isn't going to give you skills on the latest Microsoft operating system.It's a book on COMPUTER SCIENCE. Computer Science is more related to math than the \\"computers\\" most people think of. It isn't practical, it's theoretical -- it's supposed to be.It cracks me up to read the reviews where the reader just doesn't get the whole premise of the book.I first read this book in the Fourth Edition when I had a CS-101 class. About 8 years have passed, and I'm considering going for a MSCS, so I wanted a refresher. This book was invaluable in the 4th Ed, the 7th Ed is even better.

It is not as manueverable as my hard shell kayak and may not track as well BUT it works much better than I thought an inflatable device would. I use it on small lakes and streams.

It took some adjustments figuring out how to get in without a waterfall coming in with me, but after 2-3 tries I figured it out.Your butt sinks a little more than the front of the kayak (obviously) but it still moves great.

Maybe he's funny for 22 minutes on that Third Rock sitcom (I've never seen it) but 90 minutes of this guy is almost intolerable. Why is he always grimacing? Does he know he looks like that?The movie is also completely degrading to women. It portrays them as materialistic, scheming bimbos. This movie was obviously written by a guy who has been \\"burned\\", but if he thinks as highly of women as he does of the female characters in this script, it's no wonder.And finally, the end is cheap and anti-climatic and the last big laugh(?) was in the trailer.Boy, did I hate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love doesn't stink, but this movie does","review":"This movie was NOT funny.

Quickly, you'll find all sorts of locks that are sooo easy to open. Some of them, like this particularly crappy one, you can open without any tools. Others, like that round one that are so popular in schools, you can open in one second flat using the aluminum cut out of a pop can.On one hand Master Lock is an utter crying joke, but imagine how many people use them in schools.

I bought this to use on a locker at a health club. I have used it twice, and today when I tried to put it on the locker, it wouldn't close. I kept trying to jam it shut and used the correct combination on it, all to no avail. I also did the reverse of Coala's recommendation, which is to push it hard and swivel the numbers around to try to get it to close, but that didn't work.Did I accidentally put the arm in the position for resetting the combination as I tried to swivel it around to close it on the locker?

I had no problem setting the combination on any of them and they have worked well for over a year. I also just now tested one of them to see if it would open easily, as mentioned in another review. I pulled pretty hard and I wasn't able to get it to open. I did feel resistance in turning the number dials while I was pulling, but never did the dials hang or show any indication or stopping on the actual combination. I have no complaints about this lock and recommend it for \\"light\\" security needs.

I have a major issue with the exam questions though. It does give you a sample test you can take. That is excellent in prep work for the actual exam. However, it doesn't allow you to answer questions whenever you want. It also restricts your number of times you can use the disk you purchased. Finally, it doesn't allow you to answer questions according to functional systems.I wanted to use this during my time in 4th semester to answer questions during med-surg. No can do. If you want to use the disk, it is an all or nothing process. Sit down and take the exam for an hour and a half or not at all. You have two cracks at it, so if you screw up and launch the cd to see what's on it... tough luck, you have one use left.I'm not impressed. Unfortunately I wasted my cash on it and now have to find one to fit the bill. Look elsewhere if you want a dynamic question practice routine.

Even though there is a separate volume control for the 2 mics and the music, if you turn the mic volume all the way down you still can't hear the music through the vocals. The speakers are lousy, but that might be expected on what is essentially a toy. Don't expect anywhere near decent boom-box speaker quality. The whole thing rattles with the vocals. There is an echo effect that you can control the delay on, so you get this long echo or a shorter one just to enhance the vocals. That's about the only cool part. Also, it doesn't come with a power cord, so batteries only unless you pay extra for the cord. We ended up returning the thing to the store very disappointed. Even if the spin-up problem turned out to be a glitch, we were so unimpressed with it in general that we didn't want a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing With Me, NOT","review":"Very cute toy, if it worked.

The DVD is very well done and plays fast since there are no commercials.

They are not much help in make more sense of things like ethnic clensing in the Balkans, another genocide in Rwanda, or the 9/11 attacks. Another fundamental shift is the moving of wars away from the major powers to the developing world.The conclusions reached by a wide selection of researchers and professors of international relations, military theory are mixed. It rather depends on how you intrepret On War, not the easiest book to read. But in any case this book provides some profound thinking on the nature of war at the beginning of the new century.

Too bad OSU believed it also.Truly hilarious moments when you see the fans literally crying about the shellacking their team is taking. Unfortunately the second half was a let down.

It had the long, bright handle I was looking for but the MAJOR PROBLEM with this was that IT IS POORLY MARKED. The arrows on the side of the lock point upwards which made me think the lock had to be slid into the prongs in that direction but instead the arrows are for the prongs so you can know which way to slide in the prongs. Bottom line, the markings are ambiguous and cost me $9.76c plus shipping. The combination lock got jammed because apparently I slid it in the \\"wrong\\" way and now I have to replace it.I am giving this a 2-star and not a 1-star because I just ordered another another copy of this one.

A man who practices unsafe sex with the woman he casually sleeps with.

Spencer's prose style is excellent and it does draw you in, but too many story strands are left dangling. Sub-plots, in particular one about his runaway son's adventure, are begun and then effectively dropped. That one and two other important ones are resolved \\"off-stage\\", their results told to the protagonist toward the end of the book. Characters, like Sam's father and his wife's sister, are brought into the story and dropped immediately, wasting page space. This novel is about average in length, just as I like, but I actually think it could have benefitted from about fifty more pages to better flesh out its intertwined plot. While its random events are life-like, they don't make for a very satisfying story.

The love chemistry between Cooper and Goddard might have been better and the scene where Cooper escapes from the Indians by grabbing a branch as he goes over a waterfall is laughable ...all in all good typical Cooper film with the hero winning out over the bad guys and living happily ever after with his lady love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"It had been years since I had seen this movie, and that on VHS on a small TV (and a tape that was missing the ending!). Seeing the DVD, I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and all the detail.Goddard is beautiful in this movie and Cooper is ... Cooper. I love Gary Cooper but my only knock against this movie is that he seemed to be playing Gary Cooper more than any other character.This movie is non-PC, long even while cramming in a lot of story at a pace that sometimes seems hurried, and an excellent way to spend an evening. Wonderful job on the video and audio transfer, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Colonial Warfare In America\\"","review":"An excellent film!This takes place at Fort Pitt(when Pittsburgh was a frontier town)in 1763 during Pontiac's War(a by-product of The French & Indian War).With a budget of 5 million dollars,DeMille puts a very good story together that is based on Neil Swanson's book \\"The Judas Tree\\".It is also the first time that I've seen the subject of indentured servitude addressed on film.The viewer also gets to see an appearance of the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment(BlackWatch)and how they saved Fort Pitt.I would have liked to have seen more action,but the fighting scenes are adequate enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooper/DeMille & Loads Of Fun!","review":"Unconquered is two-and-a-half hours of non-stop adventure set during the French-and-Indian War. It is also a wonderful love story. Gary Cooper and Paulette Goddard provide the fun with their on-again/off-again romance. It also has several spectacular set pieces, one of which is now a classic -- when Cooper and Goddard go over the waterfalls in a canoe. What's interesting about this is that DeMille doesn't simply toss this sequence in; rather, he sets it up with an earlier sequence in which Cooper stands under a rock outcrop by the waterfalls and studies an overhanging branch. The scene seems out of place and without purpose at the moment. But then comes the canoe and the falls and it all makes sense. This is prime DeMille hokum. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only in a De Mille movie...","review":"Only De Mille would have the audacity to put George Washington and a Slave Girl Bathing Scene in the same movie, but he managed. This is just pull out the stops old movie fun. It's not very realistic, wait until you hear Boris Karloff's accent as an American Indian, but it's De Mille Showmanship through and through. You'll have lots of fun watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had to Cry Uncle....","review":"and shut this movie off, even though I probably was THIS close to the end, because I just couldn't stand it anymore! Totally bad.Paulette Goddard is having a hard time as an indentured servant in a frontiersy New World, even with Gary Cooper around.

I would recommend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent tale of colonial America","review":"Like his earlier movie 'The Plainsman' De Mille was able in 'The Unconquered' to magnificently bring us back to the American frontier, this time to colonial America. Despite De Mille's sentimentality, he was a master in showing the brutality of the Indians. I saw this movie first 50 years ago and to this day I remember a voice over towards the end of the movie saying something like this: 'They were unconquered because they were pioneers', what a patriotic statement. This movie, and others like it, should be required in schools instead of the multicultural, politically correct garbage the kids are fed with. Wake up America, America has been the shining democracy and a world savior because of the courage and sacrifices of the pioneers, which are beautifully showed in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"I was looking for some original ideas and there were absolutely none to be found here!

WRONG! I couldn't get past the first 17 pages it was so boring. Very broken and disjointed, and I couldn't care less what was happening. I put it down and never picked it back up again. I figured life is too short to force myself to read something that boring. I kept reading the same paragraphs over and over again, but my mind kept wandering. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book which makes all other books superfluous","review":"When Ifinished this book, I said to my husband: this book resembles the book I am presenty writing so much, that I can stop now. It has been done already. It is a truly haunting story about family life and love, and its destruction by death of a child. It ordinary - and yet sophisticated and truly marvelous in the way emotions are depicted, especially the small ones. The people who did not like the book were maybe looking for an easy read, or simply easily bored because deep emotions are not to be superficially accessed. And the one lady who wrote in her review that children do not have sexual feelings is very much mistaken: by wishful thinking or repression maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to suck the reader in","review":"However that's not to say it fails to suck in general.

He actually comes close to giving us a piece of the puzzle halfway when he teases us into thinking he's going to tell us how the daughter dies. Then bam it's a cliffhanger.

Interesting tips and facts about the ideal strategy to get into an MBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo disappointing...","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet. This book is awful. The authors are a couple of MBA message board skulkers I know from a couple of years back. Their strategies fall into two basic categories: 1) original ideas that were not thought through or have become obsolete, and 2) ideas gleaned from other MBA self-help guides, most of which are either obsolete or were never effective.A poor effort all around. In their defense, the economy and MBA educational environment and focus is changing so fast that it's difficult to have a plan that works for all seasons -- but this one seems to have nothing to offer.Wait til it goes deep-discount (which it surely will soon) or buy it used (cheap). Until then, you are wasting your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on the Subject (... and I read a lot)","review":"I read a lot of books about MBA admissions. Your MBA Game Plan was the shortest, simplest ... and by far, the best!The book taught me about the admissions process - what schools are looking for in students, how I can demonstrate those qualities, and how to avoid the most common pitfalls of applying. More importantly, it helped me develop a clear, organized, and easy-to-execute gameplan that kept me on track throughout the (grueling!) journey that is MBA admissions.Thanks in large part to this game plan, I was accepted at Harvard Business School and Stanford's Graduate School of Business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for getting an edge in the admissions process","review":"I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering applying to Top MBA programs.

Translating, researching, and unlocking Chinese writings to include manuals, poems, etc. is a nightmare for Westerners and respect should be paid to his efforts.This still does nothing to resolve the issue that this book is full of misinformation and should be approached by Tai Chi practitioners with open eyes and a skeptic gaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"the essence and applications of taijiquan","review":"Excellent pictures, waste of time, the sequencing of them not needed if one wants to learn anything.

There was plenty of new information here, and although I can't entirely agree with Berg's best products choices ($150 for Le Mer? Forget it), I respect the fact that she's been in the industry long enough and used enough of these products (or known someone who has) to offer up objective opinions. The chapter on hair care has given me some new ideas for quick fixes for a.m. post-gym hair, and after reading the procedure descriptions in the chapter on face lifts I'm determined that no one will ever come near my face with a scalpel.

I loved her common sense advise on investing in your own manicure kit and taking it to your manicurist and how to choose a spa. Great historical information on the beauty industry overall and candid info on individual beauty lines (Aveda, Stilla etc.) This book is fun to read, is loaded with great tips and advise Buy it, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book -- would love to see more!","review":"I agree with chicagojess' comment that the book doesn't really address beauty issues faced by women of color. Berg does include photos and some models of color, which I applaud, but as an Asian-American woman, I felt that the issues brought up for Asian-Americans were very generalized, as if everyone of a certain race would have the same coloring/hair texture, etc, etc. The one makeover that featured an Asian woman had her with stick-straight jet black hair and powder blue eyeshadow--not very useful for everyday wear. It would be nice if there were a special chapter dealing with women of color.But all in all, I really enjoyed reading this book. The layout is wonderful, the book is stuffed with good information, and it's easy and fun to read. It's great that Berg tries to cover all age groups as well. I would love to see her publish a beauty book that just deals with young women in their 20s -- of all faces and colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever progessive music","review":"This guys have reached the heaven with this recording.

This is a great album! Contrary to many of the previous, and somewhat negative, reviewers, I believe the album has a tremendous amount of feeling and emotion - it seems to be a very personal effort. The songs are fantastic and complex, even though they may follow a more formulaic structure. The orchestration is tremendous, and the performance is top notch. Lyrically, as I mention previously, there is a lot of emotion and introspection.

The main character in the book Terpin, a young boy by the name of Terpin Taft, wrestles with this question.

While a short read, I must say that Terpin is one of the most significant and important books I have ever read. I have loaned it to many friends and relatives, and it always leads to interesting and poignant conversations. Sadly it seems that not many copies of Terpin currently exist. If you ever have the occasion to read this book I would strongly recommend you do so. It does something that all truly good books do. It makes one think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Instrumental Christmas CD","review":"Tim Janis and his ensemble produce beautiful soft instrumental music--and this cd is no exception. The music's focal point is Tim Janis' piano and keyboards with some soothing strings, flute, and acoustic guitar thrown in for good measure. The song selection is strong with most of the traditional classics nicely covered. This disc is somewhat on the short side (less than 29 mintues long), but does an excellent job putting the listener in the Christmas spirit. A perfect selection for those with multi-disc cd players.

Perhaps that wasn't possible. As it is, it is obvious that most all of the material comes from the prosecution team. The last third of the book is nothing but the back and forth of the lawyers.

Not a Kathryn Casey or Ann Rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written, but disappointing","review":"I think the author is a good writer. What was disappointing to me was that I would have liked follow-up on the friends that were betrayed. More detail about them. Also, there was barely any mention of his childhood or his family. Just all this repetitive detail about the prosecution's case.What was really blatant false adversting, was the bold words \\"EIGHT PAGES OF HAUNTING PHOTOS\\". There was one picture of the victim holding her baby and one picture of the accused holding the baby. Six other photos were of detectives and lawyers. How brazen! Kinda follows that it was a cheap, made for profit book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment.....","review":"I am an avid true crime reader and this book was a real dissapointment for me. Although this book is very well written, it was basically only about the prosecutions case and nothing else. We don't read about Stefanie and Craig's relationship, nor what their childhoods were like. All we get is page after page of the prosecutors building of the case. We don't get any insight of what Stefanie's family and close circle of friends were thinking at the time, nor what they are feeling today.

Having lived in Montgomery County during the trial, I didn't follow it terribly closely.

I don't know quite where the earlier reviewer gets off attacking various elements of the book (and individuals who are written about in the book) but apprently she must be a fan of crime if the best thing she can do is attack those in the book who helped bring this monster to justice.

This book is so full of bugs it should only be used for kindling (you might get your money's worth). Previously, I had wonderful experiences with 'Dummies' books, but this one is awful. I tested many of the examples and was forced to edit many of them for the programs to work properly. Also, many of the figures and screenshots are out of place -- or their captions are irelevant to them. One other complaint -- a big one -- I don't know if this happened to all of the CDs, but mine didn't have close to everything that the book advertises! Speak of aggravating!

It doesn't help at all being a college student late for class over a locker issue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 10 minute, 2 second hacking of this lock by anyone","review":"Anyone can open this lock in just a few seconds by using a premade cutout from a soda can. It's so easy it will make you sick. Just go on youtube and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"master locks","review":"Locks were as ordered and shipped on time. Master Locks are the best and most consistent I've ever used. I am happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend...","review":"Yes, this is a very common lock that looks really nice; however, there are some disadvantages since it is so common. The main reason why I don't recommend this to anyone is because of the ease to open it. A thief can literally open this lock in less than 5 seconds. That is really bad if you are trying to protect something valuable. Overall since this is a really easy to get robbed lock I wouldn't buy it and masterlock should really think about discontinuing these types of locks. I rate this product 2 stars out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long ago Master was a good brand","review":"Are you thinking of paying $5 for this lock? Take $5 right now and put it in a pocket instead. Give the $5 to next homeless person you see. That way you will get more good out the $5 than if you buy this lock because buying this lock is like throwing $5 away.I've had 2 of these locks. The first simply seized up after a while. On the second lock the dial routinely sticks which makes the sequence of moves necessary to open it impossible. Useless. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a reason.","review":"Like other have said these are absolute pointless crap. there's so many ways to crack the combo and as well use a shim like another guy said. not to mention that the body is absolute crap metal, had to open one once and was able to just rip the back panel off as well as all the pieces inside and it just fell apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works I Guess...","review":"When I first received it, I turned the 3 numbers given and it popped open but then I noticed that is was extremely hard to push back in to lock it... needed to put excess amount of pressure to close the lock. If I were to use it in public it would be me look slightly dimwitted... Would return it but too much work for that guess you shouldn't expect much from something this cheap. I would recommend you buy something else if you want something functioning normally."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does its job","review":"I know this isn't one of those fancy locks that are super secure, but for me it does the job! For the price I paid, as long as it keeps my items locked, I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These combo locks are easily defeatable...that includes the new Master anti-shim combo locks.","review":"I just had my locker broken into while using the new Master anti-shim combination padlock. The thief used some sort of prying tool to rip open the housing where the shackle locks. If you decide to use these types of locks to secure your valuables, you are kidding yourself; you might as well use nothing at all. There are better locks out there that offer better security, although, you might have to spend more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this lock","review":"It failed the 4th time I used it! I was in the gym, just finished shower, and try to open it, for 10 minutes, no use. It totally stuck. I had different people helping me, no one can open it. I even have the small sticker which has the code on it. Finally I have to go out and have someone cut it!Can you imagine it???? After shower, with a towel only and try to find someone help you to cut this lock?????Don't buy it ever !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Locks","review":"Does its job and locks things well.

However, this lock takes multiple tries every single time you go to open it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My elbows are happy too","review":"I've been using this a couple months now, and I wouldn't say that my feet are as smooth as a baby's butt. I would say they are noticably softer than before. As a bonus, I used it on my flaky elbows and they were cured immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work great","review":"I have had a big problem with chapped hands in the winter for years. This product does the best job of all I have tried. There is a silky silicone feel but that's a lot better than raw skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well","review":"I had two scratch like marks on my hand from winter dryness ... this took care of it in just a couple days. Everybody uses this stuff when they come over. My husband had cracks on his thumbs from being dry ... he used this for a day or two and it healed the cracks. Love this stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I've been using it every night (really every night)following the instruction (wearing stockings to sleep)for one whole month to tackle my heel problem (very dry and with crack). However, the improvement is miminal, say around 5%. My heel problem has been there for almost 18 years; not sure it's been too difficult to cure. The O'Keefe's is not cheap (including shipping cost, and comparing with similar product available at drug stores); I do expect more from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is true that this formula is non-slippery, as reviewers have said. However, I can't say it works any better than my other moisturizers. I used it for a few weeks, sometimes twice a day, and I can't say I had the kind of results that other reviewers seem to claim. I'm still looking for a good heel cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy this again","review":"I ordered this product based on the other reviewers statements, which is what I usually do when ordering online. This product felt weird and grainy when applied to my feet. After letting it absorb into my skin, which took about five minutes, my feet felt clammy and gunky. I thought I had used too much product but nothing rubbed off. Later that day, I took off my sandals and checked my feet. They felt sticky. I tried this again the next day and wore socks and tennis shoes. After awhile, I couldn't stand how my feet felt inside the shoes and socks. Luckily I was home, took off the socks and shoes and bathed my feet with soap and water. Afterwards I used plain old body lotion on my feet, which felt great. I don't like this product and regret that I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver as promised","review":"I used this twice a day, everyday, for 3 weeks. I even wore socks at night (and during the day), my feet are not one bit better than when I started using it. No improvement at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome hand cream for dry cracked skin","review":"This is the only OTC hand cream I've ever found that actually heals my dry hands (I get cracked skin at my finger tips in the winter. ouch!). This is not a perfumed girly type product, but rather a serious help for people with chronic dry skin. Awesome product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"My container of Healthy Feet arrived yesterday. I swear I can already see a difference. The consistency is a little pasty/gummy but the \\"weird\\" feeling goes away. I can't sleep with socks but I used the cream and put on socks in the evening while watching tv and reading before bed. Today, I used some cream before putting on my socks for the day - all good. By evening my feet are pretty darn soft. I'm sold!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it based on the other reviews","review":"Sorry to say that I didn't really like it; though I'm glad that it works for others. What I noted was that it wasn't particularly better than other products I've tried (I'm always looking for a better mousetrap), but it leaves a sticky, waxy feeling on the skin. I don't like to sleep with socks on, and I found that while using this, my feet stuck to the sheets, so that I couldn't move around. Better luck to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waxy, Greasy Texture","review":"The best comparison I have with the texture of this \\"cream\\" is imagine taking candle wax and rubbing that into your hands. There's your O'keeffe's cream. If you have dry skin go with a more natural organic route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Feet","review":"This stuff is awesome!! It really helps with cracked, dry feet in a short time. I used twice a day for only two days before I saw major improvement. Wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This is the greatest stuff for your sore feet ever made. no greasy, no odor, heals cracked soles, buy it, use it, and feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"After reading the review on the product and ordering the product we found that it did the following:1. Made the hard areas of the foot, soft2. Cracking of the feet has virtually disappeared3. Small cracks of bleeding GONE4. Applied daily it does as advertisedPOB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracked and peeling feet","review":"This is the only product I have found that works for cracked heals and peeling arches. You don't need to use a lot of the product so it's a cost effective way to treat an annoying problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this up","review":"I did a test between O'Keeffe's cream and Flexitol for a week, and Flexitol won. I walked around barefoot for a week and put the cream on right before bed. By next morning, my heel with Flexitol was completely healed and healthy looking. The heel with the O'K'eeffe's was not. There was an improvement, but only slight. Overall, it's okay and it does work, which is why I gave it 2 stars. So if you use this, be patient because you'll be waiting several days before you see full results. Also be aware that it looks/feels like Crisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem to work","review":"Read the reviews and really thought I had a product to work the way it was portrayed. Not so. Used it for about a week, rubbing it on after my bath and then wearing socks to bed. My feet are still very rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff!!","review":"I have really dry feet that sometimes crack and when they crack, they hurt. I've tried several different products that didn't seem to help very much until I tried this stuff. It did take a little longer than I would have hoped to heal the cracks, but they stopped huring right away. Now that the cracks have healed, I cannot remember when my feet have been in better condition. I can go get my next pedicure without any shame. Love this stuff. On here now to order more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best foot lotion","review":"This is an excellent product. I use it all year long. Keeps my feet very soft. I am never without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Feet and Hands","review":"I purchased a container each of O'Keeffee's Healthy Feet and Hand Creme.

It contains far too many chemicals and does not penetrate the thick skin one the feet. try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"Great product! My feet were smoother and softer within a few days of using the product. I notice my boyfriend loves to rub his feet against mine- his aren't as smooth as mine (so I should probably get him some, lol). Other than that, love it, perfect for military and people that work on their feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for dry hands","review":"I found O'Keefes Working Hands in the paint section at Lowe's. I guess that makes sense since people doing painting, carpentry, etc. might be more prone to dry skin. My fingertips were very dry and starting to split from washing my hands so often and using sanitizers. I read some reviews about this product and thought I would give a try. I couldn't believe that within a couple days using working hands my fingers were healing up and no longer hurt. It has little fragrance and soaks in within a couple minutes and doesn't feel greasy at all. I asked my husband to try it also because his hands were like sandpaper, but he is not like to use creams, etc. He started using it daily and his hands are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Buy it and use it for 4 days. WOW. Even after the first use...WOW. This stuff is MAGIC! Pricy for such a small amount but it really works wonders on your feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"I used it for only a few days and noticed an improvement. I haven't had to use it recently since it's been pretty humid, but I'll be glad to have it when it's winter! Only thing is I wish it were scented...it has a sort of strange smell. But it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reference","review":"It's a very good reference for systems modeling and it's recommended to anyone involved in mathematical simulation of industrial equipments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting collection.","review":"Food and culture are examined in 28 essays by noted anthropologists and other social scientists in this uneven but valuable survey.Reading some of the academese is like treading molasses, but the collection is redeemed by such gems as Brumberg's examination of the Victorian roots of anorexia nervosa, Sobo's study of the social meanings of obesity in Jamaica, and Harris' \\"The Abominable Pig\\". Other writers explore such issues as breast-feeding, \\"industrial food\\", and hunger.Very interesting and worthwhile for those interested in the deeper meanings of food and eating.(The numerical rating above is an ineradicable feature of this page. This reviewer does nor employ numerical ratings.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This gives the Easter story and some other Easter information. Not exactly what I was expecting"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I thought this was an awesome book! I could actually see it becoming a T.V. show!! I wish there were more than just the 2 books. It left me wanting more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seek out another time travel book.","review":"The idea of the book had potential, but fails on two counts. First, the technology of how the time travel works, was not well developed or described. This is especially the case as it relates to the travelers staying in the past. The author did not explain how the travelers (if dead in the present) could actually live in the past.Second, to me, the book was offensively preachy. For example, while reading the book, it seemed that the author went out of her way to sermonize about Jesus rather than to write a quality science fiction/time travel book. Based upon my reaction to the Time Lottery, I would not read this author again or another promisepress book, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth a read","review":"I love time travel novels.Time Lottery follows three characters as they are given the opportunity to enter another dimension and relive a portion of their past. At the end of their 7-day experience, they are given the choice to remain in the other dimension and forget this life (their body in this reality will die) or return to this reality. One of the characters has a story that makes it apparent from the outset that the choice will be to remain. All three characters make new choices - some of them very small choices at the time - that forever change how they perceive themselves, their lives, and their place in God's world.An enjoyable read that leaves you satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate tale of redemption","review":"Nancy Moser has a nifty plot device here; going back in time to fix something in your life is universally appealing. Her characters and what they do with that chance create three distinct, yet cleverly interwoven, stories, so a reader gets a lot of bang for the buck. This is a great fun read with takeaway value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very satisfied with this knife","review":"Not very satisfied with this knife, the knife and handle is lock by 2 small nuts inside of the handle. It is easy become slack. Althought the company provide lifetime warranty. But due to the way it make. It is really weak. The knife is good look,but not thing good at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valterra twist on valve","review":"I have cable operated valves and my black tank valve leaks. I attached this valve between the trailer and the sewer hose and am able to prevent the black tank from leaking the liquid waste which leaves the solids behind thus creating buildup issues. Works very well. Now I can decide whether I want to even hassle with opening up the enclosed bottom of my rig and attempting a repair of the cable operated valves (which I hear eventually fail again later)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"Very funny and insightful look at several comics trying to reach stardom. A look into TryFlynn's life as he struggles in the business. His Answering Machine bit is hilarious and the commentary from his ex-girlfriend about the real-life incident makes it priceless. A must have for any real comic fan because stand-up comedy is the only pure entertainment artform. Eddie Griffin makes a great contribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a goodie.","review":"Good fun read that gets harder. Straightforward pedagogy of the mid 20th century that works. Unlike some of the stuff we do today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humble?","review":"To call Billy Graham humble after reading his autobiography is to call the Pope poor and underprivileged! Graham comes across as a seeker of prestige and fame. He tosses out names of the rich, powerful and famous----even infamous----on just about every page. He is a living testamony of why we should have a stricter/wider separation of church and state.And, as another reviewer has written, there is no real substance to the story. The book would have been better if \\"autobiography\\" had been omitted from the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trustworthy","review":"It means a great deal to me when a company is honest & trustworthy because they are rare qualities these days. The description of the book I purchased was 'true to form' of the book I received. It made a great gift! I was not disappointed, and I would not hesitate to recommend this supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the struggle?","review":"First, let me say that I am an evangelical pastor who has the greatest respect for Billy Graham. I believe he has done more to further the gospel message in America than any single evangelist of our time. Second, it seems that my review will be in the minority as it seems to have been given 5 stars by everyone else who has read it.With that said, I eagerly opened this book hoping for insight into his life. How he dealt with struggles. How he dealt with marriage and travel in the midst of his extensive ministry. What I got instead was an itenerary of his travels and very few insights into the difficult decisions that must have been made in his life. There is a great deal of humility within these pages, but very little vulnerability.While I respect this man as much as any Christian that has lived in my lifetime, I found this book hollow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Preaching After All These Years!","review":"Christian or not, you'll enjoy Graham's encounters with world leaders, American presidents, and those he has impacted in his many large worldwide crusades. Always gracious and never malicious, Graham gives his impressions of American presidents from Truman to Clinton. Christian readers will be impressed and uplifted by Graham's accounts of God's hand in opening doors for preaching the gospel despite many obstacles and organized opposition. It was gratifying to read accounts of men and women whose lives were changed by his preaching and his traditional calls for committments to Christ every campaign evening. Though some evangelists have been discredited over the years, Billy Graham has remained clean and honest in representing the gospel of Christ's salvation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This book is inspiring, and insightful. The life story of the most influential man in history. Even if you don't share the same beleifs as Billy Graham, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary on the life of a great man of God..","review":"I was required to read this book for a Theo of Ministry course in the Spring 2003 semester. At first it seemed a bore, but in time the benefits of reading about Bill Graham paid off. God has worked in Billys life in supernatural ways so many times, and his life is a testimony of that very fact!I rather enjoyed the book and rather enjoyed attending the SFBay Area Billy Graham crusade in 1997. It will probably be the last crusade I ever attend with Billy, but it was well worth it, as well as this powerful read. My only gripe is the size of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD","review":"There is not one reason to purchase this DVD. Neither kids or adults will enjoy it. I was hoping for something along the lines of America's Funniest Home Videos (WITHOUT Bob Saget) but it did not even live up to that weak standard. A total disappointment. Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy watching overweight folks perform pig calls at a county fair. That is the type of material (I kid you not) that is on this DVD. I only hope I can get rid of it on eBay so I don't have to look at it in my DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the definitive version!","review":"Il Tabarro is performed here in Hamburg in 1955. We are just NOW getting to hear it. The GREAT Ettore Bastianini gives one of his truly great performances, giving the role it's only true interpretation. Outstanding cast as well. De Rosa handles the part with incredible ease, as does Puma. The conducting by Cordone, is sumptious, leading you on a journey from the very start and never lets up! Also the sound on this CD is tremendous! By the time you get to \\"Nulla!...Silenzio!\\", your blood will freeze. One of the most sinister and dramatic of ALL operatic arias, performed past perfection by Bastianini. The world will never hear his like again. I couldn't recommend this CD more. It has never turned up anywhere before. Grab it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sango Splash","review":"I love this pattern! These bowls are a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the Sango dishware set.

Mine was dull and the prong setting is not what is shown in picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for the price","review":"Like other reviewers, the ring I received was also set with 4 prongs instead of 6, and is set slightly crooked - but no one else will notice! I wear a standard ring size 7, but this ring in a size 7 was a bit loose for me, so I wear it on my middle finger instead of my ring finger (which in retrospect is probably a good thing, because even on my middle finger I've had people think that it's a wedding ring)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO cheap looking","review":"I have never written a review for any item that I have purchased at AMAZON, but this was so ugly and cheap looking.

She usually wears gold with gemstones and matches them to her outfits.

Everyone at her employment has given her compliments on it and many of her customers have commented on how lovely it is.

I wore it for 5 days & got lots of compliments. However, on the 5th day I looked down & the cubic zirconia stone was missing. I wondered, after I got it, if I should have had it tightened. I didn't and now I have a silver band missing the stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUBBLE GUM RING","review":"I thought I could wear this ring to save some wear and tear on my diamond but NO WAY would I have ordered it if I would have known it was so cheap.

The stone is large enough to be noticable, but not gaudy and fake as some of the larger stones. Its a simple and elegant look. My hands are smaller, so the smaller stone looks realistic. My husband was even impressed! I like that its sterling and not a plated metal, so it will stand up to all the cleaning solutions my hands are in. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes understated elegance. Its definitely not for someone who likes in-your-face flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I am very unhappy with this product. Not only does the CZ look plastic, it fell out after two days of wearing it. I have never been more disappointed with a piece of jewelry than this one. Do not buy it.

I felt Ian McShane, in particular, was totally wasted in his role and although Tim Curry did the best that could be done, with the sub par material, he was altogether forgettable in the lead. The ambling, misguided, largely fictional account of William Shakespeare's life was aided somewhat by adequate production values, but was not worthy of being aired on primetime TV, in the US.

The 6 tape set focuses on the life of Shakespeare, from his humble beginning being from a poor family in Stratford Upon Avon; to going to London (and seems to be hiding from his wife and children), to a talented playwrite. On his way to being famous, he is befriended by the Earl of Southampton, lives through the black plague, some personal tragedies, and writes some of the best plays and poems of all time. Tim does age in this from a handsome young and middle age Shakespeare to the balding Shakespeare that we have all seen depicted in our English Literature books in High School.This movie is extremely hard to find and quite expensive, but well worth the time put into finding it and the money spent to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hal: Why did you lie to me?

She was a very deep sleeper. Looking back, we probably could have done it faster with her if we were consistent in taking her to the bathroom as soon as the alarm went off. It took her months to respond to the alarm, but it did work.Our second child, though, woke up as soon as the alarm went off, and it took her less than a week to stop wetting the bed (also around age 4-5)!

Unfortunately, our second child had a relapse, at which point we needed to replace the item. I wasn't willing to pay the price for the same brand we had previously. In retrospect, you get what you pay for. I truly wish I had stayed with the original bed-wetting alarm brand we had bought years ago. This one just didn't even come close to helping my child.

Honestly at the time I didn't think it worked, and that I had bought a lemon of a product.

However, I purchased this set to add to the existing place settings and other pieces I already had. It appears that the manufacturer forgot to add the various colorings to the mix which enhances the attractiveness and unique look of these dishes. The main color is very pale in comparison to the set that I already have and there are hardly any of the accent colors which make these dishes stand out . I am very disappointed in the quality and look of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"great aesthetics, poor quality","review":"These fit our family's style perfectly and we got the main set along with the pitcher, serving bowls, and other pieces, hating to spend the money but thinking these would last for many years. Well, they might actually last, if not completely intact, because we rarely use them. We're super careful with the dishes, yet they keep chipping. The texture is odd, parts of them seemingly unglazed, and forks running across them make an awful sound. I guess by microwavable they meant \\"won't catch fire or explode,\\" but these get so hot a potholder is necessary for getting one out of the microwave. Might be nice for people who display their dishes on the wall or in glass cabinets, but I recommend avoiding these dishes for actual use as dinnerware."},{"rating":"1","title":"these plates chip very easily","review":"We bought this dinnerwear set and within the first month 3 of the bowels had chips on the edge.

They remind me more of fruit that has been \\"freeze-dried\\" (like the ice cream at the Air and Space Museum in DC, if you are familiar) than of conventional dried fruit. They are light and flavorful with \\"nothing else\\" added to the fruit (as the ingredients state). They might take some getting used to if you are familiar with sugary (or high fructose corn syrupy) dried fruit, though. They are a great addition to organic cereal and low-fat ice cream, too.

The Wild kingdom card message is supposed to be Run wild, Stand tall, Be strong. I send cards for thanks yous, get wells, and thinking of yous plus the usual holidays and can think of no time when a zebra or giraffe theme would have been appropriate. That's what I mean by filler. With some stretch you could possibly actually use them. One thing to watch out for in this book is how much money you can end up spending on tools and materials. Many of the ingredients are of the store-bought kind, like vellum, stamps, and letter stickers, not 'found' things from around the house.A greeting card book with more clever and less filler and expense would have garnered this a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Indigo Girls","review":"as in their self-titled album. the Indigo Girls continue to explore spiritual and social issues in their classic folk-rock style. emily saliers' beautiful voice enchants in \\"southland in the springtime\\" and amy ray's gritty vocals in \\"pushing the needle too far\\" are downright haunting. stll, they are at their best in the catchy \\"hammer and a nail\\" where their social consciousness combines with outstanding harmonies to create a song we can all sing along with, regardless of age and musical preference. this is a keeper and among their very best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut wrenching emotion and fiery passion intertwined","review":"When I first heard Indigo Girls - Nomads, Indians and Saints, I was blown away !!

And he didnt get caught up in \\"marketing himself\\" on the field after a good play either (ala \\"Deion\\"). Knowing how brutal the old Raiders clubs were in the 60's & 70's, and to a man, having all of them agree that Jack Tatum was the toughest of all of them (Ken Stabler in \\"Snake\\" and John Madden's books for just a couple of examples), this tells you just how good of a football player this guy was. The fact that he loved and respected Woody Hayes at Ohio State for just being always \\"honest and upfront with him,\\" when all other college recruiters were trying to buy him out of high school, showed me just what kind of character this guy was made of. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS A HIT","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK BY JACK TATUM, FORMER OAKLAND RAIDER. THE BOOK IS BOTH INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING. IT IS ALMOST 100% ABOUT FOOTBALL. A SMALL BUT DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS CHILDHOOD IS DISCUSSED EARLY ON BUT THE REST IS HIS CAREER IN HIGH SCHOOL, OHIO STATE AND OAKLAND. HIS OPINIONS AND INSIGHTS CONCERNING THE BEST AT DIFFERNT POSITIONS, AND COACHES IS A MAJOR HIGHLIGHT.

Once could pull on the lock while spining the number dials to easily pick the lock. In fact, had this lock on my luggage traveling in Asia, and arriving at my destination the lock was missing. Instead, check out the 4-dial combination lock from Brinks. If you pull the lock while spinning the dials, even when you get to the correct combination the Brinks lock won't fall open. Instead, you need to release the tension (stop pulling on the lock), then pull for it to open.

I read this book six months ago, and I haven't been able to get the implications of it out of my head since.

I can sum up the first 20 pages of that as:\\"'fat' is old English for 'vat', and Shakespeare used the word 'fat' a lot\\".There may be the bare bones of an interesting anthropology pamplet here, but it's so wrapped up in dead repetitive prose I found it indigestible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repulsive testament to man's capacity to rationalize","review":"Sick of being fat and unattractive? Rather than developing the self discipline to become a strong, healthy person, why not console yourself with R. Klein's masterfully constructed, pseudo-academic rationalizations for continued fatness? It's all here- how other, grander cultures considered fatness desirable, how today's health conscious society is run by those who are both cruel and skinny, and how REALLY enjoying life requires relentless gourmandizing because me... want... eat... food!

As a story writer, it gave me much to think about. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Global Gift","review":"As an author, teacher, and concerned world citizen, I am awed by the depth and compassion woven into this highly-readable anecdotal book.

Baldwin eloquently demonstrates different approaches to telling a story and capturing the heart of the narrative. She demonstrates different stages of story telling with examples from her own life. Her tales are captivating and hold the reader's attention with prose and detail. Although I didn't start out loving the book, by the time I finished 10 pages I was hooked. Baldwin made me remember writing my innermost thoughts at age 7 in my journal and upon finishing the book I am looking forward to picking up my old hobby and developing it further with my own storytelling. Christina Baldwin made me look differently at the art of storytelling and pay close attention to the stories in my everyday life.

Although the pictures were beautiful and tried most desperatly to pull us into the story, we just couldn't get to the same place that the author must have been while writing the book. Maybe after reading just the first sentence: \\"Sometime after summer is spent but before jack-o'-lanterns are lit, it's apple picking time.\\", which seems to assume that everyone is interested in celebrating Halloween.In addition to this, the book speaks twice about \\"the purple ticket\\" that gets punched with a half moon. I still can't figure out what that is for. There are no explanations about the meaning of this and that is frustrating because it seems important but only the writer knows why. The sad part is that he kept this detail to himself and it's annoying.We tried to enjoy this book, but at this point its end will be in our Goodwill pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy service - have recived no info as to subs recd","review":"Lousy service - there has been zero contact from the publisher as to whether they had received a subscription and when one might expect the subscription to beginNot happy at all with the service on the magazine subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I bought \\"The Figure in Motion\\" because I often portray people in active outdoor situations, sports, dancing, etc. Thought this would be a good reference. Unfortunately, the poses in this book are so completely unnatural, they are pretty useless. I cannot imagine why anyone would be leaping and cavorting about in such a bizarre fashion unless they were a member of a modern dance troupe, or are in severe need of physical therapy. Many of the photos have deep shadows which partially obscure the figure, making it even less helpful. And to top it off, most of the models are not pleasingly proportioned in the classical sense, which makes their awkward gyrations all the more unattractive. I usually don't write negative reviews, but this book is worth warning people off of. My advice is, go find it in a book store and take a good look at it before you decide you want to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice poses but it lacks image clarity","review":"Graininess is my only dislike with this book. The models are attractive and in an abundance of poses; but the clarity and detail is lost in the graininess of the photographs. Sharp photos are a must for a figure drawing book, and this book has average sharpness. Graininess should not prevent someone from gaining the details needed for a drawing.The book is usefull, but large reproductions of the model become impossible because of lack of clarity. I recomend the book. I'm just saying there are better books of the same subject which cost about the same price. Judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You've Got the Money and Space to Spare ...","review":"A picture book of live nude models caught in mid leap or whirl, with various lighting. Divided into the single female figure (Playboy this ain't), the single male figure (no g-string), and groups (4 whole shots).

As an artist you need all possible details for the best results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for what it is","review":"This is a book of figures in motion, as it says. The pictures were taken with fast black and white film (looks like Tri-X) and are, as others reviewers have pointed out, very grainy. That's simply an artifict of films and art photography in the 1970's and 80's, before today's fast digital cameras. If the comparison is based on level of detail and skin tone, this book can't hold a candle next to the high resolution digital photos of the Art Models seriesArt Models 6: The Female Figure in Shadow and Light (Art Models series). However, until release of Art Models 7, there also weren't many photos of figures in actual movement in the Art Model series. There's a lot than an artist can do with the images in this book, and I believe that I've seen at least a few works by well known artists that were inspired by some of the poses. I consider this book to be a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artist must have resource book","review":"This book is a must have for all serious artists.

All of the pictures are poorly lit and grainy, which don't show you anything in terms of structure. All of the models are super thin almost to a nauseating point. Its sad when you have to search through the book hoping to find the LEAST ugly person to draw. Also, the poses are in motion. I will give him that.

Instead of a motoric buzzing, this version opens with a hazy mist of sound, like clouds gradually forming and breaking into a crushing clap of thunder. The Scherzo is subtler in its tempo contrasts, the Adagio seems to flow more (the timing is about the same as the other versions), and the Ode to Joy is unbearably touching in its Heaven-Storming way. Outside of some flutter in the winds, the recorded sound is good, though not outstanding, unlike the Philharmonia version on Tahra. Yet, I think this would be my desert-island Ninth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Pitches","review":"If you are sensitive to pitches you will not want this recording of Beethoven's 9th.

The plastic casing and switches are clearly sub-par for an electronic device, the velcro has safety pins on it to secure the alarm to a bed, and on top of that it did not even work at all! When we asked for a refund, they decided to replace it instead. When we refused delivery on the replacement item, they charged us a 25% restocking fee. The customer service rep was rude and flat-out lied to me about her conversation with my husband. All in all a terrible experience. Do not order this item and especially not from this company!Update: we received a full refund including the restocking fee, but we had to go through the Amazon claims process to get it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"The greatest disappointment with this novel is the lack of character development. It seems like the author expect the reader to know her characters or at least of them before opening the book. There is too little about them to come to know or care about them through the entire work.They are good and interesting characters and some stand out like the brilliant depiction of an agent who poses as a mental health professional who pretends to be a different, classical, psychiatrist from the past every day. As he goes from Freud to Jung and onwards, he entertains greatly. This character is the highlight of the book.At some points it is laboriously written and at others far too little detail surfaces to give much insight or understanding to the reader.A good effort, it is possible the book was over-edited or written about characted the author is very acquainted with in her own mind and that connection was lost on paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Sara, not enough Heaven.","review":"Being a fan of Ennio Morricone, I was surprised to hear how boring the music for \\"Two Mules for Sister Sara\\"was.

The beautiful opening song, (I'm not sure of its title) is not on the CD, nor is the slide guitar music on the disc either.

I discovered early on that with the light angled correctly you can see the functional wheels underneath the numbered ones, and that in the correct position there is a blank space on each wheel facing outward. Knowing this I can quite literally find the combination to any of these locks in about 10 seconds. Not only does that make it easier than cutting whatever is locked in most cases but you can look downright casual doing so.Does it still work as mild theft deterrence? Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel security","review":"My fiance and I used these to lock our backpack zippers together since we were traveling around DC on the metro frequently.

I really only needed something very simple to keep my swim locker locked at school. When this arrived, I found that the thing part of the curve seemed to be a bit flimsy, but like I said, I wasn't looking for Fort Knox. The thing that really killed the review of this lock for me was the fact that it did not fit through the locker hole and I had to order a completely different one. When the title said \\"Backpack Padlock\\" I thought it meant that it was easy to carry on backpacks... now that I think about it, it's FOR locking the zippers on backpacks together.Pros:LightweightInexpensiveEasy to useSmallCons:Flimsy locking mechanismDoesn't fit through much (like a locker)If this review was useful, please click yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: don't buy this for locker use","review":"I made the mistake of buying this thinking it would be a nice change from a traditional dial combo round lock that I was using at the gym.

That's a really fun movie to watch and also teaches you a few things. I can't say how many times I've watched it since the '80s. This sequel should never have been made. It just isn't worthy. It in no way is as captivating, enduring, or funny as Revenge of the Nerds. There are some scant funny moments, but most of the scenes that are supposed to be funny just aren't. Takashi (the oriental guy from the first film) wasn't even in this movie. The story was plodding and for the most part uninteresting. I was disappointed even back when Nerds in Paradise was released many years ago. Some movies just don't need sequels. Stick to the first movie and don't bother with this second installment. Sequels aren't always bad, but some movies just don't need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge of the Alpha's","review":"All I can say is \\"why?\\" I guess after the first one it would be hard to take this any place else!

Also, why take it to Florida? I would, if they had to make another one, would have liked to see it take place the next school year.

This was her second album and features such highlights as \\"Blame It On The Sun\\"{, \\"Mr. Troublemaker\\", \\"Love Comes From The Most Unexpected Places\\" and the Gospel-Funk-Disco hybrid JAM \\"Come In Heaven, Earth Is Calling\\". Motown really NEEDS to reissue all four of Tata's albums on CD as they've been unavailable for too long and are more than worthy of a reappraisal. On the plus side, this Japanese import CD was properly remastered and the P-Vine label should be thanked for reissuing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!","review":"I own this on vinyl and I'm ecstatic that it has finally been released on CD.

There are SO many color options available it's a bit overwhelming, and it's strange to me that the prices between them vary so much.

I am also going to check if Nine West has any other shoes that are similar!!!@August 13, 2011.Got the blue and they are even prettier and nicer in person!!!! Love 'em!!!! Husband thinks they are sexy too. Can't get better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine West Ouch","review":"I read all the reviews of these shoes about how comfortable they were and was soo looking forward to them. But they were AWFUL. It hurt just to try to slip my foot in for the first time and after 5 minutes of wearing them around the house, I couldn't stand it anymore and printed out the return slip. The angle of these heels puts tremendous pressure on the toes, which are jammed into a fairly narrow vee. I can't imagine what my feet would have felt like after wearing these for a day. Agony. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really uncomfortable. Returned them.","review":"Way too narrow. Unless you have unusually skinny feet, these shoes are too uncomfortable to wear.

I got the natural snake skin pair...and i was shocked how soft the snake skin was!! theyre true to size...i wear a 6.5 but sometimes 7...got these in 6.5 an theyre a smidge too big...but other than that...no complaints!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality of leather","review":"Color is gorgeus, high of heel is good but when I used started my problems: 1- I bought 7.5 USA size as always is my Nine West size, but these pair didn't fit me, they were bigger, so were inconfortable sensation when I walked, I have to put them silicon pads in there trying to fit me. But worst part was when I used just 4 times, and leather was broke in the front. They unstiched!!! If you could see, heel are new, because shoes are new and I couldn't used them. They're was terrible! I'm very dissapointed with these shoes"},{"rating":"2","title":"My everyday go to pump!","review":"I'm part of a vibrant marketing team, so I'm always on my feet and expected to be the trendsetters at the office (marketing is supposed to be creative right?) I love this range of pumps, the platform allows for great arch support and the heel isnt too high because of the platform. With low arches, the arch support works perfectly. I ended up buying these in almost every colour they come in.I'm rating this as a 4 star though, because I noted with the black leather one, the sole is a bit rubbery, so its actually prone to digs and chips on the rubber if it gets nicked.The heel is also the same leather, so it can get dug into - didn't happen with the other styles though.Still one of my all time fav pumps :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so brand new shoe","review":"I was disappointed in the pair that I received. They looked worn except for the bottom of the heels. A bit discolored, creases and a slight spot that appeared like it was exposed to heat. However the return was simple enough and I received another pair the following week. But unfortunately slight creases or wrinkles were noticeable and scratches or scuffs. I wiped them down with leather cleaner / conditioner which hep restore them a bit. Another issue is they scuff very easily. I kept them anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"item came with a defect","review":"item came with a defect with the platform was little detached, besides in some parts of the shoe the synthetic was detached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who sized these shoes?","review":"The shoe is cute but the sizing is WAY off.

I normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 and with these I had to get size 6 and then add a pad to the back of it and also one for the sole. The effort is worth it, once I got these to fit right, they became my favorite pair of black shoes. They look great with jeans, work pants, skirts, and work dresses. I have them in red suede as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern exotica","review":"Guitarist and composer Ben Vaughn has obviously listened long and hard to early-'60s exotica, TV themes, spy films, spaghetti Westerns, and cocktail music. His Designs in Music -- a highly arranged, richly textured collection of original instrumentals -- manages to pay tribute to guitarists Hank Marvin, Duane Eddy, and Vinnie Bell, and composers Martin Denny and Ennio Morricone, without being utterly derivative. Hearing the peppy themes and doo-ahh vocals, one might be tempted to write off Vaughn's music as kitsch. But a careful listening reveals a depth in the orchestration and writing that's totally AWOL in modern pop. Vaughn's guitar palette runs the gamut from spanky, tremolo-drenched lines to moody jazz-noir, and his vintage tones are always cleverly framed by various combinations of strings, brass, reeds, old-school analog synth and combo organ, harp, percussion, pedal steel, and wordless singing. Going on a road trip? These quirky sounds will make a perfect soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCANNER RARELY WORKS","review":"I bought this particular toy because my daughter wanted to be able to 'Scan and Play'. The scanner doesn't work so she doesn't get to scan only play. I could have saved her the frustration and saved quite a bit of money if I had instead bought a different inexpensive cart. VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it! It is a perfect size for her. I read a review that the scanner was \\"touchy\\", but luckily we don't have any problems with it. The only thing with this toy is that it is a bit loud. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. I hope this was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"Santa bought this for my 6 (7 in a few weeks) old daughter and she really likes it. Once I showed her how to scan, she had no problem scanning the items. You have to make sure that you start scanning at the starting point indicated on the item. You must also make sure, like others have said, that the light stays on the entire time. I do think the time given to find items is a little short, however, it forces my daugher to stay focused and quickly find items.I am very impressed with the quality of the cart and the items. Many boxed food sets come with poorly made boxes that break and bend easily. Not these boxes. They are very sturdy. The cart is also very sturdy. Once put together, it doesn't fall apart.Overall, this is a fun, educational, well made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I just bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She had been asking for it for weeks since she saw it on a TV commercial. I brought it home and put it together and immediately we both fell in love with it! It scans the 20+ items in the cart via barcode or you can manually punch in the 3-digit item numbers from the shopping guide. The scanner works wonderfully (first time, every time) and it is great entertainment for my daughter. Definately a great gift for any child who loves to play store!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie is a Hit with Adults as Well as Kids","review":"Gave this to my friend's little girl for her second birthday. Two of the Dads had more fun putting it together (very little needed). The kids at the party waited paitently while the adults took a turn at \\"buying\\" and \\"paying for\\" the groceries. It was awarded the neatest toy given by all the parents in attendance."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T GET SCANNER TO WORK","review":"FOR $50, THE SCANNER NEEDS TO WORK CONSISTENTLY. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE ORANGE JUICE TO SCAN 3 TIMES ALTHOUGH WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO SCAN EVERY ITEM PROBABLY A DOZEN TIMES EACH. NOT ONLY CAN A 4 YEAR OLD NOT GET IT TO SCAN BUT NO ADULT THAT HAS TRIED CAN GET IT TO SCAN. I CAN'T RETURN THIS ITEM QUICK ENOUGH. WITHOUT THE WORKING SCANNER, I WOULD BE JUST AS HAPPY WITH THE $8 GENERIC SHOPPING CART THAT TRU SELLS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I would thoroughly recommend this book for all players up to master strength.

In particular I recommend his victories at New York '24 v. Emanuel Lasker and Savielly Tartakower. Also a fine game is Capa v.. Sammy Reshevsky, Nottingham '36. A game collection and a text book. Get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Capablanca On The Cheap","review":"Chernev examines and explains sixty of the great Cuban's best endgames in a very clear fashion and makes it all fascinating.

It's not recommened for this type of cymbal, I think mostly because of the rings around the cymbal which make it a little more difficult to clean, but it made my cymbals look like they came right out of the box.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, unique and novel theme, well researched","review":"I really enjoyed this mystery. My usual technique is to devour mysteries, quickly trying to figure out the whodonit. This book forced me to detour into The Joy of Cooking, Simca's Cuisine, and even the Dictionary. I love books that make me look up works like sabayon, cpes, and the more than one meaning of flan. I thought I knew a bit about cooking, but was quickly humbled by the author's extensive knowledge. As a lover of light but witty fiction (it sure beats the sitcoms) and cooking (I loved reading about his detailed preparation techniques of even the simplest of meals!), I will definitely move on to the next title in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Cooks Spoil the Soup","review":"Of interest to gourmets and wine-bibbers, this however has far too many personalities to be kept in mind when considering who-dunnit.

It was pleasant that the mystery-reading viewpoint character amusedly compared himself, to his detriment, to fictional detectives of fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD including a booklet with the lyrics","review":"It is a good CD for children with many songs that they know. This CD also include a full booklet with the lyrics of all 16 songs. Furthermore, the 16 songs are recorded a second time with separete tracks so you may hear only the tune or only the lyrics. Even if I do not always like the short introduction music on some songs and even if I have some reserves on some way some songs are sung, I will say that it is a good CD, the quality of recording is good and you may buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I assumed this would be another text book style read consisting of sterile,bare bones info.

The play control of this game is excellent and coupled with a fun physics engine. You will not find the game childish as you may other platformers. Excellent heroesque music, beautifull graphics and steady pitfall style challenges will capture your imagination and draw you into a simple, yet entertaining plot centered around discovering an ancient power & a lost fabled city. And the constant challenges of pitfalling, will delight your sense of accomplishment or possibly frustrate you at times. All in all, a positively brilliant title.My only caution, is to point out that the game will not minimize to the task bar - so be sure your computer is optimized for it before you get into the game, and try to save often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I remember buying the original Pitfall when I was in 5th grade. I stayed up past midnight to play it on a school night, and couldn't wait to play it the next day. Fast forward to this game... The graphics are cartoonish, but not stupid or childish. The voice acting is equally appropriate. Some of the jumps are a little crappy, and sometimes it's not entirely clear where exactly you need to go.

I enjoyed when she spoke about Bollywood films as an escape for those in poverty.The scene in which the Reena gets her revenge was, to be blunt, ridiculous, if not for her actions, then for the speech she gives.This book was an entertaining read, but it could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gushy, but nothing new","review":"Rather uninspired writing.

Ortner is arguing precisely the opposite point, that the Sherpas were able to resist and transform Himalayan mountaineering, and their role in it, to their advantage. Likewise, it's not a postmodernist book, it's a deliberately realist book, aimed at showing the influences of western climbers, Tibetan monks, and the internal dynamics of Sherpa society on the Sherpa-climber relationships and how they've changed over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark!","review":"The author is clearly an expert on Sherpas, having lived and studied among them as an anthropologist for over 40 years. She writes this book for the layman in a form of anthropoligical study. She misses the mark both in terms of layman interest, and in terms of an enlighting anthropoligical study. Ms. Ortner looks at several facets of Sherpa life with a view toward how and why Sherpas became involved in mountaineering. It was clear to me, despite all the research and academia, the answer as to how and why remains perfectly clear and not too profound. Carrying loads, establishing camps, and fixing ropes provide the Sherpa with an extremely high income (relative to their society), allowing the climbers to provide greater comfort and a better standard of living for themselves and their families. I was very disappointed in this particular book, and I do not recommend it as a means of insight into the Sherpas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more to read and learn about the Sherpa...","review":"The book was very disappointing - ancient format- opinionated. The author suggests walking a tightrope in theoretical anthropology...yet she presents a really biased,dogmatic,authoritarian point of view. The title is great, but the content - Sherpa - is not well represented here and easily confusing and deceptive. A real disappointment.

Often basic watercolor books are too simplistic. The illustrations in this book give you something to aspire to. The color reproductions of Catherine's own work are exquisite. The chapter entitled IS THIS A MISTAKE OR A CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY? spoke directly to me and my consistent insecurities in my work. Catherine's dictum that \\"mistakes are gifts\\" is a message I am trying to integrate into my art.

The one considered the \\"standard\\" by most kiln-formers is the book by Brad Walker by the same title. Walker's book is both comprehensive, and lavishly and clearly illustrated. [...]I hope folks who are seriously interested in learning about kiln-working glass will take a look at Brad Walker's book. It is more expensive than this [one], but worth every cent. It is the best resource I have seen on the craft and art of kiln-working glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Absolutely Great!

It ends where it starts.The work starts out in Mississippi, then segues to Chicago, Washington, Chicago and back to Mississippi. In the process we cover the technological origins of the Great Migration, the building to the second Chicago ghetto, the rise and fall of the Great Society and the remigration (albeit scant) back to Mississippi. All of this is seen through the eyes of several families that took part in the migration.Thus this is not the format we are used to in dealing with historical works. I found the mixture of historical narrative and the reality of the families involved to be a charming mix, one that touched me on a human scale.I read this work at the same time I read \\"The Building of the Second Ghetto\\" (a rather more opaque but valuable work). The two complimented each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!! This is a must read.","review":"I read this book in school for An African American class.

Your average Todd fan will think it pointless (come on, is playing \\"Drunken Blue Rooster\\" and \\"Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song\\" concurrently really worth recording? Sheesh.)

I Can't Believe is a love song for all time. Flyin' The Flannel is THE song to drive by, Down With The Bass is of course a bass players dream. Lost Colors displays Watts unique and unparalled ability to cram poetry and grit into the same verse better than any other artist. Plus, you get the tough guy stomp of Anti-Mysogeny Manuever and The First Cuss. Plus that really great/weird cover Walking The Cow.

When buying as many as 10 cartridges, the ability to store these cartridges for future use is IMPORTANT. Without the boxes, the wrappers could be easily punctured and the ink dry out.

Plus, everything that can snowball when these subjects become a reality in a families life.I felt that though perhaps not a critical success on many accounts. The actors deserved acknowledgment for their near perfect portrayals.

For example, Cook always named street signs and exits. I understand that Cook is just trying to make it easier for the reader to create a mental picture in their head, but really all that detail is beside the point! The ending was kind of crazy and out there but, hey so was the whole book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation Review","review":"Mutation by Robin Cook has many unrealistic features to it, and really has horrible descriptions. You really can't ever get into the book because it is was too predictable, and gives the story away the ending after about 120 pages. The book was really long and most of the pages weren't necessary and takes up extra space to get to the good parts. In the book it takes the reader no time, to understand that VJ is a very smart individual and has became mutated. I was glad when I got to the end because I didn't have to read anymore of this pointless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Cook thinking?","review":"Dr. Robin Cook may be a good author but after reading \\"Mutation\\" you would never image that to be true. The far-fetched and unrealistic plot made it hard for the reader to believe that such events could take place. Not to mention the characters are ridiculous. Vj, and eleven year old boy, accomplishes more than most highly educated adults could ever image to be possible. The plot and characters display issues but then there is the problem with the extreme amount of detail. Highway exits, street names, and the weather are all examples of this detail that is just thrown in adding no real importance to the novel. All of this tied in with the heavy foreshadowing of the ending just leaves one sad story. Cook may written some decent novels in his time but \\"Mutation\\" is defiantly not one of them....What was he thinking???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story-Bad writing","review":"This book The Mutation, by Robin Cook, started out with such amazing promise. It had all the qualifications of a great book. It had a good story line of a mad scientist genetically altering his own child in order to make him the smartest man on the planet, a sort of frankenstein remake. It also had a good setting. The lab where the scientist goes mad is beautifully laid out. Plenty of room for mischief. Somewhere Mr. Cook lost his way though. He got too caught up in giving all these elaborate scientific terms and directions to places that we really don't need to know. I mean why would i care what highway exit somebody had to take to get to a place that really adds nothing to the story line at all. He lost me between that and the part where the 10 year old genious slash drug lord ends up killing people. Im sorry to say this but this isn't a \\"scientific thriller\\", it is a \\"scienfic bummer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"blown away","review":"As a fan of Science Fiction and suspense thriller I was blown away by Dr. Robin Cooks \\"Mutation\\"; blown away by the imaginative plot, Cook's superior intelect and his utter disregard for the reader's common sense. This dimented attempt at being a Frankenstein-Mythos has a shere lack of surprise and leaves the reader to sort through piles of pejorative verbiage that Cook spews onto the pages like vomit on an ugly shirt. While winding through the fears of genetic engineering and ridiculous story twists the plot becomes more and more predictable the closer one gets to the overt ending. At best \\"Mutation\\" would be the perfect book for someone who is serving a life sentence and needs something to swallow in order choak and die."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so good \\"mutant\\"","review":"My first impression of the book Mutation, by Robin Cook, was a good one. It is a typical story in which a genetically altered child is too smart for his age and begins to conduct dangerous experiments at his father's lab and at home. Being a suspense/thriller novel, much of the story will leave you guessing, but Mr. Cook keeps you guessing for a long time and it is not until the end of the story that it gets suspenseful. Also, the first one hundred pages are repetitive. Characters are introduced, and you don't learn enough about them to care what is going to happen to them in the future. In this novel, Mr. Cook gives vivid descriptions of everything, which helps to paint a picture, but in order to paint that picture you must get past the large vocabulary. In my opinion, this is a good book for someone with high intelligence who is into science. If you're looking for a \\"never want to put down\\" book, Mutation is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed feelings","review":"At the end of Robin Cooks Mutation, I was left with mixed feelings. While I found myself unable to put the book down, I continued to come back to the fact that they're so many pointless descriptions. He draws the book out and uses language not suitable for anyone with an education level below a PH.D. Beyond the endless unneeded details there were many similarities and parallels between Mutation and the classic story of Frankenstein. I would not suggest this book to others, although this modern rewrite makes Frankenstein seem less painful. Overall, I rate this book a two, and I wouldn't say it is worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not So Shocking Thriller!","review":"The characters presented in this novel are so unbelivable, flaky, and unimaginable. Robin Cook's Mutation is based upon a scientist who goes astray oo an experiment that involves is unborn child, VJ. VJ is a complete monster that destroys everything in his path...at the age of ten he is more intelligent than Einstein himself! This rewrite of Frankenstein has all the charateristics of a bad book. The author, Robin Cook, uses useless information and medical terms that the average reader could not comprehend. only three words come to mind: appalling, repulsive, and horrendous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Mutation","review":"Expectations and predetermined thoughts aside about this Mutation's author Robin Cook, lets get to the heart of the book, the characters. The characters in this book are almost all unbelievable or made unbelievable but their interaction with other characters. For example VJ the 10 year old genius that manufactures cocaine at his fathers lab and sells it to the mob is the most unbelievable. First off the mob would never be involved nor really talk to a 10 year old boy in regards to cocaine. Secondly even by age ten I doubt any boy even a genetically altered one would have no emotions and the intelligence to keep his parents out of any dealings with any other adults other than family friends and coworkers. Overall the book is entertaining but could use some real help with some of the characters and the way they interact with other characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, average writing","review":"It's a typical Robin Cook book with lot of biotechnology jargon. Its' about this scientist who mutates the zygote of his own kid for some experiment. What he ends up with is a child with a abnormally high IQ and absolutely zero emotions. His child turns out into a lonely, unemotional kid, totally detached from this world. This book is about this exceptional, abnormal child and his effect on the people around him.The story is gripping, though predictable. It's a page turner - one can finish the book in a day. The writing is nothing remarkable. The only factor than can keep the reader interested in the book is the story. The characters are pretty well developed, though there a few loopholes.If you are looking for a quick, science thriller, then pick up this book. If you have had enough of science jargons, then move on to the next shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully Mutation is not mutated!","review":"The suspenseful thriller, Mutation written by Robin Cook was not a book that should be recomended to read. Mutation is about a guy who mutates invitro babies. His fanatasies about having a perfect son comes back to haunt him and everything tears his life away. This book did not have anything to keep the reader reading, it was very easy to close. The description in this book is to drawn out. Cook uses to many medical terminology especially when describing the steps to mutating the babies. He also went on about the weather and street signs, which loses the readers attention. The characters in the book were oblivious to what was going on around them, even the stuff happening right under their nose. It is pathetic when a little boy can out smart his own mother and father. Don't waste any time with picking up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"The book \\"Mutation\\", by Robin Cook was a very different book, at the beginning it seemed normal enough with character development and the plot backround. But after the first hundred or so pages i didnt feel the personal relationship that i normally feel from characters. they were cold and seemingly unforgiving. the circumstances were also very unbelivable and strangly copied off of \\"Frankenstien\\". This book was to unbelivable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Medical Hodgepodge Overload\\"","review":"\\"Mutation\\" by Robin Cook is a story about a scientist whose pride drives him to create a child who is smarter than almost anyone in the world. Unfortunately, his creation takes a wrong turn and now he has to stop it. The problem with the book is the way that it is told. Cook uses excessive medical hodgepodge which loses the attention of the reader. Also, the book is too predictable. Cook gives away the plot after the first 100 pages. It doesn't take the reader long to realize that this is just a weird re-mix of \\"Frankenstien\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutations Review By Robin Cook","review":"Mutations by Robin Cook is a medical thriller of a young boy who had great knowlege in science. After trying to follow in the foot steps of his father he built a secret under ground laboratory and was a drug dealer to pay for it. In my eyes the book was very un believable and irrational. The scientific terms used in mutations were heard to understand and much of the story seemed very unreal. I won't ever pick up another Robin Cook novel to read his style of writing isn't for me. If you like to read medical thrillers this novel is going to be perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This medical thriller was a modern day \\"Frankenstein\\". Cook had the perfect combination of well-developed characters and an easy to follow plot. The characters were easy to understand, without knowing every little detail about them. Some characters were difficult to relate to, but this was no story about every day people. Cook repeatedly was also able to describe scenes without completely losing the plot in descriptions. All in all, I would say that \\"Mutation\\" by Robin Cook is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation good? Yeah right, try again.","review":"I think it was Lamar from Reading Rainbow that said \\"Everytime you open a book, you open a new and better world\\". After reading Mutation, I am saying he is wrong. It was not a new world and definitly not a better one.This book was a direct, ahem, mutation of the original Frankenstein. For instance, Dr. Victor Frank. It doesn't take a genious to figure out that Frank is a direct allusion to Frankenstein. Dr. Frank then makes his \\"monster\\" but this time in the form of a son. His son goes onto to poision (actually give liver cancer) to his brother, teacher, and nurse, all because they found out about his underground lab. Speaking of the underground lab, VJ cured infertility, making women pregnant with his dads sperm and how does he pay for it? With drug money. Sound impossible? He did all this before the age of 11. I dont recommend this book to anyone and feel sorry for those who did read this. I also apologize to Robin Cook for writing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutation, Overall Good","review":"Robin Cook's book Mutation was a scientific thriller that kept me reading page after page. From the beginning of the book where a strange birth takes place to where you find out Vj's a kid super genius, how couldn't you keep reading on?Mutations is about a Dr. Victor Frank whose love for science ultimately conflicts with his better judgment...This book was not only interesting and entertaining but it was also well written. Cook's method of using a lot of detail pays off in this thriller. His descriptions of things such as weather and highway signs help the reader paint a visual picture while reading. This book raises many important matters, one of which is cloning. Cook states his opinion on cloning through his writing very clearly, and I suggest reading this book to all people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Mutation, by Robin Cook, is not a book for those looking for an intellectual read. The plot is rather insane, to the pooint of needing to suspend your suspension of disbelief, simply to get through it. Aside from the insanity,the plot is predictable enough to warrant several occasions of flippinf ahead to overcome the characters ever-so-slow realizations. The fact that Cook has decided to add many specicfic references to highway exits and medical terms the average reader wouldn't understand only serves to further detract form the novel.This novel is by no means boring, but on the other side of the spectrum, it is not a read that will invoke the use of your brain, aside from the act of reading itself. Therefore, if you are siitin around with nothign better to do and the book happens to fall into your lap you might consider reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation","review":"Robin Cooks medical thriller \\"Mutation\\" is a laughable attempt to create a modern day Frankinstien horror novel. The unrealistic characters, and unexplainable events that occur throughout the book create a twisted plot from start to finish. The unnecessary descriptive details add to loss of interest in the book. The predictable novel dissappoints readers with a rushed ending of unthinkable events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medical Thriller or Classic Killer?","review":"Robin Cook's 'Mutation' offers little or no intellectual substance. In this so called \\"Medical thriller,\\" we are introduced to several characters so unbelievable that in no way could we relate our live's to their's. The only thing connecting them with the rest of human kind is their physical make-up, which is described in too much detail. These as well as several other long uninteresting details are distributed so imensely throughout the novel that one is forced to wonder if they are mere space fillers or are just completely inane. Whatever the case, there is actually little importance contained in such deatils. Finally, though, and most imporatntly, mutation is no more than a modernized version of Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' which not only degrades but disrespects the classic novel's ideology by portraying it as simple and unrealistic. You may find better reading on the side of a passing bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Cook missed with this book","review":"Throughout Mutation the parent/child relationship is very awkward. VJ's mother slowly notices that VJ is nothing like other kids his age. VJ has very few friends. When Martha(mother) finds out that VJ was \\"made\\" by his father, Dr. Frank, she realizes what is wrong with her son. The parent/child relationship gets very bad, even violent when VJ takes his mother captive in his underground lab. The interesting part about the whole book is while martha thinks something is wrong with VJ, Dr. Frank thinks his son is perfect, it isn't until the end of the story until he admits something went terribly wrong with his experiment of creating his super, genius son, VJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long & Boring","review":"\\"Mutation\\" by Robin Cook is a scientific thirller that isn't one of his best books. Long drug out descriptions, big complication medical terms, and many unrealistic events. A 10 year old boy manufacturing his own drugs and housing his own secret laboratory and cloning people? Come on, give me a break. This is a poorly designed book and I give it a two-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never ending Mutation","review":"The book Mutation, the so called \\"Medical Thriller\\", was not so much a thriller. The main character, Dr. Frank decides to make the son of his dreams through invitro fertilization, but everything turns into a disaster. The book Mutation was too predictable. The reader knew what was going to happen after the first one hundred pages. The author, Robin Cook, used to many scientific words and went into scientific descriptions, which makes the reader curious as to what he is talking about. Although he had good description, it began to drag on. Cook's novel was an easy read, but not recommended for personal enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation is quick to read but bad for the brain","review":"In Robin Cook's Mutation, many classical creator vs. creation themes are addressed, reminiscent of Marry Shelly's \\"Frankenstein.\\" Cooks new take on a very relevant issue in today's technological world is a misfire and fails to transfer the true emotional impact bioengineering would have on Cook's faceless, dauntless, trite, and almost cold characters. Cook uses his broad knowledge of medical jargon to keep the reader interested, but fumbles when plot twists become incomprehensible and unimaginative. I would recommend this book to someone in the mood for a quick one-day read, or someone on a long flight home. I wouldn't expect to be changed much as a person though, maybe just annoyed and ready to go to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come On!!!","review":"For all those who have shot down Mutations you must have not read the whole book. Mutations was a quality book that kept everything interesting. From VJ's high intellegence to the bad things that were happening around the house. I never wanted to stop reading this novel. I will admit some unecessary deatail but otherwise a well written book was published. This book maybe not be one of Robin Cook's best pieces but it was a great novel. It starts wtih an extremely smart infant to a little genius that can launder money and have his own lab. This book is well beyond my expectations of a good novel. I would recommend this piece to everyone looking for an exciting piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Overused Theme","review":"\\"Mutation\\", a novel by Robin Cook, was a hard story to get into. The reader had no comprehension of Cook's medical terms and the characters and the plot he used were very unbelievable. The reader was not involved in the novel, or the slightest bit interested, until getting past the first 100 pages because of the over descriptive words. \\"Mutation\\" was just another story with the overused theme, \\"man can't play god.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I found a big mistake in this book","review":"Every time I read a book of Robin Cook I hate all kinds of doctors, you don't know what can be true in the field of investigation. But this book has a big mistake, this mistake is that VJ only has 11 years and he made a laboratory by himself, sell drugs, and have a big team working for him and nobody knew it, that can be true only if Dr. Cook change VJ's age to 20 years, then everything could be possible and then this book will be a 5 stars book.Taking that away with the explanation of the ADN formulas that I didn't understood, this is an easy book to read it will keep you interested in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, but move on.. they get better","review":"This is probably the worst Robin Cook book.

However, within five years, Frank's other son, David, dies mysteriously from a rare form of cancer, as does Janice Fay, David's governess. In the present day, VJ acts like a little Hitler and it's not long before his Mom suspects something pretty evil going on. The plot moves along at a steady if not frenetic pace and by the climax, the ending is obvious. Is there a sequel? I have to check.Better than many of Cook's other novels of this time, including the abominable CHROMOSOME 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation Review","review":"In the book Mutation the author Robin Cook made the book so unbelievable in that he creates a 10 year old boy who sells drugs to the mafia to fund his underground lab.

Its a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Class Report","review":"This book was well written in many places, yet I found it hard to follow at times. I think that the author did a good job of portraying the characters and their emotions, but had a difficult time to bring it all together. I would not recommend this book to anyone, because I found the message of the book to be to personal on to many levels. If the author wanted to get his readers to not beleive in genetic testing then he got his message across clearly, but it only made sense on a certain level and past that it was inconsequential. the author left you hanging at the end and there is no follow-up book, so it makes for a disapointing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melanie Magdziarz","review":"Mutation, New York Times best seller, written by Robin Cook a medical trainee at Harvard, is a book with plots up to ears and turns and twist to your eyes.

Science was never really my best subject in school, and half the scientific termonology used in Mutation went right over my head. Many specific details Cook included in his novel were not necessary, and had no importance in telling the story. Obviously I couldnt relate to any of the characters, especially an 11 year old drug lord genius.Maybe if the story was a little more believable, I would have enjoyed it more. But Cook was trying to concoct an updated version of Frankenstein, and I dont think reality was in his agenda. Sure, if you love science and have a PHD, Mutation might be exciting. But for your everyday reader like me,it just didnt do it for me. Cook- better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An explosion of frustration and disapointment","review":"Robin Cook has created a monster. And it is robbing innocent consumers of their precious money. His latest \\"medical thriller', Mutation, is all but thrilling. His bland characters, stolen plot line and over-emphasis on medical instruments, sent the novel in a downward spiral towards an explosion that leaves all readers helpless and upset.Cook revives the Frankenstein story completely, leaving the reader without any surprise or enjoyment. The characters don't help the situation. There is no interaction between the reader and any of the characters in the whole story. So with no character connection and a halfhearted attempt at a storyline the book becomes a giant description of medical tools.

As a reader, I could see what was going to happen within the first 100 pages of the novel. This is one point that made this book badly written. Although the characters were developed well, they were simply unbelievable. They were reminiscant of the characters from Frankenstien. The names of all the characters were identical in a sense, of those in Frankenstein. Dr. Cook wrote too much on reacurring incidences with certain characters which just made the reader feel like they had just read that. Another point to harp on would be the terrible plot.

Vj tried to get all the acceptance he could from his parents and finally everything Victor was working on, backfired at him.There were many different themes in this book, but the one that stuck out to me was the parent and child relationships. This theme made the book very suspensful and I was always waiting for something to happen between Victor and his son Vj, or Vj and his mother Martha.

The \\"cookie cutter\\" characters used in this book were unrealistic and did not develop signifigantly throughout the novel.Description played a double role in this book.

Plus the description that is included in the book makes the reader feel like they are in the story. This makes the ending of the book more of a thriller.This book was an easy read and a good book for one of those five hour car rides. The different actions the characters perform intrigue the reader while making them want more. It accomplishes the hard task of turning Frankenstein into an accurate modern tale. Now the modern day reader can relate to the reality of the story better. Even though he may get on the extreme side at times it is all used as a device to make the reader not know what to expect next. This book is great for a short fun read in a month or less. It is not one of those books that could take a half a year to finish.

The book builds on that simple idea to create a turbulent reading experience full of confusion and sour feelings from the reader.Mutation, despite some good qualities, lacks a fluid story. This hurts the book as a whole because the plot is broken by descriptions of laboratory equipment, street names, and other things that hold no bearing on the story. In Cook's defense, he does have a strong descriptive knowledge of his equipment.All in all, the book lets the reader down. The broken plot makes understanding the events too hard, and the reader then chooses not to accept them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believable or Not","review":"The medical thriller \\"Mutation\\", written by Robin Cook, is to far-fetched to actually be believable. A young child could not be capable of toying with God's own human creation. The way the characters interact with each other and their thoughts about one another are also unbelievable.

A ten year old genius and his mad scientist father's journey to become the greatest scientists while keeping it all in the dark is not just an interesting plot, but this novel is an easy read, and it's fun. On the other hand a ten- year old genius selling illegal drugs and scientifically mutating human embryos is a character all too unreal. This is just one of the many unrealistic characters in Mutation. Not only are the characters unreal but also the over used foreshadowing technique gives away the novel before it ends. If you would like to read a fun easy scientific novel with characters out of the norm you might enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutation","review":"While reading the novel Mutation, by Robin Cook, it was impossible to not see the resemblance to Frankenstein, written by Mary Shelley. Mutation was just a modern day Frankenstein story with Dr. Frank (Dr. Frankenstein) and his creation gone badly. But in Mutation, Frank's creation is his son, who builds a secret underground lab that is being funded by him manufacturing his own cocaine and is selling it to drug lords. But then, it gets better because Dr. Frank's son VJ is only eleven years old while doing all this. The book while interesting had too many specific references to medical terms that any normal person could not possibly come to terms with and also a lot of specific details that did not end up being significant at all.

I'm twenty miles north of Boston and it had trouble picking up anything without fading in and out, or picking up simultaneous stations, even when I turned it a thousand different ways. I guess, they just don't make 'em like they used to. My twenty-year-old Panasonic clock radio was twice the product, but I was looking for digital tuning. Sent this back, tried a couple more,including iHome products: no better. Sent them back. Bought a Logitech Squeezebox radio which taps into high-speed WiFi. Costs double, but reception is outstanding once you get the directions figured out and get it configured. The menus and functions are overly-complex and not terribly user friendly, and the alarm and sleep functions are unnecessarily multi-step, but as a radio...wow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great radio","review":"Was going to buy the simpler unit,but reviewers stated it was basically junk. Found this one, looked it up, found all kinds of good reviews.We have an under-cabinet unit, basically the same thing except in a different configuration.

I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one before I even sent the defective one back. Great service. The second one worked fine. I like the small size for the bedroom and the controls are easy to use, even in the dark. Sound is about what you'd expect for a small player. We had seen these at Hotel Indigo and really liked them, so I ordered one. Both items came in a timely manner, in fact the second one came within two days of letting Amazon know there was a problem.I've been very pleased, I listen to sleep music on it all night and the radio in the morning.

You have to keep going close to the unit to see what buttons perform what functions, until you memorize the layout.The adjustable brightness is nice. CD function is easy. 5 Station Presets (as far as I can tell), are also a nice feature.As for the sound, well... all these small sized radios pretty much sound the same. Without a multiple speakers configuration, it's a good enough reason for Sony not to put an EQ option on it. All in all, not a bad product at all... I would recommend it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to stay in bed just to hear the alarm go off!","review":"If only it would do the dishes too... this machine is fantastic! I can't imagine anyone not loving all its features. I can never go back to a normal alarm clock. I love the alarm settings - having two alarm features is great but being able to set one to a CD and the other to a radio wake up is fabulous. More fabulous is controlling how loud each turns on. The nap feature? Brilliant! The volume max? Crazy loud. I could have a party in my bedroom! The backlighting on the display? If I was having a party, the blue lights would create great effect otherwise, dimming it and turning it off is an easy and obvious solution. Yes, I am in love with my CD Clock Radio Alarm. How hAve I lived without one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Night Light","review":"This clock radio/CD player has the same kinds of short comings found in almost all modern clock radios and clock radio/CD combos. It has intensely bright LCD back panel lighting which even at the lowest setting will drive you to a blind fold! The controls are placed in awkward locations and difficult to find in the dark given their very small size. It has no audio out jack for external earphones or speaker. FM reception is about average as far as range reception and sound quality. Average for clock radios is almost always terrible.SONY has made some good home electronics and I was really disappointed with their effort on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted!","review":"When the CD player failed on my old Timex (Piece of junk) unit I began the search for a new one with the features I wanted. This item fit the bill 99%.It features great sound with the little conveniences I wanted.I wanted a unit that played my homemade CDs- check.I wanted duel alarms- check.The light from it can't be too bright- check.A sleep feature is necessary- check.A nap alarm would be nice- check.Nature sounds as well- Nope. That is the one thing I didn't get.I have had the unit for over a week now, the alarm requires a bit of getting use to with the insistent beep-beep that gets louder and louder, but it will do. I go to sleep to music on the 90 minute sleep setting and not having to change the alarms for a nap is nice. I love the way you touch the snooze bar and the light dims and then with a second touch, goes off. If it lasts well I will be overjoyed with the choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big but AWESOME!!!!","review":"The alarm is pretty sweet. Apart from the usual stuff that it rocks, i love the three lighting settings it has. The previous dream machine i hadhad a really bright light bleed from the back and was kinda annoying. This one eliminated that problem by having three setting, the lowest of which barely emits any light.Only two things i wish sony would fix on its next incarnation..

Save your packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sony Dream Machine makes waking up a pleasant experience!","review":"The Dream Machine is not as simple to use as a basic alarm clock with all of the many different functions, but the instructions are easy to follow. It's worth the effort to wake up to your choice of radio stations, a personally selected cd track or the alarm buzzer once you get it set up to your preferences. One drawback is it will play your MP3 player, but you can't set it to wake up to it. The second alarm is a great feature if you need 2 wake up times. I don't know why some others complained about the backlight. The option of the blue backlight for the whole Dream Machine is nice: on full is not too bright, the dim setting can barely be seen in the dark or turn the backlight off and you only see the time functions which are just bright enough, but not intrusive. The backup battery is great. It came already set to our local eastern time.My better half thinks it's one of the greatest gifts she ever received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"had the right combination of everything I was looking for","review":"compact, fits nicely on night stand.

Built-in audio cable is a nice feature and the sound is pretty good from my ipod, compared to other products I've tried. It's a little bulky, but it does a lot. I would have liked a \\"sounds\\" option- like ocean waves, etc. to sleep or wake to in addition to the radio, cd, & alarm functions. So far, I'm happy with this product. I can listen to the radio, cd, & my ipod in one place with pretty good sound for a portable unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed","review":"I had primarily purchased this clock radio for 2 purposes, one was to get access to stations my 20 dollar clock radio cannot and 2. to be able to play cds. This clock radio failed on both counts- it cannot catch stations my cheap 20 year old boom box can, and it doesn't play cds very well- it always seems to get stuck or start skiping on the 6th or 7th track. Now I wish I had invested in something a little better"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with the cd player?","review":"When the cd is playing, it is making a lot of noise.

VERY ANNOYING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is something so easy so hard?","review":"Just out of the box, this is a first impression. Major complaint: the FM reception on this model is actually worse than the 22-year-old Dream Machine that this unit replaces, even in the Mono mode. Why don't manufacturers include a simple metal telescoping antenna with these units? The pathetic little wire that passes for an antenna in this case won't stay put in your preferred position unless it's attached to something. Note to designer: remarkably, the wire Scotch-taped to our bedroom wall isn't that attractive. Who would have thought? This is a foolish economy on Sony's part. At first I thought I might be getting interference from our portable phone, which sits on the same nightstand and is plugged into the same outlet. So I unplugged the phone, but it made no difference. Decent reception: why is something so easy so hard to get right? Radios are not exactly cutting edge technology, but it seems that decent reception was an afterthought with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Clock Radio I have ever owned!","review":"I have absolutely NO complaints about this clock radio.

I especially like the dual settings for wake up times and the nap setting. The clock allows choice of which media (AM, FM or CD) and volume to wake up to. Others have expressed concern about the clock being too bright at night but I find it OK for sleeping on the lowest illumination setting - and that is easy to change. It does have a lot of buttons and settings and the first few times I set the alarm time/station/volume I had to look up the instructions. Instruction book is clear and easy to use. On the whole, I am very satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Have enjoyed using this product for the past two months.

I really could not believe so many people liked this clock its been years of slow torture for me. I cannot wait for it to break so I can toss it.

The clock does have a very large snooze bar which is handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had higher hopes","review":"Really wanted a radio in my bedroom that was capable of producing decent sound.

The CD alarm option is very poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had this for years.","review":"The other reviewers give detailed descriptions of the features so I will just say that I have had this clock for years.

In the car, the signal is strong and clear. With this radio, the signal is non-existent. The built-in antenna or some other component was not powerful enough to do what I got this for.

Worse, the volume periodically goes much louder, and then gradually falls back again to its normal level. If you want a CD player for listening to CDs as you drop off to sleep, this is a deal-breaker.Also, it doesn't come with a headphone socket, although I thought from the reviews that there was one. My fault, I guess.Overall, this is simply not good enough quality for what it costs. I would recommend buying a cheaper radio alarm clock/CD player.

We've always had luck with stylish Sony CD players. However, this time we had a few problems. Within 4 days of coming out of the box, its broken. Not only is there a couple lines missing from the display (a '3' looks like three parallel lines) but something is blown on one of the speakers. It sounds like the kind of distortion you get from putting too high of a pre-amp volume into a secondary amp. its all distorted. Unfortunately, since it was a gift, the box got thrown out. Now we're unable to return it.If it were 100% working when it arrived, it would still leave something to be desired, since clock radios sound like .. clock radios. I'd love to have some external speaker ports where I can plug in my much larger extra speakers and get a nice sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony clock radio","review":"A good radio.

If you plan on using it to listen to the radio, I would reccomend passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Options (Hopefully You're not looking to tell Time)","review":"This is a beautifully designed clock radio. After failing with a previous Sony Dream Machine, I was glad to know this one had a battery back up. Unfortunately, the time display also features a back light for all of the front buttons. There are 3 brightness adjustments, however during daylight hours, it's very difficult to read (So good luck reading the clock display if there is a touch of sunlight coming in your room). If I try to place it on the brightest setting, this area of the room is filled with the bright and somewhat annoying blue light. I'm sure one could get accustomed to this, but why pay this amount of money if it's not nearly perfect?Pros:**Lots of functions**Battery back up (lithium built in)**Digital TunerCons:**Very poor clock display.**Unable to adjust the clock display without adjusting every other button on the face at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service and Excellent product","review":"I love this little but strong clock/CD/alarm/radio. It is beautiful! It has everything I need on it including the Napping alarm. I can set my alarm to wake up to a specific song on the CD or the radio. The snooze button is big so i can just tap on it when i'm sleeping. The numbers on are easy to read from far away. It is easy to use if you are used to electronics.

Personally I think a singing head is just plain creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"My daughter got this as a gift for Christmas and I wish she hadn't! The idea itself is pretty cool, a singing barbie styling head with a microphone, sounds great. But what you don't realize until you open it and play with it is, the moving motion of the barbie's jaw makes a loud clicking sound which makes it annoying to listen to the singing. There IS a volume control on this toy, it's located directly on the front (it's leaf shaped). But the clicking sound is still just as loud. And there are random voices during the song, from what I assume is supposed to be the other animals that are attached to the barbie head, but their mouths don't move so it seems a little creepy. My daughter played with it once and tossed it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality - not recommended","review":"I was really happy to find this styling head as my six year old daughter had one on her wishlist for Christmas, and she already knew the Rosella story from the dvd and her Rosella Barbie doll. But I am so disappointed! And also my girl: the heads' hair looked liked a toddler already treated it with a scissor, it's hardly brushable because it's not smooth but felted and intractable. The caraoke feature: when the head is singing, the lower jaw is moving that noisy that one can hardly understand the song. It sounds like a machine. The head comes with Talula, the racoon and the peacock, but they all are fixed, so you cannot play with them separately. To shorten it, this head is trash that doesn't fulfill any of his functions. It would have gone back if it hasn't been delivered by the \\"Christkind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not practical (or functional!)","review":"My daughter received this from her Nana for her 5th birthday. While my 8-year-old son was carefully helping me remove the head from all the wires, etc. in the box, he snagged his finger in a tangle in Barbie's hair, and the whole lock of hair came right out. We were all kind of dumb-founded, and my son (being the boy he is) took about five strands of hair in his fingers and gently pulled up and most all the strands came out. The hair is difficult to comb through, especially with the little brush that comes with it, and there is no weight to hold the head down, so she tips over easily. The only good part of this toy is the microphone component. My daughter would walk around singing in the microphone, dragging the useless Barbie head around.

If you really like to know more about these Santa Fe Streamliners, I would suggest the book Streamliners: The Pre-war years and Streamliners: Post-war years. Those book has more information than this book.

The characters and plot are both intriguing and well-thought out. Unfortunately, Wright spends too much time describing unnecessary scenes.It's difficult to write a GOOD dream sequence; there's always the danger that the reader will be overwhelmed while trying to figure out symbolic connections and allusions. This book is full of dream and memory sequences, some of which aren't necessary to either plot or character development; they punctuate the story and are slightly painful to read (boring actually). I had a very hard time actually getting to the end of this novel because of all the irrelevant prose I had to plough through.Essentially, the bones of this novel seem strong, but they are buried under a mountain of dross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wright should stick to Sci-Fi","review":"As K.

For starters, you cannot put the lock behind the trigger. It has to go in front of the trigger to work. This causes the lock to be able to engage the trigger, thus making it able to be fired. Second and finally, the combination is very hard to set and I managed to brick mine so that it did not recognize any combinations. Luckily, it was not on my handgun at the time. What a waste of $12. I recommend you look up Project ChildSafe and get a free gun lock from your local sheriff or police department.

I set the combo according to the instructions, tested it, then installed it on my gun. And then the combo would no longer work. Thinking it was stuck on the gun and needed a gunsmith, I left it on there for years. One day I got the idea of trying to break the thing. So I took a pliers and used it to force the lever... and sure enough... I got the thing open with little effort.One thing I do have to say about it, is that if you have the thing clamped all the way down, it is nearly impossible to exploit the inside with a screw driver (like other gun locks) due to where they put the ratchet... If the keyed version of this lock is the same, then it may be a solid option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but not for all handguns","review":"I installed this on my Ruger SR40C, and was not able to install it behind the trigger as I wanted to, but that's not a big deal as I won't be keeping my handgun loaded with Master Lock on so I'm not worried about an accidental discharge. I think I would have been able to get a \\"cleaner\\" install if the magazine release was not in the way. As the picture shows, it might be more suited for a revolver, or an handgun with a longer trigger pull. I was still able to install and compress the lock around the trigger guard enough to get a secure, positive fit. I think if my son comes across my handgun with the Master Lock 94DSPT installed it will deter him from wanting to play with it. However I don't think it will deter a \\"determined\\" adult from wanting to take and use the handgun (I still don't think it will be a walk in the park though).

Not only does this psychologist live in a self-aggrandized bubble, his dismission of scientific study and proven evidence of the etiology of the suicidal mind reveals his \\"psychake\\" narcissism.

I loved the storyline, and looking into the life of a girl living in the midst of the great awakening.Though... when you read the back, it talks a lot about Maggie becoming friends with her friend, Adelade's slave girl, Melee. Upon reading the book, it took me up until I think Chapter nine, and she then gets very sick and dies in the last chapter, chapter 15. Though, throughout those chapters, very little was mentioned about Melee.

THe most recognizable thing about this record is it makes you feel like you are listening to Born to do it again. The vibe, the sound, the overall feel of the album has Born to do it all over it. Songs like Let Her Go, One Last Dance, Thief in the Night, My Love Dont Stop and the sexy Take Em Off. I am absolutely glad i got this album and glad to see that Craig is still doing his thing.

The only faster songs are \\"All The Way\\" and \\"Just Chillin\\", David's most upbeat, danceworthy song on the album. His ballad, \\"Unbelievable\\" is very smooth and sincere, and slower than any other Craig song released on CD to date. Other noteworthy songs include \\"Hypnotic\\", a slow jam worth listening to when you're gettin' down with your hunny, \\"Separate Ways\\" that incorporates a sweet guitar melody, and \\"Thieves in the Night\\", an edgy song about his best friend stealing his woman.

Let it be not an all-in-all tutorial but some concept and in-depth material on the most significant topics.(though the publisher won't benefit from this kind of strategy - it's always better to write a dozen of books of one domain than having one may be two volumes covering essentials).A very(!) good example of book for professionals(asp.net 1.1) - is the book of Fritz Onion - \\"Essential ASP.NET With Examples in C#\\".Overall the book is good(for beginners) or for upgrading from previous version of asp.net(though it could have been more compact then)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview of how to develop professional ASP.NET 2.0 websites","review":"It is difficult to find one book that will tell you everything you need to know.

As a painter myself, and a Hemingway reader, one of my favorite poems is \\"What Hemingway learned from Cezanne.\\" He compares the process of the artist and author writing, \\"You must build a sentence like a mountain...Each piece must be inevitable. Like a scripture you cannot erase...\\" Shumate's poetry lives up to just this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly brilliant","review":"The thing about Shumate's poetry is that it is deceptively simple. That is, it reads simply, but both the composition of a good prose poem and the digestion of one are much more complex than first glance would lead a person to believe. There's another review here that mocks the prose poem as a \\"you too can write poetry\\" or somesuch. Nothing could be further from the truth. The prose poem is, if anything, even more complex because the poet is required to control things, to set tone and pace, without the use of line breaks and traditional stanzas.I came across Shumate's work in _Good Poems for Hard Times_ and sought out all that I could find both online and by buying this book.

The entire collection reeks with the stench of slowly evaporating embalming fluid while it embarrasses the occasional conscious reader with its contrived exhibitions of forced benevolence and the kind of deep thought prevalent among extinct tribes of pygmys. The overarching earnestness is stifling--an evening of dental surgery without aesthetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's be honest","review":"Let's be honest: Most poetry in contemporary America is really prose poetry, it just doesn't look that way. Most poems are just a paragraph disemboweled and then strung out down the page -- there seems to be little reason for line breaks and enjambment.

Fanciful and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"You TOO can write poetry!!!","review":"Ever wonder how to win a writing prize? Be pompous and earnest and pretend to take chances. Frankly, this is appalling drivel. For instance, what did Hemingway learn from Cezanne? How to build sentences like mountains. There's not a mountainous sentence in all of H. The question might be better put: what did David Shuamate learn from Cezanne? --To write with little dots. Sometimes they make a picture but don't look too close, cause it's mostly just pretend.

I also appreciate that this is a normal looking gym bag - no embroidered lotus patterns or chakras or other stuff all over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rope inside the handle is exposed","review":"I have to say it's probably my mistake because I expect WaiLana product to be made with exceptional quality. The delivery did come quickly but immediately I have noticed pieces of threads left in the package. So I took my time to clear the threads off the bag with a lint remover. Yes I do like the size of this bags. It roomy enough to fit my mat and towel. But when I drop the handles I was disappointed by the rope inside the handle exposed. Yes, you don't see it when you carry the bag but I see it when I drop the handles to get to my mat. I did receive a quick refund from returning the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal!!!","review":"Probably most folks who will look at this book are already believers in animal communication but even for those like me who are, there is an abundance of profound and amazingly touching anecdotes in it.My wife and I have called on Marta for help with our cats on several occasions with great success. As a direct result of reading her previous book we can now often communicate directly with them ourselves. This new book is truely a gem and whichever book you read first, you will likely end up wanting to get the other as well! They are easy to read and understand, and make great gifts! Even children who are too young to be able to read on them on their own can learn to communicate with animals; actually learn more easily than adults.Even if you don't have a live-in companion, animals are all around us and they love it when you make deeper contact with them. If you love animals, this book is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconvinced? Read this book and see","review":"In this book Marta Williams carries forward the concepts described in Learning Their Language. She gives many case histories, examples of how intuitive communication has been critical in the lives of the animals whose cases are described. This is both fascinating and moving. The implications are unnerving, but worth incorporating into your world view."},{"rating":"2","title":"TALKING WITH ANIMALS","review":"This book was so interesting that I read it in two sessions. Parts were funny and parts were sad, but it was all well done and believable. Makes me want to sit right down and learn how to do this myself.

Keep an open mind and it's wonderful what gifts we receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition","review":"FYI the Kindle edition that they have listed here for rent or purchase is NOT the same book.

Don't think you're saving a buck as this isn't worth it","review":"Stay away from this product. I bought the 12 pack and as my Canon cartridges started to empty I began replacing them with these. At first I thought all was going well (after only one cartridge) but as I replaced more of them, I saw the photos start to get fuzzier and fuzzier. Not only that but the color was off on them too - I printed a photo I already had printed with the Canon ink and it was way off. The ink also dries more slowly so the photos stay sticky much longer. I am afraid my print head is probably all gooped up too. I think I paid about $22 for the 12 pack which is ridiculous really to think you can buy a quality ink product at under $2 per cartridge. I am a sucker apparently but if any one out there saves themself the trouble, I will feel less bad about my own experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Works","review":"I don't know how or why it should, but it works. I tested it to see if there was a difference between using it or not. What a difference, the loaves were like night and day.

I'll order some more tonight, I'm not going to do without this stuff. It's great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't working for me but....","review":"maybe it's because the directions for using are not clear.

It helped me focus on important aspects of relationships and those small sacred moments everyone experiences in their lives. He is definately a poet to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific starter cookbook that produces gourmet results.","review":"This cookbook may be old and out-of-print, but it is very simply and wonderfully written.The recipes are very simple - usually very few ingredients. But, the results are spectacular tasting and it's easy to prepare a great meal (much better than Jamie Oliver, etc.).The author was an Italian aristocrat who came to the US after WW II and got treasured recipes from her favorite Italian restaurants.Once one starts to use this book, your friends and guests will continue wanting to come to dinner and most meals take no more than 1/2 hour to prepare.Also, because the ingredients are rather common, they are not too expensive. So it's also affordable gourmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the dirt you'll find on a pair of old cleats","review":"And what dirt it is! Yes, this book is a useful corrective for those who think of Baseball as something sweet like lemonade or mother's milk. Like stand-up comedy, baseball seems to attract humans who are closer to monsters than most regular people, so mixed in with the good guys is a wide variety of cheaters, losers, misanthropes, crooks and brats. Indeed, no matter what team you root for, you know in your heart they aren't all perfect gentlemen all the time.Ty Cobb alone deserves a whole volume to himself. Of course for every bigot, etc., there's a Branch Rickey so the whole picture isn't as bleak as Scheinin paints it. Still, he's a talented writer with a knack for decoupage, and his cut-up stories amuse and provoke. Batter up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast and entertaining read.","review":"\\"Field of Screams\\" was a fast read and a lot of laughs but make no mistake about it, the author wanted to and did show the underbelly of what once our national pastime. I enjoyed the book, however one must remember like most things in life there are two sides to a story and baseball is no different. As a lifetime fan of the game the book did not in any way taint my view of the game of baseball. I still think it's the greatest sport ever devised by man however humans are flawed and baseball is no different. For those of you that have an overly romantic view of the game perhaps you should stay away from the book. But if you are a realist and a baseball fan by all means get this book. It's very entertaining and I think will give you a different insight to a game that parallels the history of our country and the attitudes of our no so distant past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field of Screams is a real \\"scream\\"","review":"This look at the dark side of baseball was a fun read, and, as a long time baseball fan, I approached it as a non-serious monograph on the game's history. The book could have been shorter and more concise, and Scheinin tends to repeat himself a lot. Many of these stories and players are well known to anyone who reads baseball at length, but this is a one volume collection of baseball dirt. Nevertheless, an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for content; D- on style","review":"Field of Screams provides a number of interesting anecdotes about the dark side of baseball. Unless you enjoy being patronized, though, you probably won't like it. The author assumes you've heard none of these stories and comes off as thinking he's superior because HE has. He also thinks he's better than you because you, poor fool, believe there's some romance to baseball. Fear not; Richard Scheinin is here to enlighten you.I've tried to read it three times and put in down in disgust after ten minutes or so each time. If you want a good look at the steamy side of baseball from someone who doesn't come off thinking he's better than you, try Dan Gutman's Baseball Babylon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on sites, unreliable on practicalities","review":"I bought this in my local bookstore and tried to use it to plan a weeklong trip to Orkney. Unfortunately, while it helped me decide where to go and what to see, it failed me once I tried to make concrete plans. Many of the B&Bs had changed hands and were no longer accepting guests and those that were had often TRIPLED their prices. Save your money and visit the websites of VisitScotland and Historic Scotland which will do a better job on trip planning for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information on Orkney sites","review":"While you'll still need to use the Internet to look up things that change frequently like current rates for hotels or bed & breakfasts, and admission rates to the sights, this book provides good information about things to see and do in Orkney. I bought it to bring on a recent trip to Orkney as a backup in case I couldn't find a place to get on the Internet once I got there, and was glad that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad bit schmaltzy but a classic just the same!","review":"My search for a compact disc of this wonderful soundtrack appears to be in vain. However, I am very happy that I had the foresight to buy the vinyl with its original cover over 20 years ago. This soundtrack is beautiful, mainly because of its absolutely first rate orchestral score. Because of the time when the film was made, there are vocals that are dated but precious. Overall, it is worth having. SOMEONE SHOULD RE-RELEASE THE SOUNDTRACK. I am sure several of us would purchase it at any price! I went to a film collectors weekend in London and found some soundtrack enthusiasts who lamented that there does not appear to be any score available in Italy either."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN A MIRACLE CD","review":"Piero Piccioni's score for MORE THAN A MIRACLE was released on CD in 1996 (Screen Trax CDST 304 - 15 tracks - stereo).

These guys seem deadly seriousand come out like a \\"Killer Tomatoes\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around","review":"If you play the Clans, you NEED this book. Great data on all the major Clan 'Mechs. Some say it's not as good as TR3025 or TR3060. The books cannot be compared. 3025 was IS only. 3060 included a whole lot of Level 2.5 tech, and introduced ProtoMechs. But 3050 was just 'Mechs, Clan and IS. The new IS Mechs aren't that great, and some aren't well thought out, but you must remember that at this time 100% of FASA's creativity was directed toward the Clans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of TR 3050","review":"this is a must have for anyone who plays battle tech.

All have stainless steel cases and are solidly built. Although this is described as having a stainless steel case, it does not. It is a resin case with a stainless plate covering the top. The area around the buttons, the buttons themselves, and the area where the case meets the bracelet are all resin as well. Because it is resin, it is very thick and bulky. I would recommend other models of Casio, but do not recommend this. It feels and looks cheap. I opened the box, looked at it for 10 seconds, printed the labels and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked properly for 3 months","review":"I was very satisfied with this watch for about 3 months. But very soon the watch stopped to be radio controlled. I live in Boulder, Colorado which is very close to Fort Collins, from which the radio signal broadcasts.

Worse-- when manually trying to set my home time zone, my setting ( Eastern USA) doesn't even show on the list of options... so I am unable to adjust the watch. I must set it manually daily, hit the set/resume button and it immediately gains three minutes. Repeated emails to Casio go unanswered. I now have a watch that is one hour and three minutes off every day... so much for atomic settings of the time! Horrible manual too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Watch is \\"on time\\"","review":"This watch is perfect for a man who likes big watches. I love big watches. There is the necessity of familiarizing yourself with the users manual. I have never had a watch with so many instructions. It took me an hour to figure how to set it. However, I consider it time well spent. I have had it for only one month, but so far so good. I am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared me once...","review":"Visually, this watch looks like it cost over $100. It has a depth to the face and shine on the bezel that really looks great. The band is very high quality and the latch works great. However, one day I was doing some work that required me to get a bit \\"physical\\" with a cardboard box and after I was done I looked down and the watch had stopped!!! I freaked out and started tapping the face hoping it would revive it. It started working again and I did a time-sync to get it back on schedule that afternoon. No problems since, but it doesn't make me really confident it the watch. But for a cheap formal watch it's just fine. Don't depend on it to keep you alive or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Hindman","review":"CAUTION! This is advertised as a \\"solar powered\\" watch. It is NOT.

I thought I got a good deal at first, $30 for a solar powered CASIO is not bad. However I was very disappointed to find out that it is not. So be aware of that.The surface has a little scratch when I received it. Although you have to look very carefully to notice that, but I am not very happy.

I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture. As mentioned by someone, it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. It also is very large and long. So to remove the small braces cost more. Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch band adjustment","review":"I, too, am disappointed in the misinformation Amazon originally posted in regards to the watch being solar-powered, but even without that feature it's still a great watch.Now, for those of you who are WHINING about not being able to adjust the metal band on this wonderful watch, it's very easy. If you look at the inside of the band, some of the links have a small arrow stamped on them. Just put a very small screwdriver into one of the holes on the \\"arrow\\" side of one of those links and push. Do the same for the next \\"arrow\\" link. Remove both pins and the loose link. (Of course, you may have to remove more than one link!) Then connect the band back together and slide one of the pins into the \\"non-arrow\\" side to secure it. Make sure the slotted/pinched side of the pin goes in last. Push the pin in slightly to match the other links.Hope this helps you appreciate this great watch a little more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken product","review":"watch was received as a gift.

All and all they were useless, fortunately the license plate came with its own fasteners but not locking ones.TO BE FAIR, I never contacted Amazon to get a refund or replace the product. My schedule doesn't allow much time to find a package to put the bolts in and then get to a mail drop place and send them off, if Amazon wants to send me new ones I wouldn't complain and would certainly offer a different tone for a review.Everything else I received from my order was stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruiser Accessories 811330 Locking Fasteners, Import-Stainless","review":"While searching for a Chrome License Plate, we were made to understand that the above needed to be ordered which was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fit, Stupid \\"security\\" lock","review":"These do not fit any of my import vehicles (Volvo and Land Rover).

That means I don't need to worry about bad guys stealing my license plates. There's a pretty easy test to see if you should worry about someone stealing your license plates. You can take this at home. Two questions: 1) Am I the hapless bystander in a Jason Statham movie? 2) Am I James Bond? If the answer is \\"no\\" then you can relax.

For instance, the author makes a claim that American Founders' ideas were based in their entirety(!) upon the Constitution of the Iroquois Nations, while discounting in its entirety(!) the influence Classical thought and Enlightenment has had upon the Founders.

After the first 59 seconds, it switches to whole minutes and does not show seconds, which makes it pretty worthless for completing speed reading exercises.It is also sealed in packaging that must be destroyed in order to open it, so you can't (at least I can't) return it in good conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Hard Can it be?","review":"I needed a simple bookmark timer for my son. I spied this one, the price was right, and the reviews seems modestly favorable. First, you have to go through a mode switch to get to the count up, count down, or clock function. I just needed a count down and reset. Eventually, you can figure out which is which though I had to find instructions on their web site. For what should be a simple device, that's an automatic flag. Second, the reset is cumbersome and I have yet to get it to work right the first 2-3 times I've tried. I had to visit the web site again to find out how to reset. That's another strike against the bookmark. All in all, this bookmark missed the target by being too complicated and contrary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product, overpriced","review":"This product works exactly as described.

The lock itself wobbles back and forth when you ride.

So, after the cops came and cut my lock, I stupidly bought the exact same brand of U-lock. The FIRST TIME I tried to open the new lock, what happens? The key breaks. Now, THAT was not my fault. At least, that time, the bike wasn't already locked to anything.Also, I've had to use WD-40 to get it open when it rusts in the rain. It was sometimes hard to open, even when it wasn't rusted.

The lock appeared to be working fine, but this morning when I went to lock up my bike at work, I stuck the key in and turned it, but wasn't able to unlock the lock.

As usual, their voices and dances moves were marvellous, the entire concert was wonderful(as usual) and very touching. The interviews of the guys were interesting and personal. Their close-up shots allowed me to observe every change in their facial expression, so that was nice. The show also included the activities of the boys on their free day in New York(Imagine that? They actually got a day off, lucky them.) I feel as if I'm writting an informal summary of the show right now. But, excuse me for my unenthusiastic tone.

Altough the book is nicely written, the story is so implausible as to be laughable. I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the premise - I like a good suspense story and they all require some of that - but it only got worse. The cops are unbelievable, the main characters friends, who all express concern about her, are uncaring stick figures, and her quest of the truth is not only silly, it comes down to her chasing the lead of someone looking to buy a cat -- no not in the obvious places you'd think to look like pet store, adoption center, ad... but by trailing gypsies who are rumored to have cats.

I thought I figured out who the bad guy was but was wrong...Way off in fact. Truth is there is no way to know who the bad guy is ahead of time. I guess that kind of takes the mystery out of it a bit. I did like reading a mystery/thriller in the first person. It seemed to make it more intense even if some of the language was a little hard to believe.

I like the option of falling asleep using one sound source and waken by another source. Two different alarm settings is a very useful feature. Three levels of lighting are available, the brightest will light up a room! The back light alone is more light then I want. It would be nice if that could be lowered or turned off.

The first thing I did was test the receiver on the reception of radio station that is hard to reach where I live - I returned a different clock for that reason. The sound was crystal clear. The features of this product were well thought out. The light on it can be bright as a powerful night-light or very subdued. The cd player is great with the full sound of a device several times its size and the alarm can be set to any track on the cd. I like the battery backup also for power outages. The one thing I don't like is the black on gray digital display is more difficult to see from across the room than the standard red/black or green/black displays. Other than that, it's a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Time CD Player Breaks...","review":"I purchased this CD Clock Radio because it had everything I needed- Radio, Clock, iPod connector and CD Player (and it looked very sleek).

Even though the OFF setting is still a bit too bright, I love the soft glow and I love being able to just glance at the time in the middle of the night, without squinting. The blue light is just gorgeous and it is an attractive unit all around. I love being able to wake up to a CD and I love how one can play CD-R and CD-RW discs on this-how cool!

We bought this for my 9 yr old son and I took it to a baseball field to try out. I have over 20 years of R/C plane flying experience so I lofted the plane as instructed only to watch it nose dive in about 25 feet. The longest flight we were able to get was about 30 seconds in a large left hand turn the whole time. The controls are terrible, you basically have full power and no power for glide/landing. Turning is accomplished by one of the twin motors powering down slightly which just barely works and causes the plane to dive due to the power loss. Overall a very disappointing experience and I would highly recommend a \\"REAL\\" r/c plane if you want the kids to have any fun at all. His total time he got to hold the controls and fly it before it nose dived was probably 25 seconds - not worth the money at that rate in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you like kitsch","review":"This is a waste of plastic.And this review of it is a waste of my words and your time.It's that bad.Not even funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for WWI Buffs","review":"This is one of the best WWI movies to be made in a long time.

Morris cites numerous authorities for insights into the material and then provides his own thoughtful assessment of the meaning and background.

Mimsy is discovered trying to revive her parents and is holding the gun and is covered in blood. Dr Black takes care of her in the hospital along with her father who is suspected of the murder. But Black is convinced that the father didn't do it and that Mimsy knows who did so using her doll house he is able to get her to go back with play so they can find the real murderer. This is a quick read and really got my attention and concern for little Mimsy. The back cover of the Dell paperback has a map of the house of which the doll's house is a replica.

The book contains a wide variety of Crossword Puzzles, Words to unscramble, and matching of graphics ( bird anatomy and bird species pictures) to text clues, as well as macthing Birding Hot Spots to a geopgraphic text clue.The book is very easy to read, due to readable characters and fonts.The book is a first of its kind.

It does have a chapter on shaping your eyebrows and waxing your legs - ouch! However, if you want useful recipes and remedies do not buy this book! The author's idea of a recipe for Foot-Soaking Fizzies is Alka Seltzer and your favorite essential oil. Her recipe for Aromatherapy Bath Salts is epsom salt, your favorite essential oil and food coloring! This book lacks useful information and only has a few recipes other than those listed on the back cover. Most ingredients are not natural and most of her \\"secrets\\" would irritate my sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense beauty!","review":"I just recently bought this book and I am very impressed! Laura Dupriest offers clear advice on skincare, fashion, make-up, hairstyle, etc. I haven't read the whole book through yet; I've just skimmed through certain parts (like the chapter on facials; the sugar and oil exfoliant leaves your skin baby soft!). She is also honest about things that skincare people try to put over on you (like if you don't buy a moisturizer and toner with a cleanser from the same company, it won't work). I also realize that I was slowly fading into the term she coined as \\"frumpitis\\" (as the mother of newborn twins, it's hard not to look frumpy!) The only thing I didn't agree with is that you should throw out anything in your closet that looks remotely masculine. Someone just bought me an Oscar De la Renta lounge outfit that fits into that category, but there is no way I'm throwing it out!

It was definitely money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly acted adaptation","review":"Ustinov doesn't look remotely like Christie's Poirot, but never mind that. It is the ensemble cast that trashes this film, a group of summer actors who read their lines like they are reading graffiti on the rocks. The figure that should provide the menace of the book -- the evil Mrs. Boynton -- is laughable.Skip it. Wait for a more modern adaptation or just reread one of the classic Christies."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's bacccccccccck","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Evil Under the Sun\\" and \\"Death on the Nile\\". However, this one was a very big disappointment. Not much of a story, not a good cast, poorly written with a horrible sound track. There was no suspense and no characters I really care about (except the doctor and Gielgud who would be interesting if he just stood there). It was hard to stay with it but I did. Ustinov looks tired and the rest look bored. Sorry to say, unless you are a collector who wants all of the film Ustinov endeavors (as I did), you will not be missing anything if you dont buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Agatha Christie's Best!","review":"Although this is one of the more light hearted of the Agatha Christie film adaptions done, it's also one of the best.

Certainly one of my favorite films, right next to \\"Murder On The Orient Express\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this movie available on DVD?","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in the late 1980s and love all the Peter Ustinov Hercule Poirot films.

If anyone from the movie studio/distributor reads these reviews, please release this movie on DVD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Ustinov gives a brilliant final apperance as Poirot,","review":"I really enjoyed this film, whose highlight is Peter Ustinov, as he plays Hercule Poirot for the sixth and final time. It was as enjoyable as Death on the Nile and Piper Laurie gives a brilliant performance as the malevolent stepmother. The film has a very nice soundtrack composed by Pino Donnagio.Certainly a nice change from thr three made for TV films in which Ustinov stars as Poirot, which are excellent too, namely Thirteen at Dinner and Murder in Three Acts, and Dead Man's Folly, but Ustinov's full potential is really unleashed in the big-screen appearances.Move over David Suchet! There is only one Hercule Poirot, that is Sir Peter Ustinov."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation","review":"I think Michael Winner made a great adaptation of \\"Appointment With Death\\". They picked just the right actors to fit the parts.The story is about the Boynton family on a 30's Holy Land tour. Mrs. Boynton (Piper Laurie) and her long suffering children Lennox (Nicholas Guest), Nadine (Carrie Fisher), Carol (Valerie Richards), Raymond (John Terlesky) and Ginevera visit Europe and the Holy Land. But their lawyer, Jefferson Cope (David Soul), secretly joins them. Mrs. Boynton makes enemies with everyone she meets. Including Lady Westholme (Lauren Bacall), Miss Quinton (Hayley Mills) and Dr. Sarah King (Jenny Seagrove). John Gielgud makes an appearance as Colonel Carbury.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow boats - not speed boats","review":"I was very impressed when I opened this toy, but that didn't last.

The main characters are Lucky George Faustus, who has escaped from Hell, and Kurt Lundqvist, the greatest bounty hunter of all time. The problem is that even after finishing the book the reader is still left with no direction as to which side they should root for. Is this a twist like in Bedazzled where the Devil is the good guy or are the characters just not defined enough? I don't know but the book was definitely missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rubbish","review":"Holt appears to be at the end of his rope - a paper-thin plot loaded with every pointless contrivance he could dream up. After the pleasure of \\"Expecting Someone Taller\\", \\"Who's Afraid of Beowulf\\", and \\"Flying Dutch\\" this proved a complete disappointment. It does not deserve the 1 star I was forced to give it. I would have better served reading the side-panel of a cereal box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs another edit","review":"Wow. I can't believe this novel not only got past an agent (assuming she has one and didn't self publish) but also an editor. The writing was horrible and amatuerish. For example: \\"I walked into my dark apartment and turned on all the lights. I checked my answering machine--no messages. I flopped down on the couch and tried to tickle the elmo doll that now lived with me instead of my niece Ashley....That's when I decided. Karma be damned.\\" (shouldn't it be: That's when I decided--Karma be damned?)This is high school writing. My apologies if this is aimed at young adults, but I don't think it is. The story itself isn't that bad, but there is no character depth. Granted, most chick lit is neurotic and shallow, but this didn't even scratch that surface. Maybe the author needs to learn how to develop a voice by not using the first person. Too many \\"I\\"s is not a good thing. Unfortunately, I don't have anything good to say about this book. I didn't HATE it, but didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your money!","review":"Thank goodness I only spent $2.99 on the Kindle version of this terrible book. I only read it to the end because I was hoping that the self-absorbed Julie would end up alone - because that is exactly what she deserved.

Characters all have family, family is part of their lives, sometimes part of their problems! Whether or not its a perfect family could be part of future stories. Very funny situations, even funnier because the situations are so real - we know people who have these relationships with their families, we know people who have experienced some of the situations the characters in the book are experiencing. A good laugh, a good read, well written, leaves you with a feel good glow."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's good!","review":"Funny as hell book, quick-witted, true to life, she makes my dating nightmares look like a trip to the carwash, whatever the hell that means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, entertaining book.","review":"I really enjoyed this book despite that I'm long out of the dating scene. Actually, reading this reminds me of how happy I am to be out of that scene! Much of the scenarios are relatable and funny even if the main charcter seems to be VERY particular at times. I still find her charcter true enough since I actually know people like her. It was a very enjoyable book to lose yourself in and escape from your own world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"There were some interesting moments in the book but totally predictable. I don't even mind predictable if it is written in a way that holds my attention, but I thought this book wasn't worth my effort of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I cannot believe I am the first 1 star reviewer. This book is ridiculous! The author continually treats readers like we are stupid by putting lots of obvious explanations in after a thought or conversation. Dialogue is repetitive, for example, describing Greg as a kiss-ass three times to the same character or why Joe is a wannabe. Oh, and it's boring! Nothing exciting or salacious, just big chunks of paragraphs describing dinner, what she's wearing to dinner and of course, why none of the men are good enough for the annoying and stuck-up Julie. I thought the case about the assistant and his boss might be an interesting side story but nope, just a way to introduce us to another boring date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story?","review":"I had high hopes for this book given the mostly positive reviews and the cheap price! But sadly, this book was a letdown. This book seems to lack a real substantial story. It's basically like, \\"She goes on a date with this guy and this happened, then, she goes out with another guy and this is what happened...etc.\\" There's not really an interesting or captivating story being told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never caught my interest","review":"A single Jewish attorney sets out to find the perfect husband before she reaches 35.I couldn't get into the story.

This book was predictable in pretty much everyway: A 30 something, cute, entertainment lawyer living in LA,just wants to meet the one! The thing was that Julia the main character was a total and complete snot! She was so picky over in some cases the dumbest things! I found her to be so annoying and honestly the thing with the tickle me Elmo doll was just odd! This wasn't the worst book, but it wasn't the best either.... In most romantic type books your rooting for the \\"heroine\\", but I just wasn't rooting for Julia! I could see why she was single!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dating stories exposed!","review":"This was a funny chick-lit book!

And even though I've been married for ten years now, I could still identify with many of the main character's woes as I thought back on my dating days. However, I gave four stars due to the ending. Even after reading the reviews and knowing the end was abrupt, I was still surprised by it. This would have easily been a five star rating for me had the author included just a bit more to wrap things up. When you're invested in these characters' lives, you really want to know what happens to them in the end! All in all, a nice read, and well worth the small price. I will definitely look for more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable to the very end","review":"While I found this book enjoyable, it was fairly predictable. I know a lot of books are, but when I can predict almost the entire book AND be 100% right, well what's the point. I only finished the book to see how things would turn out with the guy it was VERY obvious she would end up with. All that being said, it was still a funny take on dating. Though if I was the character's friend, I would have had a hard time being diplomatic. She was kind of annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Its a must have for any long car trip.

The new record touches on many musical styles (blues, country, latin, the more vague sub-genre of 'lounge'), all showcasing the unique attitude and lyrics of the band and its frontman, Don Dazzo.This recording has just received a terrific review on BILLBOARD magazine (7/10/99)which you should check out. I'm sure they will continue to pick up more good notices for this CD and their wild live shows, where they usually mix their own tunes with unpredictable cover versions.Fans of such varied artists as CAKE, SMASHMOUTH, the Iggy/Bowie/Eno axis and, of course, forefathers like Louie Prima and Prez Prado should seek out Everlounge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy you've ever had!","review":"The recipient of this toy is three years old.

Not to be rude, and I do see your point, but Shakespeare, being a an, is naturally going to have a masculine out look in some of his stories. But I believe the story was genius not through anything else but the character of Dogberry. I know you're probably thinking \\"He had barely any dialogue and the dialogue he did have was ridiculous\\" but the fact is that his stupidity and his unique perception of reality not only provided a bases of humor into the story but also the salvation of the story. I do not wnat to give the play away so I will not say how but...this is a wonderful play and not because Shakespeare wrote it...but because of its absurd genius. Thank you. And I only give it a 1 because I haven't read this book yet for the play I am merely just expressing my own opinion of the actual play itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is right if it works","review":"I agree totally with the other two reviews about problems with both the length of the unit (I had to install in the lower DIN slot because it hit the firewall in the upper) and it does not resume the song where you stopped, you must start the track all over again once you resume.

Taking intimacy down to the \\"Barnyard Gutter\\" isn't a good written script nor good acting. Unfortunately European society and the American one following close behind have become or are becoming desensitized to bad behavior, bad life styles and bad language. Character matters here. The special effects were very good, unfortunately it was ruined with totally unnecessary negative attitudes and bad language that are either are to suppose to impress us or try to get us following the same bad examples. I no longer own the film as I would not have it in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak mystery","review":"Characters were likeable (except for murderer of course) but mystery was so weak it was ridiculous.

It's badly in need of editing, both for copy and for content. I too, had problems with a character who was supposed to be such a good editor/publisher using such terrible grammar. There is no mystery to the story; it's obvious \\"whodunit\\" very early on. The characters could have been much more interesting had they been developed; I could not get invested in them at all.The author also has several phrases of which she is inordinately fond, and she uses them way too often. The restaurant where the town gathers has no name and not much of a description; it is referred to as the \\"local gossip corner\\". Over and over. And although I did manage to make it to the end of this book, if I had seen the main character refer to herself as \\"this old gal\\" one more time, my kindle would have been in great danger of being thrown across the room.Two stars for a decent premise, minus three for execution. Glad it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Mystery","review":"This was a free book for Kindle. And I am glad that I did not buy it because there was not much mystery for a mystery novel. The story revolved around a middle aged divorcee who owns the town newspaper. She is also a real nosy snoop. That is how she gets involved in the \\"mystery\\".

When we first purchased it as a second alarm, as I have more than one child with bedwetting issues, my kids fought over it and refused to use any other product that we had in the house. They claimed that this was the most comfortable of them all. I ended up having to buy another one to stop the pre-bedtime arguing over who would get the \\"purple\\" alarm.They work well and with time we certainly saw a vast improvement in the bedwetting. My only complaint is that I wish they were louder. While they are loud enough to wake the wearer up ( and the vibration helps) at the beginning it is useful if the parent can also hear the alarm to assist the child, and we couldn't hear the alarm from our bedroom. Setting up a baby monitor in the children's room helped to solve that problem though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for us","review":"It worked well for us. I do recommend that if your child is a heavy sleeper, you attach the unit at the shoulder. We had it attached to the underware first and he did not wake up. We adjusted to the shoulder area so when the alarm goes off it's closer to his ear and that finally woke him up. After that we had no problems with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm off too late","review":"I bought the Malem alarm with vibration and light a few weeks ago and 've using but it doesn't seem to be working properly.

I enjoyed reading the book and have now loaned it to my friend who is the mother of the bride.Is it the best wedding planning book out there?

Careful guidance on how to begin, how to set up your own program, and how to adjust the program as needed. Very straightforward and well-written. The basics have never been so well presented...and these basics will have profound and safe results for anyone who follows the program as presented. Absolutely excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A light, amusing, and charming movie","review":"This movie was originally released in 1964, in the days when Universal was still producing this light, colorful fare that was filmed entirely on their backlot. It has the look and feel of a first-rate TV sitcom of the period, but I kind of like that. Burl Ives plays a genie who creates havoc for architect Tony Randall. Barbara Eden, at her most beautiful, is Mr. Randall's girlfriend. If you like \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" or \\"Bewitched\\" you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"brass bottle","review":"Burl Ives is a riot in this film. It's funny, hilarious and full of camp. It's a great laugh and reminds us all of a gentler time. Burl Ives as Fakrash ala Mash, a Genie of the Green Gin, gets Tony Randall into so much trouble you just can't stop laughing. It's great to which him turn the father in law into a mule (Since thou art stubborn as a mule, thou shalt become one,) with a flick of the hand. In the end, you can see the moral of the story and it's really a great light hearted film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Great movie, I have not seen this in years and wish I could see it now!This dvd will not play on my player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love a good genie movie","review":"This must be the movie that inspired the \\"I dream of Jeannie\\" series.

Nothing is hohum about it. It made me weep, it made me laugh for joy and kept me on the edge of me seat. For a piece of music I know this well to be that exciting was a thrill. I going to use my very bland, very safe Philadelphia Orchestra version for a Frisbee or dangle it from my rear view mirror. Those who question whether another Fifth was necessary haven't heard this one. It's as new and fresh as the day Ludwig premiered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb recordings","review":"This disc is my first experience with an SACD on my new player. The sound is absolutely transparent and spacious. 10/10 for sure.Regarding the performance, I agree with other reviewers here and elsewhere that Minnesota & Vanska give an extremely polished and precise performance. The detail is remarkable; some rapidly moving lines I was totally unaware of previously are heard easily here. Intonation is flawless. Rhythms and tempi are beyond criticism. Balance and dynamic range (very wide) are both good as well.All that said, I again agree with other reviewers that it seems Vanska never quite lets go of the reins. The attention to detail almost lends the performance an air of coldness and a somewhat reduced range of emotion. My personal preference for the Beethoven cycle remains Karajan. While I am very happy with this CD, I believe I will still add the SACD box set of Karajan's 1960's cycle to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Íntimo y nocturno","review":"Con frecuencia, este disco resulta muy subestimado.

Here is a disk mainly of his own compositions that has the same charm but in an intimate, personal setting which anyone who loves Barcelona can't but appreciate. Listen to this at night with the lights low, and imagine yourself having a café corto in a small bar on Tibidabo or in the Barri Gotic. Not great, but very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remind me what the point was?","review":"I this book had a point, I missed it.Yes our world is full of complexity and unpredictability. And yes, we tend to overrate our ability to compensate for those traits. That shouldn't be a surprising revelation to thoughtful people.I liked a few things such as the notion of a \\"fitness landscape\\".I quickly got tired of the climate change message. I'm not a doubter or disbeliever. I just think the author spent so much time on environmental issues that I lost focus on the message of the book.I suggest you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All metaphors but no facts","review":"This author is nothing but a medievalist who equates modernity with evil. He has no scientific background (political science is not science) and he is not an economist. In fact he admits: \\"I have tried to elaborate an INTUITION or FEELING about the future\\" <emphasis added>. Shirley MacLaine anyone? Everything to him is a metaphor for the human predicament: complexity, high speed, crises, unpredictability, confusion, despair, ad nauseum. (Maybe the author needs to read a book on chaos theory.) For those with an epistemology of reason, there is nothing to be learned from this treatise. For those who are as despondent as the author, well the good news for you guys is that life is utterly hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heroic Serbs","review":"This book contains some information about Serbian Folk Lore, Folk customs, a little theorizing about pre-Christian religion in Serbia and other Serbian legends but the bulk of this book is about Prince Marko. It would be very inaccurate to try to say he fits this description exactly but in a sense he is the Serb version of King Arthur. Overall an interesting and entertaining read if this sort of thing interests you."},{"rating":"1","title":"studying for the RNC exam","review":"I bought this book in anticipation of helping me prepare for the RNC exam, and it really didn't help me. the practice test questions were often poorly worded and it was difficult to figure out what the question was really asking. there was no explanation for the various answers and if you didn't know the answer there was no way to understand the rationale for their \\"correct\\" answer. I disagreed more than once with the book's answer and found it frustrating to not be able to read why they picked a particular answer. I also found that some of the information in the book was no longer the standard ie keeping the babies NPO for 12 and 24 hours..... I found the Core Curriculum for Maternal-Child Nursing to be far more helpful in preparing for the exam. save the $23 on this book and put it towards the $69 book that has much better information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected 'extras'","review":"The main poem/words of this book are not bad, though certainly more basic than I'd hoped. But what frustrated me is the fact that there are Bible verses at the end of each scenario! I was certainly not expecting this, and was annoyed that it wasn't mentioned in the book description.

The water is delivered to these large storage tanks, 500 to 5800 gallons where it is drawen off at high demand times (morming and evening). This preserves a weak flowing well, while providing a large volume of water to service the home, and storing water to fight fires, feed crops and farm animals. The water is preserved and disenfected by bubbling ozone in the tanks 24 hours a day. The timer is simple, easy to use and indistructable.

She is forced to take on a co-director for her archaeological dig where she is searching for evidence of a female Mayan ruler. Isabela is angry enough to find out that her sexist superiors have chosen a man. She's horrified that it's Mateo. Mateo never understood why Isabela left without a word seven years ago, but he's determined to be with her now. Both Isabela and her project are in danger, and the same danger killed his mother three years ago when she was in pursuit of the same Mayan ruler, the Red Lady. He's determined to protect the dig... and Isabela, for his feelings never went away. Tracy Montoya has created a winner!

What I did discover upon the solid recommendation of a sage-in-the-woods is an extraordinary juxtaposition of rhythm and glorious melody and gargantuan beats and a conviction that only 30 years of love could muster.

But great variation across tracks, almost as though produced by a collective with lots of room for different people to lead. Typically transparently layered with varying mixes of polyrhythms, harder Western grooves, and many different special effects. The influence of rap and reggae is apparent throughout. Sung mainly in clear French, but in African languages, too. General mood is happy and light. But stories about politics and society weave throughout like a kind of reporting.

Also, the man in the DVD is not very skilled. It looks as though he was pulled off the street and given a crash course in salsa, and not a very good course at that.

I've got this DVD as a gift on my birtday and now I feel much more in touch wih this dance. Up lifting with very clear step by step lessons, It made me stop watching and start dancing. My only frustation was that I was expecting to have access to parts 2 and 3 and I never heard of them.I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salsa review","review":"I think it was done very well. I have not really practiced properly but Gigi and Pedro make it look easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male beginners watch out","review":"Like another reviewer mentioned, Gigi doesn't pay attention to leading at all whichfrom a male point of view is terrible. You might learn the moves but you have no idea howto lead the woman.So for men I don't consider this a good beginner dvd. It's veryimportant to learn how to lead properly.Personally I didn't like the fact that all the names of the moveswere repeated so often. It was really distracting and although itmight be nice to know the names it isn't really helpful since every salsateacher seems to use a bit different terminology."},{"rating":"2","title":"get parts 1&2 for full impact","review":"Cuban salsa is a awesome style. you really want to learn this stuff. ignore the short falls of this dvd, because they correct everything by the second dvd, and it all comes together.the first video is kinda shakey on its own. the moves are good, but as other writers have noted, the female teacher leads from the back the whole time.the Rueda calls are not a bad idea. In Rueda the moves are called out like square dancing. so if youre super new, you dont have to think ahead, which can be intimidating at first. having the moves called out ahead is good for new leads, who are just getting the muscle memory.so, try to ignore the female teacher is leading from the back. the male teacher is a good lead - watch his movements. he just seems a little camera shy or whatever. in teh second video, the guy is much stronger. he talks through his own parts and does a great job leading a freestyle at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think of salsa as...............","review":"If you think of salsa as ballroom set to Latin music, this DVD is not for you. If you have taken ballroom salsa classes, you will be lost.If, however, you dance in salsa clubs or want to dance in salsa clubs with real salseros this DVD is a great complement to your instruction. The basics and simple turn patterns are covered.I think some of the reviews are funny. The instructor gave a move a Spanish name and she threw some of you a curve. A cross body is a cross body lead regardless of the name.I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to learn salsa","review":"Years ago, I started to take salsa lessons. You know the drill: I went for numerous lessons and forgot the steps as soon as I left the classroom.Now a high quality DVD has arrived which has changed all that. The salsa moves are broken down into simple steps-each with a name! so you can remember them easily. Learn the basics and intricacy of Salsa as they do it in Miami and Cuba.Need to review a move?- no problem, check out the helpful multiangle feature.The music is great and the instructor Gigi is clear and easy to follow. This DVD should be the first Salsa DVD you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definately a keeper","review":"With this DVD you can learn salsa very easily and fast. With Gigi as a wonderful instructor and three different angles to look at the steps, dancing becomes a piece of cake. Absolutely one to add to your collection, people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instructional DVD","review":"This was one of the best instructional DVD's I have purchased. The instructor teaches at a good pace as she and her partner illustruates the steps. I also like that she calls out each of the steps which allows you to know what steps to do next. I particularly like the end of the DVD where you can follow along as they dance to the music (which is a summary of all of the steps you have learnt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xavier>Everything>Beatiful ones","review":"The highlight of the concert. I love this album and I always return to it and satays for weeks on my cd player. The multifacetic, polifonic, esquizofrenic Marsalis breaks all the lines between armony and noise; without rest he keeps playing and playing, constructs and de-constructs... the result is a breath-taking album, plenty of violence, love, peace and beauty. For every mood and only for wide-open ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"really dumb","review":"I hate this cd because I don't want everybody to buy it so I can put the review down some"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious (unless you take them seriously)","review":"Kill yourself, stay in school, do drugs, kill cops... just some of the inspiring messages featured on No Gods/No Managers. However, there are two ways of looking at this album: it's either a brilliant satirical masterpiece or a serious danger to society. Either way, you gotta give these guys credit for being completely honest and damn funny too.This album really has everything: ska riffs, thrash-punk riffs, great lyrics, screamed vocals, thought-provoking sound bites. I'll admit, the screaming can get a little grating at times (\\"Living the Laws\\"), but overall is used to great effect.The highlights are \\"500 Channels,\\" \\"Crack Rock Steady,\\" \\"Five Finger Discount,\\" \\"Suicide,\\" and the creepy, mostly-instrumental \\"Praise to the Sinners.\\"Overall this is a great album I would recommend to fans of Op Ivy, Link 80, Against All Authority, and maybe early Suicide Machines."},{"rating":"2","title":">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...........","review":"Quite possibly one of the most underrated, but greatest skacore albums of all time.

Personally, I like Leftover Crack's songs more. Despite all that, Choking Victim will change your thoughts on everything. A true punk/ska band. They mix a unique sound unlike most street punk bands(i.e. Clit 45, The Unseen, A Global Threat) and most ska bands(i.e. Streetlight Manifesto, Catch 22, Reel Big Fish). They are even different than your average Operation Ivy band. They mix it in a way that EVERYONE who's listened to the cd, loves it. It's a cd where you can nod your head one second, and then be skanking the next, and then singing along the next part. You'll NEVER be disappointed in this cd. If you like this cd, you'll love Leftover Crack, INDK, Morning Glory, and Team Spider. If you love the hardcore part of it I suggest F-Minus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choke On This...","review":"Just when I thought that punk rock had reached its limit No Gods/No Managers came flying out of nowhere and kicked me in the face. This is definately one of the best punk albums to come out in recent years.

An album more original than anything you'll find out there today. NYC'S beloved squatters teamed up to bring this masterpiece to the table. A fresh punk sound, blending a healthy dose of crust and just a touch of ska (don't let that stop you) Social and political lyrics dominate this album along with plenty of alienation and self doubt yet somehow positive. If you're bored with whats out there, try this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creamy Goodness","review":"If I had any faith in the human race, I would be astonished that this cd doesn't have a 5-star rating.

When you press them on they need to CLICK loudly. If they just press on a bit, it kinda stays but they're going to fall off. If you can't get them to click you need to reseat the screw gasket towards the middle of the license plate (loosen the screw, push the gasket towards the middle as you tighten).

The writing style reminded me of Charles Dickens, who reportedly was paid by the word.Yes, the book is beautifully written, but I simply lost patience with it. I also found it to be a bit preachy, as if the author believes herself to be the only one who knows the joy of simply being in a garden, observing all of its wonders, and must teach it to the rest of us morons.

Now gardening has become my passion--from taking up her suggestion to walk barefoot in the grass even on a busy workday, to an occasional night of sleeping out under the stars (or at least dining out) while the scent of wild jasmine fills the air.

He grapples with the mixed blessing and curse of being a just man, and feeling others pain, for the Nazi's have just come to power and have begun persecuting the Jews. The story tells how Ernie tries to come to terms with his lagacy at the same time as the Nazis release their unimaginable horror over Europe. The end, where the words of kaddish, the prayer for the dead, are interpsersed with the names of the death camps, the author shows us how great, and how terrible it is to be one of the 36 rightious people of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiore","review":"Fascinating biography of a fine sculptor and creator of the artists' retreat at Peralta, Italy, focusing on her struggles with sexuality and key relationships in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book!","review":"This cookbook was for a friend who is legally blind, but can still read if the print is large enough.

Leading of with Also sprach Zarathustra, the CD contains Don Juan, Don Quixote and Salome. Each pieces is fairly long, allowing the listener to hear most of that work, instead of just a short clip. The overall sound quality is good, the orchestration is fine, but the music itself is okay. I am not a Richard Strauss fan as I find some of his music boring, and this CD has not changed my opinion of his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matisse Women's Chalet Skimmer Flat","review":"I purchase this shoes in Yellow Snake Skin...I like them alot but I had to return them.

This book is very insightful, and it discusses her work thoroughly. Her use of corn plants in the discovery of jumping genes (transposable elements). Truly an interesting topic and an incredible geneticist who's discovery has no doubt changed all of genetic research.

Schwinn offered to send me a part for where they \\"thought\\" the squeak was coming from. Only after I complained as LOUDLY as the squeak did they agree to send a technician.

I wanted to get \\"fit\\" before my vacation May 9th. Well too bad after 1 month, the machine started making the loudest screeching noise you've ever heard! I called Schwinn (you actually call Nautilus)and we had to try to do a phone diagnosis. The rep then said that I needed a complete new wheel assembly and that a technician would call me to make an appt to come to my home to replace in about one week. Well, it's been 10 days so I called again. Now the rep says, \\"No the technician only comes after all the parts are delivered to your house, and your parts are on backorder until the middle of May.\\" Great!! No one would have contacted me to let me know, and now the machine is basically useless to me. So much for getting \\"fit\\" before vacation. Very bad customer service with Nautilus, she wasn't even apologetic at all. I would not purchase this item!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Experience","review":"We bought the machine Elliptical 430 in Jan 2008. The structure is sturdy and easy to assemble and use. However, after two months of using it, we started encountering problems. In April, we found problems with the machine Main Unit. It did not respond to resistance level and the pedaling were not smooth (not doing a circular motion) anymore.We called the Customer Service in May (and it has already past 90 days). They said it is a simple problem. They wanted us to do the fixing and replace the parts. However, we informed them that we were not able to fix it.

Took all of the pieces out of the box and began to put it together. That was when I noticed that the flywheel was pushed in on one side. I was so disappointed. My boyfriend & a friend had to end up taking the whole flywheel apart (it wasn't that hard just troublesome) and bend the metal piece inside so that it would not rub each time it rotated. After all of that was done, assembly was not difficult. Been having it for over a month & try to use it pretty regularly. At one point the handlebars started to squeak, but a drop of grease solved that problem. All in all I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gym quality elliptical","review":"This is a great trainer! Smooth workout, gym quality. I would give it 5 stars, but it is so heavy/difficult to move that I'm giving it 4. I thought I could roll it to the large closet for storage, but no way. Instead, it sits in the living room as a center piece. Took me about 2 hours to put together. Not too complicated. The workout is great! I can watch a movie or TV show without turning the volume too loud while my daughter's sleeping. It's super quiet. It's definitely huge, so look at the measurements if you're concerned.

I'm very glad I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eliminates excuses, good for my heavy body","review":"I was a bit nervous how this machine would hold up since I'm heavier than what its supposed to support. Luckily this elliptical has performed like a trooper and has held up over months of use (5 months as of this review)...mostly by me and rarely by my lighter siblings. I must say that the machine runs quieter when they are using it though of course. I'm just glad the thing still works, hahaha. I can attest to the sturdiness and reliability of this machine. It took a long while for me to assemble this thing myself though. Maybe 1.5 hours working methodically (well...slow).

All the positive reviews definitely helped my decision, hence why I am leaving one now.The box did arrive damaged, and the handler was less than gentle with it, however, all parts were in the box. I had a friend help me assemble it, and it went very smoothly. Yes, a couple things in the manual were misleading, but we were smart enough to figure things out and it got it all together, working properly.It's a very smooth ride, looks good, and I would recommend this machine to anyone.

Probably less than 100 mi. registered on the console. Today, as my grandson was on it, the welds holding the mast broke and the mast came forward knocking him off the machine. We were very lucky that he wasn't injured. I contacted Schwinn and was told that they would not warranty this part and that I'd be required to buy a new mast. If you do a search on this model you'll see that this is not an isolated incident. The welds were insufficient and failed from metal fatigue I'll reweld the mast myself (properly) and will never, ever buy another Schwinn product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Elliptical Machine....","review":"I must say, this is the quietest and smoothest elliptical I've been on...and the reason for the purchase.

Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Whammy","review":"Received the elliptical in mid April. Assembly was easy, only took a couple of hours. That is when the troubles began- the dreaded error message appeared but I received a new console. A new problem surfaced immediately-a defective motor. Customer service was very pleasant and that new motor was at my house lickety split, but evidently no technician could be found to service this machine and so it sits,noisy and useless. The last communication with the service department resulted in a promise to get back to me ASAP regarding a new machine. That was right before Memorial Day. Based on the length of time that it has taken attempting to get my elliptical working, I would strongly suggest another company/elliptical. Those are hours that I am never getting back again.Update: Have been confirmed to receive a replacement elliptical, the 431. 430 was not available. Will this be the end of this saga?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Pain City","review":"This elliptical was actually easy to put together with no missing parts. The directions were nice, detailed and clear. It started squeaking after a little while, but was fixed by loosening up some of the screws that joined the pedal bars to the main center piece. The only complaint I have is that the pedals are kind of small... I can't get my feet forward enough so I end up leaning forward if I want to grab the handles, and that makes my back hurt. *Edit - this small-pedal-issue is more than just a small complaint. Any time I've ever tried to use it I had sharp lower back pains the next day. I used it yesterday for the first time in about a year (I routinely use ellipticals at the gym) and I am in awful pain today. I feel like the bar underneath the foot pedals is not placed right, like the foot pedals should be moved further forward, and then I'd be fine. Anyhow, I'll be looking to sell this elliptical. Barely used, since my back can't take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn 430 Elliptical!","review":"To make a long story short, this Elliptical has proven extremely worthy for home use.

The parts are clearly labeled...there's just a lot of them. There are 2 parts that come pre-lubricated. Resist the temptation to clean these parts.

With that said, everything went together well with a little common sense on our part and following the instructions.We are really impressed with the quality of the machine (it is very smooth and quiet) - and the great workout you get from using it with just 20 minutes a day. We have noticed significant muscle toning in places that you will really appreciate - all with a low impact, but very aerobic if you like, exercise.The quality, Schwinn name (resale value if needed), and price make this a non-brainier.

It was fine for a week but became very noisy. Because of the cheap design it takes constant lubing to keep it quiet. The quality control on construction is horrible. While my wife was using it the mast broke off and she went tumbling. The mast bracket has four big bolts for a solid connection but the bracket was welded to the tube with thin tack welds. The Chinese peasant who did the welding probably had only one days training on how to weld.I contacted Schwinn/Nautilus but unfortunately for me the warranty has expired and they only offered to sell me a new mast even though I sent them a photo of the broken bracket, an obvious latent defect.

It's quiet and smooth so its not going to disturb the family sleeping when I get up in the morning to work out and its easy on my joints.All said and done, mechanicals are built like a rock, lots of features, and will make a huge difference in my fitness level - all for 600 bucks - a value in this market - but the achilles heel is the lousy electronics quality. KEEP LOOKING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only workout you get out of this is when you keep on fixing it.","review":"We are into 3 years now. My wife uses this daily for 45 min workout. I have fixed it numerous times by taking apart the motor case, or by removing lcd panel and tweaking, resetting etc., I worked out very little in this machine, but got excellent workout fixing it.. Thank you Schwinn for making sure I get work out one or the other way...My recommendation to you is to spend more money and get a quality product. Not this machine. Their customer service sucks.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great So Far","review":"I recently purchased this model based on the good reviews. I have to say the assembly was pretty easy, so maybe they have updated their instructions from the past where reviews were bad on this. I have had for two weeks and it is well worth the price. Extremely quiet and smooth and for my height of 5'7\\" the stride is good. Will come back and update after a few months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Arrived early. I had to give some money to the delivery man to help me bring it to the house (3rd floor). Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).After some weeks of normal use it started to squeak a little. I have it about 6 months now (bye bye labor warranty) and the noise is getting loud. Otherwise is a steady and convenient machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer","review":"Excellent product.

It will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE machine to buy!","review":"I did a ton of on line research, then hit the pavement trying out dozens of machines. I wanted to keep the price under 1000.00. I was shocked at how many machines over 500.00 were made of cheap, lightweight plastic and felt \\"loose\\". Worse yet, many of them creaked and squeaked! Simply walking up to this Schwinn, I could tell this was a quality machine and I was instantly \\"sold\\" when I stepped on. It has all the programs, whistles and bells most people would want, it's PERFECTLY silent and built like a brick...well, it's built like a Schwinn - did you ever own one of their bikes? Then you know. Best quality, best price. Save yourself some time and just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Schwin is working out well","review":"I purchased the Schwinn Elliptical 430 about two months ago. I have been working out about five times a week for 60 minutes each time. It is a good, sturdy machine and I am satisfied with the purchase. The only thing that disappointed me is that the \\"moving arms\\" are not adjustable to height. I am short (5'2\\") and it is not comfortable for me to use the \\"moving arms\\" - it is too much of a reach for me. I mostly use the handles with the heart rate monitor, which gets to be tiresome for my hands at times. Otherwise it is a great machine with everything I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice, high quality, great value","review":"I looked at ellipticals for a long time and chose this one because of the price and the good reviews. It was easy to put together. I did it by myself in 1 hour, its a little heavy though. It is a smooth quiet ride, I love it. It did start to squeak a little but I called Schwinn and they told me to loosen the bolts 1 turn and it never did it again. The only complaint I have is the heart rate monitor takes awhile to get up to my real heart rate but I don't need a number to know it gets my heart rate up. My husband and I both love it and we are 8 inches different in height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but screwed up screws in assembly","review":"I just assembled my elliptical last night and have used it once. It's my first one (other than those I used at the gym) that level 1 resistance seems pretty strong, but it may also be the course I chose to do. It's been a while since I worked out, but I felt like I got a great workout. It took me about 40 minutes to get the parts of out the box, but once I did I found it relatively clear to put together, except for one thing. There are two bolts that are the same size and while the directions say to use a different tool, you are supposed to infer that means use the different screws. Had I known this before I made the mistake the total assembly time (including 40 minutes to remove it from the box) would have been about 2 hour and 15 minutes; however, I used the wrong screws in one step and had tightened them so well that it took me 45 minutes to correct my mistake. All in all, I think it will be a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great machine","review":"Built in 2 hours flat. Smooth operation and useful onboard computer make it nice to use. Very compact. Highly recommended. Worth the extra money vs. a $300 machine from Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I am very pleased with this machine. My husband and son tried it out and are also hooked on using it. Delivery was very fast. The assembly instructions were relatively easy to follow and my husband had the entire machine together in a couple of hours. It's everything I had wanted in an elliptical at a great Amazon price. The operating instructions are clear and easy to follow, and the computer program is a nice feature. With free shipping, it was a great deal all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this machine","review":"I absolutely love my schwinn elliptical machine. It is a smooth and sturdy workout that is equal to going to the gym for me. The instructions were easy to follow, however it was challenging to esemble. You need two people at least and about 3 hours uninterrupted. But once it is together, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Satisfied at 1 1/2 years of use","review":"I bought this product for use in a room my wife and I have turned into a home gym. Given that the room is not huge, this product's small footprint was very nice. We also like the solid feel and whisper quiet operation. Our average weekly use is about 5 hours (more when it's too snowy or icy to run outside). The resistance range is good, as well. The only problems we have had are some initial squeeking (solved nicely with some silicon lubricant sprayed on the moving parts -- please note: silicon, NOT petroleum based -- unless of course, you want the lubricant to eat the machine's rubber parts, as other reviewers have noted) and that one of the four bolts for the left-upper arm attachment wouldn't attach properly (the other three hold it in place just fine)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Pleased!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am so excited to give my review. When I decided to purchase an Elliptical I got busy doin my research and that research lead me to the Schwinn 430.I had been to Sears and Academy and physically tried others but was not sold complexly and so I was nervous about buying the Schwinn 430 without actually trying it but I put my faith in the facts and I must say that every wonderful thing said about this machine was TRUE. We had no trouble assembling it and I hope if you're shopping as I was that you will trust me when I say that you found THE ONE. I am so impressed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting the winter blues with exercise","review":"Purchased this product online. It came very quickly, sooner than the estimated time of delivery. One moderate size box. The Item was packaged very well. Assembly was not very easy and the instructions were not the best either. We had 4 screws that the heads were not the same as all of the others and the included tool would not fit so we had to dig through our tool box in an attmept to finish assembly. Thank goodness we had some metric alan wrenches or we would have needed to buy a tool or wait on the company to send us one. Once item was assembled jumped right on and began to exercise. It is a smooth workout, you do need to check at least once a week and tighten screws but very pleased with product."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied customer","review":"Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as pictured and described. Plus, it was not difficult at all to put together, and I am a petite 5'5\\" female. Just followed the directions step by step. I had help getting it down the stairs to the basement but I got all the pieces out of the box and set the thing up without any assistance. I've used the elliptical twice now and I love it. It is exactly what I wanted. And, it is super easy to move. It's not very heavy and it has wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me and my knees love this exercise machine","review":"Great machine for the price. Very well built. Received shipment (Eagle USA) quickly and was delivered inside my door downstairs. Included on the outside of the box were the updated directions. Husband put together in a couple of hours with no problems. It is a big machine but not as big as most. I have a big downstairs room so it is not a problem. It did start squeeking but with a little spray graphite on the tread tracks now it is as quiet as a mouse. The display is easy to read and navigate even without a backlight. This model does not have a fan but my husbands Schwinn Recumbent exercise bike does and it doesn't help a bunch so it is not missed. The workout is great and my once hurting knee is no longer. hurting. The stride works for me at 5'5\\". I look forward to many years of trouble free exercising."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first eliptical machine!!","review":"It took me about 3 hours to put the machine together, but it was well worth it. I have been using it daily since then (about 2 weeks) and I'm very happy with the level of functionality. When comparing machines I was worried that I did not select the one with the most functions. But now that I have the machine, it does everything I need it to do!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"We purchased our EL 430 and loved it at first. We thought it was a great machine and felt we were getting a great workout with it. However, after 14 months of use the machine broke. It was not tracking your speed and calories. I called the 1-800# and was told it was the speed sensor. They mailed a new one with instructions on replacing it. However, the new one does not work either. Upon disassembling the machine, we noticed the magnet that used to be attached to the wheel had fallen off and was stuck to the bottom of the machine. After placing it back in the correct spot...it still did not work. After reading other reviews, we noticed others were having the same problem. I would not recommend this product to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This elliptical is worth the money. I would give it 4 and a half if I could. The reason I only give it 4 stars is due to the heart rate moniter and how you put in the weight of the person. First the heart rate moniter as soon as you grab it it reads 72, then goes up by 2 until it reaches your heart rate, I would prefer it to read what it is not count up to it, I will never use this function on my elliptical. I do enjoy the calorie burning function on the elliptical, you put in how many calories you want to burn and it counts is down. This is a great machine. Very easy to put together, just takes time, it is an elliptical. We have a treadmeal and this is a way better workout, and a lot more quite. My treadmill is out in my garage because it is to loud, the elliptical is in my livingroom and we can get on it before the kids get up and it won't wake them up, major plus there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this elliptical","review":"I purchased this product in February 2009 and it works just as well today as the first time I used it nearly 2 years ago. The size is great for small, multi-use spaces - I squeezed it next to the desk in our home office. The variety of programs and resistance levels is more than enough. The machine feels very sturdy when you're using it. I have had no issues with it at all and would recommend it to anyone.For reference, I am a 25 year old woman and use it on poor weather days as a replacement for running outside. Sessions are typically 30 - 45 minutes at various speeds and resistance levels. I try to stay reasonably active and it fits my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money!","review":"I received my Schwinn 430 elliptical in a well packaged box. The freight carrier even helped me take the elliptical to my second floor aptmt, without any hassles. So much for shipping, packaging and freight issues! I was very pleased with these aspects.Ok now for the assembly -- I've read through a ton of the 5-star reviews and found the following review steps very helpful (cannot quote the exact reviewer):1. Buy some grease - got a huge can @ Walmart for about 2 $. Did not experience any squeaking whatsoever.2. Get yourself some space, and arrange all the parts against the wall, take some time to identify the individual parts and the orientation.3. Tape the main mast (cover up the gaping holes), which will minimize any screws falling through.Assembly was fairly straightforward, did it with the help of a friend, and it was completed within 2 hours. In my opinion, excellent machine with great workouts, for the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value for the Price","review":"For what you'll pay for this elliptical trainer, you really cannot ask for more! It is a very sturdy machine, doesn't wobble or move about at all when I use it. It has a smooth motion, and while there is a little squeaking, its nothing that isn't easy to ignore, especially if you're watching TV or listening to music while you work out. I use it every day for 20 minutes and it works great. There are good amount of programs to chose from, and you can pick whether you want to set at time goal or calorie goal as well, which I particularly like. My husband put it together, so I can't comment specifically on that, but he did it himself with no help from me and seemed to have a pretty easy time of it. Overall, I'd say it's a great introductory machine, and as a first time buyer myself, I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Elliptical 430","review":"This is exactly what I wanted.

I think Mack kind of discounts or ignores the materiality of abductions. In other words, he doesn't seem to think they might be actually occurring in the physical, consensus reality. Instead, he seems or his work in this book conveys that the abductions take place in some kind of spiritual realm and sometimes enter our material world. However, there implant cases (see Dr. Leir's work) and witness accounts of UFO's over houses, etc., which seems to give some merit to aliens being an actual, physical force in our world--not just in our heads, a different dimension (whatever that is), etc. Good read though but I was a little bored with or two of the philosophies of the indigenous people he discusses."},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly a good book","review":"This is quite possibly a good book and I say that because the copy I received from this seller was unreadable. Ballpoint scribblings on almost every page and ballpoint pen comments have rendered it worthy only of the trash can. It's appalling that seller can sell this kind of book for any price. This copy is where it belongs; in the trash. What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Faeries Versus Evil Daemons","review":"It's already been mentioned, but the only thoughtful way to read this book is in conjunction with David M. Jacobs' \\"The Threat,\\" which interviews abducteees just as credulously and comes to opposite, terrifying conclusions about the motives of Alien visitors. What's really going on here is the War of the Mad Gurus: which seer will sucessfully sell his vision of the unknown among us? Too bad the WWF doesn't have a category for Battlin' UFO Academics."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Passport\\" to nowhere in particular","review":"The latest fashion in UFOlogy places these phenomena squarely in the spiritual realm, and Mack's \\"Passport to the Cosmos\\" is a transparent attempt to cash in on the fad. If Mack had done a little more work with the physics, theology, and psychology implied by alien abduction experiences, he would have produced a groundbreaking work. As it is, \\"Passport\\" is just another shabby New Age hack. Probably the most irritating omission is the lack of reference to C. G. Jung, whose treatment of the '50s UFO scare forms the unspoken basis for Mack's work.The experiences Mack's subjects describe _are_ important, and their breakthrough into Western rationality arguably marks a major shift in human consciousness. If Mack has some idea of what the significance of all this is, he has managed to conceal it. In the meantime, we will have to await a more serious study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other-worldly wisdom for everyone on Earth","review":"Has an intelligence in the cosmos responded to our desecration of the Earth's living systems? Dr. Mack's \\"co-exploration\\" with \\"experiencers\\" of alien encounters seems to indicate so. While the messages of concern for the Earth are similar to the messages of concern for the Earth that are recorded throughout all history in religious revelations, Passport to the Cosmos is probably the most comprehensive, detailed, and in-depth portrait of the current manner by which these messages are being delivered today (as so-called \\"alien abductions\\"). The passion with which the experiencers relate how they have been changed by their experiences is dramatic and inspiring, and serves as a painful reminder that our culture still under-values much of the wisdom that has been brought into this world over the centuries (wisdom often also ascribed to other-worldly sources). A must for anyone interested in philosophy or religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamanism vs. The Flying Saucers","review":"This follows a disturbing phenomenon in anomalous research of whatever ilk, whenever empiricial answers do not hold adequate allure- break out the indigenous shaman routine to cast \\"illumination\\" on the discussion. The new agers probably \\"understand\\" the explainations provided from 3rd world wise men & women of crop circles, abductions, and other intrusions into the lives of certain fantasy prone individuals. But I am left wondering: \\"what the hell are they talking about?\\" Dr. Mack's first book still had enough healthy scepticism to make for solid reading. This book makes me want to cheer the academic committee's attempt to reel Dr. Mack back into the fold. With this work, John E. has wandered too far into make-believe-land to have much credibility. Jacques Vallee made a more reasonable sojourn into the folklore/UFO connection some years ago with his \\"Passport to Magonia\\". This \\"Passport to the Cosmos\\" has been stamped invalid."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent look at an extremely difficult topic","review":"Does much to capture the mystery and ambiguity of the close encounter (CE4) phenomenon. It shows that the phenomenon is a true challenge to our concept of reality, while at the same time showing that we must take the phenomenon seriously. To his credit, Dr. Mack does not take sides in the current debates on the CE4 phenomenon, but does a good job of portraying the controversies involved. My overall opinion is that this is Dr. Mack's best book yet. It is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in the UFO/CE4 phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chineese Junk!!!","review":"Will not work on GE brand, Stems too short and very loose.I tried adding both stems and it was still too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It works pretty well.

I followed the instructions very carefully, as this was the first tumbler we were attempting to use. The barrel is made of such cheap and thin plastic that it quickly wears away at the seams. The barrel started leaking, and the mixture of water and grit that spilled out made a huge mess. Moreover, the barrel failed on our first batch of stones! We did not even get to polish a single set of rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The barrel will wear out.","review":"Someone put zero thought into the barrel of this product. You are tumbling rocks that will continue to grind down to a smooth nature. What about the container? It too must withstand the abuse of all those rocks rolling around day after day. We were only able to complete one cycle of rocks. When we went to do a second set about 3 days in we had sprung a massive hole and gray course grit was everywhere. I had a tumbler as a kid and tumbled many many sets of rocks. Never ever did my tumbler fail. This tumbler is made of softer plastic. As for the machine, it works great. The set is crap though due to the barrel which is a major component to the entire set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money: Worked Once, Busted in the Middle of Second Use","review":"It was fun the first time, albeit noisy. We live near a beach with plenty of agates and used our own rocks (well under the recommended weight limit). We even had a jeweler set one of the polished rocks to make a nice pendant. We bought a refill pack. During the second stage, the machine developed a fatal leak. I could do nothinbg to stop it.If you are looking for a cheap piece of junk to use once and throw a way, this fits the bill.

If you are lucky, it will work once; the 2nd time, you have a mess halfway through the grinding/polishing process, with no way to finish, a worthless barrel and gears inside the machine that will grind themselves up.This was rec'd as a gift by my disappointed child.

However, there are no tumblers on Amazon that say they are from Science Tech and this is the tumbler that comes up if you search for \\"Science Tech rock tumbler.\\" Anyway, the tumbler worked well for the first set of rocks. However, during step 2 of the second set of rocks, the tumbler started leaking. We tried numerous times to patch it, but it didn't work.

There is one song I didn't particularly like, so I had to give it a four star rating for that reason. I also felt I needed more music when song number twelve finished.

The book follows all 46 years of the Indo-Caribbean Mr. Biswas' life in Trinidad. Mr. Biswas is a poor sign painter who got tricked into marriage to a woman with a large, annoying extended family. He tries to make a life for himself on his terms, but ends up relying on his in-laws more than he would like to. Because of the setting, the characters often speak in dialect (which is not very difficult to understand), and Mr. Biswas can be relied upon to come up with a funny comeback to the other, more pompous characters in the novel.

The plot itself, dealing with corruption within the CIA, rogue ex-intelligentia, the entire stolen Russian gold reserve and mind-reading induced by a powerful MRI is, as opposed to other works by Finder, is completely implausible.

The next four days were every other day dry and every other day she was able to stop with just slightly damp panties. The next week every night dry. Then the next 9 days only two almost accidents. This alarm is excellent, she was a sound sleeper and it wakes her up quickly, as soon as it feels moisture. We were putting a pull up over her panties but not anymore.

For example, the Beatle's tune, YELLOW SUBMARINE is a simple 3-chord song in the key of G but here they've added 3 extra chords not in the original tune.

The video is very grainy throughout and the narrator describes the action as though it is the first time he has ever seen the footage.

His biggest hits are here and maybe more importantly a lot more that should have been. The reviewer who suggested some of the vocals were overshadowed by the band is correct. I found 4 or 5 had been driven through reverberation which was a little annoying. The sound quality was a little 'warmer' on some selections than others which I suppose resulted from being recorded through 2 record companies, RCA/BMG and an independent label. These are only minor flaws and can't take away from a truly magnificient singer/songwriter. He really loved Mother Earth. Some songs are happy - others are sad.

Cohen or the congressman from Washington State who released surrepitiously obtained recordings by party hacks to the Wash. Post.

Their gowns blow in the wind, they carry candles or cakes or babies. They fly kites with the children, teach school, offer up a baked turkey or decorate the tree. There are even three male figures to incorporate. Helen uses embroidery floss to appliqué the figures, which outlines all the pieces in sharp relief.

You have to push hard to close the door. Maybe it will work, Maybe it will turn off after 3 seconds? O.K., tried everything, enough of that. I removed the cabnet. Seems the internal door latch has three micro switches that are activated by the door latch hooks. The top micro switch tells the board the door is closed. The top door hook did not trip the micro switch. I removed the two mounting screws holding the door latch. I bent the mounting tabs about 3 degerees so it will hold the latch more secure.I GENTLY pryed the back of the door, by the latch hooks, open enough to get to the spring. I streched the spring almost 3 times normal and replaced.Door now closes with normal pressure. Now trips the door closed switch every time. WORKS PERFECT. I LOVE my auction microwave.

It would cost more to fix than to buy a new one, and you only get a month or two warranty on such repairs.I'd rather spend a couple hundred dollars more on something that would last.

Would either undercook (tons of old maids) or scorch. The door stopped closing nicely after about a year. I thought the door latching mechanism would fail before the actual unit did. I was wrong. Now when I push the button - the light goes on, but turntable doesn't move, fan doesn't come on/make noise, then it shuts itself off. Paid $200 for this unit 2 years ago: at $100/year, not worth it.

I called Panasonic and they said since it's less that one year old, they would fix it. But wait! I am handicap and they want me to take it to them!! Since they have this continuous issue, I would think they would have taken it seriously and stopped putting out inferior products.

The Sensor Heat and Sensor Cook functions work well too. I do wish it was more user-friendly as far as features are concerned, however. It's not possible to add additional time while something is cooking, unless it is in full minute increments. Also, it's necessary to press the Power Level button repeatedly in order to change the cooking power, as opposed to direct entry of the power setting you wish to use. When it's finished cooking, the alarm tone is not near loud enough to be heard more than a few feet away.

Nice overall value - price, performance, etc ... when I first purchased it.But it broke down after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year) of use. My other microwave ovens before lasted virtually forever (10+ years). When I called one of the Panasonic authorized repair centers, the guy looked up my serial number and told me that the high voltage inverter needs to be replaced. Apparently, they are aware that the inverter has poor reliability and high failure rate. The guy said \\"Panasonic would pay for the part but not the labor.\\"I think if a company knows its product is marginal, they should stand behind it by offering to pay for both defective parts and labor.So far, I haven't repaired the unit.

The latch of the door is so hard to push up that it caused this small piece to break and we are having to replace it ourselves. (Cost of just the little piece of plastic is $10.00!!) If we took it into a service center, the cost would be $50.00.

The latest unit, another NN-H965, will only indicate a \\"H98\\" failure code on the front panel after 24 months. Panasonic has offered to sell me another \\"discounted\\" unit, citing a price that is $10 above what anyone will pay right here on Amazon.com. Oh, and by the way, the guy that had problems with Wifi in his house...my oven knocks me off of the internet as well.

I can forgive one broken one as things happen..but two?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around tour book about Yucatan","review":"This is a great all around tour book of the Yucatan but I would not call it an adventure book. It has the usual tour information of the Fodor's and Frommer's style with only a few actual \\"adventures\\" mentioned. The biggest flaw to this book is that sites and museums opening/closing times as well as prices are sometimes omitted or out-of-date. However, the helpful hints, humor, and narative qualities do make an enjoyable read and worth buying if you plan to visit the area. Not many pictures are included and they are all black & white."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book with the worst advice possible.","review":"We bought this book anticipating that we would take any advice from a guidebook with a grain of salt. With this book, you need a salt lick.

I tried to snap on and even glue on but the glue ruined two rail cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Natual\\" is not the word I'd use...","review":"This book has one basic recipe: it describes the difference between soap and detergent, and then tells you to pick your \\"base soap\\" from one of the real soaps available in your supermarket. Then it tells you how to add \\"natural\\" items to the remelted \\"base soap\\" to make it more attractive.The main redeeming feature of the book is it's exellant description of packaging, and suggestions for putting together a superb gift box of soap. This section, which is the largest section in the book, is definitly worth the price. It even has patterns for some pretty fancy decorating techniques, in terms of packaging.In my opinion, however, this is NOT a book about making soap. It's about SELLING soap. And, as a book about selling soap, it's very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"this isn't soapmaking, it is soap recycling","review":"I can't believe people buy these books and think they are making a wonderful product. This is not real soapmaking, it makes an inferior product compared to real soapmaking, and it is not much of an improvement over the storebought soap. Take a good look at the pictures of the soaps and ask yourself if they really look like soap ought to. These \\"soaps\\" look like everything from cheeses, to banana bread, to granola bars they are so chock-full of material that doesn't belong in soap. The reason why self-proclaimed \\"soapmakers\\" like the author add so much material is to disguise the fact that they've been unable to melt the soap down completely and they are disguising all of the unsightly and unmelted bits. Please, get over the fear of lye and get yourself a real soapmaking book; if you've been using this book and using the soaps, you will notice an incredible improvement when you make your own soap FOR REAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for experienced soap makers","review":"People who really make soap - and contrary to what others have said, it is far from an arduous or time consuming process, should do themselves a favor and pass on this book. Natural soapmaking means using lye and oils, not breaking down someone else's soap and reconstituting it.Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Packaging Ideas!","review":"This book is perfect if you are looking to give gift baskets and such for any event. I'm not too fond of the whole hand-milled soap idea since glycerine is so cheap and available at your local craft store. I did like the scent combinations though, and the book even included templates for the labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the reasons I now make soap!","review":"I knew absolutely nothing about hand-milled soap making or soap making period and I picked this book up, read it cover to cover and enjoyed it all. I then bought my supplies (the very few I didn't already have in my kitchen) and some ingredients for two of the receipes and the rest is history. My teenage daughter and I spent the weekend making soap and we had a blast! All the steps in this book worked perfectly, although at first we struggled with the amount of time to melt the soap. Eventually we got it though and within a weekend we had our kitchen full of a variety of shapped soaps that began the curing process. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have the interest in creating soap from scratch (mixing with lye, etc). It has beautiful pictures and many creative ideas for wrapping. Love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to try these recipes out!","review":"If you want an easy way to personalize soaps for gifts or make other \\"spa\\" product for yourself and others this is a great starter book.

Definitely a wonderful addition to my soapmaking library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Experienced Soap Maker","review":"This book is great for people that already make their own soap. She has wonderful recipes for hand-milled soap, bath salts, bath oils and massage oils. There are also some very descriptive and beautiful packaging ideas.

Unscented vegetable soap is sometimes difficult to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't confuse handmade soap with hand milled soap.","review":"The techniques outlined in this book in no way demonstrate the real method for making handmade soaps.

It has a great variety of original songs that adults won't get tired of listening to alongside their little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"The moaning, whiney songs on this CD are enough to give even the most cheerful baby the blues. If you enjoy torchy folk songs, this is your CD. If you were looking for modern, but gentle music to ease your baby to sleep at the end of the day - look elsewhere. I love the Kenny Loggins Return to Pooh Corner and More Songs from Pooh Corner, Linda Rondstadt: Dedicated to the One I love and the Martha Stewart Baby: Sleepytime(don't laugh). And my absolute favorite is one that is, unfortunately, out of print now, Lullabies for Little Dreamers: Soft Rock Classics from your favorite artists. Do yourself a favor - look for a used copy of that and skip this depressing, adult themed attempt at the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a collection of easy listening music...","review":"Though this album has a 2-3 really nice songs (by Emmy Lou Harris or Mary Chapin Carpenter) in my opinion it wasn't the lullaby home-run hit that many other reviewers seemed to think it was. I'm 30 and I found that most of the songs had an out-dated, easy listening feel to them. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy \\"vintage\\" music. But I think I could've developed a better playlist by just going through my James Brown and Joni Mitchell and Etta James albums to find soothing and peaceful songs. The music did reflect motherly sentiments, but I'm not sure this was my primary objective in purchasing the music. I was hoping for something that would soothe my baby to sleep that wasn't cliche lullaby music. Though these songs were not cliche, they weren't more soothing than any other easy-listening music station could provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated about 1/2 of the songs","review":"a few songs are good, but I didn't like most of them. Several were of the \\"dislike intensely but can't get them out of my head\\" category. I would put this CD on when trying to get my baby to sleep, he didn't seem too jazzed about it either. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"til their eyes shine-the lullaby album","review":"This is the best lullaby CD I have ever heard.

Such a refreshing change, and all new songs to us. Now our little girl is over two, and has to hear it before bed each night. Track two, Child of Mine, is our special song, and instantly brings calm and cuddles to an otherwise stressful time of day. I can't imagine a time in the future when I won't love this CD.

It's hard to describe this book. There is a certain charm about it. I read some of the reviews and they're right. There is no central plot or climax to the story. It's just a little refugee girl's story of her family. It's filled with real life truth and sorrow of how her family dealt with the era. I fell in love with it after page 100.

It has great illustrations and the recipes cover all skill levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start......","review":"I found this book to be very helpful for myself as I am a novice at breadbaking. The instructions and illustrations are a good substitute in lieu of personal instructions and I was able to cultivate my own wild yeast in a few days longer than was stated in the book. The chemistry behind yeast and other ingredients was very useful in aiding me to comprehend the science of baking. I did find that I needed to read and re-read sections as sometimes the text went off in a different tangent. I guess that's why she named it \\"The Bread Bible\\". I will use this book as the benchmark for selecting other bread cookbooks as I find the concise instructions invalueable when you don't know what your doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a seasoned bread baker, I am disappointed that a 640-page bread cookbook contains only two whole grain recipes. She could have at least included a section on whole-grain, but one has the impression that Beranbaum doesn't like the taste of whole-grain. Her methods are good, but, considering that part of the reason to make a sponge is to soften the whole-wheat flour, it surprised me that her sponge-based recipes do not contain any. This is a good cookbook if you want to learn the sponge method of bread baking, but as a source for a variety of bread recipes, I wish I had purchased a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"1. I have exactly followed a number of recipes with consistently poor results. This MAY be because I live in Australia and Australian flour is different to American flour. Still, since this book is distributed in Australia, it should be ensured that recipes work here as well.2. At a minimum you would expect a recipe book to give you exact overviews as to ingredients and time needed. However, in a number of recipes that I tried, what was stated in the 'overview' was grossly out of touch with what was stated in the actual recipe. Thus, by a brief glance at the recipe I'd be told the resting time was 1h, only to find out later (too late) that the recipe also included overnight resting etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite cookbook for bread","review":"This is the Best Bread Book Ever.

Written by the author of the highlypopular \\"The Cake Bible,\\" Ms. Beranbaum completes the coverageof baking (well, almost, because she still needs to write\\"The Cookie Bible\\"). All the bread recipes are very accessible,and produce consistent results. Although geared towards theamateur home baker, the recipe quantities are presented inboth volumetric and percentage formats for advanced bakers.The writing is easy and unassuming, with personalanecdotes providing a personal connection to the writer.Add this book to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Stars Is Pushing It A Bit","review":"WOW! I'm not sure how to begin this review. First, the book is quite heavy (literally) and there is just soooo much information, that myself as a home cook/baker just was overwhelmed. I love to bake bread but I really have been doing fine without all the scientific stuff. The ingredient and equipment list would cost a small fortune. The author obviously does not live on a middle income or less yearly budget. Some recipes she says to use Gold Medal flour or bleached, others she says Hecker's ONLY, and others she says White Lily and still others she says unbleached! I don't have that kind of room in my kitchen. And if I had the All-Clad pans and clay pans she uses, I'd have someone else baking for me! I was disappointed, you may not be. I bought this book for a good deal through my book club, but I will not be keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust only the negative reviews!","review":"I have been baking bread for 35 years. This is the worst book I have ever encountered in teaching one to bake bread. I'm guessing that the postive reviews were written by person or persons who will gain from the sale of this book. Although I'm sure the author is a perfectly lovely person, every negative review is right on the money. The only bread that I have made reasonably successfully from this book are breads that I already was able to make without this book. I have a number of bread baking books, every single one which is better than this one. Please don't waste your money. The pictures are to die for but your bread will not turn out that way. My last loaf I attempted from this book turned out so bad that it went straight into the garbage and I spent 24 hours making it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistently Poor Results","review":"I agree with all the other 1-star reviewers. I found overly complicated directions on the one hand and not enough basic information on the other. My doughs were consistently wet and sticky. Her estimated prep times were WAY off. I too would get half-way through the process only to find out it would take much longer than I thought. Not clear at all and also very NOT fun. Left me feeling very depressed so had to drink more wine. I had planned on giving this book away asap but don't want anyone I like to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fun","review":"While this book gives some helpful information I was overwhelmed by the detail. For me it takes alot of the fun out of making and enjoying homemade bread. As one who has been successfully winging it for 25 years, and experimenting with different recipes, the detail in this book, I believe, makes bread making more akin to rocket science than something to do on a weekend morning so one can have some tasty homemade bread with dinner.

Why should we the customer have to correct this lady's (obviously cheap) editor's lack of skills? This should be taken off the market period. I regret having to even give it one star to speak my mind.

As with all recipes it's important to read it before you start! Stick to the recipes adn once you have done it by the book, then you can try a few different variations!

I am finally getting a handle on sourdough baking because of this book. I also like the detailed explanations of why particular ingredients are listed in the recipes. For example; why use unsalted butter instead of salted? (Reason: makes controlling the amount of sodium for those on low salt diets much easier). The section on the different types of flours, their properties and the way they are milled I also found very interesting as an amateur bread baker. If you are someone who is serious about becoming a better baker or just want some explanations for things that are puzzling you, get this book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the home baker","review":"I've only had this book for a few months and already I've made 14 different breads from it, a record for a single cookbook.

The microwave it replaced has slightly more power, and has no discernible effect on my wireless network. For now, I am going back to that.BOTTOM LINE -- I'm going back to my older microwave, and if I really do miss having one this big will buy something other than a Panasonic.Too bad about the problems, because I like the large size (for large baking dish, or defrosting a good-sized roast), and (when it works) it cooks well.

We use it for basic tasks like making baked potatoes and re-heating leftovers. Nothing fancy. Warms evenly. Is fine as a microwave.Added bonus, which we didn't know we'd appreciate so much: You can turn off the beeps by pressing function-6-2. Now midnight snacks don't have to wake anyone up. The door isn't easy to close, though. It is very loud when it finally pushes closed, and takes a heavy push on the button to open it, too. Our previous Panasonic had this same poor door-opening design and the button finally broke (we had to repair), but this one hasn't been a problem yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hint for those who microwave shuts off after 2 seconds.","review":"This may be a door alignment problem.

This one lasted four years, but this morning it died the same death--would only set for a few seconds, generated no heat during that time.Our previous microwaves (Quasar and Sharp) lasted for over ten years, and based on the similar symptoms on the two Panasonic models, I just wanted to caution buyers that this may not be the best oven available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Nice Microwave","review":"This is a really nice microwave and seems to heat everything pretty evenly and really fast.

I used it for 9 years without a problem. I decided on the Panasonic because of size and power which was also like the one I had. I read reviews on this product and agree about the noise of opening and closing and the pressure you had to use to open it. I have to whole on to the machine when opening it to keep from pushing it back. I have used it one time to pop popcorn and by the time the corn had popped there was a hole burned in the bottom of the sack. I will try a lower power the next time.

Today it shut itself off after 10 seconds and showed the code \\"H97\\". I called Panasonic and the woman tech said it might be the Magnatube (sp?). Probably paid @$200, if I remember.

As the authors point out, the original meaning of angel is messenger. The individual true accounts that follow from a variety of writers show that dogs do indeed, have special messages for us, not the least of which is unconditional love and devotion. The authors' introduction touches briefly on the unique relationship between dogs and humans dating back to the Stone Age. It is followed by individual accounts of dogs who played a special role sometimes heroic, sometimes healing, and sometimes just being there in response to the emotional need of a member of their family.It makes you wonder what early humans did to inspire such steadfast devotion from another species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconditional love","review":"Anyone who has loved and lost a dog will enjoy this novel.

There's a guy at work who thinks the opposite is true. I would rather see Scott with STP. That's my opinion. This released too many years after it was taped and some of the comments by the band seem very dated now. Dated but interesting footnotes to the history of both bands: GNR and STP. The concert tracks are broken up with segments. Either interviews with the band or a weird, scripted interrogation with a pretty blonde that seems to follow the ambiguous military propaganda theme. I don't think these segments (the girl, not the interviews) added anything to this release. The interviews range from the band listening to hundreds of demos in search of a singer to Duff and Scott doing martial arts at a retreat to rehab from drugs. There could have been more songs on here but I think we're fortunate that VR released anything on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"ehh","review":"This disc includes some great performances, the problem is the disc itself. It seems somewhat like a bootleg or maybe shot by some amatures. It was also released a few years after the band broke up. Makes you wonder why it was released at all. What is up with the girl talking about war every few songs. I guess we where all captivated by the mystery of Scott Weiland's hat.With all of that being said, I really did enjoy this disc. If you are a fan of G N' R/STP/ Velvet Revolver etc, this is inexpensive and you will enjoy it. You can just skip over parts of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected, Weiland Is The Man!!!","review":"The sound quality turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Some of the video effects are cheesy and get to be pretty annoying at times when you're trying to simply watch the show, but all in all it's a great disc.

That said, most of her observations are either trite, without foundation, or politically and intellectually biased. A previous reviwer wondered why Madame Tu is no longer sought by the HK press - the reason is that her views are predictable, largely irrelevant, and not news worthy. A reader looking for a picture of colonial HK life would do better to read one of the many memoirs on the subject, or better watch Suzie Wong - the pictures at least do some justice. Unless one is merely seeking a source of questionable validation for preconcieved views of HK (the US?) - this is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"This beautiful story was just a joy to read with my daughter and to chat about.

Hello,Is anybody there? Is the story of how Mika, a visitor from another planet 'dreams' himself onto earth. It is very easy to understand what Gaarder is saying.The author is brimming with questions about the world, which is why a large part of the book is a series of conversations. Though it is often confusing, the little illustrations lighten up the book. It also seems that the author is using the plot of the story as a 'base' for him to station his questions of our world and galaxy. The appeal of Sophie's World and Through a Glass Darkly re-surfaces with this novel.

After 6 weeks of using this alarm, he is done! We finished using it 3 months ago and he has not had a wet bed since.

We put a pull-up over the top of his underwear as some of the reviewers suggested and the pull-up was only wet two times during the two months (and I think this was from poor sensor placement on our part). The rest of the time, the alarm stopped him from urinating and he got up and went to the bathroom. By the second month, the 2 or 3 times the alarm did go off, he was able to get up, stop the alarm, and go to the bathroom by himself. The alarm was loud enough to wake him up and us (in the next room) but rarely woke his younger brother who shares a room with him.

I think the item is well designed, for the most part, but it does not wake up my 10 year old bed-wetter. The sound is a sort of electronic chirping, and it blends in with white noise such as fans. It doesn't always wake me up right away from down the hall. The vibration feature seemed promising, but it's not enough. I need to find one that buzzes like an obnoxious alarm clock, I think.Anyway, this product has no guarantee and is not returnable.

This gave her (and us) immediate feedback when she wet herself at night. The first night the alarm went off and we had to wake her up but she was able to stop urinating quickly enough that she only lightly wet her underwear. After that she held her pee for almost two weeks every night and only had a slight incident right before waking up in the morning. We have her wear it every other night right now but she is complaining about the wire being uncomfortable. Not sure how we'll deal with this issue but will try to come up with some compromise. Excess wire has been easy enough to tuck in and/or tape so it's out of the way (we pin the unit inside her pants).This product definitely worked for her and she gets immediate feedback if she is wetting.

It only took my almost 7-year-old-daughter about 2-3 weeks and she's completely dry now every morning. This has changed the environment in our household and removed a stress in our house. We borrowed a friend's baby monitor and that's how we could hear her alarm going off (and it went off twice/night in the beginning) and I was tired, but after one week, it went to once/night. Then it just stopped and she now sleeps all night and stays dry all night. This alarm is AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"My son had been frustrated with his bedwetting because he wasn't able to spend the night at his friends' house. He suggested getting an alarm clock which we thought was loud but he slept so soundly it never woke him up.

I finally (against his wishes) bought the alarm and now we wonder why we have waited so long. This is our fourth week with the alarm; my son was wet the first three nights and has only been wet another two nights.

We bought this alarm and checked out a few books from the library, and have not looked back. After 52 days of wearing the alarm, he was dry 46 of them.

It took approx 3 weeks for complete success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, ineffective execution","review":"This product is a good idea -- in fact i was motivated to look for it partly because my bedwetting son thought that some such invention would help him stay dry. It works occasionally, but the urine doesn't hit the sensor, or the alarm does not go off, or the alarm is too feeble to be heard through my son's blanket, far too often for it to be effective. The alarm itself is so quiet that I put it in a tin cup for a while -- it is so weak that it rarely wakes me up, let alone my son, who I swear could drown before waking. If a child twists and turns during the night, it is unlikely that the clip will end up in a place where it triggers the alarm before most of the bed is sopping. I am disappointed with its lack of effectiveness. We are returning to the old \\"no drinks after 4PM\\" approach until we can find an effective alarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The first night the alarm went off and couldn't be turned off or re-set.

When we fist received it we were really excited. My son couldn't wait to use it. The alarm never went off! He woke up wet and there was no signal or indication. Needless to say, we were all dissapointed since we thought he had a dry night, hence the alarm not going off. We decided to try it again, giving it another chance. 1 week straight and nothing! It seems as though it has to be positioned in a weird angle as it will only go off if a certain spot gets wet. There is no such thing as just \\"plopping\\" it in underwear or pull-ups. It may work better for a girl, but it is really hard to control which direction you're urinating in if your a sleeping child. In my opinion, it is too expensive of a gadget NOT to be reliable.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes WAY too long to sense liquid","review":"I bought this because of the reviews and desperation for by 7 year old boy. He is a very heavy sleeper, so I was hopeful this would help. This doesn't even go off until his entire bladder is empty and the whole bed is flooded.

VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarm Has Been A Godsend","review":"This alarm has been just the thing we needed for my 6 yr old son who still wets his bed. I felt guilty at first when the alarm woke him from a sound sleep (poor guy), but desperate times call for desperate measures. In the course of 2 months, he's gone from setting his bed 3-4 times per night to once a night on occasion. My only criticism is that the built in safety pin broke after a few nights of use- i have no idea how this happened, but a metal safety pin shouldn't break- obviously this was a manufacturing flaw. Rather than go through the trouble of sending back and interrupting the training, I just use the built in plastic clip on the back of the alarm which has worked fine- I just clip in to his pajama collar.

But take a look at the era depicted by Bruce McIver. Simple students started asking God how they could join Him in His work of loving the world and their complete surrender to Him led to a movement that shaped much of today's American (and now beyond) Christianity.The book does have a Baptist-specific tone and the revival model is certainly a far cry from most youth oriented ministries today. Also, in a less than polished style, it jumps around a bit and can get a little boring with the details of who served on what committeeHowever, the overall spirit of the students involved and the faithfulness they exemplified to the end of their lives is refreshing and challenging.

I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead. The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the \\"incremental backup\\" function. The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was \\"impossible\\"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now. I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it. I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous. I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.

I got a message indicating \\"the archive is corrupted.\\" I could not boot my PC. I had to restore Windows using the \\"recovery disc\\" that shipped with the PC.

Everything worked perfectly.I thought about buying the Symantec product which does the same thing (Ghost I believe), but I've never cared for any of Symantec's products so I was happy to give the $35 to Acronis.Trust me, you won't regret buying this software, even if you're only planning to back up your hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product simply doesn't work","review":"I'm a well-educated professional and I've been able to successfully operate every other software product I've ever purchased.

Sometimes the error is \\"can't copy read-only file\\" and sometimes the software just runs and runs and never actually does anything (I let it run for 2 days once, and it never got past \\"0% complete\\"). Most frustrating, however, is the complete lack of support from Acronis. I've contacted them 3 times, each with a detailed but simple statement of the problem, and as yet have had no response. There could be a simple explanation for my difficulty, but if there is, I'm certainly not going to find out from them, and the skimpy supporting documentation provided with the software certainly doesn't help.

The exterior drama becomes more than a little kitchen-sink convenient, especially near the end.I'll admit, I haven't read or seen any other Gilman plays.

With the glycerine you just heat it in the microwave for 20 seconds to liquify, pour into the container and wait for it to set.

It has a windup key for the clock, a windup key for the alarm, a knob for setting the time, a knob for setting the alarm, and a tiny plastic knob for turning the alarm on and off. That makes five controls in a small amount of space. Not made for anyone with large hands. I was spoiled by the older and larger Big Ben alarm clock that had more spacing around the button, knob and windup key due to the combining of the clock and bell in one windup key, the combining of the time and alarm settings in one knob, along with a long metal alarm button.

I have been doing martial arts for only six months and I know more points than are covered in this book. Also he has a very 'Queensbury rules' attitude towards self-defense. He states that blows to the groin should not be used as it is a 'repugnant' tactic. Well if someone attacks you, you should use anything which doesn't cause them more than necessary harm. There's no place in self-defense for the niceties of sporting competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Useless Book","review":"After buying this book, I was very upset about it. It doesn't really contain any pressure points at all, it basically tells you striking areas. This sounds good, but almost anyone that does martial arts would know them any way. I strongly encourage you not to buy this book. If you want a book that has pressure points this is not it. You're much better going to your dojo or martial arts school and learning something. rather then wasting your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of book !","review":"If one surveys martial arts books they will quickly find that few books have been written that specifically deal with the subject of pressure points and nerve centers. Mr. Tegner weeds through the myths and heresay surrounding this subject and succeeds in presenting a realistic view of vital point striking. He avoids the hype (unlike the \\"death touch\\" books) and gives the reader an idea of what can be expected and accomplished from the exploitation of these anatomical targets in a very easy to understand format. (Let's face it, a 250lb man will certainly do more damage than a 120lb woman). Should be read by every martial artist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Treatment on Nerve centers and Pressure points","review":"What Bruce Tegner has done with this volume is to strip away the mystical, pseudo-magical approach to the topic and present a straight forward and highly effective amalgamation of nerve centers, pressure points, striking techniques, and common sense self defense. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the martial arts or self defense in general. It is a valuable addition to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self defence Nerve Centers & Pressure points","review":"Good thing I didn't pay much for this book.

I wanted more. And bad. So I purchased these expecting the same.The graphics were horrible and choppy. The visuals didnt seem to respond to the music.

I have not had to cut the snake, because I also bought a similar product by the same manufacturer that included the Icy cools in little individual squares. Both excellent products, nice to have both.

You see, it seems Ren & Stimpy don't celebrate Christmas, but rather Yaksmas. It's basically a warped version of Christmas and this CD goes into great detail of the story, traditions and joys of the holiday. From shaven yaks and cat hairballs to rubber nipple jokes, the songs are every bit as hilarious and off the wall as you remember the show. Some being spoofs of traditional carols and others original to this CD. But what really sets this apart from other comedy Christmas CD's (besides Ren & Stimpy themselves) are the clever interstitials between some of the songs. They make it feel like a 'lost episode' of Ren & Stimpy and give the set a sort-of story line.BTW, this isn't just for kids. I was introduced to this CD by my 35 year old uncle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Puts You In The Holiday Mood!!","review":"\\"Ren & Stimpy: Crock O' Christmas\\" is a great CD that had me singing along with the characters!

Listen to this CD on headphones anyways, because the surround-sound is awsome! If you love Ren and Stimpy, or even like them a little, get this CD! Christmas will never be the same again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect performance","review":"This CD is virtually perfect. While some words make absolutely no sense, sometimes begging you not to actually pay attention to the \\"details,\\" they still sound personal and intriguing, and Imogen's every pronounciation soon becomes an emotional treasure. And that's the harshest criticism that the album deserves. Fans of Bjork or Portishead who have become tired of the utter otherwordliness (or weirdness in the former's case) of their music will eagerly welcome Frou Frou's soothing and easily empathetic work about love and broken relationships. The sound of Details is sublime, sophisticated, soothing and captivating, and i am confident that the album will stand as one of the top ten best albums of the decade given a fair evaluation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mimicry.","review":"I cannot listen to an album that *BLATANTLY* sounds like another artist's repertoire, and I sorta can't understand how anyone can.Sure, Thom yorke from Radiohead is very reminicant of Jeff Buckley, but he's not a CLONE.But, this woman's voice sounds EXACTLY like Sarah Mclachlan's voice. Every time she hits a note, I can't help but think this.And Besides, Sarah Mclachlan's \\"Surfacing\\" has way more substance than this, anyway.I am seeing people compare her to Dido's singing; I don't really see that.Whether she was *trying* to sound like Mclachlan or not, Either way, If it was me, I would at least *try* to set myself apart, if only slightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal, Haunting, Exquisite...","review":"I have followed Imogen Heap as best as I could since I heard her on Spin Magazine TV. She has a voice like a weapon that could pierce through the skin and flow through you until you find yourself swaying and humming. She is a force to be reckoned with and to find her once again in music is Awesome. This album showcases so much that must not be ignored in the way of timbre and melody and feeling. I hope others will like it as much as I already do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Must Be Dreaming","review":"...this album is a smoothe, effortlessly captivating combination of acoustic blended electronica and heart-capturing melodies guided by exquisitely emotive vocals by the always-lovely Imogen Heap.The above paragraph may sound like an over-zealous and giddy statement, but I truly cannot help but be affected this way by such a gorgeous blending of percussive and chorus-like noises. The singles \\"Breathe In\\", \\"Let Go\\" and, \\"Must Be Dreaming\\" are so me of the best pop tracks to come out this decade yet. And that's saying something. This is the sort of music that is so greatly missing in the majority of uninspired American radio, and should appeal to fans of \\"trip-hop\\", techno and just \\"pop\\", alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"There's nothing out there that you can compare to Frou Frou. I'm at loss of words to describe how much I love this album. Frou Frou is my recent discovery and now I can't imagine a day without listening to at least one of their songs. They're meaningful, unlike all this [...] that you hear on the radio. Just buy the freaking album- it's absolutely worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frou Frou - Oh No It Isn't","review":"Tired of the monotonous radio tunes which lack creativity and whose sole purpose is glamour, not talent? Well, there is a kid in town - Frou Frou. From the moment Immi Heap's voice rang through my speakers, I was instantly hooked. One quickly embraces not only her dynamic sound, but the brilliance of the entire track. Exerting nothing but pure, raw emotion in every word, her songs will leave you moved and crying out for more. Step off the trendy pop boat and delve into an album that is sure to stay close to your ear for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...","review":"If you like Dido, 10,000 Maniacs or The Cranberries, then you'll love this album.

Then played 10 seconds of the next couple tracks, and 'click,' out it came from my player. I want my money back.Horrible. Dreck. Contrived, utterly forgettable crap of the highest order.Does she have a nice voice? Do we have competent production value? Sure. But it's like special effects in a film. If there is no story they can't carry the film.I love good downtempo/trip hop/acid jazz, etc. I listen to a lot of Massive Attack, Tricky, Morcheeba, Air, Portishead, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Amon Tobin, Zero 7, etc...

I had a suspension when I saw all the advertising. This album makes you go \\"Hey what's this,\\" but goes no where. Every song sounds exactly the same. But that really is the only response that I can honestly have after listening to it the multiple times. The music feels so right, but has no substance whatsoever, almost in a similiar way to the lyrics. Please if you have any respect for the artists that this album is trying to emulate, don't give in to this manufactured crap. Dig deeper. If not go watch Garden State.

I MUST SAY the lady in the CD sounds haunting. she has a lovely voice. only after watching garden state did i discover such a rare pop/synth talent such as this one.

It was sophisticated and something I had to listen to more and more.Her voice was juxtaposed against the stress of a day and the drive home. It was a place I could unplug from my day and groove. I enjoyed the sounds of it and the acoustic elements felt a bit more organic than the balligomingo, chicane and other electronic artists I've been into lately.

Buy it; you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Chilled Pleasure","review":"I just recently discovered this gem of an album and I have to say, better late than never! As a fan of any strong female vox (ie: McLachlan, Margo Timmons, Hope Sandoval, Beth Gibbons, Fiona Apple to name a few), I was instantly drawn to Heap's melodic and bold lyrics of life and love. This album is more of the 'chilled pop' genre to me.. it can easily be listened to in the background as well as up front and center with it's catchy subtle rhythms. It'll make you move like ripples in water; very fluid. I never tire of it and it never gets old. I highly recommend this album and can only hope that Frou Frou makes more beautiful music together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying Album","review":"I tracked down this album after hearing the song Let Go in a preview for a movie.

However, it's from a 1974 reunion concert,thus,that's where the surprises begin. The most pleasant surprise was hearing 9 previously unrealeased songs from the band. These songs weren't even on the Brummels 1975 reunion album. The song genres range from country to rock to funk and a few other things. The other main surprise of this performance is how the band sounds. They do sound like a 1970's band. This is mainly acheived because of the 2 guitars players. They are using all sorts of interesting guitar effects such as wah-wah pedals. As a guitarist who has just gotten into using effects I find this educational. Occasionally, this performance gets slightly ragged, but overall it is quite satisfying. And Sal Valentino's voice is as good as it was during the 1960's. In my opinion song highlights include Turn Around/Singing Cowboy, Lisa Queen of a Magazine, & Don't Talk To Strangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick so great.","review":"I used the provided double-sided tape to stick the protector to the wall, around my dartboard.

I see quite a few movies a year and never heard of it. Now that I've seen it, I know why. It's a mess. Either the director or editor made a mess of what could have been a good film. Very obviously influenced by James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\", the direction leaves you wondering several times why did we get to this next scene? What just happened? Why did that character do that? Some of the dissolves were messy as well. I bought it because I think that Kirsten Dunst and Lynn Redgrave are two brilliant actresses, but unfortunately because of the storyline, never get to act with each other. The under story was the biggest mess with the character's mom and boyfriend almost afterthoughts. It could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Deeply\\"- a achingly heartfelt story.","review":"Not your typical teenage love story.

The biggest problem I have is with the chuck. It is constantly slipping and losing grip on the bit.No matter how much I tighten it, it always comes loose. You can have the best drill in the world, but if it doesnt hold bits properly - its useless.Skip this drill and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"its basically a toy","review":"good price, but other then that drill was really a waste of money.

The 2 batteries it came with charged relatively quick and lasted for a while as long as it was not set on \\"2\\" and the drilling setting. Oh the flashlight it came with was good so i guess if your looking for a rechargeable flashlight with a worthless drill combo pack this is what u want everyone else who's looking for a good drill DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"clutch gone in 10 months","review":"I'm doing work around the house as therapy.

It is nice and small though and would be an ok drill for around the house light duty work."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"I own a lot of Hitachi power tools and like them all - until this drill came along. The battery doesn't last and is only powerful enough to place long screws in wood for 3 or 4 screws. My twelve year old Dewalt 12V is stronger and lasts longer (i bought the Hitachi because the price of it was about that of a new DeWalt battery - should have clued me in).I do love the way it handles.

If you are a heavy user don't do this to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD AGAIN","review":"I expected more from hitachi! Coming from a carperter of 18 years, this tool will not make it in the field with me. I use it in the shop and around the house. I do like the drill itself and the flash-light is great. If you put charge on the battery for your next use, it will be dead less that 2 days in a nice warm shop.

The Makita is by far a better drill, but the Hitachi is lighter and easier to use. The Hitachi is an ok drill for the money, but it doesn't like rough handling. If you drop it, even from short heights you can expect major damage. I have already thrown one drill away due to internal damage from dropping it from my tool belt, but I kept the batteries for the other drills. I also purchased a \\"reconditioned\\" 14.4V Hitachi from Amazon, but found the drill to be of very poor quality out of the box, the reversing switch didn't fully engage without forcing it. It also wasn't the same drill or the same quality as the ones I purchased \\"new\\" from Amazon, but they had the same part number. \\"Reconditioned\\" must mean \\"product rejected by quality control at factory\\" in Japanese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Drill","review":"This drill has plenty of power for any job. I used it to go through 2 2x4's as I needed to run some electrical wire for a transfer switch. It went through the studs easily and the compact design made it lighter and easier to handle. I wasn't using a paddle bit but a hole saw so the drill has the power. I have a Craftsman cordless drill that is larger and heavier that wasn't able to handle the job. This drill comes with 2 gear settings low and high which also made the job easier. I really like the flashlight as it has a flat base and the adjustable head allowed me to point the light where I needed it. While I didn't have to charge the batteries after this use having a 30 minute charger means I will never be without power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi DS14DVF3","review":"Great drill for the money.

The NICAD batteries are already unable to hold a charge for more than a few days with no use and only minutes with. The batteries were almost fully discharged before recharging all along, so memory should not be a problem. My Makita LI-ION drill , almost the same age, is much more powerful and the charges hold for weeks. From an environmental standpoint the NICAD technology should probably be retired and it's cheaper to buy a whole new drill set than try to replace the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great drill","review":"I love how this drill fits in my hands - it is so well balanced and comfortable. The bit holders are useful for holding screwdriving bits and the hook lets the drill rest nicely from my belt. The batteries last a nice long time. Also I really like the flashlight - I use it all the time now when I bbq at night. The powerful wide beam is great. Overall I think this drill is a great value for the money.Edit: One more thing I forget to mention: the set comes with a full 5 year warranty, something you don't find often, yet quite neccessary for power tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life","review":"The battery life is very poor.

The cost of a replacement battery was half the price of a new unit. The second battery still holds a charge, but it needs to sit in the recharger between uses or it's worthless. Even then at full charge it's only good for a half-hour or less. Forget to leave it in the charger and the next time you need it, it's guaranteed dead. On the other hand my Black & Decker which uses a lithium-ion battery works great, doesn't need to be constantly recharged and doesn't lose it's charge through non use. On top of that I paid slightly less for it that the Hitachi drill, though it didn't include a flashlight. Bid deal!

Based on those songs, I thought that the rest of their material would run in the same vein but was terribly disappointed to find that the rest is experimental New Wavy drivel for the most part. Some of the other songs are listenable but none measure up to those 3 singles. I would recommend this cd only for people that are already familiar with the Tubes music. For all others, download the 3 songs and save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, decent selection of hands","review":"No special techniques, just thinking about specific problems.Good book, worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pras is wack but whatever","review":"Good album.

I'd have to say this is my favorite album from the Lunachicks... and probably even one of my favorites ever made! If you are into the more oldschool punk, you will love these girls! If you are from New York and into the punk scene, you probably already know them. It's not just punk though. These girls just know how to rock! SUPER hardcore!

My shoe size is 11.5, and I prefer \\"wide\\" sizes when I can find them. Since other reviewers had indicated that these tend to run big, so I ordered a size 11. They seemed to fit OK out of the water, but when I wore them with the fins the front part of the boot scrunched up and made my toes uncomfortable. Also, the rubber sole on the back of the boot rounds over to the heel without any sort of lip or ridge to help retain the fin, and even with the fin straps tightened as tight as I could get them, the fins kept slipping off. I ended up returning these and replacing with Aqualung Echozip Ergo boots (size 12), which fit my feet almost perfectly and keep my fins on my feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of money!!!

Ok, so there is cutting, but the operative word with regard to cutting and origami is \\"purist.\\" There are different schools of thought and if you are a purist then these books aren't for you. However, I suppose there is a reason our library keeps these books in the Childrens room. My son and his friends think these books are really great and a lot of fun.

She interviewed a wide variety including Margaret Rawson (a world-renowned expert on dyslexia), Ruth Ellis (the oldest living lesbian), Sadie and Gilbert Hill (married for over eighty years). At first, Ellis is focussed on the historical aspects of their lives, but soon finds herself on a personal journey of her own, where she connects to them as individuals alive in the world and begins to see how looking forward, not backward, is a secret to longevity, as is living in the here and now.

I forced myself to finish this book b/c I was halfway through it when I realized that there are no lessons from centurians.

As the other reviewer mentioned, it has no substance. Quite a disappointment for such a good idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddeningly uneven book.","review":"When I started reading this book I hoped it would be about centenarians and offer clues into their miraculous longevity, but instead the author's digressions are frustrating. Half way through the book and we realized much of the book is about the author, her marriage, and even a visit to her psychotherapist (!).0 Many paragraphs are like reading an on-the-road travelogue as the author describes scenery and environs to and from her interviews.Do we care? How is it relevenat to the secrets of centenarians?Important questions are virtually ignored: what's their spirituality/relligious beliefs? diet? excercise? etc. Instead the author asks innane and irrelevant questions such as \\"What was the dust bowl like?\\" as if there are not already written accounts found in any library? Maybe the author doesn't mind wasting time figuring she too will to 100, but I sure can't say that about myself.

Neenah Ellis worked for NPR News in the past, and this was the other reason I wanted to read this book. It's basically a compilation of stories about 100 year olds, their lives, and what makes them \\"tick\\". Overall, I really enjoyed this book and Ms. Ellis' writing style. But, I was hoping for a bit more of \\"how\\" these people got to be 100. What was their secret for longevity? She was able to ascertain this from some of the centenarians, but not everyone. I also thought she covered a wide variety of individuals, from a very funny lesbian to a conservative Christian.

Like I said, I've come to expect a lot more from Star Trek, although not Peter David in general. His stories actually aren't too bad, but he always manages to spoil it.

I had never heard of The New Frontier, or Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, but found I enjoyed that story as much as the rest. The thread that connects the stories altogether in the bar The Captain's Table is quite enjoyable. I can't help but think that this idea would make a great movie. It would also be interesting to read stories from some of the other Captain's in the bar. As a long time Star Trek reader, I was thrilled to get this book as a gift. I could hear the voices of the Captain's as I read the book. Many books I read I pass along as gifts to others.

There is no one single planner out there that \\"has it all.\\" Martha's planner is great because it has a 3 ring binder where you can add all your vendor contracts and your own pages. But this planner has some fun quizzes and inspiration for the unique bride. I have, use, and suggest, both together. It's a convenient size for carting around, and a fun read.

It has a lot of free space, checklists, questions to ask, and pockets to hold stuff. You could however get the same tips and checklists from several bridal magazines or online and save youself the cost of the book.The illustrations are adorable, but I was not crazy about the organization of the planner.

The worksheets, quizes and checklists have been very helpful to me as well as all the tips.Of course I have a few bridal magazines and do a lot of online research but I do not think I will need another planner besides this one. The book recommends buying an accordian folder to put all your cutouts, articles, contracts, etc in and that has worked great for me.Like other reviewers, I would recommend going to the store to look at planners so you can choose which one will be right for you but if you are more non-traditional and do not want a generic wedding book I would definetly consider this planner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I was hoping for something unique, but it's just like all the other pro-bride, pro-industry, pro-spend-a-LOT-of-money-on-a-wedding planners (but in a \\"non-traditional\\" pink disguise).

It would of been great if there were a little bit on OT Exegetical fallacies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exegetical Fallacies","review":"Just received the book after returning from vacation, performed a high teir skim and this book is full of good details. This will require more study on my part but offers a good foundation and knowledge base."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than any serious book should be","review":"I don't have a lot to add to what has already been written about this wonderful book. D.A.Carson has given us some wonderful insights. By all means read and apply in your own exegetical projects the critical principles he lays out here. If you want to have some real academic fun, read this book a second time and nail Carson on his own fallacious thinking -- his examples are full of fallacies of the type he alerts us to. This is not a complaint nor indeed a criticism of the man and his thought. We all do it!! When you finish this book, by all means, read his book on the gender controversy in Bible translation (The Inclusive Language Debate, ISBN 080105835X). Very balanced, very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master-Scholar gives us another gem!","review":"This book could have been many, many, more pages (and the author does mention this), but what we do get is concise, informative, and well written.I highly recommend this book to all of my fellow \\"Theologians\\". It will save you much time and effort through the demonstration of sound practices of exegesis.D.A.Carson gives those of us who would study scripture a well-deserved sanity-check. With so much BAD exegesis, this book should be on every shepherd's bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"D.A. Carson is overly biased. He uses most of this book to bash views he doesn't like. Some of his categories are good but the examples he provides ought to be less polemical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"A main focus (although not the only focus) of topic examples used in this book is to try to prove man's authority over the woman in Christianity. The author attempts to but fails to disprove valid arguments offered by other respected Christian authors that disagree with this author's view concerning the respective bible passages. It is at this juncture that the book content becomes long winded, in which many of the fallacies the author has directed at other Christian authors, D. A. Carson becomes guilty of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Dr. Carson does a tremendous job with this book. The book is not much over 100 pages, but it really provides an engaging and insightful survey of the most common exegetical mistakes.The examples provided are varied and the author provides wonderfully lucid explanations. I had to skip one of the chapters that dealt with Greek grammar, because it was too advanced for me to benefit from it. While the book is highly technical in some regards, the Dr. Carson does explains things very clearly and doesn't use more technical language than he needs to.This book is a gem even for those who may never do any heavy-duty exegesis, and just want to be able to test what they hear from various preachers and commentators. Beyond that, though, anyone who is preaching or completes seminary should read this book at least once. It is a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the beginner","review":"I agree with another reviewer who finds this otherwise beautiful book light on instructional details. I happen to love Stabin's painting style, and I do find copying his paintings to be very illuminating. I still rate this book highly because much can be gleaned from studying and copying his work, which is fresh, economical, and transparent. Perhaps I would rather recommend it, though, for the more advanced artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Figure in Watercolor","review":"I am so very pleaseed with this book . It is one of the most helpful I have ever had . I highly recomend it to anyone interested in painting figures and portraits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful style","review":"This book shows lovely examples of painting figures in watercolor. While it is not a step-by-step instructional format, each of the paintings is accompanied by Mel Stabin's commentary which lead the reader to focus on one particular aspect of his technique. I've learned so much from this book about technique and composition, but most importantly, I learned ways to resist overworking a painting--definitely a step in the right direction for those who are working with watercolor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole cd is great!","review":"I've had this cd for a while now and still never get sick of hearing it.

Love combines elements of blues with funk, rock and what has been pegged by the media as \\"white-boy soul\\". The results are a nicely ecclectic mix and sound that is truely original. Highlights on this album include the widely popular \\"Baby's Got Sauce\\" and \\"Cold Beverage\\".

It has typical Seiko accuracy, long battery life, a solid band, and a relatively large, easy-to-read day/date display. I've had other Seiko products that lasted decades through my clumsiness, and they held up very well. I'm looking forward to having this one a long time.Seiko's link system on the band makes shortening the band a little difficult. Otherwise, I have no complaints. It's not a fashion or prestige watch; it's just functional, and that's exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Long","review":"I have one of these for 9 years now, the only problem I ever had was the glass breaking, and changed the battery once(battery lasted 6 years), one of the best watches I ever had, EVER"},{"rating":"2","title":"mens watch","review":"this watch was a Christmas gift .

When he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both Spanish and English, and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other, since there were limited instructions with the watch. By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real beauty. A MANS watch.","review":"Like I said, a real beauty...a MANS watch. Clean looking. extremely accurate like all Seiko watches. I had to take it to a watchmaker to shorten the SS Band. Needs a special tool other than just a pin pusher.

His old watch, which he's been wearing for more than 10 years was breaking down, so I got this for him as a Christmas present. He likes the watch very much and wears it everyday since then. It's a simple yet beautiful watch, goes with all occasions. It's also very accurate too, I haven't heard him complain about the watch even a bit. We love, love this watch.

If we cannot find a way to put a leather band, or other hair-friendly type of band on it, he will not be able to wear it.For those without hairy arms, it is a lovely, simply designed, slim line watch.

You can screw it back in but not tight enough to function. We're mailing it back for service.I'd recommend a Seiko 5 from eBay instead for the same money (my father is too old to keep an automatic running). They're famous for going 15-20 years without maintenance. I have two. If you need a quartz, go with Casio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darned nice watch for the money","review":"I have to say first I'm not a watch person. If I didn't need to know the time for work I wouldn't even think about wearing one. That said, I got this to replace a broken Citizen, which was very thin and fairly small. This is much larger, but despite that it's pretty comfortable. Not heavy at all. The large dial is also nice for my aging eyes to read and the glowing hands are great at night. It's also a nice looking watch, dressy enough without being stodgy. If it's as sturdy as other people here have said, I expect I will be wearing it for a long time. I don't understand the problem people have setting the language for the day of the week. I guess it comes down to reading the directions, which are minimal but sufficient to set it up. A darned nice watch for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko = Quality","review":"This is the second Seiko watch I have owned, the first one for 8 years and it wasn't longer because my line of work is active and I am tough on stuff. I have owned two other watch brands over the past four years (primarily due to convenience buying) but when the second one broke, I thought I might as well invest a little time (bad pun intended) on my next purchase. I saw a sale catalog in the paper around Fathers Day and thought to check on Amazon too. I paid $25 less than the advertised sale price and could not be happier. If you are going to buy ... treat yourself because quality lasts! Seiko is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch for this price","review":"It is really great watch for this price $(50).

There is one thing that is hard to appreciate from just pictures: the minute hand, hour hand, and 12 hour markers are faceted. This creates a beautiful and dynamic shimmering effect (especially on the hour markers) when the light hits the watch at the right angle.It's quite striking against the black dial face. Just the right amount of glitz for a very elegant watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for it's type, with a drawback","review":"Great looking watch and a reasonable price. But little, if any, mention is made of the need to check for the proper date at the end of the month and correct it if the month has less then 31 days. I didn't realize this when I bought the watch as I'm used to digital watches that always have the correct date. Still a great looking analog watch. Just remember to check the date when the month changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and elegant","review":"I like no frills watches without all the bells and whistles and of course I ike quality too. This watch is both casual and yet can look good in any occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I wore this watch for about 18 months before a piece of the watch snapped off and it no longer could be worn. Its a decent watch, but its of inferior quality compared to other watches in the 60-90 dollar price range. Be wary of the durability of this watch as it is just not made well enough to last more than 18-24 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this watch","review":"be careful, it got scratched easily and the battery would be dead the first week you got it if you are unluckyand the customer service are not very helpful either.if it works fine, no problem. if not, it would be a pain to deal with the customer service, as all the online retailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandniece loves it","review":"I bought this Barbie for my grandniece, as a Christmas present.

I travel a lot for work and this is better than bringing CDs around with me. I could not rip this CD to MP3s (there was no mention on the CD of this fact). I also could not play it using the Windows Media Player, despite what they say on the box. I'm also pretty sure this means I can't listen to this music on my phone (Nokia 6630 which plays MP3s).This would be worth buying just for \\"God is a DJ\\" and \\"Bring my family back\\", if only I could actually listen to them!

It is for this reason that I am very hungry for help with this issue. I really looked forward to getting some answers from the \\"The Francis Effect\\", but came away from it very disappointed.The first 68 pages of the book go into copious detail (some would say excessive detail) as to why we do not like to make speeches and being in the spotlight; however, the author does not provide enough instruction and explanation on how to overcome the anxiety producing symptoms of being in the spotlight. The rest of the book goes on to explain how to prepare and deliver a speech, but really gives only short shrift on how to deal with the panic attack symptoms that many of us deal with prior to delivering a speech. A more comprehensive book for anyone wanting help with this issue is \\"In the Spotlight\\" by Janet Esposito."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's Remarks","review":"I am the author, and am so happy to report that The Francis Effect is one of three finalists for a Benjamin Franklin Award for the best book of 2006 in the area of psychology/self help.

Since then, I've had more image changes than Madonna. From punk to ska back to indie rock and now everything in between- Dusk never seemed to leave my cd collection even after the great used cd trade-in of '95. I can talk for hours about how each song is a completely new mood and experience but I'll make this simple...Dusk is the most under-appreciated album in music...I feel that strongly about this album...probably the most important single cd I own..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best at Dusk","review":"This is one of my favorite albums. If you're looking for that perfect album to play in the thick of night when you're alone and drowning in your own psyche, pick this one up. It's fantastic. \\"Slow Emotion Replay\\" and \\"Love is Stronger than Death\\" are my two favorties, although \\"Dogs of Lust\\" is probably more recognizable to most people since it has been on the radio and since the beginning of that song has been used numerous times on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"In Dusk, The The have achieved yet another masterpiece.The lyrics are as usual moving, thought-provoking and catchy, the music is wonderful and varied, while still unmistakably The The and seems to flow from one track to the next beautifully.I have had this album since it was released in '93, and it is still right up near the top of my playlist. All of the tracks are exceptional, with no fillers. If I had to commit to a favourite The The album, it would be either this one (Dusk) or Soul Mining (although there are several others which are unlucky to be left off).For those of you who are The The fans who might not have this album, for goodness sake, GET IT! If you have heard only one or two of their songs and think they sound at least ok, this is a great album from which to get thoroughly addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best","review":"Although saying this is the \\"best\\" The The album, is a difficult thing to do (as all their albums are just incredible), it simply is The The at their best. If you've heard anything by The The (and like them), and you don't own this album, you're in for the biggest, baddest ride of The The yet. Other outstanding The The albums; Soul Mining and Infected. On a side note, I was *extremely* disappointed to find Amazon.com's web search failing on a search for \\"The The\\".
