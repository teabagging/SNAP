That is only because they haven't written/drawn a 'smart' movie for a long time. People are looking for another Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan,and Little Mermaid.

Those movies left good songs and story memories in the mind of at least 4 generations. Who does not know the \\"HI HO\\" of the 7 dwarfs or \\"WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR\\" ...

This is a great read because it allows readers to get inside the head of one of our most influential presidents. They get to read what he thought in his own words.This book is not just about the past. It is relevant today because of the deep recession that America and some parts of the world are in. I would recommend this to everyone but especially to people who are particularly interested in Franklin D. Roosevelt and what his opinions really were on various aspects of government and economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not all perfect...","review":"To me, this book teaches Visual Basic 6 in a friendly manner, but it lacks explanation in some areas.

And it would be able to accomplish this task in at least a \\"four-star\\" fashion if the author and/or publisher had attempted to review the code for errors and debug the code. From chapter 22 onward the code errors are so serious that one cannot run the sample program since one uncorrected error builds on another (and coding errors are simple repeated in the code on the included CD) the book becomes practically impossible to follow along by coding on your own computer after chapter 22. What's worse, the publisher does not publish an errata on their website for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Retelling","review":"A perfect story to read aloud to young children!

It is concisely and clearly set out with prayers and Bible readings for two years three times a day.

The book also has a wealth of information on early Celtic saints and their reflections on life.Highly recommended as a daily prayer book for personal or group use."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Taize?","review":"If you like the syncretism of Taize, you will like this book. The actual morning and evening prayers take up very few pages.

Jake is a deaf teen who lives on the island. He communicates using a mix of ASL and speaking/lip-reading. The dated 80s references are occasionally, unintentionally hilarious, and the writing is quite dire in some places (including some glaring, repeated spelling errors, such as confusing peak/pique). But the depiction of deafness is really well done, as is the description of ASL and lip-reading. About half the narration is from Jake's POV. Amanda is kind of a brat, but Jake emerges as a really interesting, well-rounded character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, very down to earth","review":"This is a great story for adolescents.

It is very visceral; there is a universal appeal in the directness of this music. Though the individual pieces are very different, they all share some qualities- strong rhythms, harmonic simplicity (although the out of tune piano in \\"The Manufacture of Tangled Ivory\\" adds great color to that piece), and the great sound of this group's unique instrumentation which fuses art and pop musical languages. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not von Kleist, the translation!","review":"Heinrich von Kleist was a personal discovery for me last year - I think his stories, novellas, and plays (at least \\"The Prince of Homburg\\" and \\"The Broken Jug\\" - I haven't read the others) are amazing. \\"The Earthquake in Chile\\" has got to be one of the most awful stories written.These translations are very difficult to read, however. I bought this and ended up having to go to the library for alternate editions - I don't have those books with me right now, and I haven't bought another edition, so I can't recommend which translators to get. This is just a warning. \\"The Broken Jug\\" in particular is almost incomprehensible. I suspect the problem is that the translator has translated German idioms too literally, at the expense of naturalness, and even readability.So, von Kleist, great, great, great! But beware, buyers of this particular translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Losers a winning book","review":"History, it's said, is written from the perspective of the victor.

I mean, do you really have to be submissive and helpless to be a good Christian wife?Given how much I agreed with the importance of your partner being your companion during activities you enjoy, I was disappointed with how Harley approached the activities, the solutions, and the inevitable \\"boys will be boys\\" attitude he espoused.Most of this book is common sense. Will it really affair-proof your marriage? I doubt it. It'll either happen or it won't. If you act like a jerk, you may get cheated on. If you marry a jerk, you may get cheated on.

I have now been happily married for over fifteen years. I give credit to this book for some of the adjustments we made early in our marriage.However, I must say, I clearly remember reading that a couple shouldn't do enjoyable things apart such as golfing, bowling or whatever. I, at that time, highly valued our separate evenings as a way of keeping our identities. After muling this thought over I began to clearly see that I didn't want my new husband to \\"do all his most favorite and enjoyable activities\\" without me. And vice versa.Learning to be aware of how I have the power to lift his self-esteem seeing how this comes back to me is not humbling - it is rewarding.Definitely a must read together to create a good starting point for a healthy marriage or \\"fixer upper\\" for a sick one.Debbie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"This book came in the described condition and was a great book.

Dr. Harley states that's why men marry women - not because they care or love you. It states that a woman should not gain 1 pound more or it is grounds for an affair. Dr. Harley agrees that this is normal for a man to want to leave his wife if she changes her looks from the day they married. This book is not about healthy relationships let alone marriages. The only real take about affairs is how easy it is for men to cheat so women should be forgiving and take them back. There is never any mention about unconditional love.

What about the man who decides to quit a high-paying job to do something that is more spiritually and personally fulfilling or who chooses to stay home with the kids?

He even goes as far to recommend that a husband seperates from his wife because she won't agree to diet!

If your needs aren't met, then apparently you are in a perfect position to go look somewhere else. That's not love. Marriage is about commitment and unfathomable loyalty. When your needs are met, you can attain great joy in marriage, but there is NEVER a valid excuse for an affair.

In one example he offers that people will stop substance abusing if they don't have the money to afford it. Is he nuts???!!!! What kind of counselor is this.

It was written in 1988. It was out-of-date then. My friends, men and women, got a chuckle out of the statement that married women resented having to work. Gee, married men do, too. Also, we wondered why he thought wives should look good for their husbands, but not in reverse. The story about the rich farmer was a hoot.

Dr. Harley skillfully points out how to create and maintain a marriage in a way that God had intended. I see now where Scripture states \\"My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory\\" that He will meet my emotional needs THROUGH my spouse just as God will meet my spouse's emotional needs through me. What a blessing to finally understand!I'm now prayerfully using Dr. Harley's book to see through my spouse's eyes what I need to do so that I may be the vessel I was called to be. What a difference it has made in our marriage. I see so clearly why it wasn't working before.I am amazed at how I need guidance to maintain something you would think should come \\"naturally.\\" Yet, I need Scripture to maintain my relationship with God, so I guess I shouldn't be too amazed.As I look at other reviews here, I'm saddened by how some have completely misunderstood Dr. Harley's Scripturally-based approach. May God bless you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The author did a very good job of pointing out some of the needs of males and females and how they differ. He also pointed out the need to fulfill these things in eachother's lives in a marriage situation. However, the way he presented the situations was very poor. He took a senario where a need of one of the parties was not being met and proceeded to explain that an affair developed. This is redicoulous. The message this sends is that: you have to be meeting eachother's needs perfectly and already know exactly what the others' needs are -- or whatchout an affair is brewing! That is simply not true. A marriage is sacred. It is a commitment and it is a lot of work. This should be the focus. Otherwise, the reader is left feeling like they cannnot trust their partener if they unknowingly are not meeting the others' needs. It has potential to bring some insight to couples, but there are plenty of other books out there with the right focus that will build eachother up in the right ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a rating lower than 1-Star?","review":"This book caused my wife and I to analyze our needs and have deep meaningful discussions about what we need, but we disagreed with most of what Harley had to say. This book seems to be written for men whose knuckles still drag on the ground and women who desire to be subservient to their husbands. We found it laughable that almost ANY time a husband and wife are apart they are planting seeds for an affair. A wife gets a job and BAM, she has an affair, presumably because she really doesn't want to work and resents her husband for not being able to properly provide for her. A husband goes bowling and BAM, he has an affair because his wife isn't meeting his needs as his activity partner. This book hasn't been helpful, but on the other hand, it does give us something to talk about and laugh. If you're looking to improve your marriage, spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justifies affairs","review":"I hated this book. It says quite strongly that if you're not meeing ALL your spouse's needs ALL the time, they may \\"fall victim\\" to an affair. It is a kind of emotional blackmail.

While I encourage communication about these needs, it is awful to use any shortcomings (which we all have) to justify a spouse's straying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sword of truth, right through the heart...","review":"We were given the book by friends. My wife didn't seem interested, so I started reading it. I never made it past Chapter 1. Of the five basic needs identified as essential to the man's side of a loving relationship, I came face-to-face with the realization that my wife is not meeting FOUR of them, and she doesn't really care. This book, though helpful for some, glaringly identified the problems we are having, and my wife has no wish to pursue them. So here I sit, with Dr. Harley's \\"needs\\" which closely match my own, and Dr. Harley saying these needs must be met, yet mine aren't. Now, I'm certainly smarter, but I'm also a whole lot sadder..

If you are looking for Biblical counseling for your marital problems, look elsewhere. After over four decades of marriage, I have determined that the number one ingredient for marital success is commitment. Commitment supersedes the importance of getting my needs met or meeting his needs. It supersedes the romantic feelings of love. A successful marriage means I will stay married NO MATTER WHAT.

Unfortunately, it's the same rhetoric: that men need sex first and women need communication first. Sadly, society has been oppressing the women's sex drive since the beginning of time, telling us that sex is bad (not for nice girls). I read a quote from a 16th century woman that said that a woman's sex drive was 10 times that of a man. How strange that sounds in today's world -- yet I submit that it's true, and that all the propaganda is dead wrong. Ladies, you don't need another book to tell you what society thinks you should know. It's just not true. If you are married, then cut loose!The best advice I got for my new marriage didn't need a book, since it was just one sentance: \\"Just put the other person first.\\"DO NOT use a book (this or any other) to stereotype your spouse.

Rabin played Paganini Caprices at a high level after just 3 years of training. Part of that was talent and part of that was a relentless work ethic cultivated by his mother and Rabin's own desire to play. It is this same work ethic that perhaps in this case was also the tragedy since it lead to social deficits in his experiences growing up. These are among the toughest decisions parents of talented children must make.One of the interesting findings of this biography is the clarafication of the circumstances of Rabin's early death.

In fact, it is downright skimming. This shows some poorly drawn illustrations of completed facial piercings/ear piercings and that is about it - there is no 'guide' about it.

The only person who would enjoy this book would be a somebody with no idea about tattoos or piercings.

Where does she sleep? on the floor next to the horse posters and fake plastic hedges? But they made sure she has a picnic basket! And where's the plans for the stables?

Phil's playing is stunning, very full of emotion. I would contrast his playing to, say, George Winston's by saying that Phil's playing is more intense, tighter, more musically complex. He is classically trained but has played rock, jazz, etc.This is my favorite record by Phil; but they are all good. This is not simply background music, it can be listened to closely, unlike much of the \\"New Age\\" genre.

I had already read quite a few books by Lori Wick, but this book suprised me. Not that it was a bad book, it was a great book. It was just that Lori Wick, as I had thought, was a pretty easy-going writer. Nothing extreme. Her books didn't have much action. Not that, that is a bad thing, but this was the first book that actully had a villian. Well, a mean villian. I thought it was cool that Pup was a spy. And it pretty much had everything I wanted in a book. I thought it was so interesting and fascinating I read it in abou 6 hours.(:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"This story is definitely more full of adventure than some of Wick's other books. You will be drawn in to the story of McKay and Pup and wait (and hope) to see how their resolution will come. Pup is a very stoic character at the beginning of the book, but you find yourself warming to her as the story progresses. McKay is the same solid, warm, likeable man throughout.

Are printed books scanned into ebook format and then not checked to see if there was 100% success?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorn Birds; Review","review":"This novel is one of tragedy, romance, and the undaunting human spirit. It is a richly woven tale somewhat reminiscint of 'A Tree Grows In Brooklyn'. Set in the Australian outback, it follows the Cleary family through drought, flood and death, focusing mainly on the lone daughter, Meggie. Meggie falls in love with a Catholic priest, who in turn must reject her or risk breaking his vows. It is a must-read for anyone interested in Australia, for it offers a behind-the-scenes look at the true Outback life from the 1920's right up through the 60's. I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classify under \\"Romance\\"","review":"If you're looking for a long, romantic yarn, this is a pretty decent one. The writing is quite good--you can feel the dust and heat of Australia, as it works its way under your skin. And you feel for the protagonist; you feel for a woman who has few options in life, and who's life is inevitably chained to one man or another.Although I'm very sympathetic to this position, I felt a little bit lost inside of this woman's mind, and felt that her men were caricatures, rather than developed characters. I wanted to be a part of her thinking, but this bias in the writing threw me off.In the end, after hundreds of pages and a bit too much saga, we are to rejoice that her chains have become easier. It's a little hard to swallow. I don't think this qualifies as a feminist work. I'd tell men to skip this one altogether, and advise readers that this is, ultimately, just a well-written romance novel, for better or for worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Enjoyable Read from Down Under!","review":"Read this book several years ago and enjoyed it immensly. A young woman falls in love with a kindly young priest and gradually gets him to fall in love with her. This book may raise a few eyebrows today with what has been going on in the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!!!","review":"There is no other book like The Thornbirds. How could Colleen McCullough dream up such amazing situations and beautifully in depth descriptions. It made me feel so deeply the pain that the characters themselves went through. I cried for them more than I have ever wept for myself. When I read this book I had my own image of the characters. When I saw Richard Chamberlain as Ralph, though, I thought, \\"That is not how I could have ever imagined him\\". The book described him so gloriously. Meggie became my favorite female; she was so innocent, naive, and sheltered, but always so strong. She developed greatly as she grew up, into quite a lady. I always wanted Meggie and Ralph to be together, but when they finally were, on Matlock Island, I realized that I couldn't really be satisfied with happily ever after or always apart. And that feeling the others' pain so deeply was rare, even in real life! This is the most well-written, lesson teaching, and beautiful novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's sooo Good!","review":"I'm 14, and this is really the first \\"adult\\" book I've read. I read it under the suggestion of my very rigorous Englsih teacher...and I couldn't have picked a better book to begin with. This is a story about Meggie, who falls in love with the Archbishop of Australia, none other than her friend Ralph. The reader will come to love Meggie despite her selfishness, and also Ralph, despite his choosing Meggie above God. Yet, there is a moral in this story: you can do anything you want, says God, but everything comes with a consequence. This consequence, no doubt, weighed heavily upon Meggie and Ralph as the only evidence of their love was washed away into the sea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Love Story!","review":"The Thorn Birds is by far the most beautiful, haunting and heartbreaking love story I have ever read.

I felt connected to the characters and thought the author's ability to capture both time and place was supurb; she really made the Australian Outback come alive. I truly felt the Cleary family hardships, their bitterness and secrets. However, after awhile I found it somewhat outdated. I can't put my finger on precisely what made me feel this way, but perhaps it was the unrealistic and weak dialogue that finally did me in. Or perhaps Father Ralph's somewhat obsessive feelings towards the young Meggie made me feel uncomfortable.

Read this book at home with a box of tissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I defy anybody who does not like this book....","review":"The Thorn Birds is absolutely one of the greatest epics of our time.

My only complaint is that I can read it only once for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, up to a point","review":"The novel starts out fascinating, and I could hardly put it down as I was drawn into the Cleary family's life. I felt it really lost steam in the last third of the book as Justine was not a strong or interesting enough character to carry the story. The author also includes a grossly stereotypical and inaccurate portrait of a lesbian couple later on in the book. She sure lost credibility in my eyes for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!","review":"I received a copy of this book some time ago and it's so tattered and dog eared now because I've read it so many times. I fell in love with the book once I got through the first page. The whole story is written so brilliantly that nobody could possibly get tired of the story. You haven't lived until you have read the Thorn Birds or at least seen the miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Pales in Comparison...","review":"I am not a fan of romance novels, however, a few years ago, my Mother asked me to read her favorite novel as a favor to her. She was so certain that I would like it. That novel was The Thorn Birds. From the first page, it was the most breathtaking story I have ever read. I was fascinated by Ralph's fascination with Meggie. I am a Catholic and have often pondered the vow of celebacy. There love for each other seemed to transcend age, time, and even God... Every triumph and tragedy of the Cleary family brought tears to my eyes. The ultimate triumph-of Meggie carrying Ralph's child was incredibly powerful. On the back of the book a reviewer said \\"Real Life Pales in Comparison\\". I couldn't agree more! Many thanks to my Mother and Grandmother who introduced me to their favorite book. I cannot wait to introduce my daughter to my favorite book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved this book.

I cried while reading all the way through the book. I was heartbroken for Meggie, wanting the unattainabe love of Father Ralph; and beautiful Father Ralph, loving God more than Meggie; but still trying to fight agsinst his attraction to her. I watched the mini series, too. It changed things around, and had a much different ending. The book was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Thorn Birds","review":"This book tells how to live life. Hard work is a virtue but love is the thing that should come first. The author was about 40 years old when she writing this novel but appears that she was so knowledgeable for so many fields such as farming, wars, other cultures, medicine and of course politics. The paperback version that I purchased was a little too thick as it was almost 700 page long. And the letters were a bit too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'm a housewife cum secretary for a business and have other commitments too. So I found it terribly challenging to read this book. It wasn't a book, it was like opening a door into another world - and observing the goings on in this incredibly strong character household. The only way to satisfy my eagerness to consume this incredible story[felt real] was by reading at night when the family were all asleep, then I would read until 3am or so - and wake up a couple of hours later like a zombi - but it was well worth it! You simply become addicted with these characters. You Just HAVE to read this book. Colleen is an incredible author. IT'S TRULY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN YEARS.!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a novel to remember","review":"I think someone already said that the descriptions were to long. They didn't annoy me as much as that person but i tend to agree that maybe some things didn't need to be writen the way that they were, but that pales in comparison to the storyline.Forbiden love, two lovers plotted together and then torn apart by everything imagineable, that is the type of story reader lap up, but there is so much more to the thorn birds. To give away anything to a person who has not yet read the book should be outlawed. The thorn birds is a lesson learnt in life that is worth reading to anyone. Hardships, death, friendship, love, temptation, the author chose so many good themes and she intertwined them beautiful into a novel that readers will cherish for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner but on the whole too fantastical","review":"Books like these are precisely the reason why I have decided to stick to non-fiction. The story is enthralling and gripping, but on the whole too implausible to believe or take seriously. It also gets predictable in certain parts. However, if you're one of those people who enjoy the occasional book-as-candy deal, then you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Characters","review":"I read this book when it was first published, to see what all the hoopla was about. I found the story predictable. The characters never came to life for me. They repeated their words over and over throughout life. This behavior is true of people in real life, but it's boring in fiction. This book created no sparks for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I had this CD when it first came out and somewhere down the road it got lost.

It is one of the few that I MUST sit down a listen to from beginning to end. The bass sends a soothing vibration through the air (if you turn up the volume enough) Very creative and unique. There are only a few places where you can hear defects in the recording, but if you get absorbed into the music enough you probably won't notice anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"an ideological approach to history","review":"The worst sort of \\"academic\\" or \\"scholarly\\" pursuit: one that begins with certain assumptions it endeavors to prove. Bennett has intimated on his radio show that he composed this book in response to Howard Zinn's \\"People's History\\" texts. Bennett's work is elitist with racist overtones. It is political and historical hagiography. The \\"feel good\\" history of the year. But not an honest, critical approach to the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Best American History Book","review":"This has been the best read on American History I have had in a very long time. Dr. Bennett has written, what I consider, the most balanced history book in a very long time. He treats both sides of the debate in various conflicts we have had in our history with proper respect. It should be the standard for our high school and undergraduate American History Survey classes. It is the model of how writers should treat history.I have read in another review that the material is a little cramped but given that this book is a survey of American history and not an in-depth study of all aspects of American history it serves its purpose well. I recommended for all those who are lovers of history or those who have history foisted upon them. I would also recommend this book to those who hates history. I believe it will change your feelings towards this rich subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Revisted","review":"It's been years since I studied history and this book takes it out of the hands of the revisionists and puts it back straight. Thanks Bill Bennett."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest and readable history","review":"Enjoyed the book immensely. Very refreshing to read an American history written by someone who so obviously loves this country. As grandchildren of Christian immigrants who came from Europe and from Iran with nothing more than the desire to become \\"refined American people\\", we appreciate a history which does not waste paper with meaningless self-flagellation. Our only criticism is that it was too short - would have liked to see several subjects treated in greater detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"History at its best","review":"I bought this book after reading volume II, which I also loved. History is one of my weakest areas - I was never good at memorizing names and dates and am embarrassed about my lack of knowledge. Bennett makes American history come alive. After you read it, you feel like you know the previous presidents and their contemporaries personally. There is sometimes a little repetition between chapters, perhaps that was intentional. Other reviewers said that this book reads like a novel. Perhaps not as \\"quick\\" as a novel, but it's really a pleasure to read. Both volumes were so good I would read them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"If you blindly worship Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln, this book is for you! Unfortunately, its not for me... I was very disappointed with the statist and religious agenda in this book. I gave it two stars because it does have a lot of interesting facts, but its mostly a neo-conservative view of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"America, The Last Best Hope","review":"This is a must read for all Americans young and old. The characters in our Country's History come to life as Mr. Bennett includes the interesting details that you don't learn in school. If our teachers used this book as a guide for their classes our school children would retain so much more of the key thoughts and ideals that make our Country great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial History","review":"Mr. Bennett's book is a good start for the beginning history student, but it is very superficial, and demonstrates that one cannot do a thorough job of discussing the period from Columbus to World War I in a single volume. At several points, the superficiality is extremely detrimental. For example, it glosses over Madison's changing views on the propriety of secession, fails to give the opposing view on Webster's \\"we the people\\" argument, takes a one-sided view on Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction, and sugarcoats the racism of Woodrow Wilson. At one point, the book is simply annoying. In one chapter, Mr. Bennett repeatedly uses the word \\"principal\\" when \\"principle\\" is the correct term."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last not a politically correct History but an honest history","review":"Dr. Bennett book is one I could not put down physically or otherwise. It is written in a superbly flowing manner. I have read some of the currently negative policitally correct History books and found them the usual dribble. The book is balanced and does not pick on any political party etc. I will be looking forward to the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Condition","review":"This was a great way to get the book I wanted in great condition for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixing revisionist's version of history","review":"Great read! This book corrects much of the garbage about American history that is taught to our kids in the public schools. It is an insightful, interesting book that takes you from it's discovery to adolescent America. Every parent should read this to help their kids learn the real history of America. I can't wait for volume 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Bennett is Amazing","review":"This book is a must in my opinion. I think that every student in America should have to read this at some point during their education. It allows History to escape from the drudgery of textbook pages and adds a reality and an excitement to the founding of our great nation- along with facts and stories that most people have never heard. Thank you so much, Bill Bennett!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American History Part 1","review":"As a junior undergraduate student majoring in History, I adored Dr. Bennet's book. What he proves that many historians can not seem to get right is that History is essentially a long narrative. Dr. Bennett brilliantly lays out the book in a structure that consumes the reader from chapter to chapter while containing various levels of knowledge. I have read this Volume twice and I see a possible third in the future. Why? Because what the textbooks and history professors fail to do, Dr. Bennett so cleverly fills the void. Better yet, there is no real bias in this Volume in regards to politics and he is helpful on guiding the reader to both views of politics if such a scenario existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended!","review":"The Ring of Charon is a fantastic book and I could not wait for the second part to read.

The concepts are not necessarily so far ahead of today's science (theory) that it just seems completely unbelievable. The only criticism that I have for it is that there are sooo many characters introduced and that the novel jumps between them soooo frequently that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping them straight.

He's nice to look at as well, but Secret Window is a pure disapointment. Yes, this movie begins with a classic plot and moves along rather smoothly as you become involved in the rather bizarre happenings. You begin to sympathize with Depps character but then the ending just makes the entire movie stupid!

It is also superbly acted. Johnny Depp gives yet another bravura performance as an emotionally haunted writer going through a bitter divorce who tries to escape in a lonely cabin in upstate New York. He receives a visit from a strange man from Mississippi, played believably by Brooklyn-bred John Turturro, who says simply, \\"Yew stole mah storay.\\" This sets a chain of events into place that are fascinating as the film unfolds in true suspenseful roller-coaster-like fashion. Johnny Depp has some really funny lines in his many soliloquies. Also featured in solid supporting roles are Charles S. Dutton, Len Cariou and Timothy Hutton.See SECRET WINDOW now. It is one of the better Stephen King adaptations.RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR SUSPENSE (AND JOHNNY DEPP) FANS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT listen to the \\"professional\\" critics!","review":"I am one of those who never pays attention to any critics review of a movie, after all, I'm not them, so how can they say whether they think I will like a movie? I had started to read the story by Stephen King, but stopped part-way through to see the movie so I wouldn't ruin the ending. I needn't have worried because the movie didn't end the same way. Check out the book, it's an additional treat. This movie has an excellent story, which is a writer, recently separated from the love of his live, battling writer's block and jealousy of the ex's new boyfriend, who is holed up all alone with only his dog and his thoughts in a remote summer house. What he goes through is a wonderful story and a joy to watch, and Johnny Depp plays it perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing - Depp","review":"This movie is so predicatable and gets boring after a while. Depp's acting is the best part of this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sowing Season\\"","review":"This may not be an excellent thriller, but it really was entertaining to watch. Writer and Director David Koepp gives Stephen King's novella a very nice flow and atmosphere, but it does tend to slow down in a few parts. The shocks and thrills aren't as strong as, say, the ones found in Asian horror films, but all of the gore effects make it more disturbing than shocking. The very good performances by Depp, Turturro, Bello, Dutton, and Hutton should be worthwhile to those who are about to watch this film. I won't give any details to what happens at the end; you should see for yourself.Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst kept secret","review":"I'll willingly watch pretty much anything with Johnny Depp in it. He's in fine form in this one, portraying a floundering, misdirected writer who is confronted by a mysterious and violent stranger, \\"Shooter,\\" [Torturro] accusing him of plagiarism. But even Depp's facial tics, quirky mannerisms, and off-beat portrayal can't save this movie, because I figured out the plot in about 15 minutes and spent the remaining 81 minutes waiting for the inevitable conclusion. This film ventures into the realms of Angel Heart and Mulholland Dr., but can't really win either way, and the cinematic clich��s about the hermetic, weirdo writer who can't separate fiction from reality are way too familiar and way too stale. We've seen all of this before, and we've seen it done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two solid performances wasted in this boring un-thriller","review":"There are plenty of reviews of \\"Secret Window\\" so I'm not going to rehash the plot. I'll just tell you that the movie is a criminal waste of Johnny Depp and John Turturo's talents.Turturo is sufficiently menacing. Depp is believable as the eccentric protagonist. The movie has an interesting premise -- a manacing southerner accuses a reclusive author of stealing his story. The problem is that \\"Secret Window\\" telegraphs it's uninteresting \\"twist\\" ending so early that anyone who's seen the Sixth Sense, Identity, the Others, etc. will see it coming a mile away.The ending is totally predictable, unsatisfying and not half as clever as it thinks it is. I'd have given this movie one star if it weren't for Depp and Turturo. As it is, they elevate a movie that could've absolutely sucked to a level of boring forgetability.I can imagine enjoying \\"Secret Window\\" on cable on a hungover Sunday afternoon, but it's really not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plumbing the Depp-ths","review":"I enjoyed this up to the last part, which is predictable if you're expecting the story to turn out to be a bust, but disappointing if you're expecting something interesting. Johnny Depp is splendid until the end where he turns into Norman Bates. I'm not a Stephen King fan, and this movie did not make me a convert. On the plus side, the setting is wonderful, and Depp's portrayal of a man going through the agony of divorce and self-doubt is compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, at best","review":"I remember seeing this movie before when it was called \\"The Shining.\\" I liked that one better.The paper-thin story is derivative at best. One of the story elements that I particularly don't care for is the Omniscient, Omnipotent Villain (OOV). And the OOV is definitely a main feature of this film. The \\"twist\\" is not particularly surprising, although it does show a bit of directorial flair absent from the remainder of the movie. Further, the pacing of this movie, which I'm sure was characterized by the studio as \\"deliberate,\\" descends beyond that into \\"tedious.\\"The performances can't be faulted; they are all very good. In particular, Johnny Depp carries this entire film on his shoulders. I suspect this would have been a one-star film with anyone but Depp in the lead role. However, great performances alone can't carry the entire weight of a movie, and this one collapses on the shaky foundation of its script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jhonny Depp is Mort Rainy","review":"Mort Rainy is recovering from a divorce and living in a cabin in the woods, living with an annoying maid and his dog Cheko.

No complaints about Depp's performance--although he is almost upstaged by the most annoying hairstyle since Keanu Reeves' in Prince of Pennsylvania. The real problem here is Stephen King's story-- a weak variation on Misery that might have worked as an hour-long episode on the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents but just seems absurd blown up into a mutli-million dollar feature.One giant plot hole spoils whatever crediblity the story might have had: With all the instant information retrieval available today via the Internet, why on earth does Depp spend half the movie trying to prove he published a story in a magazine just 10 years ago? Yeah, I know. It's only a movie--but it sure ain't much of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEEEEECRet Windown","review":"This movie would have been utterly terrible without Johnny Depp in the starring role. If you are seeing this movie for the first time, try not to think too much about what will happen. Otherwise, it is pretty obvious to predict what will happen.Depp plays a quirky writer who is in the middle of a divorce. He had caught his wife cheating on him. A man named John Shooter harasses Depp about plagiarism and things begin to get very violent. Depp creates an entertaining charachter out of a fairly boring role.As the plot unfolds, people die and the story takes very strange turns. Even though this movie is not the greatest, it is still a must see.The music and cinematography are good in the film. The acting is sup par besides the performances of Johnny Depp and John Turturro.

John Turturo also shines in this great psychological thriller. It has a pretty cool twist st the end.

A guy approaches Johnny Depp, short story writer, and accuses him of stealing his story. He threatens to start hurting Depp's loved ones if he doesn't rewrite the story properly. I had a hard time caring. It seemed to be so much revolving around so little, and the movie was so poorly written and predictable that I didn't care about any of it. Finally, when the big twist was revealed, it didn't make sense with everything that had happened in the movie.When the movie was over, I felt dumber for having watched it.

I really liked the twist at the end, and even though you will think that you've seen it all before, you should not come out feeling disappointed with it.

The people who liked this movie must be very patient types. I on the other hand was bored to tears. Did I say this movie was a bore? I like Tarantino flicks and movies like \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"Johnny Depp is a great actor, no doubt. And Stephen King has written some good scary stuff. Add the music from Philip Glass and what can go wrong?Well, basically the problem is that this is really a quite short story that could be told in thirty minutes. And even as a short story, i's quite forgettable. (Stephen King has written some boring stuff too.)Depp plays a slightly paranoid writer who, living in a cabin while he is getting divorced from his wife, meets a man that accuses him of plagiarism and if I tell you anything more I risk giving to much away since there aren't too many things happening in this film...About one funny scene, never engaging or exiting - let alone scary - it's not worth you while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep This Window Closed...The Flys Are Getting In","review":"Oh, my, my, my, my. Johnny Depp in a quirky role. Who would have guessed? It is a shame to see good actors in a very predictable plot. Not much suprise here. In the first 10 minutes you will figure out this \\"gimmicky\\" movie. I'm really tired of these gimmicky movies. What ever happened to straight out suspense and drama, well written thrillers with tight direction? This is slickly produced, looks real good. Eye candy as it were. Nothing much else, a real disappointment to say the least. You'll get more suspense from a Pay-Less Shoe Store sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp, sexy as ever!","review":"I love this movie, it's one of my favorites! This movie is based on a short story by stephen king. It centers on a wrighter, Mort Rainy who is recently divorced. One morning He is approached by a strange man who claims that he stole a story of his. Mort thinks that this guy is just some crazy fan...until strange things start to happen...Great movie and great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny can't save this movie","review":"Though short, Secret Window still felt dragging at times. Its a weird type of movie where nothing really makes sense yet you know exactly what is going to happen less than halfway thru. Nothing is really a surprise here. I don't even know what genre to categorize this film into. Its not a horror nor was it really suspenseful. Its just sort of an annoying and unnecessary film, lacking in charisma and a real plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"johnny depp saves this movie","review":"*spoiler* Secret window is part of a great movie,the only thing missing is a better ending.That doesnt sound fair to the movie,I do like it but something doesnt feel right near the end.It has the same problem \\"identity\\" has,no way you can figure whats happening until they spell it out for you.it feels forced on you.I still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny Depp and John Turturro owe me $20 bucks!","review":"This was, by far, the worst film I saw in the theater last year. Just plain awful. Slow and ponderous, with Johnny Depp sleepwalking through his role even as Turturro chewed on the scenery in a performance that was unintentionally laughable.They owe me the 20 bucks I wasted taking my date to this steaming pile of dung."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of all time!","review":"\\"Secret Window\\" is without a doubt the best movie ever made! Johnny Depp( my future husband) was fantastic as Morton Rainy( what a cute name)! is a writer who gets accused of playgerism by John Shooter. How can he even accuse Johnny of that?! He is a sweet man and so freakin handsome! They should have changed the story line to Johnny and me getting married on a warm summers day and having a beautiful life together. Lots of kids named after us. How wonderful?! One day i am gonna marry him. You just wait and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it when stars make it to the A list...","review":"Why is it when stars make it to the so called A list, they get involved with horrible films? Johnny Depp is probably my favorite actor of all time. If you want to see some of his great work, watch Jim Jermarsch's (spelling) Dead Man, this was a great western or the 9th Gate another great film.But back to Secret Window, this movie started off very well, however it became very predictable Shortly after the stranger shows up. I knew where they were going, but I hoped I was wrong. I thought \\"Please don't go there.\\" But of course they did and that as they say is that. The acting in this film was excellent however so it gets 2 stars, but I really could not recommend anyone wasting money renting it. I hope JD doesn't stop appearing in great works. I'd like to see him work with Jim J again and also David Lynch, but that will never happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed a secret","review":"This movie has one redeeming quality, well two. Depp ain't bad and the ground level premise of the two stories \\"The Secret Window\\" being similiar ain't bad either, but beyond that, what we have here is a monstrous mess. Whoever cast the role of the Mississippi 'guy', the townsfolk, the maid, the sheriff, etc., should now be unemployed. Awful acting, hammy, and anything else you can dream up that is b-a-d. Extras? When a movie is this poorly made, who cares. I found my local rental store has this movie miscategorized, it should be under comedy. If you are still looking for a 'new' suspense/horror movie on par with the Ring, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone possibly say this movie was even decent?","review":"First off, I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan. I own the majority of his movies, ranging from Pirates, to Edward Scissorhands, to What's Eating Gilbert Grape. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen with him in it. None of the characters are likable and the story not only drags but is also predictable. I really wish I just had never seen this movie, not only because it is such a disappointment Johnny Depp actually could be associated with something so horrible, but also because I feel like I was robbed of an hour and a half of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved this movie. Watch the Making part on the dvd after you watch it and then watch it a secod time. It is cool the effects they used to show reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I saw the personality problem coming a mile away. How many times are we going to do this story? I bet you this would have been a great read but the movie was predictable. Johnny Depp was awesome as usual of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet surprise","review":"While I wouldn't exactly call this movie suspenseful or scary, I really enjoy watching it. I think what makes it most enjoyable for me is the acting. Johnny Depp does a fabulous job as writer Mort Rainey, and John Turturro gives an unforgetable performance as well. The two of them hold the movie together for me.Don't see this movie expecting to be glued to the edge of your seat with your heart in your throaght, jumping out of your skin at the slightest noises. I also don't think that there is anything new or innovative about this particular film. What you have here is something that is quite nicely done acting-wise, especially if you enjoy Johnny Depp's and John Turturro's work, and moves along well. I'd call it a quiet surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous...","review":"Great movie. While most would say that its great because of Depp, i disagree. It would have been good with another actor.Story is about a mystery writer (Mort) who is going through a divorce. One day he is confronted by \\"a man\\" who says that Mort stole one of his stories and created it as his own. The man's threats become violent, killing people of whom which Mort is looking to for support. The story leads you to believe that you know exactly what is happening, but gives a sudden twist toward the ending that changes the whole story.It is a marvelous story, well explained at the end, and good acting. Highly recommend it if you like psychological movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it all before","review":"These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie until.....","review":"I was riveted...I was staring at the screen with my mouth wide open during this film.....BUT...then I got to the end. I won't spoil the movie for you by telling you what happens, but I will say that if you want to love this movie, shut it off about 15 minutes before it ends. When you watch the ending, you will be as surprised as you were with The Sixth Sense...but not NOT in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I loved Secret Window. It was one of the better movies that came out this year. Like all of Johnny Depp's movies it was different in it's own way. He isn't afraid to try things that most actors would never do. That's what makes his acting awsome. I thought the movie was hilarious, I've read the book Secret Window and it followed pretty closely. In the movie Mort Rainey is by himself most of the time. It's hard to keep an audience intertained when you are alone. Johnny Depp did an excellent job on keeping the audiece captivated.I took my brother to see it and he usually doesn't like thriller-type movies, but he loved this one. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp's acting I highly reccomend you see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it all before","review":"The only thing this movie has going for it is Johnny Depp. Other than Depps performance there was nothing going on that I had not seen before. The whole thing wreaked of \\"The Dark Half\\". To further the feeling of that movie they even had Timothy Hutton in it. The trailers for this made it seem like it was going to be a roller-coaster ride full of chills, spills and screams. Well, it was none of that. There was some anxious moments that never turned in to much of anything. The ending will not surprise or shock you. The only thing shocking was that I was so excited about this and then let down so horribly. Had it not been for Johnny Depp this would have been one of the worst movies of all time. He could make toilet cleaning interesting which in itself would be scarier than this flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Window","review":"This movie is worth renting but not buying, and even then renting it for a dollar, maybe. The movie has weak character development excePt for Depp's character. You would think that by now no one would dare do a remake of the Shinning or Fight Club,but guess again. This movie combines both, not in a good way. I have to admit the only thing that kept me from turning it off was Depp's ability to play a great character. For all of you Depp lovers, his performance is great but its like watching a Captain sink with his ship.

I mean..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking Thriller","review":"'Secret Window' is without a doubt a fantastic movie that was based on probably the most proclaimed horror writer and acted by the greatest actor. I was skeptical about the movie before I veiwed, but I was hooked within the first moment. 'Secret Window' is a film masterpiece that builds all your empathy and pity for one character and then throws a twist that will leave you guessing until the end of the film. Johnny Depp's best performance since 'Pirates of the Carribbean'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Window, Secret Garden","review":"A vivid, gory movie, based upon a short story by Stephen King called \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden.\\" Johnny Depp plays an actor haunted by a strange southerner who claims that Depp's character has stolen his story.This is a bizarre movie with a lot of twists and unnecessary blood and violence. It is easily forgettable; many of the twists that do happen we've seen before in such films as \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" et. al. There seems to be no plot here, just a load of trashy moments that are meant to be suspense-filled. \\"Secret Window\\" capitalizes on Depp's fame to garner a lot of box-office revenue. The movie's biased view of Southerners does not do it any credit, either.With trash such as this floating around, there's no wonder that Depp fans instead turn to more lucrative films such as \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" for a more enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Window","review":"I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp AND Stephen King. I wasn't expecting this movie to be so... CORNY!!!! Muahhaha ha hahahahaaahhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shining. Light. Real light.","review":"Not sure why they bothered with this one. First of all, the story is so similar to The Shining,but without any of the things that made The Shining so great. King was either fresh out of ideas when he wrote this one or he was working on a tight deadline .... Anyway, Depp is great and the only reason to see this film. Bello, Hutton and Dutton have extended cameo roles that allow them to really do nothing. As the \\"surprises\\" are revealed they become more and more obvious and less and less interesting. Why bother is the question that comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Johnny Depp did a great job with the character (s) he played. But the movie is pretty slow and boring until the crazy ending. I find it hard to believe that they rated this movie PG-13! Iv'e seen R rated movies that didn't have as much blood and swearing in them as this one! Now parents will be angry after they show their kids a movie that should have an R rating! As for the movie, somebody definatly needs some psychotherapy. Movies like this are only making society crazier!

The viewer gets a little frightened and questions \\"Who is this creepy guy who is claiming that Johnny Depp stole his story?\\" But once you find out the ending, you just might want to run back to amazon.com in a rage and return the movie. Their are plenty of other movies that are much better. Do not waste your time or money on \\"Secret Window\\". It disappoints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp Does It Again!","review":"I have been a fan of Johnny Depp since his days on \\"21 Jumpstreet\\" and so my review may be a bit biased. I mean, the man could've spent the entire movie lying on his couch and I still would've given the film a 3-star rating. Okay, I'm not that obsessed...*laughSome have complained that the film started out a bit slow but I disagree. I believe the beginning actually helped build up to the plot and Johnny Depp did an excellent job of carrying his solo scenes.John Turtorro was excellent as the villain, Shooter. Very creepy!Excellent ending, also. If you have any doubts about purchasing the movie, my suggestion is that you first rent it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"only losers talk about johnny depp","review":"I don't know why you all would get on here and dog johnny's performance, he has alot of things going for him and he is very hot, and very sexy.

As usual, his acting was inspired. Unfortunately, his character was great, but the plot was a little thin. There have been too many movies with the same twist in the story. About half way through, I had guessed the ending and the only thing left to carry my interest was Johnny's superb acting.This is probably the only Stephen King story where you are left feeling sorry for the \\"bad guy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not Johnny Depp's best.","review":"Fine, and somewhat scary film that has a another good performance from Johnny Depp but is very predicable in certain scenes, and the ending is much to be deserved. If you see it, see it for Depp's performance but I suggest you wait for video instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another King Film","review":"Just seeing the preview got me hooked on this film. I can't wait until it comes out. I've read the short story: Secret Window, Secret Garden and I must say I was impressed. I haven't seen it yet, but the film appears to follow the story of a writer who's just survived a nasty divorce only to find himself accused of plagarism and fighting for his life against a stranger calling himself John Shooter. That's how it is in the book. Hopefully they'll keep the shock ending intact, because it seems to be that no matter how hard they try, King films always fall apart near the end. Maybe this film will finally break the screen and clear King's name from failure to blinding success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Window","review":"I went to see this movie with high expectations and usually, when i do that, those expectations are not reached. This time they were.Every scene in this movie includes Johnny Depp, so he had to convey all the emotion of the movie, and single-handedly draw the audience into the story. He does this very, very well. He brings out all the idiosyncrasies in this character and does a good job of getting the audience to sympathize with him.The director did a good job in his storytelling also, having just the right amount of suspense to keep everybody interested until the very end.That is the most important part of the story: the ending; and this one has a good one. This ending is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie overall","review":"Johnny Depp turns out a pretty good performance in this movie. The best thing about Secret Window is the slow build-up.

The whole film could have been a little more sinister and a little more frightening. Even John Turturro, who usually turns in a stellar performance in whatever he does, did not have a real presence in this film. I bet he did all of his scenes in one day and them left. I got the impression that Johny Depp did this one to pay the rent. They could have done a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH A LOOK","review":"\\"Secret Window\\" is better than the trailer you saw on TV indicates. Don't want to give away too much of the plot, but there are some surprises in this movie that actually keep you on the edge of your seat, should have been R instead of PG-13. Johnny Depp's performance is much like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", a reasonably intelligent individual with a little neuroticism mixed in. John Turturro, outstanding as usual, this guy deserves more leading roles, he rates an Oscar on his shelf someday. Perfect example of a Rental movie, you enjoy it, but don't want to keep it. Give it a look, Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than what i expected!","review":"Secret Window is one of those movies that not many people with like or appreaite. Its not action packed nd its not non-stop bloody killing. It's a movie about a writer(Depp) whose losing his touch because he is having a divorce with his wife. He's living in a cabin by a huge lake with no one around for miles. A man shows up claming that he stole \\"his story\\". After that meeting everything goes further than it should. In the beginning it starts a little slow but graduly gets more and more suspensful, even with a little comedy along the way in prime places. The ending (thats all the matters)is very well done and climactic. Some scenes may be a little disturbing, but all in all it's a very good movie.It's true, Stephen King is the master of horror books and movies. I recommend anyone who enjoys things by Stephen King should buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical Stephen King...","review":"While all the actors did an excellent job, I found this movie slightly boring and predictable.

One of the reasons I have always loved Sister Hazel is for their unique sound. For this album, \\"Lift\\", it seems they abandoned the classic sound and entered a time warp back to the seventies (if they even made it there).

I was still able to use it for the one time event since I didn't have time to order a 3rd one, but overall I was bummed because when plugged in it really does look like a real flame.

They are, as others have said, the quintessential accapella group of all time.This collection is fantastic. It showcases their talent very very well.However, it really doesn't do them justice. In all honesty it would be very difficult to choose which songs represent their talent and collect them onto a single CD.Therefore, I think a two CD set should be compiled... but wait.. a three disc set would be awesome! What about a box set???Okay... I think you get the picture.For anyone who loves Accapella or Doo Wop, this is the group for you. There truly is no other group out there to compare them to. Once you listen, I am sure you'll agree.They are polished, practiced, synchronized and harmonized to perfection.

Naturally, the crowd was eager to hear the Temps again--so eager that people started to boo the relatively unknown, mostly Canadian Nylons when they first appeared onstage. But, by the end of their performance, the crowd gave them a standing ovation. \\"The Best of the Nylons\\" includes the group's reditions of several \\"oldies,\\" with imaginative arrangements, and some outstanding original compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"If you are looking for a great vocal album, look no further.

Unfortunately, the guides are all by different authors, and vary widely in the quality of their content. I've bought four of them so far, and this one is the worst of the bunch.The Texas book is a \\"Blue Highways\\" (i.e., off the beaten track) guide, and contains descriptions of fascinating places that you're not likely to find anywhere else. This one, on the other hand, is no better than those free tourist guides that you find on racks in pancake houses and cheap hotels.Mr. Dunn is both unimaginative and lazy, and this book suffers from it.

I keep waiting for that moment where the novel leaps out of my hands and inappropriately exposes itself in a dark alley to my fragile mind. Perhaps my expectations were to high, with a name like \`flesh unlimited, surrealist erotica' one would expect sexual acts from the deepest parts of the mind, unhindered by social-taboo or even personal-unconscious-censorship, things that perhaps aren't even physically possible but are some sort of \`conceptual-art-sex-act.' I've read more titillating sexual accounts and fantasies in \`seventeen magazine' - which by the way I highly recommend.If your looking for something \`new' don't get this, or \`the Torture Garden' by Octave Mirbeau - that's a pretty over hyped one too, it would have done well to STAY out of print.

This book provokes disgust.This is a crude pornography written by a talented person without gag reflex. Yes, talented. This is why it is so pictorially repulsive.

One would think a BATH thermometer would be waterproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy - bad thermometer","review":"This worked great for the first few weeks we had it. My daughter loved to play with it and it read the water temp pretty quickly. Then the clear glass/plastic window that showed the temp got water inside so when it was warm, condensation built up inside it making it impossible to read the temperature. I had to let it air dry at least a day to be able to read it again - but it would fog up all over again anyway. But at least the green/red light worked.Then a few days later, the battery would go on and off - probably because water got inside. Sometimes it wouldn't turn on at all, sometimes it would turn on (if I banged it on the counter a few times) but then turn off shortly after.This was useful, when it worked for a few weeks. But it's better as a bath toy (an expensive one at that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It... While It Worked","review":"This is a great idea. I love the blinking light - it's so easy to see. It's small so it's not cumbersome in the infant baths. It also has auto shut-off which is ideal. The problem is that it's not waterproof and it broke within a week of use. Obviously this is a design flaw as many other reviewers have had the same issue. I actually came on here to order another one, figuring that mine was just faulty. Such a shame because I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be nice if the batteries lasted longer","review":"The thermometer works great but the battery life on this is very short and of course it's a non-replacable battery. The batteries last for about a month and a half before they start not displaying the correct temperature and dying. Seems like alot of money to spend on a thermometer with such a short life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't replace battery & not waterproof!","review":"Was great until it got water logged & the battery died and the battery couldn't be replaced.

What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea.","review":"I bought this before my boy was born. We used it for three months daily. It developed condensation inside it and quit working. I really liked it until that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous! Cute, but not safe for baby's tub!","review":"This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature. In a tub full of ~100 degree water, he consistently read 72-74 degrees. Tried resetting, no luck. If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp, I could have really scalded my kids. Cute, but unsafe, unsafe, unsafe. Returning it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly useless- buy only if you want a plastic turtle","review":"Worked for a couple of weeks then, as per numerous other reviews, the battery ran out.

Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but broke after 3 months","review":"The battery died, and it appears you can't change it. Also, it looks like water leaked into the part where it displays the temperature. It was cute and fun for the baby while it lasted, but now we need to find something else that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I purchased this when my daughter was born and it worked perfectly for about 6 months. It was accurate and dependable. The battery died and they are not replaceable! I ordered another one on Amazon and couldn't wait to get it. I received it and the new one didn't even come on, battery was dead. I returned it and exchanged it for another one figuring must be some fluke. The next one I received was dead too! I sent it back for a refund and bought a new tub with temperature strip right in it. Perfect! Great little item if it worked but not worth the trouble and you don't know how long it is going to last you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 uses...","review":"It seemed like such a great concept- and then after the 3rd use it got water in the digital read out and no longer worked!Since it is supposed to be waterproof we are not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but useless","review":"Mine didn't work from day 1!

After reading other reviews I decided to get a refund rather than exchange it - by the sounds of it very few of these don't break after a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Does Not Last","review":"We got this as a gift. Our baby started having a weekly bath from late Aug & then twice weekly bathes late Sept & in the later part of Oct we started daily bathes as part of our baby's nightly routine. It is now one week into Nov & the battery has died. This is totally unacceptable & even more so given that you can't replace the battery! Not sure what we will do but definitely won't be buying another one. I certainly would not recommend this. We have all been ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery dead after 8 weeks, irreplaceable","review":"It is a nice thermometer and worked fine, but given the battery is not replaceable, it's not worth to buy it.Ours lasted about 8 weeks. Additionally, the glass window started to steam up after 6 weeks. (may be that was the root cause, but anyways, a bath thermometer should be sealed properly.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great as long as the batteries do.","review":"We used this almost daily for over 2 years. It is easy to read and use and my son has loved it as a bath toy also. It is durable and well constructed, but the batteries cannot be replaced. The first sign if the batteries going dead is the green light will cease to function. (It actually still works, but is so dim as to be useless.), then the yellow, then the red, then about two weeks later it is completely dead. We are having a hard time without it, as the other backup thermometer we have is a chemical strip and very hard to read. I would recommend buying this from a brick and mortar storefront, just because if it has been sitting around for a while and the batteries are dying/dead you can easily exchange it. If the batteries were replaceable it would have gotten 5 stars with a doubt. I do understand though, that it is difficult to make a safe and reliable electronic item that is designed to be fully submersible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Little Toy.","review":"My wife picked up this little floating thermometer for our baby's bath. The attempt was to get and keep the temperature just right and to serve as a cutsie-poo toy that might interest the baby. So far, he's shown no interest in the toy aspect, but it has worked well with the temperature part.The colorful little floating turtle can be turned on or off and gives a digital temperature readout. In addition, it has three little colored lights, or actually, one light with three colors: Yellow is too cool, green is just right and red is too hot. We keep the water running throughout the bath and rely on the colored light scheme for temperature control. It has worked very well.We've only had the thermometer for a month and it has performed flawlessly. I'm surprised at the many negative reports. We've had no problems. I hope ours continues to perform well. I'd give it 4 stars from our experience.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd times a charm??

I use the pump in a small 1/2 wine barrel pond with an old style well pump. The head height is less than 24\\" and the pump only runs 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the evening. I'm pretty careful to keep the screen clean so as not to overheat the pump. My fourth pump failed yesterday. It has only been in operation since June of 2008. The good news is, it was a warranty replacement for the previous pump that failed in the exact same way. Teh bad news is they will not replace a warranty replacement. The pumps are \\"potted\\" so they are not servicable and must be replaced when they fail (throw aways). I would advise against purchasing Beckett pumps as the seem to keep failing the same way and at about the same time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"keep in milk crate","review":"The intake tends to clog with this pump.

It failed today after running almost continuously during that period. Our fountain is three tiered with a 4\\" fall spout. The top of the fountain is about 30\\" above the pump. The total volume of water in our fountain is less than 20 gallons. We're very pleased this pump lasted 4 years and will be purchasing this same unit as a replacement. The waterfall is outside and the sound of the pump is imperceptible.

Nothing a sharp knife wouldnt solve. I set the tubing up to the pump, dropped the pump in the water, plugged it in and out came the water on the other end. No hicups, no struggling. Very quiet motor considering its size. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the inability to adjust water flow. The speed you get is the speed you get. For most applications this is no big deal, however Im using it on a custom made reptile waterfall in my house and now I have to try and manualy disperse the waterflow accross the surface to control the path of the water (its power is causing the water to hit the rocks and shoot across the enclosure like a hose).

This aquarium is in our Healing Room, so the soft sounds of the flowing water is very soothing - no distractions at all. We have a different pump on our 125 gallon aquarium that is ALWAYS noisy, distracting when we're trying to watch tv in our living room despite having surround sound.Kudo's for a perfect pump for our application :-) I recommend this pump for any under tank overflow filtration system in the 50 - 125 gallon range or small ponds / waterfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"beckett 210 pump; didn't last long enough","review":"Mine lasted 1.5 years.

And every time I hear 'Early Morning Range', I want to find a cool, shady spot under a tree to relax and dream.

Now, I will go back to the beginning of the book, and I know that all the information is there for the taking.

I was disappointed that the ball was not the shiny green color it looks like in the picture, it is actually a pearlescent paler green but still not bad. Originally the ball blew up to only 50cm, but it does indicate that the ball will grow over the first few days. Basically over the course of the next week, by sitting on it and stretching it I was able to get it to about 60cm but it was still smaller than advertised and way to small to use as a chair for a person who is 5'8."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"This ball is very difficult to get inflated all the way.

Her sister died but Corrie lived and was alive when the video was made and actually spoke about what she did at the end.This is a story of true love; not in the romantic sense, although she did fall in love with a Jewish man and they married, but in the sense of risking her own life to save the lives of many children whose only \\"crime\\" was being born Jewish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Inspiring!","review":"You will not regret purchasing or simply viewing this movie.

This is a true story of Corrie Ten Boom and her family's journey to hell after trying to keep a small number of Jews during WWII and how her faith kept her both alive and from harm--even when terribly tested. World Wide Pictures spared no expense on this one and the money spent shows. The picture spares no punches--there is violence, blood, and all the horrors of the camps.

My eyes were opened even more by this beautiful movie to a time that as a country and world we should never forget, lest it happen again and again.

What is most amazing is how Mr. Howard became friends with many of the stars that he covered. This is obviously a testament to his own personality and his ability to connect with stars as people and not just as Hollywood names.

Certainly, this list is not so short: at least three of my college professors were rumored to be.... Enough of that, though....This work takes a simple premise and expands on it to explain processes that at the outset seem contradictory. Organisations exist, in economic logic, to seek either economic rent or ideological satisfaction. Olson in this book works through organisational logic and explains group behavior in a clear, concise fashion. This behavior influences economic performance and politics at all levels.Moreso than other books which in part relate to the same areas (including Olson's the Rise and Decline of Nations and a few by Douglass North) this is THE key text for this issue, and a must read for anyone who is into political economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look at political stability and the economy","review":"Olson uses economic rationality to explain the creation of stable social/political organizations.

He didn't.Borrow the book from the library, read it if you like, but don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYABLE READ - WELL WRITTEN","review":"This was a fun read and I admit to enjoying it cover to cover. I love folk lore, food and the region in which the story took place. The author's character developement was good, the story moved well and was not only entertaining, but informative. There was obviously much research that went into this one and it shows. The story did have some twists and turns but not the sort that were so unrealistic that it made the story bad (like so many books of this genre suffer from). Note to author: I have to say that the character of Andrews was one of the most annoying characters I have ever encountered in fiction. That being said, the character of Andrews did work as I suspect that is how and why you developed him. Had he, Andrews, be a guest at my house, he would have been packed on the first flight to Atlanta after the first evening. All in all, I enjoyed this one and do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got bored of this game","review":"I got this game from my brother as a gift.

While it lacks the wonderful, in-depth story and character development of it's successor, it more than makes up for it with arguably the best gameplay in the franchise. Sure, the final villain is possibly the series lamest, but who cares? Building up your abilities via the then-revolutionary take on the job system is an absolute blast.The only other negatives are the fact that some of the jobs are borderline completely useless. Either way though, the game is well-worth the price of admission. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 2D Final Fantasies","review":"Great game. No other game in the Final Fantasy series gives you so much freedom to develop your characters. Through the job system, you can design each of the characters however you like, and modify on-the-fly.

It has become the official soundtrack of our family's Christmas time.It's incredible how Tuck Andress brings freshness to age-old tunes like God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen or Silent Night; his rendition of such a commonplace tune as Jingle Bells is as un-commonplace as you can wish. And what makes it most incredible, at least to a would-be guitarist as myself, is that he played all tunes live in studio, with no production at all!

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is very entertaining, but more so for its comedy than for its fight sequences (though those are pretty good as well). I must say that after watching the first, I instantly watched the second. Watching the second picked up almost exactly where the first one left off, making both movies being in the collection much better for fans. As to the plot, fairly basic, an emperor, plot at assassination, and someone caught in the middle. The real reason to watch this is the comedy, a very old school style, slapstick, physical comedy, and some low brow jokes, but all very funny. While I wasn't aware of Stephen Chow before, I must say this makes me interested in pursuing his other work.

I like a good zombie flick like the next horror buff. But I will not excuse this movie's weaknesses merely on the basis that it is a B- Movie. Even though this is a low budget film the viewer still expects to be mildly entertained. This film was just downright atrocious. George Romero's movies were made on a very low budget as well and they turned out to be cult classics.If a movie is low budget and the acting isn't the greatest than it should atleast beef up on the writing and plot. This movie fails miserably at that. I don't understand how anyone could give this a five star rating not unless they were brain dead or trying to mislead someone into throwing their hard earned money on this waste of time film.Sorry, but this film is a low blow to the zombie horror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, terrible, awful, cheap, I hated it","review":"Need I say more?

And on top of that, there were points where one of the Z-list actors disappears for a whole thirty minutes and reappears as a zombie and you didn't even see him get attacked in the first place.I don't even have to tell you that the acting was horrid or the budget was low as you can tell that by the title of the film and the fact that there were only about 8 zombies throughout the whole film.To sum up, this movie was a hot \\"surface of the sun\\" mess that should have never graced the markets of Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read This!!!","review":"This is a pretty lousy movie. The people who gave it 5 stars have to be the makers, others who participated in it's making, or their mothers. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's in the same 'hood. The blooper out-takes are so much more entertaining than the movie is. The story is an uninspired \\"life in da hood\\" story, but with zombies, to make it more marketable. These guys deserve some credit for the effort, and the basic story idea could make a good film, but this ain't it. It does have a few decent moments, especially in the second half, when it gains some momentum, but unless you're willing to look for the best in this pathetic, mostly amateur little movie, don't waste your money or time. I got it for a penny, plus S+H and lost a mere 90 minutes of my life to watch it. I'll chalk it up to experience and move on with my life now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unwatchable zombie movie","review":"This movie is absent any production values, is missing good lighting, and the acting is very poor at best. I don't care how low budget a movie is, if the viewers can't SEE it then how can they like it. It looks like it was shot on someone's home video. There is no spit and polish to give the impression that any effort was made on this film.

I couldn't find anything in my local stores so I decided to try my luck on-line. I found this product and couldn't be happier with my purchase. We have a regular bathtub/shower combo and this fit into one of the corners nicely. The suction cups have never come loose and it holds a lot of small to medium sized toys.

These movies are good for putting in an ordinary TV set and watching them while dusting. The sound tracks are unimpressive as well.Also at least three of the CD's have flaws that cause the movies to skip and loose track or not play at all. You will have to fiddle with it.

Besides the collection's title, there're other minor hits like \\"Restless\\", \\"He Wants My Body\\", & the Prince-like \\"It's So Delicious\\". In fact, all the upbeat songs on this collection are good. The last 4 tracks are ballads (though \\"What You Been Missin' is med-tempo & is a great duet between Renee Diggs & Ernesto Philips; may they both rest in peace). The only ballad I personally found to be a dud is the closer, \\"Till the End of Time.\\" Diehard fans of the group may disagree, but it's just not my cup of tea.For Starpoint fans or those seeking electric funk from the 1980s, this is a steal at just $6 (retail price)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great find - after serching for any CD from this group.","review":"I was very happy to find this cd, and a lot of other choices still available to purchase for the group \\"starpoint\\"....I was actually looking for 1 particular song titled \\"Till the end of time\\" and wound up with a fantastic cd which had a lot of other hits I had forgotton they also sang....thanks [...] for catering to a vast list of artist, music...old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to Use If You're Used to a Windows Machine","review":"I used this computer for a high school graphics arts class.

This book further explores demonic activity an the occult. It also provides examples from various case histories. Fr. Amorth spotlights a topic that gets little, if any, exposure in the Church today. If you're curious about what can be done to combat the devil, read this book, and its predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful book","review":"I found this book to be forthcoming and very insightful. There is no sense of \\"playing it up\\" for dramatic effect. It is a very straight forward book. Everyone should own a copy. It makes us realize how close evil/satan/demons really are. So often you find people who do not believe in the devil. After reading this book, how could you not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced account of demonic activity","review":"I picked this book up, having had difficulty swallowing his previous book, which seemed to me to be over the top. For whatever reason, I was able to take this one a lot better, particularly as Fr Amorth takes care to ground his ministry in the activity of Christ and of his Church in the new Testament and in sacred tradition. What was most convincing was the large extract from a talk given by Paul VI in 1972. In that famous talk, Paul VI is quiet clear about the activity of Satan and notes the dismay one feels at some of the temptations presented to us (Amorth called this Satan's ordinary activity)Amorth's book is important to remind one of the cosmic battle between the Church and the Prince of darkness but it would be wrong to reflect on it too much - however, a reminder from time to time is essential for balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Have","review":"This is another must-have for the student of demonology. Written by the pre-eminent Vatican exorcist, this book, along with his first book, provide the reader with a basic break-down of obsession, infestation, and possession, the methods of dealing with these issues, cautions about the occult, etc. Well-written and edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired and boring.","review":"Very disappointed in this CD. The pianist is uninspired and the arrangements are boring. The flute player and the vocalist add nothing to the project. I decided to buy this because of the one good rating it had.

Had I seen it I would never have purchased this book and will never read it to my 6 year old son! It went from suggesting eating your dinner quickly to wiping a dirty jar on your close to cutting holes in a jar lid with scissors quietly so your mom won't catch you. One of the illustrations shows a boy holding scissors wide open with his hand on the inside of the open blades. I would never read it to any child and think the message is just horrible. Yes it is fun to catch fireflys but I know this could have been done better without the dangerous suggestions and disregard for listening to adults and being careful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"This story is such a great one that brings me back to a simpler time when kids would go outside and catch fireflies (instead of being on some type of electronics). He grabbed a handy, dandy mason jar and caught as many as he could. At the very end, he struggles with the decision to set them free.Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I love this book! It has a simple, beautiful message. It brings tears to my own eyes every time I read it. I use this book to teach my 7th graders to write a critique. The illustrations are excellent and add to the magic feeling the descriptive words in the story captures. I am looking forward to reading this with my daughter in a couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to see a scary realistic film?","review":"The Torturer is about a military interrogator Rick (Andrew Walker) who has some serious problems with post-traumatic stress disorder. He sees a psychotherapist (Nichelle Nichols) in an attempt to patch up his psyche. This film comes across as a psychothriller, with some unexpected plot twists, that kept my attention on the screen. One thing I appreciated about the film was the \\"film noir\\" feel of many of the scenes. Both Walker and Nichols give stunning performances, and Mahsa Masoudi is a rising star to watch for. I'll watch this film again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Movie","review":"This is a boring movie, that just seems to run for forever. Although the idea was certainly not a bad one, the implementation & acting was downright aweful. After some 50 minutes of it, I had to give up because nothing worth noting was happening; the torture seemed to go on indefinitely, while the victim kept insisting that she had nothing to do with the terror organisation that she was accused of by the interrogator. ironically, one seemed to get the idea that the interrogator was the real terrorist, as he seemed to like the torture sessions far too much.All in all, its a movie not worth wasting ones time for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ornamental Palm Horticulture - Best book of its type!","review":"The authors give good, solid often overlooked advice on growing and maintaining healthy palms.

A best buy for anyone in the industry or just a strong interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ornamental Palm Horticulture","review":"A pure technical book, great for the farmers of palms. Everything you want to know about palms but not a palm's identification book. This book have only a few photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Palm Horticulture Information","review":"I found that there was a great deal of information on possible diseases and disorders of palms. However, my main disappointment was on the real lack of information on types of palm trees and the type of soil and climate needed. I would have liked to have had more information on the cold resistant palm trees. There was hardly any information on the species of palm trees. I found much more information just surfing the internet on palm trees than what I found in the book. I think that I could have made a much more interesting book if I had done a compilation of information from contributors off the internet! I either will sell the book as used or utilize it to assist in recognizing possible diseases or deficiencies. It would have been nice to have had more information on rare palm tree distributors of seed and/or plants as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited cultural information","review":"This book is an attempt to guide those interested in palm horticulture. However, finding that palm horticulture varies widely between the species, I found this title a disappointment. Some palms can't take iron for instance, but the authors neglect to give specific information on those species which would be helpful. The same applies to those palms that need iron. As a general guide, the book is ok, but if you really need to know how to care for your exotic and rare palms you may need advice from the local botanical garden or a nursery that specializes in growing palms to determine the nutritional requirements of a specific genus."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Comprehensive Treatise","review":"Brimming with detailed, useful information on all aspects of palm horticulture."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my favourite book 10 years ago, it still is.","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was quite young and it became my favourite. Ten years later, and thousands of books later, it maintains it\`s spot at the top of my list of the best books I\`ve ever read because it clarified \\"freedom\\" for me when I was a kid and it still does today.

I love the mythodical ways in which Hays describes the love of the game, regardless of your religion, race, gender or nationality. It doesn't matter who you are if you play ball you're just another ball player. The arkansas reds provide a place for all to belong to and that is what gives the story a sense of loyalty. Most of the players know that this is there one chance to shine and they live it up! I love this book because it shows the many ideas that are common to everyone but know one ever stands up and says. This books creates a voice in which all can be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hot item all athletes should read.","review":"The Dixie Association is an excellent book. It constantly has new twists and turns, some expected, some not.As an athlete, I feel all athletes should have the same attitude as Hog, the main character. He is not playing for the money, but for the love of the sport. Now days, professional athlete feel they deserve a huge sum of money just to play a game they played for free as little kids. I think all athletes should read this book for a new perspective about the games they love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball and beyond.","review":"This was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Although the story is played out in a baseball environment, you really don't have to be a baseball fanatic or even a sports fan to get caught up in the drama and exicetment of this novel. The main characters are all well depicted and they each have conflicts they must resolve both on the baseball field and in society. There is a quagmire of underlying themes, and you can't help but become intrigued with at least one aspect of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quiet = not cool","review":"I don't know why they call the low fan setting a quiet/bedroom setting. That thing is loud! My much larger 5 gallon hunter humidifier is much quieter than this thing. It also does not shut off when the water runs out. It happily keeps on blowing. It would be nice to have a smaller humidifier that still has the nice features. I didn't want to buy a huge humnidifier for the small room that I need it for, so I got this one. Aside from the noise and really having to keep an eye on the water, it works fairly well. The pieces are dishwasher safe, which is nice if you use your dishwasher a lot (I don't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automatic shut off doesn't work","review":"Contrary to the product description, this humidifier does not automatically shut off when the water is empty. Also, unless positioned properly the holding tank will dump all the water (on your floor). Not as loud as other small humidifiers but louder than the larger TrueAir model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"This humidifier is horrible. The thing is loud!! Yeah right it has a quiet mode. Also, the water container does get everywhere. The water leaks out and makes a mess. Also, the filter has to constantly be changed. If you use the filter while your child is sick put the humidifier away for a month you have to get another filter. You cna't really feel any mist coming out and it doesn't shut off automatically. I returned this humidifier and got a comparbly priced one from Vicks. It is not that loud, granted none of them are quiet and the water container is big and the filter is reusable for more than one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended- ruined our hardwoods","review":"This humidifier leaks every time we use it.

I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO LOUD","review":"Thought this would be great to use since the water tub goes into the dishwasher. I never liked getting out the bleach and vinegar to clean my other one. But this one is SOOOO LOUD!!! I don't mind it too much since it will put me to sleep but I can not hear my children over the loud hum of the machine! I like to hear them when using this so I know they are comfortable and not getting to the croupy stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"I am so happy with this humidifier! My son got a cold and immediately after we started using the humidifier his symptoms cleared up. And if you are only using it in a nursery or small bedroom, get this one instead of the 4 gallon tank. The tank only has to be re-filled every 24 hours, and the filter has lasted us 3 weeks so far. Replacement filters are not too expensive($5.99) and can be found at BabiesRUs **Be sure to rotate the filter...you'll get more use out of it. As far as sound goes...I don't know about other babies but my son has to have some kind of white noise or else he's waking up to just about anything, we keep it on the low setting and it works great. It's a little noisy on the high setting, but nothing you can't sleep through. Overall I would highly recommend this product to any parent or expecting parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-Leaked twice on my hardwood floors!","review":"I bought this humidifier for the dishwasher safe feature, however was unable to put it in my dishwasher because I use \\"jet dry.\\" It leaked on the hardwood floors (twice). In addition, the filter only lasted about 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me","review":"I went through about 6 different filters in my two year olds life and this one has been the best. It is easy to keep sanatized since you can throw the dome and tray in the dishwasher and the humming noise helps my son sleep through the night. He even turns it on and off himself. It is easy to refill and replace the filter and the filters are inexpensive (about $6). It will leak if you move it with the dome on, quite a bit, but if you take the dome off it will be ok. I have put a towel under it on occasion from transfering it. And it won't turn off if the water is empty but I don't want it too and run this emtpy in the summer just for the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mist Was Harmed In The Making Of This Unit","review":"Hamilton Beach has started us all down the slippery slope by using \\"mist\\" in the name of a non-ultrasonic humidifier. That's already alarming, but I already knew this was a filter-type. (Rest assured, by the time the filter's grungy, the only available replacement filters will be for newer models with slightly different filter dimensions.) Reviews indicated this unit is reasonably quiet, but like most import units, it has a small, overworked fan that makes lots of turbulence, and therefore lots of noise. On the flip side, that urgent little fan does move quite a bit of air, and the unit is built very solidly. Even so, if I had it to do over again, I'd spend a little more for a fanless model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!","review":"I think this is the best book I have ever read and I purchase it off and on because I am always giving it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE OTHER SIDE OF THE \\"REAL MUSIC\\" LABEL","review":"The year was 1994, and a new company called \\"Real Music\\" joined the New Age/World Music scene.

The adaptation of materials found in nature along with the practicality of clothing in different regions provides interesting reading for hours. Anyone who thinks all Indians dressed alike in drab buckskins or adorned themselves or wore their hair alike needs to read about the skill and beauty involved in making their wonderful clothing and jewelry. It would be nice to see more photos and some color pictures, but it is still a great book! My only disappointment is in the choice of the word \\"costume\\" in the title. Go to any Pow Wow and you'll see today's Indians cringe at that term as it implies dressing up as something they are not. \\"Regalia\\" is their preferred term for their outfits. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We bought this book hoping to learn about American Indian costumes. What we got was a brief summary on each tribe, nothing much in depth nor nothing we had not known before. We were hoping for pictures. There are very few pictures of Indians in costume in the book. The best picture is on the cover. If we had seen the book before we bought it, we probably would have passed on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encyclopedia of American Indian Costume","review":"This book is very informative, with detailed text describing Native American costume, but more illustrations would be helpful. The few illustrations that are included are not always reproduced well, possibly an artifact of working with more-than-a-century-old photographs.

Which is strange because \\"Clockwork\\" is *the* outstanding ensemble piece from early Windham Hill, and his previous all-solo-guitar album rivalled his marvelous debut for strong music & technique.

The westside of LA distinguishes itself with astronomical prices which shock those of us who live on earth. I speak as one of the few earthlings who live in this part of town.When the guide says that the baby clothes made by Fred Siegel are reasonably priced, that's a definite sign that this guide is only for the affluent and has an altered sense of reasonable prices.The preschool list is helpful, but again, this list ONLY covers the westside of LA.

E.g., the section \\"Selecting the Target Server\\" (p. 140) shows me the \\"Select Target Server\\" dialog. BUT HOW DO I GET TO THAT DIALOG? This is typical of the book.

This camera is a piece of crap. E18 errors which means your lens extends and wont go back in or the reverse. Canon is ignoring the problem and thier customers. This usually happens when out of warranty, 2.5 years. They say it is due to it being droped, sand in the lens, the moon in retrograde, whatever. My camera was well cared for never dropped looks like new and the problem occured. If you buy this camera its like a throw of the dice that it will happen to you so prepare for another 150 bucks to fix the problem, or buy a brand that stands behind thier product. I heard that there are a couple of class actions in the works over this issue, I hope they succeed, I am going to see if I can join the class and get my money back. And if you think it is random, my friend had the same problem with one of the A models. Its not, it hapens to most canon cameras. do a google search for E18 before you buy this hunk of junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out loving it but now I miss every shot","review":"I have had this camera for almost 3 years and at first I just loved it. It's very easy to use - very intuitive and all the buttons, etc. are located in an easy-to-use way. The BIG problem I've had with this camera is that the shutter speed has become slower and slower. Now I miss all the good shots because after pressing the button it takes almost SIX seconds to actually capture the shot. With kids, dogs, or any kind of event, really, it's just impossible to capture a moment as it happens. My poor kids are tired of hearing me say \\"Smile and hold it..... hold it.... hold it... hold it... wait....okay there's the picture\\" I loved the camera until this happened so I'm upgrading to a new Canon, the IS870."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready to Get Inspired","review":"This is a great DVD that will just flat-out inspire you to take your double bass playing (and overall playing) to the next level.

I enjoyed the fact that speakers were from different countries, I enjoyed the topics of conversation as well. The course also points out which phrases are used in what part of the world , such as Spain vs Latin America. The only downside was that one of the conversations on the CD is Not in the book, and that there were not more CDs and more topics and conversations. I would love to listen to more of this course, but it's only a 3 CD set . It's very good to hear people in normal conversations with all of the flaws that we have when we speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Well...the English speaking is hard to understand, and the phrases to repeat are very long.

Those things were mostly lacking in \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" and \\"London Bridges\\", which also featured big terrorist-oriented plots more suitable to a James Bond movie than a crime series. I'm glad this series is getting back to more realistic antagonists, and paying more attention to the trials and tribulations of Alex Cross. \\"Cross\\" is unapologetically a well-crafted piece of mainstream thriller fiction, and I think you'll enjoy reading it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fast ride.","review":"Once again Mr Patterson has given us a look into the life of Alex Cross. There is something that has always made this character endearing. Could it be the relationship with his children or the way he allows his Grandmother to guide him when he needs it. Then of course there are the bad guys that he has to find and stop. With the help of his ex-partner John Sampson he opens up the old wounds created by the death of his wife Maria as it seems that her killer has once again entered his life. I really enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"From the beginning when reliving Marias death, to the end, when you know more is to come, Patterson keeps the reader riveted. With 'The Butcher', Patterson has added, what seems to me, the most violent thriller yet to the Cross series. Highly readable and quick to finish. An overall satisfactory entry to this series.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb James Patterson","review":"This book, like the many Alex Cross books before it, was excellent. Can't wait to continue reading the Alex Cross saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campy Cross","review":"I am a fan of James Patterson. And I am particularly a fan of Alex Cross. I have read all of his Cross books and despite my disappointment in this book, from continuity issues to campy movie cross references. I reached a point at which I said enough already, give me the money shot and stop torturing me. This was the Alex Cross book for the initiated, we already know the history of the Dragon Slayer. So you can jump right into the water. Short chapters make it easy to turn pages. But, once you got your feet wet, you realize you should have rolled up your pant legs first. It was free money I am sure JP knew it. Probably ghost written. And still I will read Double Cross. Not out of any adolescent respect or honor. Mostly out of habbit. And like cigarettes, a habit I should probably break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, absolutely terrible","review":"I'm half way through this and I'm scanning like crazy. Can't wait for it to be over! No wonder Patterson's chapters are only 2 pages long -- there's no substance, the story is fragmented - totally lacks cohesion.Didn't care for some of his others either -- cookie cutter templates that lack credibility and substance. I think Patterson is way past his prime for writing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to read all night!","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. I expected a can't put it down read as with his other Alex Cross books. Usually I finish within three-four days but this one took me over a month.

I am so disappointed in Patterson for writing such tripe that I have made up my mind to go on to other authors who deserve to be read and I have now given up on Patterson.

This is by far the worst James Patterson book I have read so far. It is all over the place and you keep reading because you keep waiting for something to happen but it never does. It is very very predictable and not nearly as exciting as his other books. I would NOT recommend you waste your time with this book but maybe read some of his others such as The Honeymoon, Beach Road, Beachhouse, Lifegaurd, Kiss the Girls, or The Quickie. (there are obviously more that I have not mentioned here) The point it, this particular book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross","review":"Great book.

The story is well written, and nicely suspenseful, but the thing that really stands out is the audiobook production. They have some really top-notch talent voicing the various parts, and the action is augmented in critical parts by just a bit of music here and there. This is done so well that it really adds to the listening experience. This one gets a very high recommendation from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What pile of steamy dookie","review":"\\"Along Came a Spider,\\" \\"Cat and Mouse,\\" Kiss the Girls,\\" and \\"Mary, Mary\\" are my favorite of the Cross books. I've been very disappointed with the recent adventures. I finished this book today, and was again disappointed. I think Patterson is lazy these days. His writing is just vague. My expectations were high before I started reading, \\"Cross.\\" Patterson stated in an interview that this was the Cross novel to read. What a liar.I just picked up Double Cross today at the library because I want to know where Alex cross is going. If I read the same kind of story line, I'll never read an Alex Cross novel again.My advice, don't buy the book. That's what libraries are for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This is my first James Patterson book, and I won't be back. \\"Cross\\" is so poorly written, I am unable to read it. \\"Cross\\" reads like the product of a junior-high \\"creative writing\\" exercise, padded with extra words and full of exclamation points, so the reader will know this is the exciting part! The characters are less than one-dimensional, if that's possible. The story is childish. How does this level of writing get published, or find an audience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did I hate this book?","review":"Was it because half of the sentences ended in a question? Or perhaps because the author had the nerve to insert multiple product placement ads? Maybe it was the unrealistic situations, poorly developed characters, ridiculous dialogue, cliche-ridden Cross kids and Nana Mama. I think that at this point one of the kids from the novel has a more evolved vocabulary and can construct better sentences that Patterson!!! Do not waste your time on this tripe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow! That's all I can say. This book is the worst thing I have ever read. First of all, it is written on a third grade level. Little words, large type, 2 page chapters - just like my son's reading books!Second, even for a fictional piece, the story is totally unbelieveable. This guy goes around killing people and nobody seems to notice. He kills two people in a hotel, he kills a person in a busy city square, he has a shootout with two thugs on a baseball field and nobody see or hears anything? And, he seems to be the only competent \\"bad guy\\" in the book. Everybody else makes a mistake and they get killed. It's like watching Die Hard. The bad guy shoots a hundred times and misses and the good guy shoots once and kills five. Was I reading the script for the next Austin Powers movie??? There might be more but I could only get through half the book before I got sick of reading it. I kept reading and reading hoping that it would get better but it just got more and more ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man's book","review":"I bought this book for our book club.

I read Kiss the Girls years ago, but not enough to remember if it was good or not. With reading all the success that J Patterson has had, I thought he must be great!I was so, so wrong. The book was boring, flat and all over the place. Most of the book is just scattered and random, jumping from one unimportant point to another. There was so suspense, no thrill. The characters were completely flat, and I found that the backstory was completely missing from some very important parts. How did Cross get another kid? Where did HE come from? That would have been nice to know.And then, it all got worse at the end. Terrible!!! I will never read another Patterson book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I couldn't wait to pick up this book and starting reading.

After that the plots are far fetched, the writing is choppy and I started not to care about the characters. It feels like Mr. Patterson is just cranking out books without regard to the quality of writing. For example - pg 136 in \\"Cross\\". \\"He turned out of the stairwell - and it all went wrong in a hurry!\\" Is that even a complete sentence? Also, how many writers use exclamation points in their writing? Maybe I am nit picking. I do like to read some books as \\"candy\\", but I do expect a certain level of writing even from those types of books.

The plot is good, but not Patterson's best, and Alex remains the hero we all expect him to be. Patterson continues to develop all of the recurring characters and their individual relationships with Cross and each other. Again, the plot here could be better and the ending seems to jump up on the reader quickly and is almost too abrupt. Overall, however, I rate this a very good read and it just keeps me coming back for more with Patterson/'Cross."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome crime thriller love story!","review":"Alex Cross has done it again!!

Patterson's style - three page chapters always ending on cliffhangers - gets old very quick and simply does not allow for the type of more elaborate plot that many readers (myself included) are looking for in a crime/thriller novel. Agreed, there is a lot of action, but it's all simply too straightforward, predictable and shallow. This was my first Patterson and I'm not coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book would be worth reading... Mistake!","review":"This may be the 'shark jumping' moment for Patterson and the Alex Cross series.'Cross' is a disjointed mess, with cliched antagonists (Irish vs. Italian mobsters), and slower than usual pacing for a Patterson novel.The plot never really gets off the ground,or engages the reader. I felt as if I'd read it all before. There's no real payoff for the story's 'hook'(Who killed Cross's wife?). Even the numerous interludes with Cross's Nana and kids aren't enough to sustain the action during the slow points. Other reviewers have already commented on the worst aspects of the story. I won't beat a dead horse.All that's left is a book that Patterson must have sleepwalked through, and a teaser that only makes me realize what a waste of time it was to read this book.I'm tempted to 'Cross' this series off my list. I have to wonder if the 4 and 5 star reviewers read the same book I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I'm a James Patterson fan, I've read every Alex Cross book thus far. This has to be the worst. The plot, the characters, I just was not really feeling it at all. The storyline was weak, especially with The Butcher..the ending was super predictable. I say the next book let Kyle Craig finally escape from his padded cell and bring on the action....I could have skipped this book all together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, ending very weak!","review":"James Patterson is overrated. The ending of the book is so weak and like someone else already said, very predictable. I prefer other writers with more depth and knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Patterson dissappointment","review":"I was introduced to Patterson in the summer of '06 with Beach Road. I literally did not put it down from cover to cover. Every one of his books I've managed to get my hands on since then has been the same; intensely engaging throughout the book all the way to the bombshell twist at the end. I never fail to wake up my boyfriend when I sit up straight in bed, gasping at the newest surprise ending. While Cross was average in keeping my attention; I was not enthralled. The book ended on such a predictable, mundane note, I don't know that I'd go back to the Cross series. I'm excited for 6th to get back to the Patterson I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross - Not even phoning it in","review":"Perhaps I just don't get it, but this is possibly the worst mystery novel, if not novel, I've ever read. I vowed a couple of Patterson books ago that I'd never waste my time with his work again, but it was there at the library and I broke that vow and wasted the time. Compared with Lescroart, Connelly and Block, this fellow is below zero. (Unfortunately, Amazon requires at least one star. Even it's undeserved here.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed","review":"I am a huge James Patterson fan and have thoroughly enjoyed just about everything he has written. So it was with great excitement that I waited for this book. It was a huge disappointment. The suspense and plot twists we've come to expect were not there, and there was way way too much graphic violence for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best alone","review":"Dropping the nursery rhyme titles is no big deal for the Alex Cross series, I'm just glad Patterson has given us another Cross mystery. He is definitely at his best writing as a solo author. The novels coming out of his \\"Mystery mill\\" with co-authors are, for the most part mediocre, weak and not very interesting, so a new Cross mystery is a pleasant reward even though by using two and three page chapters and large print the book is heavily padded to look more formidable. The good part is \\"Cross\\" can be read in one or two sittings. From the way the book ends, with a minor cliff hanger, it seems that Patterson may already be working on another Alex Cross. His books are not great works of literature but rather pure entertainment, well plotted with interesting characters and odd ball bad guys. Read it for fun, but don't expect a lasting reward, they are just sweettooth treats for down time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real yawner","review":"This is my first and probably last Patterson novel. For all the books he has writen, I thought he would be a clever, witty author. I found the character to be very shallow and the plot line, while gruesome, very predictable and trite.

The author has a natural way of making you guess to help build the suspense of the book. I personally give this book a 4 star rating because I couldn't put the book down and read the book in about 5 days. I do have a passion for suspense trillers and Patterson has that ablility to put out some good suspense trillers books wise. It also has an ending I didn't expect because I thought I knew the killer but I was wrong.

However, those go by quickly and you're right back to the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"JP does it again. :)","review":"One great feature about Cross is that you do not have to read the other books in the series to enjoy the story. As usual, JP creates so much suspense and excitement you are finished before you know it and cannot wait for the next one to be released.In Cross, you learn about Alex Cross and what happens to his first wife, Maria, which in turn allows you to understand the evolution of his life. In addition, you meet Michael Sullivan, one of the worst antagonists in Alex Cross's life.Other than feeling slight disappointment when finding out what happened to Maria's killer (because I felt it was just thrown into the story for closure), Cross is an electrifying tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross","review":"I was curious to listen to this, my first book on a Playaway, an iPod type listening device of a single novel. This was cool! 7.5 hrs continuous, stopping starting at any point. I stuck with this story to the end and am so mad at myself for the totally waste of time. The content is brutal, not exciting or suspensful. The writing is cliche filled, name dropping to appear contemporary and stupidly improbable! I'm annoyed at authors who write just to fill pages, ensnareing readers (listeners) with nonsense. Don't even want to dwell on a review other than to advise, skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Placement???","review":"I dont think I have ever read a book with more positive references to commercial products. He must have received a nice bundle of cash from Mercedes, Duncan Donuts, Au Bon Pain, etc...

Not the best Alix Cross book by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing the way He used too.","review":"Finally, Patterson is back to writing the way he used too.

However, I'm already waiting for his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I read this before?","review":"I wanna start by saying that I am a diehard fan of Patterson, especially the Alex Cross series. This book however, seemed a little vanilla. I liked the potential it had with Alex searching for his wife's killer. I liked the \\"Butcher of Sligo\\" as the featured serial killer. I did not like the flow this book took. It seemed kind of confused as to where it wanted to go. The revenge or closure for Maria's killing still doesn't feel like it happened. I'm used to being shocked at some point reading one of Mr. Patterson's stories, and this one didn't do that for me. Was it a quick read? Yes. Was it one of my favorites?

I enjoyed the film version of Kiss the Girls.Second, I looked forward to reading the latest book on Alex Cross.Disappointment sums up how I feel. It was if Mr. Patterson was sleepwalking when he wrote this book or he did it just for the money. (Which is what Eddie Murphy said when asked why he made Beverly Hills Cop III).The suspense was lacking. Of course, when I think of Alex Cross, I picture Morgan Freeman. Well, there was a scene in the book where Alex Cross and his family was eating at a restaurant when a musician stopped by the table and told an inside joke about Morgan Freeman.This was not his best efforts. Of course, hundreds of thousands of copies will be sold of this book. I think a better use of your money would be to buy Kiss the Girl on DVD and order a pizza. You'll enjoy that experience more than reading this boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea...lousy plot","review":"Ugh..Patterson creates many characters throughout the book you would expect him to somehow tie back later. This does not happen. The book is plagued with non-essential dead ends and over development of characters. Patterson has a great mix of condiments for a good book, he just does not have any recipe for them. During the first half of the book I was expecting twists and turns that would take me reeling, but what I got was a background on characters that rarely intertwined. In short, the book's plot was as thin as the Butcher's razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it but only liked it (a little) .....","review":"I was excited to read \\"Cross,\\" as I had read two of James Patterson's earlier works, and enjoyed them both. However, I was pretty disappointed with this one. While I thought the book was faced-paced and the plot moved quickly with all the action (murder, rape, murder, rape, murder, rape, etc.), I found the writing quite bad and even laughable at times.I also felt there were a number of details that were never explained, such as where his youngest child came from? Perhaps I would know that from reading his other works, although if one were to pick up this book as I did without knowing the main character, such details should not be overlooked.Overall, even though I did enjoy certain aspects of this book, I have a hard time recommending it. If you're a fan of serial-killer, suspense-type, action novels, you may enjoy this one, although you will have to look past the writing style a bit to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that was one awful book","review":"Did a 4th grader write this book?

A friend gave me this book and it opened my eyes to the amazing gift I now had: time.Too often we forget time is as valuable as (sometimes more valuable than) money, especially when that our time comes with expertise. Since reading this book, I have started using my retirement time as a gift to my family, my community, my church, and myself.

This boot ages extremely well, and wears in much more than other boots over time. There's excellent ankle support, and the uppers are amazingly resilient. The soles wear well also--I can't complain. I've taken these boots to Alaska, Hawaii, Arizona, Minnesota, and other places, in all sorts of extreme weather and they've worn remarkably well.My only complaint is that the boots aren't the best for individuals with high arches.

Teens do not suddenly snap into violence, there is a reason behind. If this book was written more from Brig's point of view, showing the reason to why he got to this point rather then just saying he didn't like her, it would be much better. Rollo and Candy followed their friend without thinking of the consequences, Brig had the actual reason. She did a good job showing Valerie's emotions, but other then that, there were too many holes for me to enjoy this book or actually say it was an accurate description of teen anger.

It shows the lurid reality of sexual assault that many young women face today. Simply because she was an outcast,Valerie was singled out for harassment. But you get to look into the boys' minds,too. I sympathized with Rollo,which I couldn't do otherwise. He was a nice guy who jumped on the bandwagon. He stupidly kept annoying Valerie with phone calls,but he did try to apologize. Although your friends might do something that seems fun,it's not always prudent to join in.In this case,someone was hurt by it. Although the book does give moral lessons,it was fun to read.

I used to get Quiet Please earplugs, but they stopped selling them at my local store, so I looked online. These are better than the Quiet Please earplugs, which get squished down fairly quickly, and then don't mold well to ears.

The lowest setting makes a noise that is not overly obtrusive - does not keep you awake.She has had it for two months now and nothing bad to report. She speaks so highly of the unit that almost all her relatives want one. One aunt said she was ordering three. I was initially considering getting one with an ionizer but it seems that the ionizers do not work for very long on many models. At 49.99 with free shipping from Amazon it was a bargain.

It is implied that you will always throw the ball the same. No mention of synthetic lanes, I guess a little out of date.

My favorite track is the underated Chiquita which should have been the single, not the rehash of the Shangra-La's (sp?) Remember(Walkin' in the Sand). Other album highlights include Bone to Bone, Think About It and Mia (a true rock ballad that puts their later putrid ballads to shame).If your a new A-Smith fan get Rocks, Toys in the Attic, Get Your Wings and this one and find a great American rock and roll band at their peak.

It describes Porter's 5 Forces, the three C's and of course the four P's but you can get that in any marketing/strategy book.

This is the only dissatisfaction I have ever had with Logitech, and I'm sure I'm not going to let one cam ruin my faith in Logitech. But for those looking for a webcam, stay away from this one, it really sucks.I would highly recommend Logitech 9000. I bought this particular cam for my desktop approximately a year ago and use it daily. It has great video, mic is clear on both ends, very easy to install and use.

But currently, they're unusable because we're having a particularly icy winter. He'll still use them--when it thaws, but still cold--just not as much as he hoped.

She plays it in her classroom and the kids love it, too. Along with Emmylou Harris' Light of the Stable and David Grisman's Acoustic Christmas, these never leave our player during the holidays. Those who love this will also love Evan Marshall's CDs.The musicianship here is superb. The tone of the mandolins seems to be the perfect way to perform this favorite holiday classic. The music is light and cheerful; at holiday gatherings it makes a wonderful backdrop without overwhelming. Yet it also stands up to an audiophile or the most discerning musician really enjoying every nuance.

I have to confess that Mr. Craughwell has at least one in there that is fact rather than legend. \\"The Hall of Tortured Souls\\" about Excel 95 having a Doom look alike Easter Egg hidden within it. I remember reading that one 13 years or so ago and, since I was using Office 95 at the time, I checked it out. I saw that one with my own eyes so I know it is fact rather than Urban Legend. Most of these are so way out there though as to be hilarious. There are several great legends though that have just enough ring of truth to them to make you wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urban Legends:666 True Stories that Happened to a Friend or a Friend of a Friend","review":"I thought this book would be perfect for my nearly 15 year old granddaughter who requested short pieces to read. I thought the stories would be funny and a bit bizarre but the first one she read had to do with a sexual act and she just looked at me with horror. \\"Grandma, I don't think I can read this.\\" Upon going through the rest of the stories, I realized that many of the subjects were of a sexual nature, okay if that's your bag but not appropriate for young adults. Back it went to Amazon and by the time I paid for shipping to and fro, I lost half of my money. Moral, if you aren't familiar with a book, go to a real bookstore and check it out before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime set in superb landscape","review":"This little thriller is set in one of the most beautiful, but least known places of Austria, the Weinviertel. Polt, a police officer in a very small village where people know each other, is forced to investigate the cause of death of a vineyard- owner. He died in his cellar (the typical lower Austrian wine- cellars built into the Loess) of bad gases due to fermentation. Strange thing is: There is (and was)no wine fermenting in his cellar, so Polt has to search where that gas came from and if there was eventually a murder taking place. Komarek, also author of landscape descriptions, marries his experience in that matter with a crime story and a lot of interesting people, but sometimes is a little bit on the clichee-side. A good summer read and remember to buy Austrian wine for that occasion: You'll get to urge for it, when you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREENBURGS GUIDES","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THE MODEL LIONEL TRAIN COLLECTOR GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT EACH CAR THAT HAS BEEN MADE FROM 1901 TO PRESNT IS VALUED AT HIGHLY RECCOMEND"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Information","review":"I needed to know about old Lionel train sets, both what pieces were offered and what they were worth today, and I found the descriptions in this guide excellent.

The superficiality of this book was a great disappointment. Here's what I got from this book: childhood was nice. School was hard. Italy was pretty. Parish life was fine; but the Troubles were hard.

Angela finds a remote place along the sea and it's there that they are greeted with a ghostly menace.the rest of the story continues at a good pace and kept me in suspense until the final startling conclusion.different from the usual romantic suspense (m.m. kaye, elizabeth peters) but just as good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low tech fun for everyone","review":"I love Louis Cat Orze. It is one of the best games I have ever played. It is an old game and the production is a bit old-fashioned, but it has been fun for both kids and grown-ups. Even the boys have liked playing this game even though there are no shoot-em-up sequences and no flight simulators. It is a history mystery that teaches players about French history during the time of King Louis the Fourteenth at his palace in Versailles.You have to learn a lot about King Louis's time in order to earn money and buy your way into different places to find clues. The clues help you solve the mystery. After playing Louis Cat Orze, I knew more about Versaille and King Louis the 14th's court than my friends who are from France!Whatever you do, listen to the advice that Louis the Cat gives you and have fun with this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable how much better this is than an Altoid","review":"And it's a little, independent company unlike those gigantic multinational conglomerates!

Study this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Crown would call, \\"No wisdom, only information\\".","review":"This book is a mix of good and some bad. This book should definetly be a prime choice for any fencer. Unfortunetly, Gaugler likes to be wordy a lot in his book, and therefore is not what some would call \\"reader friendly\\". In fact, the book is so unbelievably wordy, it scares away many potential readers. The enormous, unfriendly graphs and charts dont help either.The book does not go any deeper than mere mechanics, while some would consider it good, since it means also keeping out the bias and the complaining, it also means no reviewing of the mental side of fencing, which can draw a lot of potential readers away.Bottom line: The book should definetly be bought, but if you want to go a little deeper into fencing thought, go get yourself one of Evangelista's books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated material, not useful for vast majority of fencers","review":"The material in this book was presented in at a well ordered, brisk pace, if only the information was useful to the modern fencer. The section on foil is obviously the best (the book being old-school italian style), but lacks any training other than bladework. The epee and sabre styles are little more than additions to foil, and are not representitive of current national and world style. The lessons are poorly laid out, only being useful if the person has taken lessons from a coach before, in which case the book is mostly useless. There is no mention of footwork exercises anywhere in the book, a condemning mark in my opinion. This book may be useful to a fencing historian, but anyone looking to improve their game would be better off (lacking a coach) going to tournaments and talking to other fencers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Point","review":"I tried very much to understand the points made in the reviews of those who liked this book - sorry it doesn't work. What a shame that Dr. Gaugler has squeezed the \\"life\\" out of fencing and made it into an academic project. It just isn't so. I'm convinced most books on the sport do the same. But what do I know - I'm just an athlete trying to compete..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for modern fencing","review":"This book has little useful information relating to the modern sport. Absolutely NO attention is paid to the rules, concepts of right-of-way, or direction. The book spends all its time on the mechanics of movements with no attention paid to tactics. Furthermore, figures are sparse, and few illustrations are present to detail the evolution of the movements. The book uses the Italian hand positions rather than the easier to understand and more prevalent (in my experience) French numbering. Too much attention is paid to relaxed, exhibitionist movements rather than the overall goal: to score touches and win. Finally, the preference for all things Italian is excessive and unhelpful with insufficient translation.This is an excellent book for those not serious about or have no interest in competition. Do not buy this book otherwise as it is useless to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best study of the Italian style of fencing available.","review":"Reading William Gaugler's excellent volume on the classical Italian style of fencing is like studying the workings of a finely crafted clock. All the pieces fit together nicely. Nothing is out of place or extraneous. His methodology is that of a true master of his art. It should be mentioned, however, that even though his approach is purely Italian in nature, there is much to be learned by students of the French School as well. Any student of fencing, any teacher of fencing, would benefit from reading this book. If you fence, it should be in your library. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"simplicity made stunning","review":"As in other Philip Aaberg recordings, the piano style is simple, yet profoundly moving. The melodies of these powerful movie themes are allowed to manipulate the background harmonies in a way that the essence of the theme always predominates. ( Oooo- that sounds SO pretentious!!) The choices of material will cater as easily to music lovers as film lovers, as much of the material comes from the rich source of independant and foreign films. What a treat to hear a performer pay tribute to CINEMA PARADISO, MY BRILLIANT CAREER, OUR TOWN, and other films which realized the dream of melding film with music. This is my absolute FAVORITE Aabeg recording.

It is a return to guitar rock after the Buttholes last album, which was bogged down somewhat with too much electronics. There are even some moments where the guitar really gets going and I am reminded of some of Paul Leary's finest work. Unfortunately, after 4 or 5 listens, I still can't recall any of the melodies. \\"Jet Fighter\\" from the last Buttholes album is better than anything you'll find here. It's pretty tame and forgettable. The production sounds a little too clean. And as for the lyrics... Superman gets really good weed? It's a long way from \\"I saw an x-ray of a girl passing gas\\".

My issue was with a new cedar gate in our driveway that they kept taking a break on and leaving big messes.

It's been only a few weeks yet this seems to be doing the trick for a safe and low cost approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woot!","review":"Great product, great price. Is affective in keeping large amounts of birds from congregating in the large tree near my house. Also deters the neighbor cats from jumping over the fence at the gate (immediately under the owl).

Doesn't look fake or out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Owl don't fly","review":"I thought maybe this thing would scare away the squirrels that are eating acorns and making a serious mess in the backyard, notsomuch. Rather than go through a lengthy process mounting Owl I just stood him on the porch overlooking the area in question, by mid-day he was face down in the yard and 5 feet away was mister squirrel going about his business as if to mock me. I didn't want to resort to violence but none of these gimmicks ever work, shame on me for trying this.... more shame on you if you don't heed the warning.By the way I gave it 2 stars because my 2 year old grand daughter loves the thing, maybe I'll teach her how to throw it at squirrels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't impact the pigeon's presence in my roof","review":"The Owl looks very good, close to the real thing.

We have had it for just over a week, so perhaps they'll catch on but so far the pests are gone.We hung the owl using a long loop of thin wire. This results in the owl moving very slightly in the breeze and it's being perched on thin air. We know this is not owl-like or physically possible but the pests don't and maybe it's exactly the movement that makes it particularly effective. In addition, I have installed 4 small ceiling hooks around the yard and have moved it every two or three days and plan to continue doing so.The rabbits being gone is a bonus. We got this to shoo the birds away from our table and barbeque. We also got the inflatable snake for the rabbits (and, if needed, for the birds). But the owl has taken care of both. The snake is still flat, in the box, in the garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tame","review":"very nice plastic owl, would scare me in the dark, but doesn't scare any critters or birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"our school's mascot","review":"Though this was sold as a garden item, I purchased it to use in the main office of the school where I work.

The fact that this event marked the UFC's 10th anniversary made the effort all that more pathetic. The only remotely interesting fight on paper is the heavyweight showdown between Ricco Rodriguez and Pedro Rizzo.

Well, you'll know within 13 or 14 degrees what the temperature really is.

In fact, when it was 68 degrees in the house, this thermometer read 60 and when it was 35 on my outside porch, it read 40 degrees. Bottom-line: this thermometer is so inaccurate it is useless. It seems to have a very limited response range (between 40 and 60 degrees).

On top of that, the cord is so short that use of an extension cord is virtually mandatory. It does not keep the food warm enough to meet the 140 degree minimum for warm foods to be safe. And the clinchers--you really have to warm the food first, and then put it in, and when you're done, the thing is an almighty pain to clean. Save your money. BTW, a discussion with Rival reveals that they believe in keeping all cords under 2 feet, so expect to have difficulties on all their products unless you have a very close outlet, and don't plan on taking it to a gathering without bringing an extension cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for my need...","review":"Too small for what I bought it for which was for my husband to have heated lunches.

Most bands don't start getting tributes until after they've been around for at least a decade. This is just Vitamin Record's attempt at capitalizing on the success of the band. Second of all, most of Simple Plan's fans are white middle class middle school brats who've never heard a single piece by Mozart or Beethoven; or anything with a violin in it besides Yellowcard. So even if Simple Plan is really popular I doubt many of their fans will be able to understand what's going on on this CD. And if even if they do, it's not very good.

Since it was the highest rated scoop I was looking forward to making a hassle free batch of cookies; besides, what could go wrong with such a simple tool? Well...... Unfortunately after the THIRD scoop from my FIRST batch of cookies the mechanism that slides the dough release back and forth skipped, causing the release mechanism to slide well past the edge of the bowl. This effectively caused each scoop of dough to be trapped within the scoop......UGH! After MUCH effort I managed to get the teeth of the mechanism realigned, just to have it happen again! I decided to go back and re-read the product reviews and found that this seems to be a wide spread issue with this design. I have decided to give the Zeroll brand food scoop a try.

I'd say they were about 3-1/2 inches (using an oatmeal chocolate chip recipe, with scoop filled to level). I didn't get many complaints, but usually prefer a smaller cookie. I like the scoop so much, however, that I will just get a smaller one from the same manufacturer.This is my first cookie scoop, and I was very pleased with how easy it was to use.

The right amount each time!

The first time I used this scoop was for a batch of chocolate chocolate chip cookies. Awesome. The second time I used this scoop was a few days ago for some oatmeal raisin cookies.

It was extremely difficult to get the metal back on the spokes so it could continue to scoop, and then it would just pop right back out.

The grip of this thing was pretty good. I scooped out my first cookie. Yay! Then another one. Double yay! Then as I scooped out the third one, the spring between the handles came out and hit me in the forehead. Ouch! The scoop jumped out of my hand and the poor piece of cookie dough fell on the floor. Well, that's the end of my new cookie scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retired after years of faithful service","review":"My Oxo scooped its last cookie this week. After nearly weekly use for just over three years, the little gear at the end cracked and the scoop no longer releases the dough. I pressed it into service a few extra weeks by using it to portion the dough and then digging the dough out with a teaspoon. The best thing about the scoops is the repeatability-every cookie is the exact same size and shape. If you fill the scoop up and then level it off by scraping off the excess on the rim of the bowl it makes a nice flat bottom dough ball that spreads evenly and predictably. The large scoop makes a pretty generous cookie; recipes claiming to make 4 dozen typically only make three dozen or so. The medium scoop is best for more reasonable sized cookies. I don't have the small scoop but I would imagine it would be too small for dropping cookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookie Scoop","review":"This cookie scoop works really well.

I was on my second batch of chocolate chip cookies (admittedly, a thicker dough, but nothing exotic-- got the recipe from Epicurious.com) and the gears slipped, just as in the case of the other user.

It makes baking cookies so much quicker and easier and all my cookies come out the same size. The dough pops right out and the handle is smooth and easy to squeeze. I can't even imagine trying to make cookies again without it. This is my second scoop and the only reason I have to purchase a new one is because someone at my house used the one I had before for an ice cream scooper.... not made for scooping hard ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite tool when making cookies/cupcakes","review":"The more I've gotten into baking, the more I've turned into a slight perfectionist. I love the ability to make my cookies very uniform in size, so that they cookie very uniformly. Hence I got a cookie scoop.I have had both the medium and large scoop for a year now, and they are working great still. The squeeze action works great, and I've had no problems with cookie dough not releasing properly. I will sometimes use the large scoop to load cupcake/muffin batter into the pan. It's important for those to be uniformly filled! I have never used either scoop for ice cream though. I have another specific ice cream scoop (doesn't have a squeeze mechanism).These scoops can be a bit tricky to clean if you let dough harden in them (as in dont wash/rinse out immediately), so I'll soak them a bit to loosen the dough or use my dishwasher. Most of the time I rinse out the dough right after use, so I can then clean by hand later. Overall good clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest scoop ever","review":"Well I've had this scoop a few months now, this is about the third time I've used it. It broke because the gear on the handle part went off track so that you couldn't get the cookie dough out of the scoop. I put it back on the track, it went off of it again, got it back on and then it broke again, this time I couldn't get it back on and it ticked me off so I threw it away. I am very disappointed in this scoop. I have the larger one and it works great! But this one stinks and now I have to go back to the larger one, which means my idea of filling jars with cookies for my friends isn't going to work because the cookies will be to large to fit in the jar. I have OCD, they have to be the same size, scooping without a scoop is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on first use","review":"I went to use my cookie scoop for the first time and as I was using the scoop, it broke in my hands with my 5 scoop of cookie dough.

It is easy to work and keeps on ticking, over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for scooping coconut oil","review":"I can't live without this! (Okay, I can, but I don't want to.) This totally solved my problem of trying to get coconut oil out of the jar/container and into the pan. Before, I'd have to use two utensils- one to scoop, and one to push the coconut oil off of the first utensil. sometimes it would get stuck on the second utensil, so I'd have to use the other one to try to get it off. This is an issue when room temperature is slightly warmer than normal, but not warm enough to melt the coconut butter. When the temp is cool, the coconut butter/coconut oil is pretty solid and falls right off the utensil used to scoop it, but in the summer, some is melted but some is soft, meaning it will stick to the utensil.Using the cookie scoop solves this completely. It works perfectly. Now I don't have to worry about having lazy moments and resorting to using liquid oils (bleghk!) in the pan.The OXO scoop is great quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke the first time I used it.","review":"The scooper broke with the first scoop.

I bought an OXO cookie scoop last year to help make evenly sized cookies. The thin metal device that is supposed to release the dough from the scoop twisted and bent when working with chilled dough. Once the metal was bent the scoop was completely useless. Ever the optimist I bought another OXO this year since all others I found were plastic. Unfortunately the same thing happened this year although it waited until the fifth batch of dough instead of the third before it crumpled up. Gee, maybe next year I'll get seven batches out before the thing twists and bends! My opinion: comfy handles don't count when the release mechanism is made so cheaply it is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice size, badly made","review":"I was very excited to replace my old spoon with this perfectly sized scoop for portioning out cookie dough. However, after about a dozen scoops, it simply fell apart where the gear ratchet is on the end, thus releasing the entire assembly, including the spring which flew across the kitchen.I'm stubborn, so I painstakingly reassembled it, working hard to align the teeth to the ratchet to properly position the release wire in the scoop. Again, it fell apart. Afters doing this about 5 times, I have simply given up and pitched it into the trash. It seems to be designed to fail. Too bad, as it is the perfect size."},{"rating":"2","title":"jktwete","review":"This makes for very uniform cookies and then they all bake evenly and they look very professional.

Also been using it to scoop out muffins and cupcake batter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicer than most.","review":"I bought a cheaper one of these from a \\"mart\\" store. It was crap. This isn't anything fancy, but it seems to be built well and hopefully will last a long time. Perfect for making even, medium sized chocolate chip cookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookies made faster","review":"At first I was hesitant in ordering this as I didn't think it was a necessary kitchen tool. But now I'm so glad I got it. It saves me sooo much time making cookies. I ordered the medium size. When they are done baking, they are all the same size and shape. Also it's easy to clean, even if the dough dries up on the scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great for making uniformly sized cookies. No longer such a mess trying to get the cookie dough out of the scoop and onto the sheet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"It's a nice size, makes small cookies, but not too small. It's also useful for things like muffins or cupcakes, to make them nice and even. I've only had it a few weeks, but I'm already very attached to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO Good Grips Cookie Scoop","review":"The release mechanism stopped working the second time I used this - essentially became useless after that point. OXO usually has quality products, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time OXO","review":"I love OXO for my kitchen and always look to them first for any gaget need- this scoop however does not cut it. Much like a few others have said, it failed quickly- with me it happened on the 3rd batch of chocolate chip cookies when the spring popped out, and the gears slipped. Back it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems at all","review":"I have both the medium size and small size OXO scoops and like them a lot. They make distributing muffin batter and cookie dough so much faster and everything bakes evenly. I haven't had any problems with dough sticking or jamming, but heavier muffin batter does plop out easier than lighter, stickier cookie dough. I found it easier to discharge when I let the cookie dough barely touch the baking pan - it comes out without the need to snap my wrist. I also spray them with non-stick cooking spray before using them. I've put them through the dishwasher many times and they've held up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"i love oxo products however this cookie scoop is terrible. the dough does not come out you have to squeeze the handle like 100 times then use a spoon. what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really handy tool to have","review":"I was using some plastic ballers to do cookies and they just weren't cutting it. I got one of the OXO scoops to replace it and I'm never looking back.It has really comfortable rubber ergonomic grips that keep your hands from slipping even when a bit greasy. The ratcheting feels solid and you never think they are just going to collapse on you like the plastic ones. The spring is just right, strong enough to quickly reset, but not so tough to wear you out if you use it for several dozen cookies. Plus the paddle sweeps out the dough very well.The plastic ones I've used have cracked in the head or the handle and the gears were pathetic. The spring didn't always reset all the way and the paddle wasn't machines tightly, so it caught a lot of gunk, making it hard for quick release. I tossed them all out when I got this bad boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookie size for kids!","review":"Very pleased with the Oxo Good Grips Small Cookie Scoop. Perfect size cookie for taking to meetings or functions.When filled to the top and scraped level, it makes about a 2 inch diameter cookie.The only down side( and reason for 4 star rating) is that if your cookie dough warms up too much the scoop does not release well at all. So keep batter chilled for best results."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am now a cookie chef :)","review":"I tend to make a lot of those instant mix cookies which should be foolproof but hell, using a tablespoon to try and measure per eye just wasn't working for me and I was getting some very burnt cookies and some underbaked ones hence my seeking this gadget out. Well, now I make MY OWN cookies - how about that :) I am so utterly confident that they will bake perfectly because of this gadget that I slap them together once a week and now that I don't angst over getting them onto a baking sheet, it's really a quick exercise. Great little tool for bakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"how did I live without this!","review":"I bought this because I was tired of trying to figure out how to form my famous white and dark chocolate w/ pecan cookies. This medium cookie scoop from OXO is the answer. It cut through the refrigerated dough with ease and released the dough instantly. It seems sturdy and the handle and release mechanism is ergonomic. I highly recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made","review":"I haven't had a chance to use this cookie scoop yet, but from my first interaction with it, I can tell that it's well made and seems like it will last for some time. I am planning on updating the review after using."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke","review":"I used the disher maybe three times. The first couple times were on soft batters for cakes and muffins. The final time was on a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough. It broke like other reviews said it would. I thought it could be fixed but we couldn't manage it. My husband threw it away before I had a chance to return it.Not an overly specific review but its been a few months since it broke, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"cookies are perfectly shaped and sized!","review":"I love this cookie dough scoop! The dough balls it forms are nice, and dough comes out with ease by squeezing the handle. It is a very durable scoop and highly recommend it to anyone that likes to make cookies. I love mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie Scoops!","review":"No guesswork, no 'Hmm, maybe this one needs a little more'. Easy to use, easy to clean. Bake on, my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"work beautifully, I wish they had an Xtra Small - 1 tsp","review":"These are new and I obviously didn't see the measurments on the different sizes when I ordered; I thought the small one be one tsp, the med. a tsp and a half, and the large one tablespoonfull..for cookies those are the size I want. Having said that...I just used the smallest for the first time to scoop and bake a really soft/runny/messy batter for a soft spice cookie. With two spoons this recipe makes a TERRIBLE mess. the small scoop took two squeezes of the handle to release the sticky dough, but they came out nice and neat and uniform sized. Scrape them against the side of the bowl to level them. I can see that I'll get a LOT of use from the small one (I make small cookies!) and will read some of the ideas for the larger ones. Muffins? all the same size? oh I think that would be nice! I'm glad I bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a good job.","review":"I like it, but when making a super batch of cookies for Christmas parties, my hand get tired. Good quality. Will buy more in different sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect cupcakes","review":"I used this scoop and all my cupcakes were the same size and it minimized the dripping dough. I'll try it on cookies next"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Pink Leather Laptop Briefcase","review":"I looked for a Pink Leather laptop carrier for at least 2 years and finally decided on this McKlein USA Deerfield Pink Leather case.It is good quality Pink Italian leather, with shoulder length straps, and fits my 10 1/2\\" X 14\\" laptop. This was difficult to find, because most of the carriers I considered were made for a smaller laptop. This one has two separate compartments, which also allows room to carry the adapter cord and mouse, if you use one. It also has room for a few thin files, pens/pencils, and a phone.I would like it better if the handles were a rolled leather style, and it had a removable leather laptop sleeve. That's why I gave it only 4 stars.

I like the way the book uses examples, it is very helpful to the reader. Yet, the book has some faults. The book does not keep a consistent pattern of how they like their answers. In the back, there are the answers to the odd problems. More often than not, those answers are either wrong or in no way helpful. The book goes through different concepts much too rapidly for comprehension. Each section is practically totally different from the previous one and only in several instances does it have anything to do with the chapter as a whole. The book is informative and well organized, though, and is better than some others I have seen. Overall, I will rate it with a score of two stars for it's lack of consistency, user-friendliness, and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Man's Journey","review":"This book was indeed, excellent. However, it wasn't exactly what I had been hoping for. I had been hoping for a book detailing Slavic Sorcery, its uses and practices. Instead, this book chronicles the author's efforts to be accepted into the vestigal groups of slavic shamans; and his experiences among them.I had been hoping more for a history followed by some recipes and practical applications of Slavic paganism. While this wasn't exactly what I had hoped for it was still an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Well, the item was received but without the pour lid and without a scoop as advertised.

The most usefull section is the batch script reference. It can be a real time saver when you writing a batch script and you cant remember how to do something. This book also contains the most usefull commands you will use when you are maintaning computers and servers. One thing I dont like about this book is that it contains information about using the command-line for Windows Server 2003, I think this should be left out and put in a seperate pocket consultant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for anyone working in IT","review":"Having started in IT back in the DOS days I can tell you that this book is a great everyday reference for anyone working as a systems admin in a server environment like I do.

Anytime users and administrators can get away from the GUI way of doing things and actually use the PC as it was intended, that is a good thing.Learning that behind every button is a script is a wonderful empowerment."},{"rating":"1","title":"very lacking","review":"you would think with a title like administrator in the name it would cover more.found it lacking in some very basic commands like cacls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid sampler of what Yo La Tengo does.","review":"This EP is a good introduction to YLT's musical diversity (for people who are not familiar with the band) while providing longtime fans with three things at which these musicians are incredibly skilled -- beautiful originals, solid covers and reinventions of their own songs.YLT's catchy pop melodies are solid, whether they redo them by bumping them up a notch (the EP's title song, from this year's Summer Sun) or stripping them way down (\\"Cherry Chapstick\\", from 2000's And then nothing turned itself inside-out). Beyond YLT's original tunes, the most beautiful and touching song on this EP is the lullaby-like cover of Bert Jansch's \\"Needle of Death.\\"Overall, this EP might be short, but it shows a breadth of musical styles and is a cheap introduction to the music if you've never heard them before, or an interesting take on some previously-released songs for those who have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"America has long been viewed as a 'tasteless' society by the rest of the world. Reading the reviews for this record, one can very well see how this view came about. I've been listening to music, all types of music, for close to 60 years. This is easily one of the five worst records I've ever heard. I could liken the singer's voice to the caterwauling of alley cats but I fear that would be a grievous insult to felines everywhere. Thirty minutes of my life, gone. I'll never get it back. The late sixties produced some exceptionally creative and extraordinary albums. This, most certainly, is not one of them.

For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use.I'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last.I use it to hold 2 1\\" notebooks, a textbook, a portfolio, a book, a calculator and my pda. This is about maximum capacity. I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections.The handle ontop is cozy, the over the shoulder strap should be wider.Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and hope that it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap breaks on first use","review":"Extremely disappointed in this bag.

Also the strap is not leather. A big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I should have expected inferior quality for the price. The outside of the bag was pretty nice, but the strap was poor quality. The interior of the bag was unacceptable to me. The main compartment was not fully lined, and I could see the stitching of the pen holders that were in the compartment the other side of the main compartment. The seller was good about communicating for the return that was made about 2 wks. ago, but I still have not received my refund. It was not worth the price of shipping to make the return. The cost of shipping for the item, and the cost of shipping to return, were about the cost of the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag!","review":"Very nice bag, especially considering the price. Has a patchwork design sewn with multiple leather pieces, which looks good. Many compartments which allow plenty of room to carry a number of different items. I can fit an IPad in one section a 35 mm camera in another and have plenty of room for a number of other envelopes, papers whatever.

But my favorite reason for using them is that I'm left-handed. A regular measuring cup assumes that you will hold it in your right hand ... which means you get to read mililiters or ounces instead of fractions of a cup. With these I can look down and read the measurements easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they crack and leak.","review":"I have had this set for several years and replaced two of the three cups at least once. Each cup eventually develops a crack in the bottom where the mold indentation is, then they start to leak at the crack. I stopped using them for hot liquids to no avail. They go in the top rack of my dishwasher. They have never been in the microwave. They use is so limited now I can't justify keeping them anymore. Currently two of the cups have cracks again. I will not be repacing them with OXO measuring cups, I've learned my lesson. OXO = great design concept, but poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are Great Measuring Cups!","review":"We bought these cups after our glass measuring cup cracked. These cups are plastic - but seem very durable. The OXO line is known for ergonomic design - and these do not disappoint - the handles fit nicely in your hand. The cups have the regular measurements on the outside of the cup, but also on the inside. The inside measurement allows you to look down into the cup while you're pouring so you don't have to constantly check with the outside to see how much you've poured. It's a brilliant idea and something I don't think I could live without now that I've experienced it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love these, but would love more if in glass","review":"These clever measuring cups are super handy and easy to use.

The issues with polycarbonate besides the possible health concerns with BPA, is that it tends to crack with use.

I would expect a measuring cup to last a life time. I won't be buying these again.Pros:Easy to read measurements.Convenient sizesCons:Polycarbonate (both BPA and can crack/leak)Pouring can be a challenge, don't go to fast or you will make a messBottom Line:Avoid these and get glass or a food safe BPA free plastic that will also be more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Cool","review":"These measuring cups definitely look cooler than they are. My husband was excited about the angled measuring lines. We put them on our registry for our wedding and were excited to receive them. However, I found it harder to measure accurately with these compared to a regular measuring cup. After a few uses, I noticed that they were sticky on the inside and starting to look yellow. No matter how much we tried cleaning them after use, they did not complete come clean. Any time vegetable or olive oil was put into them, residue was left behind that could not be washed out. It was not long before I was searching for a classic glass measuring cup. My Pyrex glass measuring cup actually comes clean when we wash it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knuckleheaded pour spouts","review":"We got these for our wedding 5 years ago. They looked cool at BBB, but we've always been disappointed at the way they pour. If you want to pour at a speed anywhere between a dribble and a dump you're out of luck. It just runs down the side of the cup.Why don't measuring cups have a good pour spout? This isn't just with these cups, we have some glass Pyrex ones too, and they're worse. My French press pours well, and my inlaws have a good pouring plastic measuring cup, so I know it's not just my pouring technique. We've finally decided to replace them, so here we are on Amazon, browsing the measuring cups.Btw, the one cup size cracked a year ago, but the other two are still holding liquid, although with lots of visible cracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad so sad","review":"When I first received this set of measuring cups I wrote a stellar 4 star review about them. My primary reason for buying them was because I needed a good quarter cup measure. Secondarily, I liked and still like the design of these measuring cups.My previous 1/4 cup measuring cup was not accurate. When filled, to the level it provided too much content (i.e., it held more than 1/4 cup so it wasn't accurate). So, my first trial of this set was to use the one cup piece and measure 1/4 cup of water. I did that and then I poured the water into my other measuring cup that I knew was inaccurate and it OVERFILLED it. So this OXO held even more content than my existing on.The title of my review is appropriate because I really liked these but I'm disappointed because I need to return them and search for a better one which is a bit of a hassle.

I use it exclusively for Locatelli Parmasan cheese, and have never had any problems with it. I keep the cheese in the grater in the refridgerator. Everyone that comes over for dinner loves it too. In fact, my brother in law bought one, and my mother in law asked for one for her birthday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High maintenance, poor performance on soft cheese","review":"So far I've had a good experience with Oxo products, but this one is a big disappointment. It really can only be used to finely grate hard cheeses. Any softer cheese (such as cheddar), even if briefly frozen, will be just smeared over the drum, stuck everywhere and will come out in a long rope, as one of the reviewers observed.But it's not the worst part. I absolutely hate the design with the handle screwed on top of the drum and has to be reattached for every cleaning. With other graters it is possible to see inside the drum while grating and to make a quick adjustment, if necessary. To detach the handle you have to put your finger inside the drum and press it against the sharp blade (!!!). The drum is very difficult to clean - the inside is narrow and any soft cheese gets stuck very badly. If you put it in a dishwasher, dirty water will collect in the crevice where handle is attached to the drum. It's too high maintenance for such a simple device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought a few of these for my restaurant and they lasted about a week before they broke.

My use thus far had been to grate enough parmesan cheese over our prepared plates - it's not like I had grated an entire block. The cheese gets stuck between the drum and the casing, and then the entire casing wants to come apart. I tried to grate a softer cheese, and all it did was get clogged up. The \\"freshness\\" seal does NOT seal well enough to keep anything fresh for more than a couple hours.So, unless you enjoy being laughed at by your cheese or vegetables, or whatever food you are foolish enough to believe this thing will grate, save your money and your time. ZERO STARS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"We use this all the time. We never realized how much Parmesan cheese can be used in our cooking and in our meals.

It too broke within 2 days of use. These plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses, or by someone who has a strong grip. The common defect I'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum. The tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum.When I find a good rotary cheese grater, I'll write a review on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've had my rotary grater for several years. I always have some romano or parmesan reggiano in it and use it almost daily. Being able to store it with cheese in it is brilliant and it comes apart for easy cleaning in the dishwasher.Last night while I was grating some cheese the handle sheared off as many people have complained about. I called up Oxo customer service and they offered to immediately send me out a new handle.Great product AND great customer service. I have a lot of Oxo gadgets in my kitchen and I assure you that after this customer service experience I'll give them the edge when I purchase anything new.Oxo rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 month","review":"This one was not worth the money. It did only last for 2 month. The black piece on the handle is just slipped on and after it came off, there was no way of getting it on again. Without the black part it's impossible to grind the cheese without hurting your hand. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Please don't buy this. OXO makes some fantastic products. This is not one of them. It's fine for super-hard cheese, but anything softer than Parmesan-Reggiano gloms it up pitilessly until it becomes useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... But watch out for that handle","review":"We just picked up a new one of these after the old one's handle broke at the base.I was really irritated at first, but then it occurred to me how long it has been in use and how much we've asked of it over the years. Hard cheese is a snap, but one of my wife's signature dishes calls for roasted, grated walnuts. A lot of them. She used to make it often.The star taken off of this view is specifically because the handle broke on my old one. Yes, it was getting old, but that's an obvious weak point of the design and it should be reinforced.The star I didn't take off - but considered it strongly - was for the price here on Amazon. The new one I just picked up in a brick-and-mortar store was $7.99 - nearly half what Amazon is currently listing this for."},{"rating":"2","title":"really does grate cheese!","review":"its a little bulky , but very efficient . would recommend as it does what is expected of itLike the way you can grate lots of cheese with the little door closed- less mess for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"The grater is terrific!! I love the way it shreds the cheese. I wasn't sure at first because it seemed to be a little stiff.

We are really enjoying our grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like a lot of work for a little reward, buy this","review":"I have been fortunate with a really great cheese grater.

So back to the store it goes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well for most cheeses & hard to clean","review":"I generally like Oxo brand products but this grater doesn't work well with most cheeses.

Afterwards, it is very difficult to clean as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love OXO - but not this grater!","review":"Really, listen to the other one star reviewers here, they're right. My whole kitchen is filled with OXO products, so I thought that I would try this. Not a good idea. You use this once and the cheese gets gummed up in the grater and it's impossible to clean. You cannot take the metal grater out of the plastic and it's a long narrow drum, so the cheese gets stuck there and doesn't go onto the food properly, it grates too fine as well. We had to throw ours out after one use.Would definitely not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for two things...","review":"The only 2 foods it grates well are parmesan and chocolate, as long as the chocolate is cold, not worth the money, I think I'd rather use my small hand held gater.

My experience has been that cheese gets glommed up inside the grater and by the time I get it pried out the cheese is as dense as if I had never grated it. On top of that, it is nearly impossible to clean. I finally threw it away even though, unlike others, mine was not broken. I am not normally a product review writer; in fact this is my first on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to let others know."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"If I could give this 0 stars I would.

All other Oxo products that I have owned have been great but they blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I got a traditional grater very soon after buying this one. For the money, it's a pretty good value, but it grates messily, is hard to clean, and is very uncomfortable to use. Also comes apart if you're not careful while grating. My cheese always came out lumpy, and forget about grating veggies. Blades are very dull. Nice if you feel like you have to have a rotary grater and don't want to pay too much. But only use for very soft foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"craptastic","review":"Craptastic waste of money. Grater is not connected to handle enough and slipps on hard cheese (parm).

The turner was far larger than expected, almost 10 cm in circumference, therefore difficult to hold. The 36 cm length is not a bad thing, mainly the bulkiness of the handle is unweildy. It was also rough, not sanded properly. After a single use and two washings, the edge developed six cracks, one is a cm long. Unable to locate a phone number for the seller, I emailed to request return instructions. The response was over two days' coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly cracked","review":"I really like that the turner is the shape and size I wanted. It does its job well.That being said, however much I want to like it, the quality I expect just isn't there. After a short amount of time, the wood cracked in several places along the edge. The turner can't have suffered too much neglect; I hand wash it because I have no dishwasher, and I don't let it soak in the sink, or sit in food. The wood finish was also a bit rougher than I would have liked, but it has softened with use. Finally, I found the handle slightly uncomfortable to grip (especially when the wood was rough) and a little unbalanced (it felt strangely heavy). I am still using the turner, but I must make sure there is no food stuck in the cracks when I clean it. Once it really bits the dust, I hope to have better luck with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped within a month","review":"I usually like OXO tools, but this one seriously underwhelmed.

They are well made, but I hardly ever use them.Functionality-wise, they are somewhere between a spoon and a spatula. But, the thing is, they don't work as well as a spoon or spatula would in their respective situations.I have had tons of kitchen stuff over the years and I've owned just about everything at one time or another. As far as cooking utensils go, and as far as I can tell, there's nothing you can't do with a pair of silicone tipped tongs, a silicone spatula, a wooden spoon and a wooden slotted spoon. This particular item may have one or two specialized uses for which it is uniquely suited, but for the most part, a spatula or spoon would probably work better.I rated 4 stars because it is exactly what it says it is and it seems to be high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy, and it cracked in the first month - do not be fooled by attractive low price","review":"I trusted OXO as a brand, but found this turner to be extremely heavy and non-ergonomic.

For \\"New Age\\" music fans it creates a serene environment that's perfect for meditation and reflection. For musicians, it speaks of subtle tones, haunting counterpoints, layered dissonance and perfect production. Ray Lynch hit a bullseye with this entire album and the fact that it's endured, still, only proves it's timeless quality.This is music that can be expressly enjoyed, when you're in the mood, and is even appropriate for creating that background calm when you leave it on while doing other things.

At the other end of the scale, the first ten minutes of \\"Starfighters\\", where the gang riffs on mid-air refueling , had my wife and me weeping with laughter. (Trust me on this one.)

One chapter discusses what the authors call systems: computers and software.Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style\\" provided, in a small space, rules that you might recall for a lifetime. This book is more like a grammar guidebook with a focus on technical material mixed in.For more examples, you'll need a bigger book on technical writing; and if you want a style guide, you might do well to remember that the basic conventions of English apply to technical writing too.

We also didn't want a huge chair that tool up a bunch of space.The chair is perfect for us, it fits snugly in out chair and she fits in it very well. I do not like the cushion however because it is very flat and hard to clean, so we just don't use it. My favorite part about it chair is that the whole thing fits in my kitchen sink which makes cleaning it so easy. Also the fact that the whole thing can be folded up and carried along is nice since we regularly eat at a family's homes who are past the high char phase. The tray however is a little smaller than you would get on a full sized chair witch means more food ends up on the floor, but that is what you get with a \\"space saving\\" high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster seat","review":"Great booster seat that's cheap, lightweight, easy to use and sturdy.

I like them because they are slender and they have silicone tips. The fatter tongs with more of a \\"rubbery\\" tip don't grip veggies and the metal tips can break apart more delicate items like fish. These grasp anything very well. I've seen some other reviews about how the tips will melt easily over high heat, but have never had this issue. I cook with them all the time over the last 4 years high heat, low heat and I put them in the dishwasher. I will wash them if they're dirty just so I don't have to use my other tongs!

I use mine for picking up bacon and turning it over, and because the edges are nylon, it won't scratch the pan. They are a great alternative to the cheap aluminum tongs that feel flimsy and break easily. OXO products, including this one, are always easier to use and of high quality.As others have mentioned, they store easily in a smaller space because of the locking mechanism at the top and they have a loop if you want to hang them. They clean easily, too. I haven't had any problems with hot temperatures on the tips, but I wouldn't use them for barbequeing either for fear of the nylon + flames = no more tongs. They should be good to go for any indoor kitchen task not involving an open flame.Note that OXO makes these particular tongs in the 9 inch and the 12 inch size. Both are great!*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy","review":"This review is for the nine inch tongs. I've had my first pair for about two months now and just ordered another.

Nothing's worse than trying to pull a chicken out of the roaster and using tongs that are too long (which would require extra clamping strength from your hand) or tongs that are too heavy and you need another tool in the other hand.Make sure people know how to use them though. For some reason people don't understand that the hinge/heel is the lock to open and close the tongs. My sister thought they only opened a teeny bit and didn't even know that they release for like 2 months (haha!).

Now I see that they are much more useful than I thought. I use them for any and every thing that I can think of. They are great for turning just about anything. I use them for pasta also and even for grabbing pickles and jalapenos out of big jars! They are long enough to keep you from getting burned by grease splattering, therefore I see no reason to buy the shorter ones. I also love the fact that they are dishwasher safe. The locking feature is very useful for storage as well. My only reason for not giving them 5 star is because the inside groove sometimes traps things. That isn't much of an issue.

The thumbprint books of his are fun activities to do with your children that any age loves, it is just too much fun, pretty soon the neighbors will be dropping in because they heard of the Emberly fun going on at your house.

A tale of self discovery, diversity and love that the reader can't put down. Whitaker melds the heartache of social injustice with an intelligent story of romance and passion.

Eventually, I had to skim the pages to keep my eyes from totally glazing over on the way to the ending.The plot, such as it is, revolves around two women, Marissa and Alex (I can't count the lesbian novels I've read where at least one woman is always named Alex).There is a strong attraction and affection between the two, but each of them is too afraid to take the next step in the relationship. On page 251 (the book is 270 pages,) after I'd given up all hope of there being a REAL reason for them to be holding back, the author briefly throws in information regarding one of the women's past, which FINALLY explains that character's reluctance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this album after I heard it, especially since I has very high expectations. I bought it as I first heard it as the theme song for the anime series, Mushi-shi. The first verse of the song Sore Feet Song was used. I wished I had heard the entire song before I bought the album. The second verse was not only disappointing but almost offensive. In order to ease the lost love, the singer talks about how he or she robbed stores and ate rats and toads to feel better. Give me a break. The song, for me, changed entirely. I would avoid this album. Don't buy it. Of course if you think robbing stores is a great thing, then this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"Item was too small, not long enough to wrap ankle, no indication in on lime as to who small it was. did not wrap ankle well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Disaster--Do Not Buy","review":"When I started to install the reel, the process (almost unreable and unclear \\"instructions\\") calls for removal of a heavy metal frame that attaches to the wall. Once the frame is installed, the rest (and very heavy part) of the reel slides on two \\"lugs\\" which support the entire weight of the reel and hose. The sample I received had both lugs broken, and this was unusable. I called Ames Customer Servce for a replacement part, and they said they don't have parts, but they would send me an entire new reel for free. (Customer Service was very polite and helpful.) The new one arrived, and it had one lug broken and missing!! Again, useless.

The narratives are descriptive of the relationships between the drag queens, the personal histories of each of them, and vivid descriptions of their performances. You'll be entertained, however, I personally wish they went into more complex detail as to their repeated reiterrations at the end of each chapter that drag queens are questioning gender, femininity, masculinity, etc. We already know this. How about breaking down what all this means instead of quickly glossing over it in the last chapter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"popcorn popper","review":"We have really enjoyed having our popcorn popper.

I even grown my own popcorn. I used the 6 quart until about a year ago when I got the 8 quart. The base unit is the same for both. The one I bought within a year ago can no longer be used. Somehow the oil gets into the bottom of the unit and begins to smoke, threatening to set it on fire. The unit gets so hot oridinarily that this is a fire hazard. West Bend has somehow cheapened these things compared to the 6 quart one I used for a good 10 years. If I could depend on West Bend to make a good solid unit I would buy another in a flash as it is the best---when made well. For now, it is back to another brand, albeit smaller, necessitating two batches. For anyone buying these newer machines from West Bend, keep an eye on it for safety's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"if only it wouldn't break","review":"We liked the popcorn popper the 2 times it worked before the stirring rod broke off. Except, we didn't like that the butter did not really drip down from the \\"well\\". You put butter on top of the lid and it's supposed to drip into the popper. Instead, the butter sat there and halfway started to drip, then made the lid hard to clean. Bad design. Anyway, about our 3rd usethe stirring rod broke off!

This makes enough for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"One exception ...","review":"Love popcorn. Any popcorn. Tasted my daughter's made with a 6-Cup West Bend Stir-Crazy and fell in LOVE with the wonderful taste and easy preparation. Don't know if her's does it, but mine will catch a kernal or 3 beneath the middle turn knob and when it pops, it will not come out unless the entire stir arm is unskrewed and lifted to release the popped kernals. This is irksome to have to do after each batch of popcorn.Otherwise, it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Popper","review":"When my 15 yr old hand-crank popper finally wore out I decided to give an electric model a chance. After reading dozens of reviews I chose the West Bend 82308 Stir Crazy 8-Quart Corn Popper. It's quick and easy, makes great popcorn and I don't have to stand there cranking. I don't use the \\"melted butter\\" feature because the corn pops up too quickly. The only downside is when you flip the popper over to dump the kernals in the bowled-lid, it is difficult to grasp the base & remove it. No matter, great popcorn & convenience makes up for this design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn popper!","review":"I love this popcorn popper. This popper consistantly makes great popcorn and pops almost every kernel every time. I'm not even using any of the gourmet popping corn in it. Clean up is easy too.

For this alone I would give the set four or five stars but the packaging is so infantile and atrocious that I actually recommend NOT buying this set and waiting for the individual seasons to drop in price or go on sale. The packaging is a cardboard slipcase that contains what basically amounts to a molded plastic spindle (like you would buy a pack of 50 blanks) that fits in the cardboard box. The discs are all stacked on top of each other! There's no episode guide. Nothing. This is as about as far as you can take \\"No Frills\\" without just putting the discs in paper sleeves.

I mistakenly assumed that it was like the individual seasons, just grouped together. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Talk about a no frills, no bells and whistles set. I imagine that after one complete go round with the disks, they will probably be scratched and in need of replacement (undoubtedly the plan of the manufacturer). As bad as the package is, I would have given a higher rating if I did not feel as if I was missing something while watching the disks. I felt that they were too short in length (22 minutes is the standard for 30 minute shows when in reruns, meaning that each show should be approximately 25 minutes in length).

After chapters giving a pep talk, the author discusses riding in general, then gives just one basic chapter on Western and then English riding. I never knew quite where I was. The author brings up terms without defining them, and finally, some sentences are almost incomprehensible, requiring several readings. For example try to figure out \\"posting.\\" And I still don't know what this sentence means: \\"In other words, if you are riding around the arean to the left, with rail on your right side and the middle of the arena on your left side, your horse should take the left lead, so that it can canter comfortably to the left while curved, or 'bent' slightly to the left.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap doesn't dispense!?!?","review":"I bought these as replacements for my wand that came with the blue/green heads (the green part at the end was a tougher scrubbing sponge). I didn't want to buy the blue/green ones anymore because the green part would fall off quickly (it was just glued onto the blue section) and then I'd have to throw it away and start with a whole new head. I thought these would be the perfect solution since the blue sponge material has no seam and would not fall apart. The problem is, there is some design flaw with these because after several weeks of use, they still will not dispense the soap that is in the wand. I've tried loosening or tightening the head. I've also tried several of the heads (I mistakenly purchased 4 packs at one time). At the end of the day these were a waste of money and I guess I will go back to buying the blue/green ones even though every 2 weeks or so the green part falls apart and I have to use a new head."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend these.","review":"I have been using these dish wands for years and really like them because you don't have to get your hands wet and they clean all sorts of dishes, including glassware, very well.

Since Amazon won't let me include a link in a review, here's a summary of what I found:Ammonia inhalants can do more harm than good. Simply being unconscious is a symptom of something else and not a condition that it is generally necessary to treat. Ammonia inhalants can seriously aggravate respiratory conditions (e.g. asthma, COPD) or the person you're administering them to could hurt themself when waking abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks focus!","review":"I went ahead to buy this book even though it has some substandard reviews simply because I wasnt looking for an overly complicated academic text on pricing.

The examples are too brief and lack analytical rigor.Some templates and graphs in chapter 5 were useful but whats up with a section on famous quotes?

The first thing I did was plug in my old version to compare. When I plugged in the new EX-29, I was totally shocked.

It's a well-made heavy spoon. But when I recently went to buy more as gifts, I discovered oxo has since thrown quality out the window. Their spoons are now made of several pieces of wood glued together--just like so many other cheap wooden spoons for sale nowadays which usually crack after a few uses.

But if quality if what you're after, you'll have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Tool","review":"Looking at the criticisms of this spoon from other users, I can't help but wonder if OXO changed the manufacturing process for its wooden spoons, because the one that I own is definitely made from one piece of wood.Any chef who is concerned about scratching nonstick cookware should own this spoon and the others in the OXO lineup. I use it with my steel surfaced cookware as well. This spoon is a pleasure to hold and stir sauces with. It definitely makes life easier in the kitchen.Tip: to protect your spoon from cracking, apply some food-grade mineral oil and rub it in all over.

As usual her side characters are as interesting as the hero (and in the case of Lord Falconer more), and you're left wondering eagerly if they'll appear in any future novels.

I particularly love when she takes a group of people with something in common (sisters, brothers, family, same location) and writes a series. The two stories in this book do not dissapoint.Both stories are fairly quick reads because they are shorter than a typical Nora Roberts novel. However, that does not mean that the characters are not developed or the story line is not believable. Quite the contrary.Natasha and Spence are both very realistic. I felt their actions were what I would do in a similar situation. I particularly like how I can place myself in the main character's (Natasha's) place and feel her emotions.Rachel and Zack was a very interesting story. I particularly liked Zack's brother.

I got 2 units with the same problem and eventually purchase the Leviton TBI03-1LW that did not have this problem, and though it has an LED it is quite discreet recessed little green light that I can live with (some other models have a quite bright red LED that bulges out a bit and is harder to mask)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfect and Half the Price You Pay at Lowe's or Home Depot","review":"These are the most handy things you can own in your home.What else can I say.

Unfortunately the one I got from this vendor was a piece of crap and I'm pretty sure they knew it. The package looked like it had been resealed, and when I plugged it in and turned it on, it buzzed. I tried a different lamp just to make sure it wasn't the lamp. It works and I only need it for short periods in the area I'm using it, but it pisses me off when a distributor repackages crap and pawns it off on the next customer hoping it will be someone like me that won't return it, because it's not worth ten dollars worth of hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"It dims","review":"We use this dimmer on a floor lamp in the baby room. It does what it is supposed to do- dim. The slider control is very sensitive and the lamp flickers sometimes, but this might be the lamp and not the dimmer switch.

The switch lies on the floor but I have to pick it up to adjust it."},{"rating":"1","title":"died after a year","review":"This item stopped working after a year of use for no apparent reason the worst part is that i hardly even used it much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying noise.","review":"I bought this to use as a dimmer for my salt light. It is just a little too bright at night. Other purchasers complained about the noise the dimmer made, but said that it shouldn't be an issue for lower wattage bulbs. I used this dimmer with a 5 Watt bulb. That's 5 Watts. There are not many bulbs with lower wattage.

They are affordable, plenty accurate and attractive.HOWEVER, this gauge was purported to be appropriate for application to a 1965 Dodge A100 slant six, and the sending unit was simply too large to fit. Correct thread size, but the water jacket was too shallow to accept the sender.So, I don't know if the incorrect information came from Sunpro or whoever was pimping for them through Amazon. It is no big deal.

Galofaro cuts the architect's excessively thick theory, asking simply, \\"how has digital production affected his theory based practice?\\" As tiny as this book is, it is BIG on content and imagery.

Instead, I was bored by the long (and pointless) descriptions of flora and fauna. I love the rugged landscapes of the area, but descriptions were overdone in this book.

Under these covers the sticks would still be fine if they didn't have a point sticking out of them on the edges. I had to cover the sticks with duct tape which looks ugly but gets the job done.

If I had known this was not an XBox controller, I probably would have searched further until I found the correct one.

The end of the last track is not on the CD. It is a very rude and disconcerting end of the CD in the middle of a note. I returned the first CD I received, and the replacement is exactly the same.

However, after the 5th time using it, it broke in half completely. I promptly wrote amazon and told them and they very kindly sent me a new one for free (kudos to amazon's customer service) and apologized for the problem. I've since been using my 2nd pizza stone and one of the corners completely broke off after it had cooled.

The plot goes nowhere, with the characters (most of which you won't be able to stand) literally going around in circles time after time after boring time. Perhaps the most dissappointig part, though, is that after you've read through all the drudgery, you expect the ending to resolve some of the things that happened and questions that came up along the way.

I can't take them back, because my hands were greasy when I opened the package to take it out.I only bought this because of the anti-bacterial feature and my desire to have a healthy kitchen, but never again - unless they are giving them away for the price they are worth (under a dollar would be about right.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke w/ 1st use","review":"I bought the OXO good grips scrubber.

It is one of the more versatile ab/back benches for the price. The hip/knee pad is probably more comfortable for women, but is adequately padded. The plywood beneath the padding could be a litter thicker but the frame is solid. The only concerns would be: the short bench for situps (make sure the back of your head doesn't hit the floor at the bottom of your situp with the bench at max incline) and the short length of the toe/ankle bar which should be lengthened to accomodate shorter legs especially as one tries to hook ones toes behind it during situps or crunches.

After the class I borrowed my friends book, Trouble Free Triangles by Gayle Bong... and it was fantastic. I've learned so much from the class and I have been able to apply all I've learned by reading Trouble Free Triangles by Gayle Bong. I feel like the past 6 years of my quilting life have have finally come together with triangles and my fear of triangles are over. If you have ever been fear full of attempting a quilt that has trianlges, fear no more. This book will help you overcome this fear. It was easy to read and very easy to follow. I really enjoyed the book and it is a definte must have for your library.

I bought his book hoping to gain some insight. Instead, I found it quite disappointing. The content is too superficial. I am actually not sure what audience this book is targeting. For me, I am looking for in depth analysis, at the least, it should provide good reference for each topic covered so that I have a starting point if I want to go to detail. For a person looking for basic understanding, this book also tries to go to too much detail, for example, on how each protocol works. I think he is just trying to fill the pages. I did not proof read it on purpose, but at least one reference (I happen to be familiar with it) is totally wrong.

The color plates are high in quality and a pleasure to reference.

This is a fantastic product. I used it dry for 3 days and was pleased with the job it did. Not as close as a razor, but pretty good. It does a great job under the arms and the bikini area. No irritation at all!!! It wasn't until I tried it with shaving cream and water that I found out what a close shave it really can do. My legs are smooth and soft just like silk. Very similar to the same closeness you get from a razor...with out the cuts, nicks and irritation. I love this shaver, I will never go back to the razor again. The only bad thing about it is the noise level. It can wake the whole house up...but it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I purchased this shaver because its customer rating was so high. Also, the shaver I was replacing was a Remington, and I had loved it. I've been very disapointed.First of all, the bikini trimmer does not lift up and away from the shaver, making it much less effective. Second, it did not shave as close as the cheaper Remington I replaced. But the big disapointment has been that it FALLS APART WHILE I AM SHAVING on a regular basis. It has lots of little tiny pieces inside that are difficult to get back in the right place, including little plastic things and tiny springs. It has finally reached the point where I can't get it closed at all, and I have to hold it together in order to shave. I am going to get another shaver today, and it's not going to be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure beats razors!","review":"It's a wonderful shaver.

Then it's ok for awhile, then it squeals *loudly* again. It's related somewhat to the position or orientation of the hair dryer and cold start temperature. After a year I've noticed that it squeals whenever the room temperature is below about 71 deg. F, say, in the wintertime. But now it basically squeals all the time until the unit is warmed up. Other people have stated this problem, you can search this online using this product name, model. It should have been a factory recall. It's most likely due to poor motor bearing specifications.

This was overshadowed by the group release \\"Talk\\" shortly after. Anderson can't always please us all both in a group and on his own like most people have. He's become a part of that new age/world music scene. Most of the songs are in Portuguese, pertaining to the Brasilian theme, and possibly some in Spanish (where's Peggy Hill when you need her?!). Featuring two tracks with Brasil's own superstar Milton Nascimento (who I only heard of through Duran Duran). Real hardcore fans might want this, otherwise it doesn't seem like a Yes solo album. It could be anyone. Even his albums with that other Greek artist, Vangelis, are more approachable for Yes fans. Not that \\"Deseo\\" was good or not, it's just not my bag.

This isn't a bad album, but it's also not likely to convert anyone to listen to more Latin American music, which is too bad: like several of Jon's 90s albums, he appropriates an existing style without really seeming to have captured the spirit.Personally, I'd give this about 2.5 stars. I don't fault Jon for trying to do \\"world music\\"; it's not far from the spirit he has always pursued, and seems more obviously a natural fit than David Byrne making REI MOMO. But Byrne succeeded by simply grafting his lyrics onto a different style of dance music than he had previously done; Jon struggled, possibly because he was never a composer of dance music in the first place. The result is largely more pleasant than compelling.2.5 stars would be about right: a few performances you'll want to hear again, and the rest agreeably bland.

This cannot be relied on in any way shape, or form.The only good reviews written on it are:1) Paid for by Toshiba.2) Written by someone who thinks they know what you did wrong, (It is not you).3) By someone who wants you to suffer as they have.Along the lines of always trying to stay positive here are some good things about it:1) The unit has no issues when powered off.2) It makes an attractive paperweight.3) Can be used to pound thumbtacks into the wall.4) It can be used as a fly swatter.5) Makes a great Rug-Hockey puck.6) It's handy dandy as a Windshield Ice Scrapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy if you travel -- major conceptual problem here","review":"A wonderful little machine if you want to be a slave to always finding a power outlet within 24 hours -- or lose all data!!Imagine a PC which loses ALL data when unplugged.

The colors were pretty good for text and monochromatic images (we did not use this for photo printing), and one and a half ink cartridge was enough to produce approximately 150+ sheets of color.More importantly, the printer was able to handle heavy-weight cardstock (110 weight), albeit if fed one sheet at a time.

What you're saving in upfront printer cost, you will make up quickly in ink. I'ts not that the ink cartridges are so expensive; it's that they don't last long. I've had this printer less than 1 month and am on my 3rd ink cartridge. I contacted HP tech and was told the HP 21 black cartridge average is 150 pages. Ink cartridges for my previous printer, Epson Color Stylus 600, were more expensive, but one lasted for 3-4 months; I haven't changed my printing output!

Final straw - darn thing has started not to work right. I get messages about how the cartridges can't move - I can hear that - but I can't turn the machine as they tell me to because the light just blinks - it doesn't turn off.

It's not a film like other brands, but a stiff sheet of plastic that feels awkward to write on. 3) It gets scratched! This does not make the protector reuseable.In the past, I've used the Fellows brand, but opted for this because of the price. Again, it's not worth it.

Klaus Kinski or Werner Herzog...I think it's a tie.The real surprise (lost within all this ego tripping)is Bruno Ganze--who gives a heartfelt performance as a helpless Jonathan Harker and, let's face it, Isabelle Adjani is one of the most angelic women who ever walked the earth.Kinski gives another one of his patented performances while Herzog allows the story to slowly (and I mean slowly) unfold.The final scene, where Harker rides off into a bleak landscape, is unforgettable.Filled with existentialist dread, \\"Nosferatu\\" leaves the viewer pondering the questions of life, death and love.Maybe this film falls short of F.W. Murnau's masterpiece but, it is a worthy remake by one of the great filmmakers of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nosferatu","review":"Scariest movie ever made. Period. End of discussion. Klaus Kinski, best actor ever. Period. End of discussion. Werner Herzog, most intense, commited director ever. You see where I'm going with this. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Haunting.","review":"This version of the Nosferatu story directed by Werner Herzog is just absolutely haunting. I have not seen the classic 'Nosferatu' made in the 1920s, but this is a prime modern example of how the real Dracula story is supposed to be. It is made by a man with real vision, craft, and maturity. Sadly, though, through countless remakes and spoofs, the Dracula story has become like a joke in our culture. Most people do not see the story as a tragedy. Dracula is seen as a kind of lady's man, rather than a cursed and lonely individual seeking love and affection. The highlight of the film is, of course, the performace of Klaus Kinski. He gives yet another stunning and creepy performance, playing the part of the tortured Count Dracula. Once again, bravo, for so few actors in film history can touch him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly I was disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this movie because, it was so long and drawn out. There were a few good parts like the way the villagers acted when Jonathan said Count Dracula. Other than that I thought the movie was a waste and, I didn't like the way Count Dracula acted when he had Lucy. It was a gross out. Then again you don't have to take my word for it. Your opinion may be totally oppisite from mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sympathetic and grotesque poem.","review":"Werner Herzog creates a dark and lyrical poem about the sad and grotesque vampire living in the carpathian mountains. Long stretches of beautiful and muted natural scenery evoke the mood of loneliness, isolation, and dread that words cannot provide. Some of the most haunting imagery filmed in cinema help to create a chilling retelling of the classic movie with the added dimension of a rich musical score which sounds more like a chant throughout. Anyone who loves cinema (and is tired of hollywood) should own this film and pay attention to how sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The OG Vampire","review":"Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to the Original","review":"The problem with remaking classics films is that they can rarely live up to the standards of the original. Such is definitely the case in the anemic remake of the classic German silent film, Nosfaratu. Often times the vampire in this remake seems weak and ineffectual, as if Jonathan Harker should have been able to break him in two with a carefully placed karate chop. When he speaks he comes across as whiney instead of menacing. All of the actors seem to underplay their roles as if they were bored to death; there is a decided lack of human emotion. The supernatural elements of the original film seem oddly missing. The only thing the director really managed to do is create some breath-taking cinematography of rural europe. If you are a fan of the original film, my advice is to skip this remake and instead buy a copy of Shadow of the Vampire--which I feel is fresh and compelling. It is a fictional account of the making of the original German classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Was Too Creepy And Strange !","review":"NOSFERATU was good but there was something wrong. Horror movies are supposed to be Creepy and Strange to a certain extent. NOSFERATU takes the Creepy and Strange thing to the limit and that is sometimes wrong. Other thing I didn't like about this movie was it was too much of a love story than a Horror Movie. I recommend this movie to anyone to who likes Horror/Romance movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring, overrated horror films","review":"Hello? Doctor I have insomnia. Could you help me? Yes, watch Herzog's Nosferatu. I was cured and now I am able to get a good night's sleep. The pace of this film is tedious. The scenery is nice. So what? So is the scenery on National Geographic Explorer. One of my problems with Herzog is that he doesn't so much make films as much as he simply puts pretty pictures and scenes on film. This is not what cinema is all about. Herzog's Nosferatu fails the litmus test. Watch Psycho or Bride of Frankenstein or Halloween, then try to put this on. The inferiority of Nosferatu in comparison to those films is startling. If I want pretty pictures I'll go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I can't believe that people watch this and are entertained. Films are supposed to be gripping, enthralling, emotional. Horror films especially should be filled with suspense and a degree of the unknown. Nosferatu falls flat on all accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESY!","review":"THE MOVIE STARTS OUT RATHER CREEPY AND INTERESTING. JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

SO SHE WILL NOW BECOME A VAMPIRE AND THUS TRICK DRACULA INTO FORGETTING IT IS DAWN AND THUS BE DESTROYED. AT ONE POINT IN THE SHOW RATS ARE EVERYWHERE AND PEOPLE ARE DYING OF THE PLAGUE AND WALKING AROUND LIKE ZOMBIES.

NO, INSTEAD THEY ALLOW THE RATS EVERYWHERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Vampire Film I Have Ever Seen!","review":"When I watched the film, it made no sense at all. It was boring and way too weird to watch again. The music of the film is compeletely unbarable and I could barely understand the plot. Max Schreck back in 1922 did much better than Mr. Klinski. I critisize the film for being a bad representative of the Vampire myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful remake of the F. W. Murnau classic","review":"This is a film that takes a few viewings to fully appreciate Herzog's attempt at recreating a movie in the style of the German Expressionist film movement of the early 20th Century. Although very well done, it doesn't quite compare with the creepiness of the Murnau original. However, this is still a fantastic film and the commentary by Herzog is very insightful for the student of the horror film classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark, Gothic And Thrilling Masterpiece.","review":"Werner Herzog's \\"Nosferatu\\" is a thrilling remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic. But Herzog goes beyond it and presents a gothic work of art that remains one of the greatest of all vampire films, if not THE greatest. The film is lush, rich in performances and settings. The screenplay is intelligent and spooky. The cinematography is rich and breathtaking in it's usage of darkness, shadow and color. This film presents the true elements of dark cinema. Herzog doesn't go for gory scares like \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" or \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" Instead, he takes his time with the art. The film's atmosphere, look, and dramatic intensity make it chilling. Single images stay in your mind. \\"Nosferatu\\" is for those who truly love great art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and mesmerizing.....","review":"This remake is one of my favourite movies.It's surreal and just breathtaking.

The vampire in Nosferatu is the type of creature all horror fans want to see. It wasn't until the 90's when Subspecies came out, that a depiction of a vampire left the old \\"Bela Lugosi\\" days and once again re-emerged as a vile and horrible creature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, innovative and useful approach to seeing San Francisc","review":"As a San Franciscan, this book is the perfect gift and/or inspiration to entertain friends, family or even yourself.The author's approach orients the reader and eliminates the clutter of the average guide book.

The superb eloquence in Bresson's language supported on Bernanos'story give us the most intimate portrait of a priest in a lost village.The poetic images are enriched by a precise dialogue. The multiple reflections derivated from the story are so many that you must see this movie several times , a priest with epic sense in a dark neighborhood. The methapors are everywhere, in the images, in the suggested ideas beyond the visual language.In this sense nobody could give a best homage to Bresson's art that his friend Tarkovsky, who after knowing him said in Paris these wise words: If we admit that Bresson is the biggest filmaker in the world, then the filmaker who is in the second place, really is in the tenth\\".I sincerely recomend to get one work of Andre Bazin titled What's is the cinema? where Bazin (who belonged to Cahiers du Cinema) offers an amazing and exhaustive analysis about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"All is Grace","review":"Extraordinary.

The transfer looks great, the only problem is that the film is loose in the gate, causing it to jump and move in and out of focus.

He later befriends a priest in a neighboring village and learns that he has cancer.The film does have some nice scenery of norther France but that is about it.The special features on the DVD are a theatrical trailer, audio commentary by Peter Cowie, and the standard essay about the film in the liner notes.This film is recommend for those interested in the topic or for insomniacs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade-close from an electric","review":"I can see from other reviews that I am not alone when it comes to bumps, itching and irritation from regular blade shaving. I absolutely become enraged when I itch after shaving in the shower with a blade. But electrics just never produced a close enough shave. But now this model does, beautifully.My only concern is that when I click the button to pop open the foil head assembly it is attached to the rest of the shaver by some frighteningly small, weak looking pieces of plastic. I imagine when something breaks, it will be this vital part. But, at least the two year warranty is comforting.Overall pricey, but excellent results, provided it lasts for at least the 2 year warranty period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cut hair well, unreliable design","review":"This razor doesn't cut my hair well at all--even under what the directions list as ideal condition. It's completely hopeless on knees, etc.After two months of use, the rubber part at the base of the razor head began to shred itself. I looked into the provisions of the warranty. Note that while the razor does come with a two-year warranty, you need to 1. save your receipt, and 2. drive the razor to the nearest certified dealer. For me, the nearest dealer was an hour away--and I'm certainly not in the middle of nowhere.The battery life seems to be fairly good; I awarded an extra star for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I returned it","review":"While the razor did shave well, it was an old model, not made for over 7 years, and wouldn't hold a charge.

I have used Nair that burned me terribly, Nads that was a sticky mess, and countless others. This razor worked ok for the first shave, but it was just chewing my hair off. It was like the blades were dull out of the box. The plastic trim started to come off right away and it's so hard to clean. I needed a toothbrush to get anything out of it. Just not good at all. It is now collecting dust with all the other useless hair products. A very expensive paper weight. If only men knew how much trouble we go through just to remove hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"WDF-5500","review":"The razor itself works great. But beware, when you try to order replacement screens and cutters, they don't make them anymore. Or if they do it is impossible to order. I tried to order the replacement part twice. The first time I ordered model #SP-360, but found out it didn't fit the 5500 model. Sent it back but did not get refunded for the original shipping charge. I then ordered #SP-132 replacement part and they sent the #SP-360 saying that replaces the SP-132. Again I will not get reimbursed for the shipping charge. I guess the WDF-5500 model is just too old a model to get replacement parts for. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"Despite its price, this was not a good replacement shaver for an older, noisy electric shaver.

First of all, there was a weird buzzing and hissing present throughout many of the scenes. Also, whoever created the score was under the impression that this was a real nail-biter, and the most dramatic of dramas. Totally over the top!

The Child actors are the best thing about this movie, especially young Sean Patrick Flaherty, who shows some acting range and ability. The adult actors have less acting ability and range than those in commercials or porn. The father seems tranquilized. The adult scenes remind me of spending time at the house of a couple that you know are breaking up, just uneasy and uncomfortable, nothing scary or interesting, just uneasy.

This movie is almost worth the rental price, but not quite. Hopefully the folks who made this film read this and take my feedback constructively. The children were better actors than the adults because they didn't over-dramatize things. I think sometimes people forget that there is a difference between stage and screen acting. You don't need the actors to work as hard because you have special effects that you can use in movies.

The power switch does not turn on the printer. You have to unplug the power supply from the wall for 15-20 seconds and then plug it back in to get power.Paper handling is awful. Sometimes it will pull just one sheet, but it can pull up to 25 sheets at a time, and then jam. Color is okay, but trying to print monochrome photos is a challenge, since they end up with a blue/purple tint in the midranges. Ink, especially the color cartridge, as others have noted, goes quickly, and is pricey.

It has been nothing but hassles. My parents have a different hp printer/scanner/copier and it didn't work either so they were sent a replacement and that would still act up. Quite frankly, I'm tired of HP and will never buy their products again. They are lagging behind. I think they make weak products so that people will go out and buy more. Unforunately people don't learn their lesson and keep buying the same thing.

Giving it two stars for the times the printer worked, HP's stellar cartridge delivery service, and decent looks.But constant paper jams guarantee make it unusual that I get anything printed in less than two tries. To make matters worse, the paper jams to not stop the printing process, spraying the printer internals with ink. The ink smears on the following pages or my hands. This happens with two or three different brands of paper and with included and pre-installed drivers on Mac OS X and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. Instead of a simple printer driver, included software installs a whole printing and imaging system including a bastardized photo manager and several utilities that duplicate services provided by the operating system.

Unlike the last reviewer, I had no trouble with the initial set up...BUT...after a few days of use, I started getting pop-up windows from HP advising me to download the latest driver 'upgrade' from their website. Which I did. And guess what? Quicken no longer recognized the HP! So I completely uninstalled the HP software, reverted my C drive, just to make sure, then re-installed the HP software from the disc.

However, this 4160, from the start, was bad. First, like all the other review, it does use a ridiculious amount of ink. Second, the moment I installed it, it would constantly stall in the print queue, and would only print if I restarted the computer (as you can imagine, completely useless!). I called HP technical support, and after an hour on the phone, the said it was fixed (supposedly a firewall mix-up), but then the next day, same problem.

You basically can't use your home computer unless you disconnect the printer. This printer is your worst nightmare right out of the box. Never, never, never buy HP -- check around on line and see what other people are saying: HP printers are absolute junk. Just do a google search on \\"HP sucks\\" and see how many hits you get!!!

This book was trounced in 1961 by Garry Wills in National Review (which also favored some degree of segregation at the time, against Supreme Court decisions like Brown v. Board of Education) and, if read today, sounds still more grotesque. Its value, if any, is as an example of a kind of racist literature still current even after World War II, and written by a very articulated man. It can be used as a historical source, but not much more. So, if you are interested in American racialist thought, this can be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great example of the mentality of the time.","review":"This book is just as racist and bigoted as the other reviewers have made it out to be, yet they miss the value of the book in learning about the mentality behind Segregation. When this book came out in 1961, it was considered a well-written thesis for not only why Segregation was nescasary, but why it was the moral thing to do. It offers that rare insight into the the thinking of the times that has escaped most post-Civil Rights literature.

Aside from the fact that the product is rather cheaply put together, I didn't find much of interest in the recipes. I was struck by the unusual spelling of some dishes (Chicken Tanduri, for example) but then I noticed that, though rooted in Indian cuisine, the book is more about Indian cooking as exported by way of East-Africa.

In fact, I came out of this movie wanting to do something, anything, just to see something come to an actual finish.The few surreal moments - his stopping time, or her speeding through a whole generation in moments - stand out.

The most mundane of realities mix with surprisingly boring magical realism. The two main human characters are really difficult to relate to. The man is a clueless loser and the woman begins by endlessly doing unattractive and poorly executed dance steps and then becomes a vapid and soul-less nasty person. The only interesting character is the cat, who is left waiting at the vet so long that they forget about him and he gets euthanized for neglect.

She finds out what life is like for them. Jane has to pitch in and do her share of the work. At first this is hard for Jane because she never did any real work before.Boston Jane isn't a book I would recommend. It was pretty boring until the end. All Jane does is worry about being a proper lady. This doesn't make her life very exciting.

Because she had a crush on him, she enrolls in a girl's school. Within a few years she is a lady. Willaim goes west to the fronteir, and sends a letter asking Jane to marry her. To her father's dismay, she goes. You have to read the book to find out what happens next. This is a fantastic book! I felt so sorry for Jane at certain parts of the book.

This book is comprised of mostly completed illustrations, and lacks the sort of detail Manga is famous for.The sections on 'head shots' is simplistic, the line quality heavy, and the color unspectacular. To make matters worse, over 3/4 of the book is filled with finished drawings. If you are the sort of artist who learns by looking at finished illustrations, this book is for you.

Alone, it is confusing, framented, and leaves the reader constantly asking \\"How did you do that, please explain!\\" The excercises are very difficult if you are not already an expert on Computer Graphics. It assumes you know complicated Computer Graphic techniques (although stated otherwised in the prefix) and askes you to implement them in OpenGL without hardly explaining how the technique works? I have to use this for a Computer Graphics course which is suppose to be for Senior Computer Science majors. Most of the exercises are completely beyond what the book has presented!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start your education in computer graphics with this book","review":"This book is the work of a university professor who is teaching computer graphics at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. You will find in there a lot of detailed concepts alongside with clear mathematical developments. The most popular aspects of computer graphics are covered in progressive order, from the most simple/basic to the most involved/advanced. This book is useful if you already have a good proficiency in geometry, in linear algebra, in calculus and in programming with a language like C or C++. Otherwise, I can hardly figure out how you could use the concepts and the mathematics for your own purpose. Even though I obviously need to read other sources to learn OpenGL, I expect to go back to this book on a regular basis to grasp fundamental concepts that are simply not explained in books showing you how to use a graphics library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read in the topic of computer graphics.

To begin the book has absolutley no structure (top down approach my @!?) which has basically left we with knowledge of concepts yet with no idea how they relate. The knowledge I did get however was like pulling teeth because the examples in the book are soooo awful(I was forced to use the net to supplement my learning). The book rarely works out an entire example and just assumes that you understand it after your first try.

Angel explantions of theories are hard to follow at best. In one chapter he spends an whole large section explaning the theory behind a lighting model then states that openGL doesn't use this method for lighting. So why even cover it in an openGL book??

However, I didn't use it everyday because it tended to make me a bit shiny. Now that winter weather has kicked in, it is a skin saver! My oil prone skin still gets dry and flaky in the winter, and Neutrogena's Healthy Skin Enhancer has really helped with that. My skin doesn't feel tight or dry at all, and on days that I'm not as concerned with coverage, it works wonderfully. I just dust loose powder on top to set it, and I'm good to go. Do take note that doesn't fall under the full coverage category. You can build up coverage, but only to an extent. I haven't had many breakouts lately, so it is very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I purchased this product because of the reviews however I was very disappointed.

I have normal skin, it is not excessively dry or oily. I'm 42, however I look about 32, this product did nothing for me. It did not make my skin look better but worse over time. The coverage was good initially but because I had to keep applying moisturizer the coverage was wiped clean. A tinted moisturizer should moisturize your face, that is one of it's main functions. Estee Lauder Day Wear is a superior product, giving a natural glow as well as sufficient moisture. It doesn't offer as much coverage but this coverage is no good if you have to keep applying moisturizer. It defeats the purpose. This will be going straight into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for summer","review":"I bought it in winter and it totally dried my skin out.

I was thinking that it has SPF 20, it has retinol (which is very good for anti-aging), it has tint, why would not it work on my skin? So I put it on, and voila, my skin looked great, especially my forehead, which gets very oily in summer.So, I recommend this product, especially for people with oily skin, and use a good moisturizer at night when you use this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable software","review":"This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9.

However, when I first received the package in the mail, I was concerned I had ordered the wrong item. I have a Forerunner 305 wrist-mounted GPS, and all of the packaging for this product references the Edge GPS sensor, so I didn't know whether or not this would even work with the Forerunner. There are very slight differences in navigating the menus to set up the cadence sensor between the Forerunner and the Edge, but the cadence sensor does indeed work very well with the Forerunner, so Forerunner owners order without fear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Waterproof","review":"I'm a big fan of Garmin computers, and especially the mapping features of the 705. If there were any other computer that did what theirs does, the GSC-10's sensitivity to water would be an unacceptable design flaw. It's supplied with zip-ties (requiring a cutting tool to remove it), yet it won't tolerate even a small amount of water such as from washing one's bicycle or riding in light rain for over an hour. Garmin is honorable and will replace drowned GSC-10's under warranty. (I'm on my third one.) But it's really unacceptable to have to remove the sensor any time I wash my bike and any time rain is anticipated, and to have to do without it for a couple of weeks, or longer, any time I get rained on unexpectedly. They're replacing so many of these that, after a wet spring in the eastern USA, my last warranty replacement was backordered for five weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not waterproof","review":"I'm on my second unit.

The second unit I try to seal using silicone in the battery compartment, wheel speed screw hole, and wire hole for the wheel speed reed switch. To no avail it somehow still got water inside the unit and is now failing.If you use your bike only on an indoor trainer then you can purchase this unit, if you go outside you are wasting your money.EDIT:I was able to seal up the unit better with the third unit using household silicone. So far so good. If you buy this product you will need to seal up the battery compartment, the sensor wire hole(remove screw from wheel speed sensor and pull apart), and the wheel speed sensor screw itself.I really like the dual sensor once it gets sealed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"work fine although bulky","review":"the product works as advertised, my only complain is that is a little bulky, and the arm to measure wheel speed could be optional, since with some devices as the forerunner 305 there is already satellite recording of the speed.otherwise works fine and helps during rides to keep a high cadence to avoid injuries and increase aerobic benefits."},{"rating":"1","title":"speed senson review","review":"Too bad no speed sensor for Garmin 450T.

It took me about 15 minutes total. I have only been on two rides with it so far but I love it. Now I know how far I've gone as opposed to just knowing how long I've gone.

I originally bought one for my bike and eventually bought a 2nd one for my wife. Compared to other speed/cadence devices that require a direct wire, this one is great. It's completely wireless and attaches very quickly to your bike with minimal set-up. All you need to do is attach the speed and cadence sensors to your bike, align the GSC 10, and press the calibration button. If it picks up your speed sensor a little light turns green, if it picks up your cadence sensor, it turns red. From there you simply tighten and pair with your Garmin device. I have a 405CX and my wife has the 310XT. Both devices paired very quickly and work great. The only thing you need to remember is to turn off the GPS feature when cycling indoors on a trainer.

As a note of interest, I used a magnet about the size of a dime on the end of my pedal (ferrous metal) that faces inward and aligned the sensor to that magnet. This eliminated the need for tie wrapping a magnet to the crank and it is out of sight. The magnet is strong enough to remain attached to the pedal and is recessed enough not to be knocked off. Even if it falls off it is cheap to replace. Very clean. Someone should market a magnet insert to fit the allen wrench socket, this would certainly get rid of a lot of unsightly, unnecessary tie wraps. Four stars for installation as it needs to be properly aligned and adjusted, not plug and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I received the Garmin GSC 10 as a gift with my Garmin Forerunner. After the first snow of the season, I was excited to use it with my bicycle (indoor) trainer, but when I tried to set it up it was clear that the sensor would not fit my bike AT ALL. I have a Specialized Docle Elite bike and the sensor arm is too thick to fit between my frame and wheel. There is absolutely no way to mount the unit without pieces getting in the way of my back wheel. Design FAIL. Pretty bummed, but I still love my GPS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as intended, but the WATCH battery life is an issue on long rides","review":"Installs easily and synched with my watch with no issues.

It works very well and seems quite accurate. This second one is for a stationary bike I have.My only problem is that the first one I got has cracked on the speed sensor arm where the screw is that holds it to the main unit. So far it is holding in place, but it won't take much to break it loose. No speed sensor would only be a problem on a stationary bike since the GPS can calculate speed on a moving bike. Cadence is what I really wanted this for to begin with.Since the speed arm seems fragile, I don't think I would recommend using this on serious mountain bike rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to a Forerunner 305","review":"Very easy to setup on you Garmin Forerunner 305.

I found this sensor to be of extremely poor design as it does not fit my bike at all. I had to create a makeshift inch block out of electrical tape and tape it to my pedals for the sensor to even reach the signal. Additionally the sensor itself is so sensitive that even the slightest touch will completely turn off the sensor.

I had two of them fall off when riding at speed, then I noticed the third one had begun to crack so I removed it before it fell off. The 4th on, I used some liquid tape to keep it snug, and it worked for a couple of months, but now it, too, is cracking. I use it on an aluminum frame road bike and it seems the combination of speed and vibration are more than it can handle. They need to include a metal thread on the plastic clip so you can screw it down tightly and maybe use some Locktite.

Now I get the real time info needed to train more efficiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"great with foreruner","review":"The sensor is a great addition to the Forerunner 305.

Mounting wasn't difficult but the sensor could probably be a little better. I've got the sensor body leaning away from the wheel with the speed sensor arm adjusted towards the wheel. As with another review I read, I had to add a spacer for the magnet on the crank for the cadence. Both the speed and cadence magnet had to come pretty close to the sensor to get picked up.I've been using this on a Kurt Kinetic trainer and it's great to be able to monitor speed, distance, HR and cadence.

The thing worked perfectly fine for about 2-months and then just completely stopped working. I replaced batteries and reset it to the Edge 500 unit many times but it never worked again so I gave up on it. I never used it in rain and it had absolutely no reason to stop working other than some kind of flaw in the unit itself. I refuse to buy another one because I'm afraid the exact same thing will happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be better.","review":"Super easy to install, paired within seconds.

Simply a good device that does what it should well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with MotoACTV","review":"I won't repeat what other folks have said, it is a great product. Just wanted to comment that it works flawlessly with a MotoACTV for folks looking for an ANT+ speed/cadence sensor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with my Garmin forerunner 310xt","review":"I bought this product to use it with my Garmin Forerunner310xt. I installed it on my Trek road bike with ease. I've rode probably 300 miles with it and it works like a champ. My only complaint is that their is a delay from the sensor to the computer about 1.5-2 seconds. Other that that I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and cheap","review":"Despite mounting all the pieces exactly as instructed, I couldn't get this device to consistently work. The plastic slides out of place at the slightest bump, and within 2 weeks the sensor arm has come loose and snapped off. I've got a Garmin Forerunner 305 and absolutely love it, but would not recommend this accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for a cruiser style bike","review":"I bought the GSC10 off Amazon to go with my new FR60. It was available on Amazon for almost half the price of what I could get it for directly from Garmin. (Gotta love Amazon!)According to the instructions, the pedal magnet must be within 5mm of the GSC10; and the sensor arm must be within 5mm of the spoke magnet. There is not a way, (on my cruiser-style bike at least) that all the components can be mounted within a close enough proximity to each other. Disappointing, but I can only assume that the folks that are more likely to use this item ride a different style of bike altogetherAs a side note, I had given up on the installation and went onto Amazon to return it, only to see that (according to Amazon) that this bike sensor is only compatible with the following HR monitors: Garmin Edge 305, Edge 305CAD, and Forerunner 305. But my FR60 is listed as a compatible device on Garmin.com.[....]I assume that Amazon is incorrect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GSC 10 for Edge 500 Bike Computer","review":"This connected an synced up with the Edge 500 very easily.

Can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I mounted this to a Bacchetta Giro 20 recumbent bike. The tie wrap straps were not long enough for the center tube so I had to buy longer ones.The cadence works as advertised with my Garmin Edge 800, unfortunately the unit mounting does not accomodate the speed sensor for this type of bicycle. To compound matters, you cannot use two of these sensors units (one for cadence and one for speed) with the Edge 800.For the speed sensor to work, I am going to have to open up the case, remove the speed sensor lever, extend and protect the sensor wires, and mount the speed sensor lever with a homemade mounting.I gave the unit a four star rating, not because it doesn't work, because it is so inflexible and the entire system (Edge 800 & GSC 10) is somewhat inflexible with mounting and connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woks on bikes but not on trikes","review":"I own a trike (ICE Trice) and mounted the cadence sensor on a modified boom post.

Cadance is helpful on road biking conditions as well. The speed and distance calculations seem to match up well with both the GPS and my estimates from checking the map on long rides.Setup is pretty simple, and pairing with my Garmin 310xt was quick.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was that the battery that came with it was dead. Kind of aggravating, as it meant a trip to the store before I could verify that the sensor worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this device !!!","review":"If I could describe this product in one word it would be failure.To keep this short:1. Set up is easy.2. Concept is great.3. Design: Not so much. It is not feasible to keep the sensor attached to the crankarm and attain a reading from the GSC10 (attached to the rocker arm) without placing a 1 inch spacer inbetween. Mind you, it doesn't stay in place.I own a Gary Fisher and the rocker arm to crank arm spacing is approx 1 inch. It is unfortunate that the cadence senor requires a 5mm deviation or less from the GSC 10.Yes, it's not a typo. 5mm deviation. So when you get going and by chance the GSC 10 moves as much as 1mm, you no longer attain a reading.I am really disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I am on my 3rd one in 3 years and it just died. I liked it when it worked. It helped keep my cadence up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Ride without Cadence Sensor","review":"I've had my Garmin 305 for about 2 1/2 years. Great unit. Initinally wondered why cadence sensor? After talking to a very knowledgeable rider, I found it is extremely useful. I had been riding (Trek 7.5FX) at a comfortable 75-80 rpm. Was told to drop a gear and ride closer to 85+. Not to worry about speed, just get used to higher cadence. I've been doing that ever since and have steadily gained .5 mph average on 40 mile rides. Just not building up lactic acid as quickly. I now have Cadence on the top of my 305 display with HR just below. Speed is on a lower display. Forget speed, except downhill or tailwind as the other two are paramount. Now my average is about 16.3 mph for a hour or 16.4. for my last 40 miler. I'm almost 70 yrs. old, died (for about 10 seconds) of a heart attack 7 yrs ago, quad bypass, doing great now. By the way, I use 130 HR as a red line - normal anywhere between 105 - 120 HR when riding. GO FOR IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I took it into a shop to install it for me. It seemed pretty easy. I would buy it again. I absolutely love it. My cadence goes directly to my Garmin. This is a must have for every cyclist."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"So far this is a great product from garmin. I bought it so I could get speed and cadence on my FR60, along with cadence readings on my Timex Global Trainer. It was pretty easy to install, and it picked up the magnets fairly easily. The only bad thing is that I had to make cardboard spacers to go on my crank arm since the magnet wasn't close enough to the sensor to begin with. All in all, if you want speed and cadence, go no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent for students of logic and clear thinking.","review":"I bought this book as I am concerned about our nation's and the world's energy future. What a disappointment.At first I thought this was just a poorly written book, but as I read on it got quite humorous. Silly analogies and selective use of information abound. Not to mention a positively laughable example of conveniently forgetting the data used in an earlier argument when making yet another incredible leap in logic not 3 pages later.Should become recommended reading for anyone interested in the study of false logic and fallacious argument.

I'm sorry to say this book really misses the mark! Please introduce us to the real Elvis who isn't a God given talent, but just a kid with a dream and the courage to be different. Elvis is you and me man, not perfect, just flesh blood and bones trying to make sense of what it all means. As a dedicated fan I really would like to be given the experience Elvis straight.

He never grew culturally, intellectually or musically, although he grew quite a bit physically. Only in America could a hillbilly named \\"Elvis\\" become the idol of millions. Grow up, people. The only thing extraordinary about Presley was his pompadour which, I believe, is listed in the Guiness Book of Wolrd Records for highest, silliest hair-style.

Clearly a power issue. To remove all doubt, powering the pedals individually (as others have noted) fixed the problem. I guess you get what you pay for.

The ice cream was never ice and it wasn't cream- It never became ice cream. It remained runny liquid.When I called the company to see if I was doing something wrong they told me I had to partially freeze everything- the bowl, the ingredients, everything. That takes a lot of time and more importantly, it does not meet what this product promises (namely ice cream, soft serve in a short time).Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cream Maker Disappointment","review":"Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He is an ice cream fanatic. I read the reviews, most were negative, but I found one positive that stated if you follow the instructions exactly as written, the machine will work. Well, my husband has tried it on several occasions and cannot get it to work properly. The ice cream either won't dispense at all, or it is runny and he has to freeze it in a bowl. His slushy maker works better than this machine. We chilled the bowl for 24 hours, (as a matter of fact, he cleaned it each time he attempted to make ice cream and put it right back in our chest freezer, which gets very cold, and left it there for days until his next attempt) and it still didn't work.

Its obvious when he sits on it that he is not fully comfortable and wont sit longer than a minute. Its really small and narrow, is hard plastic and the green \\"pot\\" slides and seems to pinch. It is also a little unstable and tilts when he tries to get up from it. I am currently looking for another product and will use this for a stool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this. Listen to the other reviews.","review":"This potty received poor reviews; I foolishly bought it anyway because I was hoping to get my daughter interested in the potty (she loves Dora). This thing is as bad as it gets. My daughter tips over on it. The removable cup sticks to her and, worst of all, she can not pick it up and move it because it is not attached to the base. The whole thing falls apart in her hands. Buy the the Bjorn potty instead and have your child personalize it with stickers of their favorite character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not kid or parent tested!","review":"The concept is good for the 3 in 1, but the step stool portion does not lock into the potty ring base. So child knocks it over easily and a pain if you have to move it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would make changes to the design","review":"I would change the design of this potty chair.1> The green pan comes off to easily. The plastic sticks to my daughters thighs and comes off of the seat and spills urine all over. If I could purchase a different one, I would get one that has the pan that slides out instead.2> The seat that fits onto the base removes too easily for the early stages of potty training when your young toddler like to explore how things work. My daughter just rips it right off. However, if you are using it as the chair that fits onto the toilet seat, it stays nicely and is sturdy. I would like it if it was as sturdy on the base as it is on the potty seat.3> The stool has rubber grips on the bottom are very sturdy and don't slip at all when used as a stool.4> The Dora & Boots picture is actually a sticker and mine had a few bubbles in it. Already the ticker is showing some wear from using bleach to clean the potty chair and we have had this for less than a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!","review":"My daughter didn't even get to use it. It actually is really small. And my daughter is tiny all ready and very thin. So you would think she can fit, but actually the toilet itself was too small. Not worth anything. Worst product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dora Potty","review":"My daughter and I absolutely LOVE this potty chair. She loves it because it has Dora and boots on it, I love it because it is so easy to use and clean. It is at the perfect height for my toddler as a stand alone potty chair. Then, you can just pull out the little bucket and empty the contents rather than picking up the entire chair. Or, you can take the top part off and put it on the bathroom toilet and use it as a potty seat. The bottom part can be used as a little stepstool. We honestly only use it as a potty chair, but it is nice to have options. We are very pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I wish I would have gotten a potty that didn't have 3 pieces to it. My daughter is constantly taking this apart.

I stopped putting her on the 3-in-1 potty & started using a different potty seat & the rash went away within a day. I'm sure the design of the seat contributed to the skin irritation, since everytime she got off, you get see the red ring indent left from the ridge of the seat. So from my personal experience with the seat, I'd advise you to not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast delivery - average product quality","review":"The shaver came within the time frame promised and it provides a close shave, but after using it for a few weeks now I've noticed the battery life is a lot worse than my last Remington MS3. This one only lasts about 1-1/2 shaves before needing a charge and my old would last a week or more! I'm not sure if it sat on the shelf too long before selling, the battery in the new shavers are weaker than the old, or perhaps infant mortality of the battery (i.e. bad batch of batteries?). Not very happy with this shaver..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working!","review":"This product was great for about 3 weeks. Then, although charged to its capacity,just stopped shaving hair. I have to say though, that when I called Remington,they were absolutely great about it. They said that the model is no longer beingmade and they would send me another shaver at no cost (still waiting but am confidentthat it will arrive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Life is a Major Issue","review":"I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product. With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months. After that, it's time to either ship it to an 'authorized repair site' and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one.By the way, the battery bypass cord is useless if the battery dies. It can't bypass without some sustainable life in the battery so the shaver is dead when the battery goes. Not exactly what I'd call consumer friendly engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"I used Remington shavers for years and loved them...but this one does NOT live up to the past quality! Within a month or two the screens were already dulling to the point where I had to shave multiple times just to get a reasonable shave. I tried returning the product to Remington, but they blew me off big time. Save your money...buy another brand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shaver with no downsides?","review":"I've been using this shaver for several weeks now. I usually let me facial hair grow a little, so I shave every 3rd or even 4th day - that way I use both components of the shaver the so-called trimmer as well as the triple blades. So, here are my comments on its performance (not necessarily in the order of importance):POSITIVE1) Very minor skin irritation, if any at all.2) Shaving closeness very good, but a few strokes are necessary to achieve smoothness (as is the case with every shaver).3) Quickly rechargable.4) Stylish-looking device and accessories.5) Trimming works well, followed with triple blade shave.6) Comes with a storage case/travel bag.NEGATIVE1) The middle blade falls off on occasion when the cap is removed to clean the blades with the included brush. Unique manufacturing error?2) Somewhat loud.Overall, it is worth your money. To date, I have not regretted buying it and I hope that I won't for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"screens too fragile","review":"This shaver works well except that the screens require changing even more often than every 3 months, as stated by the manufacturer. Since these are pretty expensive to replace, you wind up spending as much as needed to get a new shaver every year. Not for me, I'm looking for a new model..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I've had this shaver for about 6 months now and here is what I've learned.... It takes a long time to shave with this thing, it takes several passes over your face... let me repeat that... SEVERAL. It's nicked me before but I've learned to avoid that. The worst part about this is that when you shave, your freshly cut stubble collects all over the OUTSIDE of the razor and then places it in places like under your nose as you furiously shave. It's annoying to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaving With too much effort","review":"Although it gives a close shave, it requires alot of time and effort. I had to go over my face several times. Also it is very noisy and the foils are very fragile and clumsy. Lastly, the trimmings come out of the foil and creates a huge mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the MS3-2700","review":"I purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and after 3 mo's the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face. I have been trying to replace the SP-93 screen and blades, but have been unable to find a store that carries them. I e-mailed remington twice and explained my problem but did not even receive a courtest reply. Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shaver I ever owned","review":"I have owned many electric shavers over the years, some with more success than others. Remingtons' products have always rated highly with me, so when it came time to buy a new shaver Remington was on my list. I purchased this shaver two weeks ago and I have enjoyed razor-like closeness since. The shaver charges quickly and lasts for ages. The de-luxe carry pouch is just a PVC zipper bag, but who cares? The shaver is a quality product with a fast powerful motor and feels solid and well made. Like a Mercedes, you know it will just keep on working as expected for years. Being washable, there are no worries about cleaning, just squirt some liqid soap over the foils, turn on for a few seconds then rinse and dry and you have a clean shaver again! I keep coming back to Remington simply because the other makes I have tried just don't come close and I know for sure I won't bother buying from another manufacturer, there's just no point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going back to Braun!","review":"I owned a Braun shaver prior to this one, but thought that I would give Remington a try. The $40 Braun gave a much closer and comfortable shave then my \\"now for sale\\" MS3-2700. On top of a closer shave with the Braun I was not forced to replace the foil after 4 months of use. Try it if you want, but I would not recommend this product. Want to buy mine? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Remington!!","review":"I've had Remington's before and I must say this is not their best product. It can be found cheaper if you must have it but I also have used Braun's before and is a superior product although much more expensive.

No help from the Customer Service group- So bottom line- find another brand this is more of the same old stuff-although the battery does stay alive longer it has earned a 2--otherwise I would have rated it a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shaver bites","review":"I've been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it.For years, I've used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise.The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood.To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time.The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden Netting","review":"I draped this over my garden.

Overall, what could have been a dry subject is coverered in a fascinating manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is the best book I've seen about the history of roads and highways in Houston I've seen. It's got a ton of full-color photography, historic photos, and is a well-written book.

If you're a roadgeek, or just want to know about how Houston grew, this book is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive","review":"Very expensive, don't see why anybody should pay $800 for this product.The shelves and door have a plastic coating (or a film) which gives it a shine. The problem is that the coated surface gets damaged easily in assembly. The door was difficult to attach to the cabinet body. The hinges did not fit easily in the door's grooves.

My cabinet arrived undamaged and in good time. I am fairly mechanically inclined and assembling it was not *difficult*. However, the instructions that I got do require some reading between the lines and things must be done in a certain order, so I experienced a couple moments of minor dismay. I am satisfied with the quality of this product, but I do think it is still overpriced, at least compared to things made in China. The list price of $900 is insane, especially considering that you have to assemble the thing yourself.

Probably what's still needed is a few more Church books each focusing on aspects of his career. But for a solidly filled-in overview of it all, this one will do just fine: It covers all of the territory, and the detail is extensive.These authors (notably Gramer, who started on it before Ashby) had one huge advantage though that no one else will ever have: Extensive interviews with Church, conducted mostly in his latter years in the Senate. More removed historian views may prove useful later, but this book will always be a touchstone on any research relating to Frank Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaron\`s Party is SO the best VHS EVER!","review":"If you don\`t own it, go buy it!You\`ll definetely love it!He does the best concerts and his concerts are so great you\`ll feel like you\`re there.This awesome video consists of his Disney concert special,a live concert at the House of Blues,in the SNICK house,and tons of behind-the-scenes footage of him,and some with family all over DisneyLand.And you\`ll also see behnd the scenes of his video\\"That\`s How I Beat Shaq\\".After that footage,you watch the video.You with scream once you see this video.If you love Aaron the way I do,you\`ll buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aaron's party live in concert","review":"I like the VHS because it was so cool and aaron carter rock the VHS called Aaron's party live in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh, freedom of speech and Amazon reviews...","review":"Carefully read the one star review before buying this book/CD:oddly enough (as reviewer pointed out) THIS IS NOT ABOUT HARDCORE FUNK.Shane (silly boy) titled it New Orleans Funk Guitar, and then produced an excellent resource on News Orlean Funk Guitar.

Also be prepared to laugh aloud, to feel your heart soar and your heart ache, and definitely bring a hankie."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good love story","review":"Almost Paradise was the reason I became a fan of Susan Isaacs. It's a completely different book than her later ones- the books Isaacs wrote after this were all very good, funny and suspensful, and quick paced. But Almost Paradise is special for me, maybe because when I read it I had no idea what to expect: and what I discovered was a talented, funny, intelligent writer who decided to write a love story in her own unconventional way: and what a love story it is!The story of two people (Jane and Nicholas) who seem to belong in the real world, who seem to share problems with the majority of people, and yet...the characters that Susan Isaacs creates become something different, they become people that'll stick in your mind, people that you'll think about long after you close the book.

Nevertheless, I could have read it simply as a soap opera had I been given a happy ending, but I was furious when I got to the end.

Wearing socks helps.They are comfortable & well-cushioned, though not extremely so. If I was doing a whole lot of walking I'd probably choose another shoe.I do wear a lot of clogs and though I usually prefer them with some embellishements or a little fancier design, these are just great & I've been wearing them nearly every day. They are lightweight & look good.The green suede is really attractive & perfect for these fall days in the Pacific Northwest.

Right from the start I had problems -- very poor design: hard to turn on (often takes several times) and it's awkward to remove the top for cleaning. Plus the hinge will probably break. And that's the good news. Now for the bad -- the R-9170 does not come close to Norelco's for a close shave. Even shaving longer does not help. Plus, the after shave irritation alone deserves a return.

The price is excellent for the quality you are getting. The razor can be used plugged in and gets many shaves per charging. The design is slick and the head is completely removable to allow for easy cleaning under running water. The motor is quiet. The grip is confortable. The razor is light weight.The only reason I gave this razor 4 stars and not 5 is because there is a short break-in period. For the first week or so my face was a little sensitive. The razor comes with a statement saying that it may take up to 3 weeks for your face to adjust. After 1 week, I was experiencing extremely close and comfortable shaves.

The closeness is OK, probably the best I've ever gotten from an electric shaver but nowhere near as close as a blade shave. But the real disappointment is that battery life is short, and it is not designed to be user-replaceable. Now even when I use it corded, there are times when it acts as though it is out of power & doesn't want to shave. That is a real disappointment. I didn't expect to be back in the marker for a shaver after only a year.

The author would have you believe that a diagnosis of fibroids is something that alters the course of the rest of your life, and that every diagnostic test and therapeutic procedure is incredibly painful and invasive. That may be the case for some women, but not for all. We turned to this book after I was diagnosed with fibroids and, rather than giving us the information we needed to make educated decisions, it made us fearful of each step in the process. As it turned out, my fibroid (singular, something the book would have you believe never occurs)was removed surgically and I was back to work within 3 weeks, and my life has gone on quite happily.

Unlike Galaxy Angel A which was first split up into a box set, then as AA for the second half, all of \\"X\\" is in a single 3-disc set. However, for some reason, only the first 8 episodes are actually dubbed. Each \\"episode\\" of Galaxy Angel X is 1 long episode with 2 mini-sodes which count as 2 seperate episodes. This makes for 4 on the first 2 discs & 5 on the last one. The first disc has both English & Japanese tracks, featuring most of the original voice actors from the previous GA dubs except for a new actress playing Rampha. The other two are in Japanese only, with no dub. I don't know why it was put out like this, or why they only bothered to do it with only 1/3 of it dubbed, but it seems profoundly lazy, like it was taken up by Bandai Visual for the last 2/3 of the show.

Yes, the title track has some nice playing. \\"Mother\\" might have been stunning as an instrumental. \\"Sugar\\" has potential with its saucy innuendo. A couple dreadful tracks like \\"Little Things\\" & \\"Found My Love\\" have me reach for the skip button when her talk-sing part approaches. \\"Deep Freeze\\" near the end of the set is the only track I want to put into my song mix rotation. The last track \\"Change Your Mind\\" sounds like \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\" from Bob Dylan's first album in 1962. The song Dylan sang was more interesting.

Johanna Lindsey, this book is superb! The sexual tension and attraction between Royce and Kristen was WOW! So much action without too much history, just enough to explain what was going on. I loved that Kristen was such a strong woman, so sure of herself. She knew she wanted Royce and didn't deny it! I also loved how Kristen came from such a strong family background and the closeness she shared with her parents and brothers! And Royce, he was so gorgeous and sensual, no wonder Kristen couldn't deny herself! Johanna Lindsey, please, I beg you, write a sequel for Royce and Kristen. I did not want this book to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true medieval romance","review":"After having read Prisoner of my desire\\" I swore never to read a Joanna Lindsey romance novel again. I was truly appalled. But the customer reviews persuaded me that I probably would like that one-and I did! Usually I don't like medieval romances but that one was different. I liked sassy and daring Kristin who is a really strong heroine and also Royce who is a true match for her. I could understand both point of views which is seldom the case when I read romance novels. It is so sweet to see how Royce and Kristen eventually admit their love for each other. The only thing I did not like was the spanking scene. It was unnecessary and didn't fit at that moment. It was as if Lindsey only brought it in because she has a liking for such scenes. The bondage scene (only a mild one) seems to be one of Lindsey's favourites, too but at least it fitted into the storyline. Nevertheless I did enjoy the book thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope...","review":"If you like books that have the same conversations over and over and the same situations over and over... this is for you.

I get to travel back in time and could picture myself in that situation. Utterly romantic. This is a must read book after Fires of Winter. You can't read one without the other. I just can't stop reading this book. I read it in one day and is re-reading it. Absolutely amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of the romance genre!","review":"This was my first Lindsey book which I read 21 years ago when I was 16, and I still rank it as one of my all-time favorites in the historical romance genre. Kristen Haardrad is one of the feisteist heroines in romance and has plenty of fire to stoke the desires of the Saxon lord Royce of Wyndhurst. Both characters are likable and have depth which makes this an enjoyable read - Royce is conflicted by his hatred of the Vikings [who had caused the death of his beloved fiancee years ago] and his intense desire and eventual love for the strong-willed Viking hellion, Kristen.This is the book that introduced me to the romance genre decades ago, and though I haven't kept up with most of Ms Lindsey's later works [I found her earlier novels to be much better plotted - check out Fires of Winter which is the story of Kristen's parents, Brenna and Garrick], I recommend this author to those who love historical romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to Fires of Winter","review":"Kristen is the daughter of Garrick and Brenna in Fires of Winter. Unable to find a husband, she sneaks aboard her brother's ship so she might meet a man at one of their trading ports. Unbeknownst to her, her brother and his men are going on a raid and are soon captured by Saxons. Royce keeps the Vikings alive to help him build a fortified wall. He is stunned when he finds Kristen among them. Despite his desire to keep away from her, he finds that he is unable. Kristen is bold, honest, and forthright in her dealings with him. Together they sizzle. This story is one of my favorites and so much better than the previous story. Kristen is able to admit her feelings for Royce, which excites him and continues to draw her closer to him. They are wonderful as a couple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johanna Lindsey's Best","review":"This was the first romance book I ever read and it continues to be one of my all time favorites. Kristen is a wonderful, beautiful and feisty character which you love and envy immediately. Royce is handsome and hardened and still you love him and can't help cheering him on. I think that the chemistry between them is great and the writing is above par, much better than your average bodice ripping book. I recently reread this book after several years of it sitting on my shelf and it wasn't at all disapointed. It has stood the test of time. Although I still enjoy Johanna Lindsey, it seems to me that her newer books have been come cookie cutter versions of one another and none of them can compare with Hearts Aflame. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"While this book had an intriguing start, it evolved into a rather poor excuse of a romance. Kristen is such a strong heroine, yet she keeps giving in to sleeping with the \\"handsome strong\\" Royce. not only that, I found both of their characters odd and somewhat unbelievable. Anyway, this doesn't seem to be a book for the jaded or bored romance reader. If you love a bit of will-bending and submission, I guess this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"it kicks somehow","review":"if it wasn't for Fabio's pic at the book's cover, it won't even buy it. Nah. Not that much but seriously, I like the story. At least the heroine here knows how to fight and no rape ( i think) was held on it compared against the first book. Her mother, Brenna, was twice been raped by her father, Garrick, on that book, one of Jl's irritable yet still managable to read stories.What is it with rape, rogues and women anyway?Oh well, from this trilogy of JL vikings, I like this the most though I much preferred Brenna than Kirsten for so many reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay's Best!","review":"Hearts Aflame impressed me as one of the most honest presentations of the agony and ecstacy of love ever. Kristen is so refreshing as someone who can be very capable, strong and independent without being bossy, bitchy or manly! She's able to keep her femininity and still be stong and honorable. And Royce - what can I say - he was my first crush! This book is excellent. I've loaned it to all my friends and still read it every year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"reminded of my why I started reading Johanna","review":"I was surprised when I saw this book, as I thought I had read all of JL's books. this book reminded me of when I first started reading JL, and I was caught up in the story. When I finished, I sighed and said \\"that was a good story\\".I know that JL's older books tend to have stronger male characters, and females that cave in, but if you look at when they were written and the time period, that is probably more realistic.As far as the story goes, I loved loved loved, seeing Brenna's daughter in this story. The fact that Kristen is trained to fight by her mother was absolutely hilarious, as she had to use her skills.Overall, this was a good story, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Lindsey","review":"I picked up this book in a hotel gift shop many years ago, and it was the first book I had ever read by Johanna Lindsey. Since then I have bought up everything she has written. While her recent books are entertaining, they do not seem to have the same heart-wrenching quality as some of her earlier work. If you like what you've read in her recent work, try this as well as Secret Fire, and The Fires of Winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggh","review":"I could not enjoy this book.

The hero of the book is engaged to another woman, yet he kidnaps the heroine, takes her virginity, refuses to let her leave and the ENTIRE book he is never planning to marry her but to marry the other woman and discard her. And the heroine is so beyond pathetic, bowing and scraping to the hero and instantly forgiving all the crap he puts her through.

The author argues for the Christian's liberty to read fiction, to listen to good music, or to engage in scientific research without feeling guilty that his activities are \\"purely secular\\" and that God's time is too valuable to be \\"wasted\\" on such things. Prudent participation in culture is both a duty and a pleasure. It helps God's children to see Him as the Creator of everything that is beautiful and brilliant and to be able to say with J.S.

The other collar we used the \\"1\\" setting which is the lightest setting and it made our dog yelp so loud and jump like it hurt so bad.

In the instructions it said a response like that means the setting is too high and may be harmful. The training DVD was not helpful it was based on a different larger product with different controls and for large breeds. This product is too powerful for dogs so tiny.

If you need to correct your dog you have to be right next to him... and then it still doesn't work sometimes. Everyone knows that the key to training a dog is consistency, and how are you supposed to be consistent with such a sporadic product? Bonus surprise: You can't use two of these at once. They use separate codes for each unit but the signals interfere with each other and they are sporadic at best.I am returning mine, and I would never recommend this product to anyone.

Other than the unnecessary grammar issues, I find that the author is very dry and one-note. For a communications textbook, the bulk of it is just bad writing.

She's not particularly likeable, nor terribly compelling. The therapist, Susan Allen (Mel Harris) lacks the charm of Tom Booker (Robert Redford, The Horse Whisperer), but does serve as a stubborn foil to a reluctant Paige.Older viewers should probably skip this movie in favor of the grittier, starker presentation of The Horse Whisperer.Still, for children, Wind Dancer's generally lighter feel may be more suitable than The Horse Whisperer, and may offer parents an opportunity to discuss the conquering of fears and disabilities without deeply upsetting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Great","review":"I didn't abhor this movie, it's just not the best.

I can only assume the battery circut has malfunctioned. Needing a shaver immediately and being back in Korea I have bought a Philips made in Europe. I did not get enough service life from the Remington, considering my Norelco's excess of 11 years. Bye, bye Remington... too bad though. I kind of got used to it.

Within 2 months of purchase the blades had dulled to the point that it felt as though it was chewing rather than cutting. I purchased a Norelco 7810XL and have been using it for the past 8 months with excellent results. Based upon its short useful life I can no longer recommend the Remington R-960.Origininal review: I purchased this razor when the batter on my Norelco died. I based my decision on what the reviews I read suggested was the best shaver for the price.The Remington is clearly not as well-built as the two Norelcos I have used in the past (more plastic, shaving head clips on rather that having a hinged latch release), but the results are slightly better. I am getting a closer shave in a slightly shorter amount of time.Given the excellent results and the much lower price than the Norelcos I am happy to give Remington a pass on the less sturdy construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doctor and Stella -good movies","review":"Havent seen Roomates yet so no-comment on that one.

I found a friend with the tools necessary to grind away the metal burrs, and the hitch pin now fits in the hole.But I would recommend avoiding the hassle and buying another brand of hitch extender.

I operated my car at/under posted speed limits over paved roads for a period of three days. On removal of the adapter I found that it had bent down so the insert for the receiver frame was no longer in alignment with the socket for the hitch accessory.I would frankly rate the Curt adapter as a potentially serious road hazard and strongly recommend against Amazon making it available. If it bent after three days of use within its rated weight what would have happened on a longer trip?

I will go with the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words and post photos of some of the details of this set instead of launching into a written description; in a nutshell, the board and game pieces are absolutely beautifully crafted. I agree with other reviewers that the main downsides are: 1) can't expand this to include 5+ players (unless one buys a second set and uses the brown and green game pieces from the standard set -- hmmm...) and can't incorporate expansions such as Seafarers and 2) the number chits are very hard to see and rest awkwardly on the land hexes (I think next time I will try using the standard number chits -- at least they are a bit smaller and will be easier to see). Otherwise, this special edition set really enhances the Catan playing experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I could not put this book down!

It's whisper quiet, he didn't even know it was on......until wads of his hair were getting ripped from his scalp. He likes his hair short (less than 1/2\\") and we had to whittle using the 1/2\\" attachment which made him wince and then again with the 3/8\\" and 1/4\\" attachments to get it even all over.

So I got one and I really love the fact that it's cordless so I can actually chase the kids around the house to cut their hair.

I've had mine for a little over a year and started having problems after only about 15 haircuts. First, the battery stopped holding a decent charge long enough to cut hair for more than 5 minutes and got progressively worse as time went on. Then it only worked when I plugged it in because the supposedly rechargeable battery was shot. Now it only works intermittently, oscillating between a high-pitched \\"buzzing\\" sound and a low-speed/low-pitched \\"whirring\\" sound, even when it's plugged in! Somehow the defective battery is affecting the electric motor of these clippers so that it no longer effectively cuts hair in either mode (plugged-in or unplugged).

I'm sticking with Wahl or Oster from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save on Haircuts!","review":"Works great!I love the fact you don't have to be oiling the blades since they are oiled for life according to the instructions...just keep them clean.

During each of the recharge cycles, I fully drained the battery and charged it over night, to minimize memory effect.The accessory combs are easily broken. The combs are made from plastic, not nylon. The plastic is brittle. The part that holds the comb to the clipper was poorly designed, looked weak, and was weak. My 1/8\\" comb broke after about 20 uses. Since it's the only one I use, I have to go find a replacement.The replacement comb costs only $5.99, but is hard to find. It's out-of-stock at the Remington store.

I checked it and tried tightening the bolts that hold the blade and it worked for a while and then it didn't work at all. Tried tightening the bolts again and the thread just gave in, I had to put some new screws to get it tight again. It never cut hair well anymore. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull after 4 cuts","review":"I bought this product, dreaming of the freedom of cordless hair cutting, cut my hair once and the next time it was too dull to cut. I contacted Remington for warranty service and they made me send it in to get a new one. That one went dull after 5 haircuts. Better, but really wasteful. I can't figure out where to get replacement blades, but I can't see how it's worth it as they will probably be of similar quality.I don't have wiry hair; I have fine hair (and not much of it). This is just a failed product. On the plus side the motor and battery seem to be pretty good, but that doesn't do you any good unless you just like to listen to the sound of a clipper running.Don't waste time and money with this item - go with Wahl or maybe Oster (I had an acceptable Oster that lasted about 4-5 years)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Darn Good Deal","review":"Yeah, Ok, it doesn't stay sharp forever, but for the cost of about one barbershop haircut (maybe 2), you can cut your hair for a year.

It looks junky and cheap. I thought because I paid over $100 for this that it would actually be decent - pretty sure that \\"charge while you listen\\" was in the description? Perhaps they meant, you can hook up your own charger next to it? Do not buy this. It looks like someone spray painted it grey. I am putting it back in the box and will return.

Unfortunately I haven't found any of KSs other books that come close to this one. Summer is a delightfully naive, feisty and sad heroine. Nick is a fiery, tragic, and stubborn hero. I am not sure I would have forgiven him for his intitial treatment of her but eventually he comes to love her in a fiercely protective manner. The sub-plot involving the dynamics of the New Zealand settlers was interesting although the resolution was a little far fetched. But all and all a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Fever","review":"This was the most amazing book I have ever read!

This is not what I had expected at all.The supplemental disc, from a shoot, well, that is bogus! Rolando, plese go back and re-make this entire dvd.You have information to get out there, but its gonna put everyone to sleep!

No examples to illustrate waht he's discussing, no video of setting up lights, etc. The one segment where he actually attempts to illustrate a point with a live model, he ends up standing between the camera and model so you can't see anything. Boring content, bad production make this one a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy can shoot photos but can't really teach properly..","review":"Much like everyone else says, Rolando should focus on instructions, and not just having a conversation filmed.If you really need/want a good instructor, go with Kelby's photo training.

Dom is a great character wimpy, whiney, selfish, spoiled, you hate him so much you are glad to know at the end he will be paying for all the terrible things he has done to Griffen over the years. Isabel and Griffin tear at your heart not wanting to seperate, it was very emotional, I could feel Isabel's grief.

He has elevated the eastern way of life to appear much more civilized and thus superior to the \\"Texan\\" way. The Texas characters in the book are portrayed as backward and borderline barbaric. Jason, on the other hand seems to be much more enlightened and cultured. I supposed upon finishing the book, I was to be ashamed of my home state, but rather I was more ashamed of Mr. Craven's portrayal of us Texans in the book. If he thinks so much of the Far East and their culture, maybe he should leave Texas and go there to live there instead. On the other hand, once I get past the hurt feelings, the novel did hold my interest and was full of action.

I found myself invested in the book in ways I didn't expect be.What I disliked the most was the small amount of suspension of disbelief required for me to enjoy reading the book that I didn't anticipate from a Tom Clancy novel (basic Hollywoodized bullet misses and the like).Don't expect anything fancy here, as the book is straightforward and to my knowledge doesn't seem to try anything new. Nonetheless, the book was written well enough and I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, Unrealistic, Common, Poorly Written Garbage","review":"The plot is simple, predictable, and poorly written. The poor use of first-person makes it sound like an 8th graders \\"What I did on my summer vacation\\" essay.The worst part is that this book is no doubt marketed to young people who are familiar with the game, yet it includes very graphic gratuitous sexual dialogue in one of the chapters.The only reason I read this book was to make sure its content was suitable for my middle school brother who likes the game. I refuse to let him read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched, horribly written","review":"I wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before picking this up. It is horrible.

For a top notch \\"splinter cell\\" spy guy, Sam Fisher sure ended up with a gun pressed to the back of his head a lot.Example of bad writing: One dinner with mystery guy scene described the entire meal from salad to main course and then said so and so started the conversation by saying bla bla bla. I'm thinking \\"Not a single word was said before or during dinner?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A First?","review":"This is an unusual book written for the young reader. It is apparently a book based on a video game which in turn is based on a Tom Clancy character and written by a David Michaels. It carries the name of a popular writer in the title (Tom Clancy). If Clancy had little or no input (one can't tell), then one would wonder if Mr. Clancy has used a ghost writer for his other novels? I wonder how much he would charge other writers to use his name to sell their novels.A young reader who is unfamiliar with old clich��s of the English language should enjoy it, but serious readers will be put-off by the writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!","review":"AS A FAN OF THE SPLINTER CELL GAMES,AS SOON AS I HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK,I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT IT.

I've read all of his books many times (in fact I had to buy a 2nd copy of Red Storm Rising) and read the Net Force series. I picked up Splinter Cell looking forward to tales of Sam Fisher but as soon as I started reading I noticed something odd. The author was writing in a first person view like none I've ever seen before. He uses the word I constantly. In one paragraph EVERY sentence started with I. I did this. I did that. It dosen't make for good reading at all. I skimmed ahead and it seemed like the author continued to overly use the letter \\"I\\" throughout the book so having spent $12 of my hard earned money I put the book down and never expect to pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"silent, super, stealthy, splintercell","review":"AMAZING!!!! The facts about this book are simple. It's amazing, its action packed, it's beautifully written. There is a man by the name of Sam Fisher who must stop an extremely unstable terrorist organization leader and find out who is supplying him with his amazingly powerful weapons. He must fight his hardest to achieve this. He is no average agent. He must physically enter his location stealthily and must exfiltrate the same way. This is all for the protection of our beautiful country (America). It doesnt matter the location. He will do the job. All for the red white and blue.I loved this book. It was my most favorite book I've ever read. I loved the fact that at the end of a chapter that was all action it leaves you hanging and the next chapter was in a diferent location with people you never expected to be apart of something like this. I could read this book a millions times, over and over again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Spy Thriller Novel","review":"A great novel on spy and action things. The plot is quite straightforward, but not-that-simple. Sam is the main spy agent of the Splinter Cell, who has the luxury to travel all over the world.The main protagonist was depicted not only as an effective killing machine, but also a human.

Then I saw this novel at a book store and thought it could be a good read. It turns out this isn't one of those bad novels based on video games. I like the transitions between Fisher's point of view and a random person's point of view. This novel puts the reader in all the action of the missions Fisher has.This is a great novel for Tom Clancy fans or fans of the game series.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Splinter cell","review":"This book was okay.

It is a lazy, production type of writing. Imagine some one can start a war by sending two emails with phony audio cuts?! And a brilliant terrorist could send a stealth bomber in the bright daylight and didn't expect to be detected?! Our country's survival is depended on the stupidities of terrorists and one superman.

It cussed \\"f\\" all the time, and went into description in the sex scenes. Seein that this video game is played by kids and that they are most likely to read it... I just found it disgusing and uninteresting. The plot seemed average, like just another spy story. I'd steer clear of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing based on an excellent game","review":"This book begins on a positive note. There's action, some description of Sam fisher's cool gear, and a bit of a plot. But after a couple chapters it gets really bland. The author (not tom clancy) has a writing style that is pretty ordinary, with some weird perspectives thrown in. For example, the first person style takes a while to get used to, and seems confusing when the author cuts to different scenes (like the villains talking for example) that don't have a 1st person perspective.There isn't a ton of cool action, just a lot of mediocre action. The writer's pace doesn't even change when he's describing it either, just keeps on plowing through the story. Even the sex content isn't exciting.Overall I'd label this book a bland Clancy knock-off that is only worth reading if you are snowed in for days with nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"New character, maybe new ideas","review":"A new type of spy novel unlike Clancy's Ryan series. New character different plot from a different aspect.

I was duped as I thought it was a Tom Clancy book. After reading the first page I figured it out.I have never played the game, just saw a commmercial on TV some time ago. The game looked interesting. The book was not.First off, you have to get over the first-person narrative style. The guy is talking about himself as if he is recounting it to someone, though he would never really recount it if he was so deep undercover. A third-person narrative would've made more sense.The characters were hollow and very predictable and I never felt engaged with the story. It kept hinting at something big that never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle School Excitement","review":"Only a middle schooler could love this book. Only a middle schooler could read this book. Only a middle schooler could possibly have written this book. (My apologies to middle schoolers everywhere!)Tom Clancy is a great story teller, but will never be accused of being a great writer. That being said, there's no way Tom Clancy ever read this book, let alone wrote any of it. If he had read it he wouldn't have willingly put his name on it.Save your money and buy a Nelson Demille novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but disappointing execution","review":"Let me start out by saying how interesting the idea of a Splinter Cell is in practice. The book's premise is very interesting and the plot line is good as well, but that's where the positives of this book stop.The writing style of the author seems to be playing to the lowest common denominator. There are entire sections of the book that read: \\"I do this. I do that. I go back to doing this other thing. I then go to do this. I start doing this.\\" There isn't much to say about the variety of sentence structure here.This was overall a disappointing read especially considering that Tom Clancy's name is pasted on the front cover of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"It's pretty obvious that the publishers want you to think thisbook was written by Tom Clancy. I was looking for any TomClancy book to take with me on vacation, when I picked thisone up by mistake. I was extremely disappointed when I openedmy suitcase, picked up the book, and discovered my mistake.I read it anyway, thinking the writer might be okay if TomClancy is willing to put his name on the book. It wasn't theworst book I ever read, but it was mostly a waste of time. Thestore was bland, and the writing lacked style.

Yes, I did cruse through it in a few days, but that was more because I had nothing to do than it being a good book. If you're a big Clancy fan, don't bother with this. These sorts of books are cash cows for him and just ways for bad writers to get some exposure. I think the biggest problem I had with this book is that it's too James Bond-ish in style. There isn't the depth and reality like an actual Clancy novel usually will carry. Yeah, Michaels does give some detail about a few things, but the scope of the book seemed rushed and poorly constructed. Like I said, I understand that these aren't meant to be massive publications of sweeping genius. They're cash cows that Clancy can slap his name on. It will keep you entertained for a long plane ride, but you'll forget it the second you put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense book","review":"Great book keeps you reading until end of book. find out all the mysteries as the story goes on with not too much but enough action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a excellent book!

All arrived in perfect condition, even the cups which are not made of Corelle. As for the person who stated that they were difficult to wash, they must have allowed the food to dry onto the plates before washing. Just filling the sink up with hot, soapy water will make most of the food particles come off.

They have more heft than the regular Corelle, though, and the mugs are a regular weight. They make a nice casual place setting. Everything but the mugs is made in the US.

Oil seems to stick to the fluted sides of the plates like glue, and I have to add extra soap and scrub extra hard to get it off. The cups are the most difficult to clean - all of them have coffee stains on the inside that I cannot remove. I don't know if they will fare any better in a dishwasher - someone else will have to comment on that.I am now in the market to purchase another set of Corelle in the traditional material. Not as nice or as luxurious, but certainly less stressful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing problems","review":"I bought 2 sets for me, but both came with different manufacturing problems... wrinkles on the borders... color differences on the edge...

I had used Corelle before and knew that they were very light and the whole not braking thing was a bonus. Saying that I have to add that these dished are not as light as the old set I had. They are lighter than the stoneware but only a little. I will use them until it becomes to painful, then I will start my hunt for the lighter ones again.I wanted to add that they were delivered in good shape and on time.

The only problems I have found with it is that the ink cartridges cannot be refilled and the ink could hardly be called inexpensive. My wife is a Kindergarten teacher and prints a lot of material on the printer at our expense. The 2nd problem will discourage me from buying Canon again. The part that is called an ink absorber wipes clean the ink cartridge heads has become full of ink and the printer smudges or streaks all the papers. The fix for this? Take it to a Canon authorized dealer and pay more than the printer was worth new to have it cleaned or replaced. That is ridiculous.

Use it primarily for home and student, mostly printing. Light use for picture printing, but has done a good job. Best feature is easy set up. Receives a low rating because it uses a lot of ink unless you set it to fast and grayscale (Cartridges are expensive ... the best deal on cartridges for this printer can be found at Costco.), and because the paper feed has gone bad in this short time. I have two other Canon printers in my house and have passed them onto my children. These other two printers have lasted the same use or worse for much longer ... and the children have them because the cartridges are inexpensive and seem to last a long time (getting harder to find though).

I didn't need anything fancy for my college dorm. While a little on the bulky size, this printer is very fast in both printing and scanning. However, I noticed that the text quality is lower than the HP printer I have at home. The ink price relative to HP is lower. The PG-40 offers 16ml of ink for around 20 bucks whereas HP's entry level all in one (F380) uses the HP 21 cartridge that offers only 5ml of ink for 15 dollars. Personally, if the MP160 was not on sale, I would opt for the MP180. The MP180 offers a LCD screen (as opposed to the MP160's LED screen), memory card slots, and a higher resolution scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended printer","review":"I'm very pleased with the print quality and the ease of use.

This book was written several years ago, but time has proven Ms. Hertz theory to be a persuasive one.

Now they are all wanting this book for their children. It was as much fun for the boys in the family as it was for the girls though the book is actually about a girl--Minneapolis Simpkin. It opens with a discussion, which we interrupt, between mom and Minneapolis. Obviously, Minn wants a pet and mother does not. Then Minn finds a baby monster and takes it home. Things do not go well. My children, when they were small, had a hate-love relationship with monsters. This book filled the gap so that the monster could be enjoyed and the child could be the winner.

This book is simply Part II of Little Women","review":"This is a great book, and my favorite part of Little Women. It covers the part when Jo goes to New York and meets Professor Bhaer. However, when I ordered \\"Good Wives\\" I thought it was a sequel that I hadn't read before. Instead I found that it was a poorly bound and poorly copied (e.g. faint print that's hard to read) copy of Part II of the book Little Women. If you have the novel Little Women you already have \\"Good Wives.\\" I sat the books down side by side and compared them, and they are identical. I'm confused why everyone is referring to this as a sequel to Little Women, unless perhaps when Little Women first came out it ended when the father came home from the war, and maybe Part II was originally printed in a separate volume?However, every copy I've ever picked up of Little Women nowadays already has Part II in it, so if you have Little Women I'd advise you not to waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminently readable classic","review":"I read this book when I was around fifteen (I had already read Little Women, Little Men and Jo's Boys ).

I enjoyed the book very much.However, in my opinion it is not as good as the first book. Perhaps because, like any sequel, it is an extension of a good thing that stands for its own right. Perhaps, because I am still young myself, I was able to connect more to the teenaged heroes than to the adult and married ones.However, it was a great joy to meet them all again, and I think it is a good and worthy sequel, although it can't be compared to the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it -- its chapters are already in Little Women","review":"If you have Little Women, you already have these chapters.

Instead of going through each of the building blocks f Himalayan statuary and iconography, then putting them together (i.e., mudras, vehicles, hand objects, etc.), it is organized (not right word) in a peculiar fashion that resists its use as a reference book. Often it goes into great detail about trivial things, then omits more important things. For example, it clutters the landscape with discussions about different sects - this is really premature.

Her theory concerning Henry's negative reaction to Anne of Cleves is very amusing and as likely to be near the truth as any other I've read. Lindsey ,however, lacks objectivity in pursuing her subject and makes it clear from the outset that she is firmly in Anne Boleyn's camp. Actions that she attacks in the case of Jane Seymour are summarily excused in Anne Boleyn - although both women were in essentially the same situation. For one well grounded in Tudor history this book makes a diverting read. Readers in search of a solid history of Henry's six wives should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Created a new love for history","review":"I'm not normally a big non-fiction reader, preferring rich literature to anything else, but while browsing through the local bookstore one day, I spied this on the shelf and was taken by the title. I spent about half an hour reading it there in the shop before I decided that I needed to by it, and then once I took it home I finished it in about 2 hours.This book is interesting, fascinating, often humorous, and although it has a couple places where it is more annoyingly feminist than necessary, it really is a good place to start for someone wanting to get a taste of this period of British history without worrying about being bored to tears.

Fortunately I haven't had a similar need with my own children, but both of them have enjoyed this book and we've read it a number of times over the last few years...and days. I actually just bought this copy because my previous copy was all worn out! The only negative to the story is that it's a little 'behind the times' in some of the details (ie. a record player, children's ward in the hospital), but this certainly doesn't seem to negate children enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion About This Book","review":"I think this book is great. In my opinion, it is very educational to youngsters as to what a hospital is like. If you're a small child who is scared to go to the hospital, this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I highly doubt that Khaled is behind this release!","review":"No one doubts the originality and creativity of Khaled's music. On the other hand, this CD seems to be pirated with poor sound quality, and the record label is not Barclay or any other record labels that produce his work!

Please do not support piracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"the strangely titled \\"NOW!\\" by Khaled","review":"The \\"new\\" Khaled cd entitled \\"Now!\\" appears to be old tracks from before Khaled's international success - with the exception of the 5th track - \\"Aiysha\\" - which is the same recording as \\"Aicha\\" from his last cd, \\"Sahra.\\" This is hardly Khaled \\"NOW\\" - If you have no Khaled yet, you will find unending pleasure in the cds SAHRA, N'SSI N'SSI, KUTCHE, and KHALED.

For example, the second chapter takes you into VB by building a simple image control. Everything you need is in the chapter.However, the rest of the book seems to have been written in a hurry. I think the book could have done with a rewrite. For example, chapter 12 which discusses API calls mentions that API calls are a way to know when a process has terminated. This is given in a list of four other things which are then demonstrated in the chapter, but how to determine if a process has terminated is not explained. In chapter 5 it was promised that this would be explained (see page 219).These are just two critisms amoungst many. The book is just not laid out in a way which will help you learn VB. I have a problem with it and two colleagues at my work place have used the book and compared it unfavourably with others on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-pound bags?","review":"These are two 1-pound bags, not two 2-pound bags.

I thought I was purchasing some templates - generic data models oriented for specific industries. This book is a teaser for the author's electronic products, which contain the real templates. This book has just enough information to lead you to believe the electronic product is plausable, but not enough to really use the data models discussed(without the expensive downloads). I expected a bunch of entities with the PK and FK attributes ready for customizing with my company specific attributes... NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Model Templates NOT Included!","review":"As others have stated, the CD included with the book is (effectively) only an advertisement for the models for sale on the web site. Frankly, I find this offensive, since books that have CDs are generally much more expensive because (normally) the CD has additional useful content, CDs cost money to make, etc. I doubt that I would buy another of Mr. Silverston's books after having this disappointing experience. The models themselves seem well thought-out and useful, but if you're looking for something that will save you time and money, you'd be better off purchasing a model from one of the many industry-specific standards organizations (e.g. ACORD). Those models will be much more detailed and recognizable between multiple organizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"On: Cavalry, Its History & Tactics","review":"A very thorough volume on the mounted sphere of human conflict. Written expertly in the classical style with an historic sense. Focusing on the role of Cavalry as complementary to attritional based warfighting and conflict of varying intensity, it sets out Cavalry as an indispensible asset to national greatness for the western powers it covers.Will leave the reader with the firm opinion that Cavalry Tactics represent a superior means of engaging and destroying enemies, or bypassing resistance in pursuit of lofty ideals, specified goals, force protection, force projection, combat multiplication.Overall one of the most intelligently written and thorough works in the field of Chivalric Literature in Modernity. Highly recommended for all horesemen, military leaders, political scientists, historians and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug and Play Internet","review":"I used to have a cable modem that was provided by my cable company but I didn't want to pay the monthly lease fee anymore so I went out and bought this D-Link Cable Modem.

I called my cable company and told them I'd be switching modems, they wanted some long number off the back of the modem and said I was all set to go. So I plugged in the coax cable on the modem and plugged in the power.

Have temporarily solved the problem by yanking the circuit board out of the case, hooking up all the connectors and hanging it in front of a small fan. It's not elegant - but it's been up ever since.Maybe their newer model (which looks to have some holes in the case) doesn't have this issue. Maybe I have a lemon.

Comcast increased the cable modem fee from $5 a month to $7 a month. That really irritated the hell out of me. That is why I decided to buy my own modem.If you need to buy a modem to save money and you have Comcast - beware! This probably will not work for you.

It just seemed like Hasbro didn't know how to handle the cape. It looks odd and is split down the sides, showing the Tusken's undergarments (he looks like a mummy).

If you are expecting any historical information or a description of the area beyond visuals, you will not be pleased.I ended up buying the Insight City Guide (made by the Discovery Channel) of New York instead.

However, the coverage is completely restricted to Manhattan, and the rest of the boroughs are condensed into a \\"Farther Afield\\" section. New York City is not equal to Manhattan.

Well, this is it. My one complaint is that it's slightly too big to be a one-egg pan the way *I* like them done, and too small to be a 2-egg pan. For that, and the fact that T-Fal doesn't make very high quality pans, I am tempted to give 3 stars, but for $7, I find it difficult to be so harsh with something that's not poorly designed or poorly executed. It's basically a pan that does what it's supposed to do, yet I don't feel compelled to ever use it, so it mostly collects dust in my cabinet. It's an okay tool to have, but frankly, I find it easier to do fried eggs on a larger surface. If the pan is hot when you drop the egg, the whites won't run far from the yolk anyway, so that's my preferred way to do them. No harm in having this thing though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"I love this little pan, it's perfect for scrambling 1 egg. You can scramble 2 eggs in it, but you have to be much more careful as you turn, so it doesn't splatter on the burner and fry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just ordered a second one for backpacking!","review":"I love this little fry pan for camping or power outages. I use a little tea light stove and this pan fits over it perfectly. Because it's so small the heat doesn't have to distribute as much and so it cooks faster. It's a light little backpacking pan, the nonstick is great, easy to clean, and the quality is excellent. T-fal did a great job with this little jewel. My husband uses it on our electric stove almost every morning to make his egg for his bagel sandwich. So I wanted a second one to keep in my pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I wanted a small skillet to cook just one egg, so I thought this would be ideal. Before I ordered it I even got out a tape measure to give me an idea of the size. The size is exactly as described, but I didn't take in to consideration that it would be too small to use a spatula to flip the egg. I'll buy another skillet a little bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Don't Buy!","review":"I used this pan twice cooking ONLY eggs in it and the non-stick quality failed! my eggs stick to the pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny fry pan","review":"This pan is a real conversation piece hanging on the wall in our kitchen. It might even work but that is not what we use it for.If it had a nice thick base we likely would have but it feels as well as looks like a toy. It certainly has been cost effective in the laughs it has generated so we will keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Fal 4.5-Inch Nonstick One Egg Wonder Problem","review":"I recently received my T-Fal 4.5 inch Nonstick One Egg Wonder in good physical condition.It really looks cute, and appears to be very well built. I then followed their instructions to condition the fry pan's surface.When I tried cooking my first scrambled egg at a low temperature on my gas stove,The bottom of the egg was over-cooked and the top of the egg was still runny.This pan is much too small to flip the egg over, and I do not know if a miniature spatula even exists.This really means that it needs a lid on order to cook the top side of the egg also.Per an email response from the manufacturer, they cannot not supply a lid, even as an option.Now, I will need to try to find a lid from somewhere else, and it most likely will not fit very well.Therefore, I do not recommend this item, and I give it a very poor rating.Richard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"This is too small, I did not realize it would be this tiny when I got it. It looks like a toy, I ended up giving it to my daughter to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Small Non Stick Pan","review":"I had a different non stick pan before with an egg on the handle and though it had started out great the non stick surface came off in no time. The first time you use this you will see the level of quality. Nothing sticks and my home made egg white sandwiches come out perfect and evenly cooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"When it says one Egg it means one egg","review":"It's not kidding about being able to fit a single egg.I was hoping to use this to make grilled sandwiches but it's cramped fitting a single slice of bread.It still works moderately well but only grills and heats about 80% of the sandwich.I use this in a dorm room with a hot plate burner and the amount of space the small pan saves is really outstanding.As far as the heating it heats quickly and evenly due to the circular ring pattern on the bottom of the fry pan.It has been easy to clean with and without grease or butter.When I have used it without butter or something of the sort, the no stick feature is pretty evident as well as nothing has burnt or stuck to the ban and everything has come off easily.Overall it's a great little utility pan for limited space or being on the go but it really is meant to be used for very small portions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a couple of weeks, then got sticky","review":"It's a real shame. I got this pan hoping to be able to fry an egg for my daily sandwich. Worked fine for about 2 weeks before my egg starting stick to the sides and the bottom. Don't know what happened. I normally cook my eggs starting off at moderately high, then low to medium. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too small","review":"I bought this pan to fry single eggs, but it's just to small! Please be aware that even though this pan is advertised as being 4-3/4\\", that measurement is across the top of the pan, which is completely irrelevant. It's infuriating when manufacturers do this, but anyway, the actual bottom of the pan (you know, where you cook) is only 3-3/4\\". For me, that's simply too small for a fried egg. With a fried egg that small, I think the whites are too thick, giving it a strange texture and making it difficult for the whites to reach the proper level of doneness without overcooking the yolks. If the cooking surface were actually the advertised 4-3/4\\", this would probably be a wonderful pan.And yes, it's fairly thin, flimsy, and cheap-feeling, but I'm not holding that against it and it doesn't contribute to my 2-star rating, because, well, it's a cheap pan! As a result, I used this once and it now collects dust in my cabinet; I'll stick to my larger nonstick frying pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely lasted 5 months","review":"The pan is just the right size, it doesn't tip over, and the handle never gets hot. Unfortunately, the nonstick coating just didn't last. We always use nonstick safe spatulas and wait for it to cool before hand-washing, so really not sure what went wrong. I know it is a really inexpensive pan, but it is never a good thing to notice that a bunch of the nonstick material has suddenly disappeared. Let's just hope it went down the drain and not in with the eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, not too practical","review":"I thought this would be great for making fried eggs, because when I make them in regular pans, they're never nice and circular. The problem with this pan is that it's impossible to flip the egg, so it always ends up like a mess. (Maybe if I had a tiny spatula...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This was the worse ever.. looked like a toy.. was certainly not worth the money.. even if it was not very much.."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no","review":"on no... it is for kids????......i mean... it looks cute and beautiful....but... come on..... it is not that useful in real life....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use for LOW heat only","review":"There was nothing in the review about heat and when I checked the instructions, it said low heat only which is quite useless to me. I gave it away, not worth the return."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it...","review":"This was not a need but a want. I am a gadget freak and I also like good quality kitchen appliances.Works very well...to make MY Egg M?Muffins. I wish it had a lid..but it does not and so I use a small plate to cover.T-Fal...are you listening....how about a simple cover...with a simple handle... thanks :) This would give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egg pa","review":"This pan is great for one egg. I found that if you let the egg cook until the bottom is set, you can easily flip the egg using a fork. I do agree that a little lid would be a great addition to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walmart sells this for $6","review":"I was fooled buying here, paying a little overbut I don't mind, since I got it delivered to home - No taxbeware that the second Image(one with two steel rings)in the Images is not the Item what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"This little pan is great for cooking 1 egg, scrambled or fried, although stirring/flipping isn't easy in such a tiny pan. Still, it's so much better than using a larger skillet to cook just 1 egg because it tends to run all over even an 8-inch skillet. This pan works well for 1 veggie burger, too!Because of the small size, I have to use this pan on the smallest burner of my gas range so the flame doesn't come up around the pan. I am careful to hold the handle while cooking in this pan because it is so lightweight. But the cooking time is short, so that's not really an issue for me. The manufacturer recommends hand washing, which takes less than a minute. I took away 1 star because I think the product would be better if it was just an inch larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan for single eggs","review":"I use this pan when cooking eggs for breakfast sandwiches. Perfect size and a truly non-stick pan - eggs do not stick at all so no broken yolks and super easy cleanup. You won't be disappointed with this pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Little Skillet","review":"This is a cute little skillet and my boss loves it. I will have to see if it really holds up and is none stick like advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK-I get the JOKE","review":"I read all the reviews before ordering two of these. For six bucks, you can't go wrong. NOW I get the joke of other reviewers who said such things as \\"Is this a toy?\\" This itsy-bitsy pan really will cook one egg but don't expect it to do anything else. It really is just big enough for one egg. I cooked mine with a slice of cheese on top during the final minute and there was barely room for the cheese. I gave one to my son & DIL but don't think they'll use it. If you have a few extra bucks, order the cute little turner/spatula with the eggie face. This thing is the perfect size for your One-Egg-Wonder pan. It's also cheap enough to throw away if you happen to ruin it by overheating. I gave it 4 stars, not due to any issue but that fifth star is reserved for really outstanding products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever but not high quality","review":"I got this pan so I can make breakfast sandwiches and actually get the egg in the shape like the egg McMuffins at McDonalds. It works like a charm so far. The non stick surface is always great at first but this pan is definitely not high end so I'm dubious about how long it's going to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small mini gift book.
