It was very easy to set up, and has been working perfectly ever since. Having one reliable atomic clock in the house is useful, as all appliances drift somewhat, and so do mechanical watches. The wireless remote temperature sensor has also been working reliably. I just placed in under a bench on the deck, and it has survived so far (in the wet Seattle climate).Also, the station has a memory for highest/lowest temperatures (one for the station, one for the remote sensor), which is nice when you want to know exactly how hot/cold it got last night.I haven't been using the weather forecast much, so I won't comment on it.I still haven't had to change the batteries (almost 6 months of use by now).Altogether, I'm very happy with the purchase (less than $35), and would recommend this unit to anyone looking for an inexpensive atomic clock/temperature sensor combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product-bad information","review":"The weather station and remote sensor work very well, however, when you order the basic weather station, Amazon suggests ordering the wireless remote with the basic unit. When the product arrives you find the wireless remote is included with the base unit. If you're a dope like me, you'll assume that one remote is for indoors, and the other's for outdoors. This is not the case. The base unit reads indoor data and the wireless remote that comes with it goes outside. Guess I'll put the extra sensor on the other side of the house as the unit will gather info from two outside sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchasing this weather station was a mistake","review":"I read (and unfortunately ignored) the reviews of others describing their poor experience with this product. I purchased the product because it appeared to have the features I needed. The first product that shipped worked for about 30 days and failed (the failure mode seems to be that the outside transmitter just stops working, followed closely by the base unit display failure). After replacing batteries and resynchronizing the units, it still did not work. I contacted La Crosse and shipped the product back to the company. After about 3 weeks, I received a new (rather than refurbished) replacement that also only worked for about 30 days. It too failed again and I just tossed it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"After ordering this product I read reviews that the exterior transmitter worked only for a short period of time and that a replacement cost as much as the entire unit.

A piece of junk and waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"The first one I bought didn't even work, I sent it back and they told me it was a bad unit so they sent me another one. That unit worked fine for 2 months and now, looses the outdoor temperature reading every 4-5 days. When I call them to report this ongoing problem they tell me to remove the batteries and wait 15 minutes and put them back in. Works fine for another few days.There's not much that is accurate about this product.

What is the point of having a weather station that doesn't properly report the temperature.It also doesn't tell the correct day, date, or time.

I had a much larger more expensive La Crosse, but it fell and broke.

The only bright spot is that it was offered for less than $20.00.The time, date, and day work, but I have a clock and calendar for that. Definitely not worth purchasing.

After she followed the setup instructions, the outside temp would not display on the unit. She tried all troubleshooting techniques available, to no avail. So I had her send me the unit thinking it was user error, but alas, I could not get the outdoor temp to display either. So I sent an inquiry through LaCrosse's warranty website, and it took them several days to respond. They had me go through similar troubleshooting techiniques, and then told me to ship the unit to them...at my cost! One week later I received the unit back indicating the sensor was bad and they had replaced it. No apology. No sorry for the inconvenience. No refund of my shipping cost.

That doesn't mean the wood is falling off, just the finish. Also, this unit did not work for very long.

This was especially annoying at 3:00 in the morning. After reseting the entire unit, it worked for awhile and then began acting erratically once again. There have been times I wanted to throw the whole thing away, but I have persisted. The outdoor transmitter stopped working - even with a reset and battery replacement of both units. This makes the whole unit somewhat useless, since I really want to know the temperature outside. Craftsmanship is mediocre at best, but looked good initially with the wooden face plates, but after 6 months of use (sitting there), the veneered wooden layer started peeling off. It has been a disappointment. I realize it was not the \\"top of the line\\" unit, but it wasn't the bottom line unit either.

I received it it a timely manner but it wouldn't communicate with the remote. I tried all the suggested fixes on LaCrosse's web page to no avail. I then sent them a message about the problem. They acknowledged receipt of the message and had forwarded it to the support group who would be contacting me in a \\"timely manner\\". That was eight days ago.

The time is now incorrect for a reason that I do not know. Neither my friend or I will dare to reset the time and risk having to set everything else again.

Anyway, I've got too much to do in the mornings to wait around for the TV. There are loads of these kinds of devices on the market, but very few with a sensor for indoor humidity, which I wanted. This along with the \\"forecast\\" feature, makes this one VERY useful device. The only thing I'd change is having the display backlit, because it can sometimes be a little difficult to see in certain light conditions...Conclusion: Works as advertized, delivers the necessary information with no fuss, and amazingly, it's REALLY accurate with the forecasts.

I Had to Return This.","review":"Because I have another, higher-end LaCrosse weather station, I thought this would make a good replacement for an Oregon Scientific one I had been using on the second-floor. Boy, was I wrong. Even after three days, the atomic clock wouldn't set, and the outdoor temperature sensor, placed in exactly the same location as the Oregon Scientific one, communicated only intermittently. Most of the time, the outdoor temperature never registered. The indoor temperature reading worked fine, but since I bought it for the atomic clock and outdoor temperature, the unit was completely useless.If you are still considering purchasing this, check the specs for the size. It's very small and, for that reason, not all that easy to read even when it is working. I just ordered theAmbient Weather Wireless Advanced Weather Station.

However, aboveabout 80 degrees it's not even close to being accurate! Up to 80, it's just fine,and the outdoor sensor seems fine (below 80 - it's not that hot here now, so whoknows what it'll do then). When the interior of the greenhouse is 85-90F (as verified by 2 otherthermometers, both of which agree), this unit registers 107!! I won't bother sendingit back, as it's still useful for humidity and outdoor temps, as well as the timeI guess... but I had to add a different thermometer for getting an accurate readinginside the greenhouse. A $3 bargain kitchen dial thermometer from the grocery storeis VASTLY more accurate for my purpose.I wouldn't buy it again had I known it's so wacked out above 80F."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdoor sensor quit working too soon","review":"I purchased a La Crosse WS-7014CH-IT Wireless Forecast Station. It worked perfectly for about 4 months, at which point the sensor that was supposed to receive the outdoor temperature quit working. And, the problem was definitely with the inside receiver as a second (cheaper) La Crosse indoor/outdoor thermometer located elsewhere in my home continues to work, providing both inside and outside temperatures. This meant that the sending unit placed outside the house was still sending a proper signal. The problem is with the inside unit. And, it is not a battery problem, as I replaced them and it still did not work.If you check out many other reviews, you will see this is a common problem. I would not buy another La Crosse unit.JMR"},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer service","review":"Worked for about a month after purchasing.

I ended up thinking the book was more an info-mercial than true helpful information. Personal experience with energy workers and extensive reading has lead me to believe that our energy is a key to health, though thinking that a photograph and computer can get the work done seems EXTREMELY far fetched to me. On the subject of karma the book really turned a wacky direction in my estimation. I am still confused that it is recommended by some nationally recognized speakers that seem to have lots of good words to share.(?) Life is for learning!

Somehow, this bit of fiction is the basis for a very big business based on Energy Balancing of your photograph. Those who are helped by this should rather understand the great power of their own minds in this process and that the story should not to be taken seriously (as all the disclaimers imply). If, as in the story, your photograph can be used to change your health, what if he gets it wrong or choses to use this for harm? Can he kill you or make you grow a third leg or go crazy?

Secondly, there are no supporting facts-we are told that Max can cure anything with drops and energy balancing, but there's no proof.I suppose Max and everyone in his family will live until they are 150 years old since this approach has all the answers. The stories in it remind me of 60's drug-induced hallucinations. Einstein would be rolling in his grave if he knew his name was being associated with this nonsense.The paranoia about medical treatments is just that--paranoia.The philosophy isn't even logical. I love how they use quotes from people like Confucious, Fromm, and Dylan to make their book sound deep and factual--puleese!They have pure fiction here and they are trying to sell it as nonfiction--can't have it both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they lived happily forever after! (or did they?)","review":"This is an entertaining bit of fiction and there are plenty of disclaimers to let everyone know not to believe a word of it. And yet, you get thinking that Max might make a mistake and cause someone to grow a third leg , to go crazy or to develop cancer. As you read the book, you wonder whether he could make zombis out of all of his subjects. Unfortunately the incidence of such side effects is not reported in the book. Where do all the side effect people go? Can they come to him and get changed back or is it permanent? (If it is permanent, there may be no legal recourse because of all of the disclaimers!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational","review":"Thanks to Lewis and Slawson for educating so many about the emerging field of Energetic Balancing. The evolution of the AIM program from drops to photos is an amazing story and they cleverly use a novel format to keep the reader engaged.

Not because it was good, but because it is REPETITIOUS, REPETITIOUS, REPETITIOUS. It all could have been said in one very short chapter. The rest of it is vague repetition of a few ideas, said over and over again.I expected to be impressed by this book as I am avidly interested in quantum and vibrational energy, but I ended up feeling I had wasted my time in reading this drivel.Also, I noticed that in all these reviews, not one person described a disease he/she was cured from. Not one!So basically, Lewis invented a vague computer program that only HE can access. Gee, what happens in a power failure?I have concluded that this is just another MLM money-making scheme.I use energetic products from Advanced Tachyon Technologies that really work at a very reasonable price.

Save yer' money and pray it's re-released on an LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING SINGER/SONGWRITER DEFINES ECLECTIC.","review":"My heart nearly sank when I saw that this title may be going out of print; I purchased at least 5 copies when it was released based on what has happened to wonderful CDs like this in the past. Toni Childs is one of the most distinctive and, yes, accessible songstresses in the tradition of Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and Nina Simone. If that lists sounds far apart in styles, yet appealing, then you'll understand Toni Childs. The African and other world rhythms that punctuate most of her work are all on display here; I dare anyone to listen to \\"Zimbabwe\\" or \\"Let The Rain Come Down\\" without feeling your spirit being noticeably lifted, nourished, and rejuvenated. While \\"Union\\" and \\"House of Hope\\" are also must-haves, this is an outstanding collection of some of Ms. Child's best work. That voice will haunt you and her songs will enrich your life in ways that only the most precious performers can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE COLLECTION!","review":"Couldn't agree more with the past reviewer about Toni Childs musical journey. I have enjoyed her music from the first time I heard of her in the late 1980's. First rate soulful singer-belter with something to say and a great \\"world-beat\\" sound. A unique vocalists to say the least and highly under-rated! I especially love the 4 newer cuts from her last studio effort, \\"The Woman's Boat\\" from 1994."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate - Toni Childs, yes...it is!","review":"The CD I reach for. Her Zimbabwe is, simply put, magical. The entire CD is an experience for all real lovers of great lyrics. This CD will take you from preparing your meal with a loved one, to enjoying the food, to raising a glass of fine wine, to clearing the table, to holding hands on the sofa, to embracing at the end of a long day. It's the CD for insightful people in or out of love. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What On Earth is a \\"Firking?!!!Please Advise On My New Email Address If You Are Persistent Enough To Locate It!!!","review":"Toni Childs has one of those very distinctive voices that you either love or hate. To me she sounds like she has a Mezzo Soprano bullfrog caught in her throat. There is one track on this album called \\"Stop Your Fussing\\" but it sounds like she is singing\\"Stop Your Firking\\" . I don't know just what on Earth a \\"Firking\\" is but please feel free to Email me if you can solve this mysterious puzzle. I give this album 5 stars because Ms. Childs enjoyed her 15 minutes of fame and then fell into that Great Wasteland of Music Obscurity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"This is one big disappointment. There are simply too many negatives to this video--don't waste your money! I was surprised to find that this was so poorly done, compared to the 3 other Saffell videos I own and use regularly.The production is so poorly done, half the time you can't hear what she's saying. The volume and quality of her voice vary with her moves, so at times it's muffled. The lighting is awful and the camera changes angles so frequently it's impossible to see what they're doing, nevermind follow it. It looks very amateurish.Usually Janis gives too much instruction and too many demo's before picking up the pace. Here it's the opposite---we go right into complicated moves with little instruction and even less practice. So frustrating it's no fun.Janis is capable of much, much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, modern and uniquely shaped","review":"I bought a small set (probably not this one with 53 pieces) a couple years back and am looking for more, but darn they discontinued it.

Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"great star trek compilation","review":"Very good performances by various orchestras. There are A LOT of star trek themes in this CD so it may be a little overwhelming to play this CD from start to finish. Tracks #2, #9, and #11 are my favorite. Jerry Goldsmith just does a fantastic job on Star Trek arrangements in general. #9 by Frederic Talgorn is probably the most unique of all the arrangements on the theme and I happened to like his the best. Very nice chord progressions with the high woodwinds and lower strings providing a good pulse to the piece. His ability to interweave the star trek theme towards the end of the piece was also expertly handled. The speed and general pacing of this piece is much faster than the original recording that is played in the end credits of \\"Generations.\\" I happen to like this version much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Been there, heard that...\\"","review":"To anyone who has collected Star Trek musical scores on CD over the years, this latest compilation offers little. As recognizable as the title themes are, they can all be found on previously released Star Trek CD's (...some over and over and OVER again). Varese Sarabande's best contribution to the list of Trek music currently available on CD has been their re-recorded releases of episodic suite music used in the scoring of Star Trek's original 1960's television series. With so many other Star Trek episode suites yet unreleased, why re-package a predictable selection of theme music yet again...? Had there been even one previously unreleased track on this CD, I would have purchased it ...but there isn't, so I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"great G movie but why isn't it on DVD","review":"Great movie.

It is kind of boring and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla vs Super-Mechagodzilla","review":"the above is the REAL title for this fil (Godzilla vs. Super-Mechagodzilla), if Tristar would only realise it!JeersNothing.Rating out of 5\\"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\\" is, I feel, the best film out of the new series. You can draw a lot of comparisons between this film and a film like \\"Godzilla vs. Mothra\\" 1964, in that their is a synergy of plot, direction, and effects which makes the sum much greater than the parts. Everything about this film just \\"fits\\" well. As it is this film is the only new Godzilla film which come close to matching the experience found in \\"Gamera:GOTU\\" or \\"Gamera vs. Legion\\". A stellar effort and a film most deserving of a cherished place in your video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla II","review":"All good, Was very happy and will order more from this seller. Thank You very much. Happy new year 2013..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one of the best Godzilla movies made.","review":"This movie is great!! It is far better than the original 1974 classic. And this movie has some of the best special effects of any of these movies. With the appearance of Radan, this makes the movie that much more enjoyable. And in this version of Mechagodzilla, the mighty lizard is nearly destroyed my the mechanical menace, unlike in the first one where the battle wasn't all that impressive. Plus in this movie, we actually get to see Godzilla's offspring, but it still isn't made clear if Godzilla is a male or female, but it won't really matter to all you fans, don't worry this isn't another Minya from \\"Son of Godzilla\\" or \\"Godzilla's Revenge\\" The Mechagodzilla looks awesome and puts it's 1974 and 1975 counterparts to shame. This is my second favorite Heisei Series (1984-1995) film, only preceeded by \\"Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"When Tristar first released the Heisei series, I eagerly got a copy of King Ghidorah, and it was so good I thought nothing could top it. Then I got Godzilla vs. Destroyer, and it again seemed like the best of the lot. This can't be topped, I told myself with total certainty.Then I saw Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. It puts them both to shame! Rodan looks ten times cooler than the 60's version, and Mechagodzilla is more badass than ever before. Godzilla is better done than ever before in the Heisei series, and Baby Godzilla actually looks like a baby Godzillasaurus and not some freakish escapee from a wax museum! If you are even a remote G- Fan, you owe it to yourself to see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!","review":"Take it from me! This is the best godzilla movie.

Rodan arrives to collect the egg, but Godzilla also is on a quest to gather the egg. Narrowly escaping the destruction that the struggle of the two monsters cause, the egg hatches in Baby Godzilla. Godzilla and Rodan return to collect it, but Mechagodzilla gets into the way to attack. Now who will claim to be Baby Godzilla's mother [or father]? Will Mechagodzilla innhilate the two monsters and leave Baby Godzilla alone with mankind?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, Poor overall.","review":"I like godzilla. This movie unfortunately is terrible. The acting is silly and childish, the dialogue is [bad] and the plot is as simple as ever.

It is no classic. Image quality is so poor that even mountains are difficult to distiguish. This movie is sadly morbid in music, tone and narration. There are no interesting dinosaur shots. There are no characters. Found it to be a total disappointment, as did, by the way, my five year old. This is rather gutsy for anyone to be selling B rate TV fare as if it were of value today.

A happy surprise lies in your future, most likely.Then there's the not so good, specifically the feminist/political stuff.

Although I support gay rights (and gay marriages), I *don't* want to read erotic lesbian literature -- much less in a cookbook -- and found that aspect very offensive. I was also annoyed to find numerous seafood recipes in a cookbook that claims to be vegetarian. Since most appetizers, side dishes, breads, and desserts are meatless, the main draw of a vegetarian cookbook is that of the main dishes -- of which there aren't very many, especially when you eliminate those that contain seafood. (They could have at least put those in a separate chapter.) Although the recipes are excellent, there are a number of vegetarian cookbooks with excellent vegetarian recipes and no lesbian poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Ok I was NOT expecting this from DW...The beater in the picture looks waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay smaller than the one I got.

This book must be read by everyone. Merging a product with something that has meaning, and how it's done -- until the soul-entity becomes the product -- are simply amazing and eye-opening. The author writes that an advertiser's goal is to hollow out the meaning of something and replace it with a man made product.

He teaches - heal the soul first , then the mind and body will follow which I think makes his teaching so extraordinary and powerful. He reverses the commonly used statement- mind,body,and soul....into the order of importance saying it should be soul,mind,and body .

How could it miss? Ah, but it does. Ingrid is very implausible as the servant/mother figure to Warner's sons after Fay's untimely death. Ingrid and Warner learn to love each other. Then, because of gossip, she leaves him and the sons in the lurch. Enter some years later, Susan as a vixen engaged to one son but making her play for another. Enter Ingrid again to put a stop to this shameful behavior. Enter me to turn it off.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Much","review":"Was disappointed to find out that only two small sections in the front of the hair actually change color. In addition, the color changes from a blueish violet color to blue. Which means the change is hardly visibile. To make the color change back you have to use a small cloth type thing that you put a piece of ice in. So I don't know why the description says it changes with a magic brush. My four year old was excited to play with it but after less than one minute of rubbing the washcloth and barely seeing a color change she walked away.Also, her doll came with really cute orange boots but they do NOT stay on which is really frustrating to a four year old. Overall I am NOT impressed with this doll!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well made!","review":"Seems to well made and has worked for me. We have a 60 lb goldendoodle and it keeps him tied up just fine.

A few hours later, I hooked them up again (using the other, non defective tie-out) and that one broke, I chased my other puppy for half an hour, in 10 degree weather, he almost got hit by a car..that tie-out was stripped of it's coating as well...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

The book does not attempt to be an historical documentary, but rather a touching story that will appeal to little ones' sensibilities. The author's note at the end accurately explains the history behind the story, which parents can gradually explain to children as their interest develops.What a marvelous companion this book would be to an introduction of Vivaldi's \\"musical story\\" about nature and the changing seasons. In my experience as a music teacher, children love \\"acting out\\" the birds, thunder storms, etc. while listening to the Four Seasons.

Ben has a fresh take on an ongoing problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking Overview of Evangelical Theology","review":"Witherington's book analyzes the exegetical shortcomings of Reformed Theology, Dispensationalism and Wesleyanism. The main point of the book is to say that every system of evangelical theology has its blind spots. These exegetical weaknesses can be overcome by a return to commitment to knowing the first century context of the New Testament. In addition, Witherington says there must be a commitment to reject modern thinking which has influenced our theology. Witherington says that the parts of each theological system that make it distinctive are the places of greatest exegetical weakness. I am sure that proponents of the various views would strongly disagree, but this is Witherington's contention. This book caused me to think about my own theological presuppositions and the need to seek the truth in a deeper way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant and ad hominem attacks","review":"Witherington engages in irrelevant and ad hominem attacks. He has not interacted with, or even significantly referenced, serious dispensational scholarship. The author is entitled to his views but that entitlement does not give him a license to be less than accurate, painting an incomplete and unbalanced picture of dispensationalism. And it certainly does not give him the right to be dismissive, derisive, harsh, or censorious in his unfair criticism of dispensational theology. As one dispensational scholar once wrote: \\"Normative dispensationalism is a legitimate, worthy, and conservative viewpoint. Other Christians do not have to agree with it, but they should represent it fairly and treat its contributions with respect. This is simply a matter of Christian integrity and courtesy.\\" Unfortunately, Witherington misses the mark completely regarding both integrity and scholarship in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight to America's Royalty","review":"This set offers terrific insight into the Kennedy Family, their flaws, their triumphs and their history."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Ash to Ash","review":"I have read everything he has written with consistent satisfaction.He is original,engaging and a\\"deep\\" poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"What age are we in that DVD's have to be turned over in the middle of the movie?

This book is anything but. It takes on the form of a narrative ... one gets the feeling that they are reading a novel. This really made the book quite easy for me to read. Even in light of this, the book does not lose the scholarly element - it is still written very precisely, impeccably, and insightfully. It is very attentive to detail, and does not miss a beat. This is just a phenomenal work. I plan on reading it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to another DBZ saga","review":"This is a great beginning to another saga in Dragonball Z. It begins with Gohan and everyone on Earth thinking that everything is fine, but soon trouble finds them. Frieza and his father, King Cold, land and are set on destroying everything. All of a sudden, Trunks shows up and the battle begins. This is a great tape and shouldn't be missed, but also get the next tape, Prelude to Terror, to see what happens after the cliffhanger at the end of this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Super Saiyan?!!!","review":"While Goku is still out in space, Gohan is in the School of Hard Knocks, literally. But then he senses a presence. Is it possible? Is Frieza still alive? It looks like it and it looks like it he and his father King Cold are heading to earth and the Z fighters are faced with a dilemma without Goku, but who is this purple haired dude? Does he have a death wish? It looks like this unknown soldier seems to have made a wild claim to destroy Frieza, but when he transforms into a super saiyan, it's obvious that Frieza is no match for this mysterious youth. But when Frieza did his Death Ball attack and blasted a hole in it, it looked like he finished off this unknown Super Saiyan, but he launched a explosive attack and he was about to slice Frieza in half. Is the terror really over? Has Frieza finally been destroyed? And who is this unknown Super Saiyan?

Trunks is an awsome addition to the Z team with amazing powers at a young age. You see him face off with Freeza and Freeza's father King Cold. Trunks proves to be an excellent warrior and shows great skill when fighting. Best of all he is a Super Saiyan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funimation's DBZ ? No thanks....","review":"Dont get me wrong DBZ is one of my fave animes. But the way it was dubbed (King Cold *shudder*) was pretty poor. Funimation has improved with the Trunks/Andriod saga but the script changes wernt needed. I wouldn't mind as much if the uncut verson was $5 more for 15 seconds of footage the skiped over on the tv show. If you like DBZ go get the DVD version so you can watch the subbed version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HARDCORE/PUNK","review":"WOW! This album is awesome. Officer Negative stays true to their old skool punk roots while expanding a little bit giving it a more hardcore sound. Don't get me wrong. I'm not labeling it as an \\"eclectic\\" album.

They keep a very steady sound on this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"punk rock for jesus...man how things have changed","review":"Oh great just what we really really need these days...Christian punk rock...well Officer Negative is a very boring band. If they quit showing off their love for Christ for 2 seconds then maybe they...well they'd still (...).

Although the story is rich in its references to Jewish tradition, the story is accessible to everyone, regardless of background (including those who are not Jewish). It is an extremely powerful story that guarantees an emotional response from its readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mannheim c.d.","review":"The person I bought this for for Christmas does not like it at all.

Great sound and great quality recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Chosen Sampling of the Past 25 Years","review":"18th-century rock 'n' roll? Neo-classical? Progressive electronic? Whatever you call the music of Omahan Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller, this is an adequate sampling of the music they've been churning out for the past 25 years. [At less than 90 minutes over two discs, it's not over-generous, but there are 25 tracks. (25 tracks, 25 years--get it?)]Virtually every album from the Steamroller catalog and Davis' Day Parts series is represented. The music is at times raucus, the next moment introspective and serene (and even sometimes a bit formulaic) as it combines elements of classical music with plenty of synthesizers and percussion into its trademark pop orchestral sound.True fans will probably already own all of the individual CDs sampled on this collection. But for the unitiated who perhaps are wondering why Steamroller has managed to sell more than 20 million albums, this is an excellent place to start. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Perfect Collection of Great Music.","review":"Perfect for those who like Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas work and want to hear more of what Mannheim Steamroller has to offer. The 25th Year Celebration set takes its listeners to \\"Another Place,\\" (as the song is entitled). with a wonderful integration of the greatest songs in the early Fresh Aire series with the newest work on the upcoming DVD, Fresh Aire 8. If you want the greatest songs in the Fresh Aire series (or never heard them before) and don't want to buy all the albums, this is the next best thing!

The only way to make it simpler is to have someone else do it. The drive to the repair shop alone will take longer than the repair will take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for Japan","review":"Don't buy this product if you're travelling into Japan.I am sure it's a good adapter when used in the right place, but both the description on this page AND on the packaging for this adapter says it should be compatible with most outlets in Japan. How about 0? Every wall outlet I found in Japan had only two slots without a ground hole.Actually, this product looks like it would adapt a Japanese appliance into a North American outlet, but I was looking for the opposite. I keep feeling like I must have misread something, but if you are hoping this adapter will work with a North American plug in a Japanese wall outlet, this is NOT the product you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"There's a lot of adaptors on the market that I wouldn't really trust due to poor quality. I originally got one of these by chance. It's perfect so it prompted me to by another 4!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TEAR JERKING - HEART WARMING STORY!","review":"DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP.The Story of Trent Murdock and Bailey Chancellor touches a wide range of emotions. The Story of little Sarah really held the characters together. Sarah was truly of the angels.Would have like to have seen the 57 Chevy - souped up you say? Chase was great but a bit short. Macy becomes an endearing character, glad she didn't get hurt.With the characters hang-ups and fears, the popping into bed seemed a bit on the stupid side. But hey, I lay that demand at the door of the editors. Only ichy spot in a great story.B. Mott must have a bit of knowledge of the Arabian horses which was refreshing, I loved the way she incorporated them into the story adding more demension to the characters.

They enjoy hearing the story of when they were a baby with their picture on each page. I think it's a great keepsake."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a journal than a book....","review":"While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's watch the text roll by.","review":"I expected a lot out of this book. But it bored me to death. Here is the plot:A $.75 accounting discrepancy alerts an Astronomer cum Computer Scientist to a Cracker's presence in his system.Like a cat that never pounces, he watches, and alerts the appropriate authorities, who in turn point the finger round and round until the Cracker returns. Rinse. repeat. Occasionally, the protagonist is away from the lab, living his life when he is called away, but we really don't care because those characters are flat and lifeless. Maybe the general public finds the Cracker's methods described in the book as intriguing, but as a computer professional, there were no surprises. The final chapter is speculation based pieced together from the gossip, rumor, and headlines.Don't bother reading this. If you do bother, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Accidental Patriot","review":"Quite a story, especially because it is all true. If it wasn't, I would have chided Stoll for such a cartoonish portrayal of the FBI and CIA. Three-quarters of the book through, after seeing evidence of monitoring of hundreds of sessions including attacks on dozens of military computers, one of them said something like \\"So this is all about you losing seventy-five cents?\\" How Stoll avoided running screaming out of the city is beyond me. Quite a guy, and it is very noteworthy that this seemingly textbook leftist academic from what even he called the \\"People's Republic of Berkeley\\" chose to defend our country, at a cost of big chunks of his life, endangering his career, and ticking off those around him, when the FBI and CIA just plain wouldn't. Something to think about, Beltway boys. In the meantime, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read.","review":"I've read Mr. Stoll's fine book in my hard cover version more than once and now again on my Kindle.There are interesting videos on You Tube about Mr. Stoll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good page turner","review":"If you're into RL detective stories with a big helping of international intrigue and lots of 3 letter agencies with their fingers in the pie this is probably right up you alley. Stoll does a good job keeping the story moving (it helps if you are a bit of a computer geek) and makes the story quite compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service for a great book!","review":"This story by Mr. Stoll is a stand out among many stories that have emerged from our culture. We understand that the story is true, but unlike so many fact based stories that end up being somewhat rigid in the telling, The Cuckoo's Egg comes alive with characters we all seem to have met in our own daily lives. The intrigue of the chase is exhilarating as the intuitive brilliance of Mr.Stoll brings us along on his journey from a bored scientist, who has been 'down-sized', to a frantic paced international detective story with dire national security issues. This book doesn't just set the measure, but it is the measure by which all books in this genre are judged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"This book is a fascinating look at the Internet before more than a handful of people even knew what the Internet was. The book is an exciting tale of espionage with a twist of science on top. I learned a lot about the Internet, yet the story wasn't compromised. I've read other \\"computer stories\\" and this is by far the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a must-read for anyone in computer security!!!","review":"Well written, well laid out, and by far, a definite read for anyone persuing computer security work. Stoll's book completely changed my pattern of thought regarding computer security. What is most frightening about this book is the \\"what if\\" factor.What if he never noticed what was going on...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting - Every page better then the last.","review":"I read the book over the course of one week during the summer. I found myself not being able to put it down or get anything else done for that matter. Cliff Stoll's description of the prey trying to outwit the preditor was fascinating. Some computer terms are used and if you don't know anything about them you might find yourself lost in the technospeak. Great Job Cliff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute \\"Must-Read\\" for All interested in Computers","review":"I read this book for my Information Networks and Networking class. Our instructor wanted to see how complex the cyber community is and how easy it is for someone to trapaise through the networks to explore databases and websites of others. And how easy it is to destroy the trust that is expected from everyone participating in that community. Cliff Stoll shows the potential danger of hackers. He also points out the advantages and disadvantages of not securing your systems. We are open books when we decide to participate on the Web, our privacy and safety are challenged.I found \\"The Cuckoo's Egg\\" to be a quick read and very informative. Since I am not a technical person, I found the language that Cliff Stoll used, to demystify the realm of computers, very easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good spy/ mystery/ thriller and loves computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most enticing mystery....","review":"The author tells an amazing story of crime in our day and age, of one that he himself lived, and finally came to solve, all while trying to live a normal life; not that you could call his life normal. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a mystery. Enticing and fun to read. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding security novel","review":"The best computer story I have read. Cliff Stoll does an outstanding job of telling his story based on the log files he generated by tracking the hacker. A must read for those interested in computer security."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"Cliff Stoll's account of what happened when he began monitoring the activities of someone who had broken into his computer system is enlightening and entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in computer security or online culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, not great, but very good","review":"Very interesting. if you have to experience in Unix/linux, shell commends, and networking all of the little tidbits of code and commends that are used will be interesting (\\"Hey i have used that commend... I could write that Trojan...\\" - Myself). Really shows the beginning stages of people using national and worldwide networks (internet). It also has its funny moments, got to love the shower scene. At times gets a little dull, running back and forth but overall READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable tale, yet this is a true story!","review":"I don't know what took me so long, but I finally, finally read this book. And once I did, I couldn't put it down. This is part computer security and communications technology history, part espionage/spy story, part a peek into the seemingly counterintuitive world of governmental bureaucracy. In a world where the Internet is now a deeply ingrained part of our culture, and all kinds of security traps seek to exploit the innocent on the 'Net, this is a refreshing account of the innocent early days of Internet computing. This is a really, really good, entertaining and enlightening read. Thank you, Mr. Stoll, for busting the bad guys and also for this amazing account of what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read all these years later","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend of mine. I'm a computer engineer who is just a little too young to identify with the systems described in this book. I found this book fascinating in the descriptions of how Cliff Stoll and his contemporaries viewed computer networks in the late 80's. It was a very different world back then.The book is well written and doesn't get bogged down in code or anything like that. Stoll adds just enough personal story to this book to make it interesting while focusing mostly on his search for his elusive hacker. He even includes his chocolate chip cookie recipe in the footnotes!Overall, this book is a great piece of computer history and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"As you can see from the reviews here, many people also love this book.I love the trip down memory lane that this book provides. Sure is fun to go back to a more innocent time and remember what it was like before the internet became huge. If you remember archie, gopher, kermit, then this is a book for you.Even if you're too young to remember this time, it would be quite fun to watch WAR GAMES and then read this book. I love the writing style--this is a real page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book the week it was released.","review":"I knew Cliff (by e-mail) from computer security work I was involved in at the time with the Fed...I was 18 at the time. I have read and re-read this book at least 20 times and it never wears thin. Cliff knew how to tell the story in laymen's terms as at the time he began his hunt he was one. This was the first well publicized crack and even got its own PBS special. An excellent read and even moreso when one considers that no one knew just how significant an issue computer security would be in the future touching not just those in academia and government, but every day folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written and entertaining.","review":"A \\"hacker\\" book that appeals to the computer fan and theespionage fan alike. Stoll has a talent for writing notseen lately. This is the first \\"computer/internet\\" bookthat I've ever heard described as \\"Exciting\\" and \\"APage-Turner\\". Highly Recommended, to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to the missing .75 cents...","review":"We get an incredibly engaging page-turner of an astronomer/system manager tracking down a foreign hacker. Cliff Stoll genuinely struggles and questions his own actions not knowing whether he is doggedly tracing some hapless student or a nefarious spy. In the end he overcomes his Berkeley counterculture distrust of all those three letter gov't agencies and develops a respect for their work if not their inability to coordinate or communicate interdepartmentally. He becomes a security expert they all seek but laments the lack of openness and the attack on trust that is required in the academic world in order to facilitate networking and the exchange of ideas. A really good story and there is a pretty good recipe for chocolate cookies on page 155."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Computer History Read","review":"This book is really 4.5 stars. I was not completely enthralled with the book but was captivated by the story. This is almost a genesis story for computer security and is therefore an important read. I was impressed with the detail that Cliff Stoll put in to the retelling of his tracking of the hacker and all the trials and tribulations that he encountered trying to get government agencies to take him and the incident seriously. The sad thing is that it took over 20 years for these agencies and government in general to really wake up to the threats truly knowledgeable \\"hackers\\" pose to business and society in general.I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the computer security field or just enjoy a good thriller. I can't give it 5 stars because it just didn't hold my attention to the point of \\"Couldn't put it down.\\" It definitely is a 4.5+ star book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy To Read, If Nothing Else","review":"As a computer security case story, it is a pleasantly easy read, and Stoll generally succeeds at making a fairly dry and abstract matter readable to Joe Bloggs (i. e. me). Unfortunately this book is written along the lines of the American school of easy - to - read - yet - voluminous - enough - to - look - good - on - my - bookshelf writing, which means that two thirds are actually made up of inane stories of Clifford's personal life in which he essentially tries to sucker up to his readership -- \\"check it out, I'm just such a whacky hippy\\". Unfortunately, though not for lack of trying, he fails to concile his flower - power stance with his eager cooperation with some decidedly unmellow intelligence agencies. Which one is it going to be, Clifford -- snitch or freak? You can't have it both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"This book was way too long. The tale of the missing money and the subsequent tracking of a faceless hacker could have been told in 200 pages. What I found really tedious were all the phone calls - calls to try to track the hacker and to various government agencies to try to get help to catch the intruder. Phone calls can only be so interesting. Yes, it is real life and real life is never (I hope) as interesting as fiction - but by the time the hacker was caught, I was just happy to see the book end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I felt this book was a bit laboured and the potential reader needs to realise that while this book has a lot of good reviews it is gradually becoming dated. It does have a lot of Espionage and will appeal to people in InfoSec but as the years go by it's becoming a historical reference to the way things used to be , at least from a systems point of view. Also another negative hence my 2 stars is that it tends to drag on a bit for the first few chapters which left me annoyed at the pace of the unfolding plot.The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tech book","review":"Berkeley astronomer tracks a German spy through a maze of computer espionage. Interesting information about computer technology and security, but the suspense of the chase was not all that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Cuckoo's Egg, which is 399 pages long, is 360 pages of redundant boredom. The author narates the story of a hacker breaking into the Berkley system while the author follows the hacker's every and I mean every move. This drones on like an endless loop that culminates into an uneventfull catching of the guilty parties. Deceptively, the book jacket carries reviews of \\"fascinating, intriguing and gripping.\\" Perhaps, if you never leave your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and highly repetitious","review":"Reading the book was a drag. It is repetitious and technically dated. The author tries to add a human dimension by inserting episodes of his personal life but it seems out of place. I started on it 6 weeks ago and still haven't finished it and it wasn't from lack of trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Truly one of the most addictive books ever for anyone interested in computers or network security. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I won't repeat all the accolades everyone's said below, but if you've read the book (and understood the technical stuff) it's interesting to dig up a copy of the Com-ACM article (mentioned in the book) and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not well-written","review":"That book is a nerd test - if you've heard of it, you're probably a big nerd. I can say that because I'm a big nerd. Cliff Stoll was a physicist working at Lawrence Berkeley Labs as a sys admin when he accidentally fell into counterterrorism research. Stoll is not an excellent writer, but he did a great job of tracking a hacker when that sort of thing just wasn't a big concern for law enforcement, and his documentation of the whole thing as it went along was probably the only thing that got the guy caught and prosecuted. Recommended if you're a big nerd like me; not recommended if you're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has not aged a bit","review":"One would think that with the advances of the Internet and Computer Security over the last 20 years that this book would begin to show its age. It certainly does not. This book is addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"Just awesome! I read this on recomendation from my computer securities friend and was quite pleased on how indepth the book actually goes. Cliff is a quirky and wonderful writer and despite occasionally letting the storyline go amuck its still a wonderful read. I would highly recommend this to anyone in computer security or network development or for anyone who loves to learn new things while engaged in a wonderful semi-spy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC BOOK!","review":"Cliff's unpretentious writing style, and the way he unveils the story keeping you interested is just awesome. I bought this book while flying from Columbia, SC to Oklahoma City, OK and couldn't stop reading the whole trip and while waiting for the connections. When I saw the book at the store I thought that this was just another cheesy computer storytelling book like Takedown.How mistaken was I! The minute I started reading the book Cliff got me interested in the drama. I am not versed in UNIX or a computer wizard but the way everything was explained--To the point and in plain English--made it easy to understand the whole affair.Regarding the above, I have not seen such a proper command of the English language! Cliff writes concisely yet elegantly and respects the reader by avoiding unnecessary detail and repetition.Cliff doesn't leave anything unexplained and closes the story superbly... Thanks for a good book Cliff... You made my flight very pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome real world account of a hacker in action","review":"While the hacking landscape has changed, the message still rings true.

It is not a physics book, but presents some information on certain specific uses, such as in biology, thermodynamics and a couple of other areas. But it is useful, esp in conjunction with the book by Miller and Ross. They complement each other well. For application it is a good book, but it does not have plug and chug equations in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I am not going to buy this, and having read it's reviews I shan't be buying the first or second season collections either. Even though I came to this product because I suddenly realised I should be able to buy \\"Mad about you\\" DVDs now and should be clicking on the \\"Yes send me all of the Mad About You DVD collections\\" button.Only apparently the first season is a poor quality release and Sony is otherwise screwing around with their customers by playing some sort of pointless bait and switch.If you're going to sell DVDs then the product should be of appropriate quality and if you're going to sell collections of a TV show you either sell collections of each season or, I only wish, a complete set of all episodes.

I'm English and happened to catch an episode on freeview by accident and was completely hooked by the sharp script, witty set-ups and general easy raport between the two fantastic leads, Helen Hunt and the fantastic Paul Reiser.It shows how great the show is that I am willing to wade through this unfamiliar American website to see if I can buy all the series... and I am appalled by this so-called \\"Best Of\\". There seems to be very little in the way of extras on the first two releases, and I refuse to be conned by the studio into shelling out the extra cash for this.It's almost as though the studio is using the love dedicated fans of Mad About You feel for the programme.

This was an excellent sitcom in the early years and deserves a full release. And judging by the list of guest stars mentioned, the \\"Collection\\" will concentrate on the last couple of years, when the show had gone downhill and was trying to bring in the audience by bringing on big-name guest stars like Mel Brooks and Carol Burnett, rather than producing great episodes about Paul and Jamie."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAD AT YOU !!!!","review":"I LIKE EVERY OTHER FAN OUT THERE HAS BEEN DESPERATELY WAITING FOR SEASON 3 AND THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE AND AN INSULT TO LOYAL FANS I ALSO THINK THE COMMENTARIES WERE AWFUL THEY TALKED ABOUT THE DUMBEST THINGS AND THEY MAY HAVE WELL JUST HAD PAUL REISER DO THEM ALONE BECAUSE HELEN HUNT REALLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND JUST SAT THERE THROUGH MOST OF IT.

They release season one with a low bit rate, inexpensive 2 disc set, then season two in a better quality 3 disc set and now they're doing a \\"best of\\" set that has Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt participating in some of the extras and commentaries. Why weren't they involved from the beginning and then just release the series season by season? Does mean that this new set is the final word on Mad About You and that we will see no more season sets? Will they continue with \\"best of\\" collections? It's a perplexing way to treat a classic television show.Before \\"Friends\\" was available in season collections they tried doing \\"best of\\" discs. I've noticed that those discs are now in the $5 pile at various electronics stores. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for this kind of format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gonna happen my friend!","review":"I really can't believe Sony did this.

They should just release season by season. Many fans are disappointed. I boycott this set to send a message to SONY, Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt that they should not jerk their fans around like that. Fans want to collect seasons by seasons in complete set with complete shows... not season 1, season 2 and highlights. Too bad a good series with talented Helen Hunt ended up like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't","review":"I'm sorry, but I just can't buy this. I don't have money to just throw around. I have to pick and choose what luxury items I buy. I bought Season 1, bad transfers and all. I bought Season 2, happy to have better quality. Then I waited. And waited. Like all the loyal fans, I waited and watched season after season of Frasier, Seinfeld, and Friends rolled by. But no Mad About You.Now this. I'm sorry. I will not give Sony more money in hopes that they will somehow \\"see the light\\" and put the rest of the show out. Why is this so hard? Every obscure show ever made is being put on DVD these days. How is this show so expensive to produce? They must have skads of production stills and art lying around to compile the box design. It's not like they were putting huge amounts of money into the sets before.Just give us more of what we got with Season 2 - decent quality, and FULL SEASONS. I'm not paying for something containing episodes I already have, no matter HOW much I love the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott it!","review":"As many of the comments have stated, this is a disappointment if you wanted all the seasons, especially 3 and 4. Season 1 was not phenomenal, but good. Season 2 started to show a lot of promise, while seasons 3 and 4 were very good. Don't buy this. Some have advised that you buy this collection so that Sony will be encouraged to release the full seasons. I think they have already decided this is the last release. If you want the other seasons, then you should complain directly to Sony at sphe_customer_service@spe.sony.com <sphe_customer_service@spe.sony.com> and tell them you're not buying episodes you already have and want the rest of the full seasons.

I thought, \\"Oh, wow! A 'best of' collection!!!\\" But the episodes are badly chosen, and only a few of my favorites are included. Also, so many are the ones Paul Reiser obviously thought were his best as auteur, so we are presented with way too many that are too fussy or too serious, including the three- (Lord help us) part episode where the Buchmans' marriage is put to the test (Gosh, don't we all want to watch all of THAT again?!!), and the \\"New Frontier in sitcoms? Not so much\\" episode where Paul and Jamie sit outside the bedroom door agonizing over whether or not to go in because the baby is crying.I'd recommend buying sets for separate seasons and just watching the ones you want, unless you think Paul Reiser was the Orson Welles of the 1990s, as Reiser apparently does.

Most of the episodes are 20 minutes in length, with several running a dismal 19 minutes in length.

It doesn't make sense. Don't waste your money or time. Amazon was very good about allowing me to send this birthday present back for a full refund.

My 7 year old daughter sings better than her. Here is a lady who dresses way to young for her age. I would be embarrassed if this was my mom. These songs are boring and over-produced. If you want to by a cd of someone who can sing buy anything by Linda Eder. Kathie Lee should just retire and go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Taste","review":"I have just read the reviews of Kathie Lee's new album. It is amazing how bad the taste of the American buying community really is. People praise her voice, and remark on her range. She has no range at all, and is sorely in need of a good voice coach. As far as the composition is concerned, she demonstrates that she has had no training whatsoever. I believe that Kathie Lee does'nt even read music! Every song has the exact same voicing. It adds up to the fact that they all sound the same. Compare them with a master like Hoagy Carmichael, or Johnny Mercer. The Duke would turn a deaf ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!Contents Will Prove Harmful!!","review":"While Kathie Lee Gifford never failed to use every opportunityafforded her while a talk show host to croon a tune, she should have left the real singing to the experts. In attempt to further her public persona, she's moved from the sappy standards she once sang to sappy adult contemporary, with utterly disastrous results. She even tacks on a remix of one of the many awful ballads found within this hodgepodge of misery. Only'Love Never Fails' shows the faintest glimmer of personality, and it's a complete carbon copy of Celine Dion's far superior 'That's The Way It Is'. Her singing is barely average, her voice so nondescript that such typically soul-challenged divas as Mariah Carey and Jessica Simpson now look like havens in the neverending emotionless storm that is this record. After hearing this record, you won't help but fall to your knees andpray \\"Come back Celine, all is forgiven\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is way to funny","review":"i got to hear this through a friend of mine&I laughed so hard.first of all she can't sing.secondly what's up with being the dressed up version of Mariah Carey?3rd she is a poor Celine Dion Cher 3rd tier knock off at best.her voice has no emotion or depth.i guess with money&nothing else better to do with her time she drops a CD?if she is lucky she may be a trivia question on who wants to be a millionaire? hopefully no one will remember this set.i still trip on my friend about this.i think she is a babe, better suited for modeling or hosting a show but please no more music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops!!

It's not that Kathie Lee has a bad voice, she doesn't, it's just that it's better suited for standards. Here she makes a vallant effort at \\"pop\\" music, unfortunately it ain't always pretty. The ballads are rather underwhelming. Why each one must begin with a hummed intro is beyond me. The title cut and \\"The Hardest Part\\" are actually descent. However, \\"Heartache,Heartache\\" is a reeeaaalll bad Shania Twain-esque tune that is destined to become a camp classic.

I honestly feel that fans will be let down by this album. The songs are typical, non-descript, and don't capture the listener. You know how sometimes you buy an album and there is only one hit song, and the others are all dull and forgettable? Well, this whole album sounds like that. The worst one of all is Heartache. Kathie Lee keeps up the autobiographical subject matter like \\"We don't make love anymore\\" which may help her communicate with her husband, but it doesn't really give the listener much to ENJOY. Her fame will sell records, but the lack of enjoyment will keep this off the hit list. Kathie Lee has a great voice, but she doesn't quite deliver with this album.

They are supposed to have an anti scratch coating but still seem to scratch fairly easily but for the price and features it does not dissuade me from purchasing these glasses.

Out of the 3 I purchased, I was able to get enough pieces together to make 2 full cubes. The directions are terrible and the sliders don't fit into the holes. You have to pound them in, and since the sliders are made of plastic, breakage is very likely. Once you get them together, the drawers don't slide well and it's hard to shut the drawer all the way because of the mis-cut pieces. When the drawer is open all the way, the cube wants to tip over, so if you are wanting a single cube, you'll have to secure it to the wall or floor.I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so inferior, that I just had to give a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"You will spend hours trying to assemble it, only to want to go crazy because the pieces don't fit right.

Nearly all the songs here are great, and it samples almost every kind of music. It starts out with 6 rap songs, then follows with an R&B song, then 4 excellent dance tracks, followed by 5 rock songs, and ends with 2 adult contemporary ballads. As the review below points out, only one song is a remix but sounds so much like the original that some buyers might not even be aware it's a remix if it wasn't labled as such on the CD. This CD could be five-star quality but I took one star off because a few of the rock tracks are a bit old. \\"All for You\\" by Sister Hazel is a great song, but it's from 1997 and it seems a bit strange to hear it on a year 2000 compilation CD.

On the other hand, the partisans were undisciplined, and many of them went around drunk and stupid much of the time.This story places all of these elements together, and shows the senselessness of it all, emphasizing the warmth that developed beteween the two protagonists.

Why because it only delivers one verdict in the area of food safety - that nitrites and nitrates rule - it fails to give the educated consumer a choice in approach. I fail to see how, when amongst many others the acknowledged King of hams in Parma or its moot equal Iberico can deliver such gems without the use of nitrates,the art of charchuterie can be considered complete for dismissing their non use so quickly.

I probably would have bought it anyway being sckeptical of reviews. I couldn't have said it better, esp. about the nitrates, and the non-existence of photos!!!!!!!!!!!, how do I know if what I made looks like it should? I will add in my review several other comments such as: the book appears to be written for the sake of avant garde chefs trying to impress one another (a tip-off to this is the forward by the chef of the French Laundry); the recipes are not necessarily traditional but manipulated to create a sense of excitement; if these guys really made these cured meats etc. where are the photos of the finished product?, there is no excuse for this today given the techno capabilities of the computer. The book will probably sit on my shelf for a long time before I reference it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constructive replies to others' opinions","review":"I liked the book, but do agree there are shortcomings (as consructively provided by another \\"non-professional\\" reviewer.) I will not however recommend the book, as I was quite disapointed with the author's \\"blast\\" dismissing less than ingratiating (?) reviews by attributing them to \\"mean-spirited and inept reviewers.\\" Rather arrogant sir - I too prefer that cookbooks have as few errors in direction and presentation as possible. Pointing out \\"room for improvement\\" in a first edition is constructive - why would you think your prospective customers inputs any less credible than your editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing","review":"Of the three recipes I tried, two were just mediocre and the third was a waste.The three were bacon, sauerkraut, and gravlox.The bacon burned before becoming crisp, the sauerkraut spoiled and had to be discarded, and the gravlox lost most of the raw salmon flavor even though it was the soft cure.With my personal method of making sauerkraut I only had 1 spoiled batch (3 quarts) in the 4 years of making the kraut."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"this book leaves out far too many details to be useful. don't believe the reviews here. i own this book and it's the worst book i own. i gave up trying to make bacon based on the recipe in this book. total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I bought this book because I thought it was going to teach me how to cure meat and store it. It has more condiment recipes and brines than it did cured italian meats. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I bought this book for my father as a Christmas gift, and he has done nothing but putting meat in casings since then. Very detailed and informative. It's by far the best curing book I've seen from what's out there. Many of the recipes we've found online do not go into detail about how much and which type of salt is required for the right cure, but this one makes sure the proportions are right so you don't get sick off of your own food. The history of (the) Charcuterie also adds to the pride that comes with learning this all but lost art. I'd recommend this book to the beginner interested in getting started or to the advanced who is looking to hone their skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"If you are interested in charcuterie this is a must have. Easy to read format is not like a textbook. The food comes alive in the pages and you want to make everything. All of the recipies that I have tried have worked marvelously, bacon, saurkraut, pate de campagna, pate en croute, chutneys, etc. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. So much good stuff!","review":"I have not done anything like cooked my way through this book.But- I've made a bunch of things, and they have been great!The licorice-spices \\"gravlax\\" might be the show-stopper. It is utterly gorgeous, and I've made it several times; it may be the best salmon appetizer I've ever had.The corned beef and pastrami are excellent. I've been making my own corned beef for St. Pat's Day for years; it's relatively easy to add a hot-smoke and make it into pastrami.The pancetta is also excellent, though a bit more risky-seeming! And the bacon is gorgeous.None of these- except maybe the gravlax- is exactly easy or simple... but the results are worth it.There's also good info on confit (and one of these days I WILL make duck proscuitto!), and lots on sausages- which I mostly have not done.Not much on cold smoking, especially in a home environment, though we've experimented and have had some good results without a lot of specialized equipment.I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charcuterie","review":"An excellent book, lots of good easy to follow recipes and history of various products. It makes me excited to get on with the process of making my own delicious meat products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding source of information","review":"I bought this for my husband, since he's big into sausage making and smoking meats, but I have to admit it had so much comprehensive information that I found my nose buried in it, as well. The author covers many, many meats and explains not only the how-to of preparation but the why, as well. We have tried four sausage recipes and have been duly impressed with every one. The best thing about this book is that it was purchased right before we went into a low-carb diet plan, and this book has given us ways to allow our taste buds more of a thrill than just your average salad diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrolyte Replenisher","review":"This product can be found for more money at Whole Food Stores but finding it on Amazon for less was a gift! Have started using this product daily as you lose vital electrolytes easily in the desert of Nevada.

Finding a replacement without empty sugars was, I thought, impossible till we stumbled upon Ultima! It is sweetened with Stevia leaf extract and has only 10 calories per serving, 0 sugars, and a total of 3 grams of carbohydrates.

I signed up for a course called \\"Italian Cinema and Culture\\" for the first term of my freshman year in college, thinking it sounded glorious. Ahh, to escape the immature boys of high school, go to college and learn about Italian culture and film! Big mistake. Huge. It was a little over a decade ago, but I vividly remember sitting in the lecture hall, and thinking, \\"Are they kidding? A fish?\\" The disappointment was very similar to my experience reading A Farewell to Arms, when I learned the difference between a Great Book and a book that would leave me impacted: I have to care. With both Hemingway and this movie, I just didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film Thats Difficult To Enjoy","review":"Extensive roll of useless film is dull and I find it insignificant, unless you're a Fellini Fanatic.Otherwise it's a movie lacking in every aspect.Cannot recommend tis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musty period piece, smelling bad","review":"Only its undeniable status as one of central relics of the Sixites (one that has held up as well as, say, the Nehru jacket) saves this dull, pretentious, massively over-rated film from the lowest rating.

It doesn't even come close to his other films. It has a few moments but the overall tone of this film is very simular to that of a fart. I hate to bash Fellini because I do love his films. I have heard people say he's overrated. I could never understand why someone would say such a thing. Now I know why. Because they watched La Docle Vita and never bothered to watch any of his earlier films.La Dolce Vita is an attempt at delivering the same message that Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura did. I also despise L'Avventura. Antonioni was the worst thing that ever happend to Italian Cinema. I understand that later on in his career Fellini admired Antonioni's films. I think La Dolce Vita was the result of Fellini's admiration for Antonioni. I really wish Fellini spent more time admiring Pier Paulo Pasolini. Pasolini's flims blew Antonioni's pretentious crap away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I understand that some movies are \\"classics,\\" but that doesn't necessarily make them good. There were no likable characters in this film, no one to relate to, no story or plot, it's just following this womanizing guy in a downward spiral who goes around town in this nonsensical fashion meeting all these strange people that you never see again. It doesn't make any sense. I guess it's supposed to be ironic--that what people think would be \\"The Sweet Life\\" is anything but, but I didn't need 3 hours of terribleness to portray that irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"La vita è troppo breve (Life is too short) to give 3 hours to this!","review":"Buyer Beware: despite other inexplicably glowing reviews, this movie is overly long, looks dated, seems \\"choppy\\" with different segments just strung together, and the \\"plot\\" borders on incoherent.

For some reason it resonated with me then as much as now. I recently watched it again, and found the scene at Steiner's apartment to be quite fascinating. Here we have a man who is hemmed in by the walls of society, and the way for him to experience nature is by making audo tapes of the sounds of rain, storms,and other facets of creation. Then he can play them back in the safety of his apartment, apparently unable to just enjoy the outdoors in all its beauty. He is afraid of the future, and can't break away from society and its walls. Perhaps that is why he is attracted to Marcello's character, who just floats freely about, apparently without a worry."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Dolce Vita","review":"I think La Dolce Vita might be the best film I've ever seen, and I have been waiting for the DVD for years.

As an owner of two APBT's which weigh 70 lbs. I was surprised to learn that the dogs of the last 100 years seldom weighed over 40 pounds.

The book deals with problems in a fascinating and informative way and makes it fun for the reader. It is a type of book that you do not want to put down. This is a wonderful book providing the reader has a secondary school mathematical background. I strongly recommend this book to be taught to the undergraduate students of relativity and cosmology.

But it is a realdisappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr One Star is wrong!","review":"The thought experiment is not wrong,the whole point being made was that the ships A & B although at rest \\"relative\\" to each other were not at rest \\"relative\\" to the vacuum and hence the invariance in the \\"propagation\\" velocity of em radiation caused \\"relative\\" errors in time of reception. Remember they were in rectilinear motion, say they were moving at .5c relative to the vacuum, then you cant have the forward moving pulse moving at 1.5c through the vacuum and the responding pulse moving backwards at .5c just to keep the timing right! thats the whole point of this.

I do not own the book but was thinking of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vocal like this...","review":"Yeah, that's it! One of the best vocal recordings I've heard in the last years. Starting with DARN THAT DREAM, a smooth and precise baritone solo by Peter Eldridge, followed by a magnificent track called THE WORLD KEEPS YOU WAITING with a strong chorus with a nice tigh harmony very well chosen. Then I'd call your attention to NOTICING THE MOMENT (the CD's best track! - although in the last part there's a note that Kim could sing one octave up) and also to two beautiful bossa nova styled songs: CHAMEGO and A DAY LIKE THIS. JACKIE strikes you at once! It's brilliant and very well arranged. All the other songs are also very good. Great vocal arrangements and precise execution. So that I still keep the CD in my car since last month! It neve stops playing. I also had the oportunity to see the New York Voices live here in Brazil. It was amazing! And how gentle they are!

While they do remind me of Manhattan Transfer they can deliver their own knock out punch and that is courtesy of the simply outstanding Kinhan-Eldridge collaboration of The World Keeps You Waiting, a catchy fantastic harmonic vocal arrangement with a brilliant sax solo from Darmon Meader. This track underpins a rewarding cd, with other highlights being Jackie, Don't You Worry Bout A Thing & On A Clear Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"WAS\\" the most exciting vocal group ever?","review":"THE NEW YORK VOICES... a vocal ensemble which, at the top of their gamecould melt water or freeze it dead in its tracks! I sincerely hope thatthe 30-second samples (much too truncated for such a group --who doesone complain to?) leave out the best segments of their songs.But, if not, then it seems that they have more than lost their edge...they sound like the Lennon Sisters on Prozac. NYV fans have had morethan enough musical disappointments in the last few years.

For everyone else, it has a pretty obvious and unimaginative take on how to use toys to stimulate language development. A typical suggested dialog for playing with legos is: \\"Yes, Bobby, that is a blue block! Here is another blue block! Now there are two blue blocks and they are exactly the same!\\" and so on. There are lots of lists of things your child should be doing at various ages; but if you are interested in this book, your child has special needs and you probably already know he/she isn't going to develop in a typical way. To me, this book wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"rpirolo@nyc.rr.com","review":"The story proceeds at a steady pace until the end where everything jumps together and a life-long decision is made by the heroine in the span of a few pages. Throughout the book she is married to a religious fanatic, while she is anti-religous, complete opposites. Can she in one moment forget one of her lives that she has lived for years, not to mention the people involved? It ends too abruptly and there is too much of, what I perceive to be, the author's religious background. The husband, apparently, became very successful by praying. That is even a more far-fetched premise than the fantasy purported in this book. I am a Christian believer but I felt manipulated by this story.

If you don't have an impact hammer, you will need a long breaker bar to get the factory bolts out - I used a 25\\" bar to break mine loose. On my installation (2011 Xterra) I had to remove the spare tire but did not have to remove the exhaust hanger bolts - this probably varies by vehicle. The unit I received did have a hole in the box where the mounting flange had punched through the side, but the part itself was undamaged. I installed a Hidden hitch in my last Xterra (2006). Both are good hitches, I like the look of the Curt unit a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Price !","review":"Exactly as advertised. It bolts up with no drilling.

It was a bit of a pain to install myself, took a 3' long torque wrench to remove the factory bolts, and was a very snug fit that took the help of a rubber mallet to knock it into place 1/32\\" at a time.Overall, I am very happy with it.

It took 2+ hrs and 2 guys beating the hell out of it to finally get it between the frame rails.

How it holds up over time is an unknown, but right out of the box it seems very sturdy and well-made. The polycarbonate jar won't break like glass, but it's clear so you can see what's going on, unlike stainless steel. The start-step feature is great-when you start it up, the mixture doesn't erupt upward and get all over the lid. There are 3 speeds and that's all you need.The power is awesome. This thing could probably grind stones into gravel and come out laughing (but I don't recommend that). I put plain old ice cubes in and it grated them evenly and fine enough for a snow cone. The blade assembly seems to be well-designed too, so that it blends/chops/grates evenly and you don't have to stop and scrape down the sides and redistribute the contents like I had to do with my cheaper blenders.All in all, I am looking forward to a summer of great smoothies and slushies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Blender","review":"I bought this Blender in Jan. of 05, have used it weekly since and have had no problems at all.

DVD 3 stopped cold as German soldiers were surrendering their weapons toward the end of The Fate of Europe.Victory at Sea is one of the finest creations of the documentary art. Between Henry Salomon's script and Richard Rodgers's music I find it nearly impossible to view and keep my eyes dry.

When Emmit Till's battered body was sent home, his mother demanded that his casket be open so that everyone could see the cruel mutilation he had suffered. More important--for historical purposes--she allowed his body to be photographed by JET and EBONY, the two black magazines with national circulation. The result was that for the first time white Americans had to look directly at a horrific truth they had been able until then to ignore. Ironically, it was at the trial of Emmit Till's accused murderers that the white press took over the civil rights story.

I also tried a DI box and it sounded even better. You really don't need a DI box but having one will enable to add some tone. Overall, I give this 4 out of 5 stars because installation was a bit tricky with the jig and all. But the sound quality and price make this a great deal.

It's a bit tricky since I never wood-worked or handled drills before but for me it didn't take longer than couple hours.

I would install this pickup in all my acoustic guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sound, good directions","review":"This pick-up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically. It does pick up percussive noise which you don't get with under saddle pickups. It is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don't use a sound hole cover. Over all I'm please because I was able to install myself and it was simple. You do need to use an external pre-amp, but even with piezo pick-ups that is usually the norm. The directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions. The only change I had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"K&K Pure Mini","review":"I'm very happy with this product.

Based on the pictures we were expecting a cream to beige color. It's very, very yellow. Still looks great though. when the light is on the color looks more like in the picture.The other thing to note is that they aren't the easiest to get the lens straight.

Everyone can relate to Oscar or Roy-whether you want to learn how to become successful, find your purpose, or are thankful and want to give back. A great book for everyone in your family or organization!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Millionaire Mentor is a gem!","review":"Millionaire Mentor is a brilliant marriage of the art of story telling and the short and sweet success secrets of the ages.Its been said that knowledge is a process of piling up facts, while wisdom lies in their simplification.Greg Reid is a very wise man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greg S. Reid - Absolutely! The Millionaire Mentor","review":"After the first time I spoke with Greg, it was evident why he is called, \\"The Millionaire Mentor.\\" I listened as he reinforced my goals without even knowing what they were! How did he know?!?!And as he was talking, I was secretly going into a frenzied fit trying to find a pen because I didn't want to miss a word he was saying. Within seconds (and I mean seconds) after hanging up the phone, I was making drastic and sweeping changes to my website and the ideas just kept flowing. That's right! The recent changes you've just seen, were all because I talked to Greg Reid, The Millionaire Mentor. I was lit up like a Christmas Tree after our conversation.In addition to his incredible ability to stimulate immediate action within others, Greg has written a small book that packs a powerful punch. His message is direct, insightful, and EASY. All 110 pages are filled with functional and productive advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"Either all these reviewers are kidding or they are on drugs.

However, I would like to take a second to comment on the quality of the set. After comparing the third season with seasons one and two, I was more than impressed with the picture clarity and the crisp, clean audio of season three.

A previous review stated that there should be a statement for the release of Season 3 in September - October; well, it's nearly November and I haven't seen anything yet. Please everyone, contact Universal studios and demand that they release at least Seasons 3 and 4 (Season 4 includes one of my favorites -- the Soup episode)!!!

It is a good size for my 18 months old daughter, I used it outside during the summer and now I have purchased pit balls and it is inside our home.

I'm not sure how this happened as it was the top ring and our toddler didn't have any sharp objects. We were on the level grass and it was only 1/2 way full of water.It was still usable - though the top ring would be deflated and floppy. We didn't fill the water that high anyways.The 3rd time we used it, it was at campsite and our toddler fell down on her butt and I guess that started a slow leak in the base.I liked this because it was padded on the bottom, but it's worth about $5 because you only get a few uses out of it.I'll be looking for a different brand next summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing and Enchanting Story","review":"Marcia Martin has a gift for storytelling, and in her warm and open and down-to-earth style, she shares with us an amazing and enchanting story about her friendship with a very special one-legged Canada goose named Bandy.

It sounds nothing like them, & isn't really aggressive enough to be called punk. The tunes are catchy enough, & doesn't get preachy like most other Christian groups, but all in all, if you're looking for a good punk album, go buy Social D or some Offspring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extradordinary","review":"This book is extraordinary because, when read in 2010, it presages a decade of war, explaining precisely why defeating the Taliban has not been possible. Kaplan is a brave and highly insightful journalist; he should be serving our nation as an assistant secretary of state or defense. His ability to describe the interrelationships among human nature, culture and the politics that result in armed conflict is unique. Ten years after its second release, Solders of God is still fresh and applicable. It is must-reading for anyone seeking to understand why the war in Afghanistan is so maddening in its duration and complexities. Bing West, Newport, RI"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon Sense Look At Afghan Society and Politics","review":"This book is a superb analysis of Afghan politics during the Soviet war years. With an update for the current (post 9/11) situation, this is must read for all CIA-types as well as other serious students of South Asia politics. Mr. Kaplan has a dire warning for the west in his analysis of the future of Pakistan ala Yugoslavia. Read and understand - reality is not pleasent!I will buy other titles by Mr. Kaplan."},{"rating":"2","title":"an early work, but good","review":"Before Kaplan got really famous, he wrote this little volume of travelogue/reportage on Afghanistan. At the time, Afghanistan was a rite that the hardest of the hardcore journalists had to go through, and of those who survived to write a book about the experience, Kaplan's is one of the best. His experience scrambling around the Afghan mountains with the mujahideen is not one that many people have had, and his descriptions convey well the roughness of the terrain and people of that country. In addition, he analyzes politics astutely -- the details are sometimes moot now that everything has changed in the region, but for giving a sense of the country and its conflicted this book is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book !","review":"Great book from the marine corps reading list. Still reading it but overall it is good so far . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzz...","review":"As a college student, I am required certain books for my history class. The firsthand account books I have read this semester have been very enjoyable (Kaffir Boy & Son of the Revolution). However, even though Soldiers of God is a firsthand account of Robert Kaplan traveling in Afghanistan & Pakistan during the Soviet invasion & occupation, it was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I could barely read 3 pages without beginning to doze off. The action is limited and sporadic and the commentary is less than stellar. If you are looking for another Kaffir Boy this book is not the one to pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing in Action","review":"Way to boring. No real descriptions of any combat action. Just like boring historical statistical stuff. Lots of Afghan tribal stories, why they can't get along we may never know. If you want some edge of your seat and can't put it down action, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binding Fell Apart","review":"I noticed the review that said this book was worthy of \\"permanent display on your coffee table.\\" Well, I don't think that will be possible with my book, as the binding fell apart after 6 months. The book has gotten a fair amount of use, but nothing out of the ordinary. I've since seen a similar problem with a couple of the display copies at bookstores (which is why they've been demoted to display copies). So I don't think this is an isolated problem. It seems like the book is so big that they didn't make a strong enough binding for it. So just a warning for this thinking of buying this book. The good news is that, on the advice of one of the reviews, I bought Colorado: Yesterday & Today to replace my copy of Colorado: 1870-2000. I agree that it is the better book and now it will be on permanent display on my coffe-table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Colorado","review":"this is a most beautiful book. we bought our copy in 2000 while we were living in colorado. it is a prized possession. the one i purchased recently was for a friend who bought a copy while out staying with us in colorado. she has lost it and was missing it. we found a replacement on amazon and she is delighted. the pictures show 'then and now' and tell a wonderful story. the narrative is gorgeous too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"Fielder painstakingly retraced the steps of WH Jackson to vividly depict the 100 plus years between Jackson's eye and Fielder's eye. He gloriously proves that 100 years elapsing is a wink of an eye when it comes to history. Perhaps one has to live in Colorado to really appreciate the magnificence of the work. It was great fun to look at the comparable photographs and try to find the differences that have occurred in that time. And then you want to go and see the site for yourself. It will serve more than take up room on your coffee table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protein chem text","review":"I have been using this text as a supplement in a biophysics course and have found it very helpful. The text discusses physical properties of interactions within a polypeptide chain as well as with the environment. This book goes into protein folding, determination of evolutionary relationships between proteins, enzymology, methods for determining structure (like NMR, X-Ray diff), and is an excellent graduate or advanced undergraduate text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book, still useful after almost 20 years","review":"This book tackles proteins from the chemistry of its amino acids, via folding, biophysical properties, evolution, degradation, biosynthesis, structural determination, structure-function properties and more. Every chapter is as thorough as the format allows, and since it is clear that Chreighton set out to write a veritable flagship of a book, each chapter is really comprehensive. Sure, some things have changed since 1992, for instance within protein folding, but many of the books statements about this phenomenon are still valid abstractions for many proteins. There are some trivial errors when Chreighton deals with specialized techniques such as NMR, but nothing crippling. Chreighton is still one of the most useful books in my bookshelf. If there would be newer editions available I'd give them full score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Please, I don't buy this book except if you want for some reference. I bought my graduate school, for me were complete unuseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Experience","review":"I purchased four of these bars - three to use in the shower and one just outside the shower door. The three bars in the shower began to show signs of rust after about 2 week of use. I called a Mabis customer service rep who told me that the rust was probably due to the screws. They sent me new bars and I purchased 18 stainless steel screws at a local hardware store. Once installed the new bars also began to rust- obviously more than the screws were rusting! The layer of chrome seems to be very thin (it showed signs of pitting after only a few weeks). For the life of me, I can't believe a company would sell a a rust-prone product for use in a wet environment.I gave them two stars only because their customer service was extremely responsive and courteous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe Havens still dances with the best!","review":"Dancing on the Basketball Court, a collection of Safe Havens cartoons from 1999, published in September 2000.

It's generally kid-friendly, but smart enough to merit the attention of at least this adult.I was intrigued enough by the strange goings-on (How had the family Border Collie been transformed into a campaign worker? Why was one boy dressed as a Palm pilot?) to buy this collection. Fun stuff, suited to reading a few pages at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Excellent Writer","review":"I found Preconceived Notions to be one of the best books I've read in a very long time.

I KNOW ITS FICTION, BUT DAMN!!!I read Mrs. Williams other book a Twist of Fate and I didn't like that either, maybe I just don't like her as an author. I tried twice and I'm not going back again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Robyn Williams has out done herself in the writing of this book. I truly enjoyed the book. The story line and characters were incredible. I would have like to hear more about Zabree (Imagany's younger sister), but that leaves room for a sequel. How about it Robyn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preconceived Notions","review":"I read the other reviews before buying this book (as I often do), however, I do not like the story or the characters. Imagany is shallow, Caprice seems to have no depth. Really, I am speechless...after reading what others said, I am wondering what is wrong with me. I didn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robyn, Robyn, Robyn,","review":"Your book (Preconceived Notions)was totally awesome! I fell in love with some of the characters and hated others (Robert). It took me on an emotional rollercoaster ride and I didn't want to get off!Reading this book made me flash back to some difficult times in my own life that I was in denial about. But I'm facing and dealing with these issues now and as a result, my spirit, mind and body are now free to grow.This book gives women hope that there are \\"strong Black men\\" in this world who are spiritually grounded, compassionate, sensual, loving, motivated, self-reliant, and who are in search of a good woman!Robyn, you have renewed my spirit and faith in knowing that God will provide me with a man like your character, Elliott. It also excites me to know that this character is not a figment of your imagination.So, keep exciting my mind with your thought-provoking books. You're one heck of a writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Black Man!","review":"I bought this book on Saturday Morning. Sunday afternoon I was finished. I could not put the book down. It was truly amazing how I was so wrapped up in the characters. They seemed so real life to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I must say A Strong Black Man is definitely out there. I was truly impressed in the way the book ended. I enjoyed this book so much and I will be buying Ms. Williams next book A Twist Of Fate. Congratulations on a job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Hook! 5 Stars","review":"Ms. Williams, I couldn't put the book the down once I began reading. The relationship between Imagany and Elliot was powerful and inspiring. This book has also made me become more aware of how children are abused by molestation. Kudos to you Robyn on a well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll get pulled in....","review":"I really hadn't heard of this particular author before, but when I received an (unsolicited) email note/excerpt from her, I said \\"why not? \\" and ordered a copy. I REALLY enjoyed this book! Surprisingly, once it pulled me in, I stayed up until 4am - refusing to go to sleep until I'd finished it.I admit, I was initially a little put off thinking \\"this is about a bunch of college kids\\" -topics that may be a little too juvenile for my tastes. Boy, was I wrong! There were some real adult issues dealt with here - demise of family structures, abandonment, incest, lack of communication, domestic abuse, drug abuse, materialism, sudden wealth. It's all there. Robyn's words seemed to flow off the page and you began to feel like you really knew the characters. As a first-time author, I'd say that she has a very bright future.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book but was left wanting more!","review":"I thought that the book was very good up until the last two or three chapters. I feel as if the author left a lot of open thoughts and never really finished them. For instance, what ever happened to Zabree? I am glad that Imagany and Elliot reunited in the end at the Phyllis Hyman concert but I would have liked to see Imangany's family reunite. Or at least find out the outcome of Zabree's life. For Zabree to be such a vital part of Imagany's life it just seems as though we would have gotten an explanation of Zabree's condition both short and long term. I feel the same for Imagany's mother. I would have liked to see her character more in depth after the death of her husband and life partner. Up until that part I definitely enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Shallow","review":"I read Ms. Williams 2nd book which was pretty good...so I assumed especially because of all the positive comments and a bookstore reccomended this book as an excellent read & discussion. I must say this is actually one of the worst books I've ever read...such a waist of time...maybe some bored teenager would enjoy...there was no character development...the main character Imagany was the most conceited matarilistic B...I actually enjoyed her being beat by her sugar daddy...that was the best part of the book...if you can stay awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best black \\"love\\" stories I've read.","review":"Don't have any Preconceived Notions about this piece of work! Although I read this book awhile ago, I still remember how it left me. It left me with a very satisfied feeling. The plot, the characters, the flow of the story were all fantastic. This book is great and you,the reader will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"Preconceived Notions started out slow to me. However, I was not disappointed at all. What a wonderful love story. No way, could I have predicted what would happen in the book. Great debut! I quickly bought her second novel, A Twist of Fate after reading this book and again, I was not disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like!","review":"When I first began reading this book, I thought I would like it. As I got into how much of a golddigger Imagany was, I knew I wouldn't like it. The reason I gave this book 2 stars was because Anthony beat her down. Yeah, I am a female."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"After hearing so much about this book from coworkers and other book lovers, I decided to give it a shot. I found the plot to be really basic with nothing new that we haven't already seen in the resurgence of African-American fiction titles these days. I felt that Ms. Williams was writing for a not so sophisticated reader as I thought that she spent too much time going into unnecessary detail about Elliott's football games, etc. Who cares? There should have been more detail given to her parents and their issues and how they affected Imagany. I'm glad this was a paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO THUMBS UP!","review":"Two thumbs up to Robyn Williams for writing such a vividly erotic and wonderful novel. I started reading Preconceived Notions and was unable to put it down. Imagany, Elliott, Carl and Caprice were a wonderful cast of characters. Ms. Williams' storyline was believable and very touching. I also liked how Ms. Williams added richness to her characters without adding a lot of profanity and the bedroom scenes were off the hook. I can say truly loved reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I loved this story. However, I think that too much emphasis was placed on Imagany's sexual talents and not enough on exploring the depths of Elliott or Zabree.I would have preferred a better ending to wrap things up.

Stand-out tracks like \\"Sonar\\" and the radio single \\"Te Extrano\\" demonstrate Soleli's superb songwriting skills and crossover appeal, but it's on the stark and lovely \\"Primer Amor\\" where Soleli really shines. Overall, this Soleli proves that he is a force to be reckoned with, and I look to foward to hearing more from this bona fide talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Tarot -- A Great Size & Good Artwork","review":"This deck is a good alternative to the traditional Rider-Waite Tarot, and I enjoy the images on papyrus.

Lenin (the office-cat who loves fishburgers for breakfast) and who his beloved Julia really is. I liked the book for it's surprising twists, the multitude of characters and the setting in post-war Russia of 2015.

However, the rich turquoise waters and scenes of beautiful beaches of Key West were all washed out and almost void of color. The whole movie looked like it was shot at the wrong exposure.

Besides, the director of parts II and III is a master of erotic obsessions (Aman Chang!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a problem with they play, but a problem with the edition","review":"I believe this is a poorly rendered version of Antony and Cleopatra. The organization of the notes made it difficult to read. Instead of putting the archaic meanings of words at the bottom as footnotes, it would have been much more helpful to place them in the margins. The constant going back-and-forth between footnotes and the text made my reading of this play less enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good change from disney princess fare","review":"This book features letters to and from the disney princesses concerning their lives after they live happily ever after.

Every page had me itching for a red pencil. The excuse that it's the writer's 'style' doesn't fly. As a 'style' it comes under the label of 'ignorant of basic grammar.' An editor could work for a week on this book and still be on chapter 1.There's plot here, but it is so hard to find under the bad writing that I couldn't follow it.

I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who have an interest in the white peoples' history with Native Americans. It is a humbling education.

I made it about 100 pages, waiting like the story, but it just wasn't happening for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I liked the beginning of this story better than the end...Enjoyed reading about the Indian customs before the white man came into the picture.The ending, of course, was predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an amazing book.","review":"I have probably read thousands of books over the course of my life, but I can honestly say this is one of my top 3. It's an unbelievably moving, poignant, descriptive journey through the lives of characters that will become as real to you as the paper they're written on. I cried and celebrated along with the characters and was genuinely touched by this book. I was so sad to see it end.A word of warning, however, this book is not a sunshine-y sugar-coated look at life as a Native American in the 1800s. It's a real, gripping, and often violent look of how things really were. For anyone who has an interest in Native American culture, or wants to experience the culture through the eyes of a white girl kidnapped and raised as Nerm (one of the People), this true story is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Memorable Read","review":"I read this book and was completely mesmorized by the story. It's one of those books that compels you to continually keep learning about the subjects even after the last page is turned.

The story will truly stay with me in my thoughts for a long time and I imagine it won't be too long before I read it again.

I recommend this book to anyone. It's not only a love story, but it's a story of the Comanches last days on their beloved praire."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can really FEEL this book!","review":"- At least I can not find another word to describe this. Everytime I read it (especially the part Wanderer remembers finding Naduah after she has been taken \\"home\\" by her relatives) I surely start to cry. You can feel every emotion deep in your heart - just like it was your own. I love this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride the Wind","review":"A fascinating portrait of the Comanche nation on the cusp of their appalling treatment by the whites when they were virtually starved into submission and herdednon to the reservations. Although the writer does not spare the reader from the atrocities perpetrated by both sides of the conflict, she gives us a wonderful insight into the ways of the Comanches from the point of view of the captured girl Cynthia Ann Parker, and her transformation into a Comanche woman. One whose life was ruined by her recapture by the whites later in life after her marriage to a member of the tribe and the birth of her children. Very sad portrait of her demise as she longs for her Indian husband. There is a moving portrait of their courtship and marriage, a marriage which survived much bloodshed and difficulties and were the protagonists were portrayed as being deeply committed to each other. All iN all a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"Ms. Robson did a fantastic job on this book. I will be reading more of her books. She puts you there at the scene.

Sept.1991."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the discriminating reader","review":"Unfortunately, the real Cynthia Ann Parker never talked about her capture and her life with the Comanches, so her story is wide-open to exploitation by amateurish sensation writers.On the technical side, the narrative jumps haphazardly from one character to the next, which is confusing because the reader never knows whose eyes (s)he is looking through.On the plot side, the story suffers from an overabundance of flat characters and unnecessary sidestories. Combined with the wobbly POV and the detailed descriptions of violence and sex, this makes for an uninspiring, often outright annoying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read. Long but descriptive.","review":"This is and excellent enjoyable read. It does leave one wondering how much research went into the background of Ms. Robson's work. She describes how wonderful the Indian tribes were to their captive white children. She does go into the very poor treatment of more mature captives. As a juxtoposition, one could read the short novel \\"Where the Broken Heart Still Beats\\" 'The Story of Cynthia Ann Parker' by Carolyn Meyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reaches out and touches your soul...","review":"When I was ten years old I discovered my Indian heritage and devoured all that I could on the subject. When I bought Ride the Wind and brought it home, I began a journey that changed my life forever. Lucia St. Clair Robson makes you feel like you know Naduah (Cynthia Ann Parker), makes you love her. Knowing Naduah was a real person makes me want to cheer and wrenches my heart all at once- she had white skin, true, but she was in all ways Comanche. The end of her life was so sad, but her courage is an inspiration for us all. I sincerely hope that she and Nocona found each other again on the other side, walking the Hanging Road of stars to Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a Great Book, I Really enjoyed the story.

Nick Nolte should've won an oscar for his layered and sensitive playing of Tom Wingo.The Mirror Has Two Faces - competent romantic comedy. The gem in the film is Lauren Bacall.Perhaps the package would've made more sense if it included all three of Streisand's directorial efforts so we can witness her range and growth as a director?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not mine.","review":"I bought these for my aunt.

She had just managed to stand up to her family and then she let herself be ordered around by her lover! And of course this Jacob wasn't one of my favorite characters either. I think bossy men are horrible and not even heroines in romances should fall in love with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly an early work","review":"I agree with \\"Reader from the Midwest\\" that Emily is a wimpy, spineless disappointment, and Jacob is obnoxious and overbearing, like Emily's whole family. This is clearly an early work re-issued, before Ms. Krentz hit her stride with strong, well-rounded women and men who are strong without being dictatorial, domineering, or controlling. Don't give up on Krentz if this is the only one you've read, just stick to those written in the 1990's (or later). I've found the re-issues of the 1980's works of popular writers such as Krentz and Linda Howard to be almost uniformly disappointing. They often have the old romance formula of controlling, unable-to-express-love, know-it-all man and feisty (but not too much!) woman, who ultimately submits to most of his demands because he \\"loves\\" her. Who needs that kind of love? Anyway, try Jayne Ann Krentz again in her modern incarnation and don't waste money on these re-issues..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can always count on Jayne Ann Krentz","review":"Full Bloom was no disappointment, I never seem to go wrong with JAK, she's one of my favourite authors. Her writing changes so dramatically when she writes under the pseudonym, Amanda Quick, but I'm a great fan of her historicals also. I thought Emily was yet another admirable heroine with her odd qualities, and Jacob was an ideal overprotective yet gentle hero. I hope JAK continues to churn out these wonderful romances, under Amanda Quick also."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!","review":"I can't remember the last time I was so disapointed in a book. Weak-willed, wimpy Emily Ravenscroft is the most pitiful, spineless excuse for a heroine that has ever graced the pages of any Janyne Ann Krentz novel I've read. Jacob Stone the hero (I use the term very loosely) must have used the phrase \\"It's for your own good\\" 50 times. I've rarely found a character with so few redeeming qualities. He was at once condecending, over-bearing, and so self-riteous I had trouble even finishing the book. The only thing that kept this reader turning pages was that I just KNEW Emily was going to show some backbone sooner or later. I was wrong. Time after time Emily almost spoke up for herself only to back down. I won't even get started on Emily's annoying relatives. All in all I will definately think twice before wasting my money on another of Ms. Krentz's novels. It's only too bad a zero star rating wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Huma Origins","review":"Zimmer, as usual, did a fine job in picking and presenting the current thoughts on how we humans came to be. While I have read a number of books in this general field, Intimate Guide pulls up many fine details that clear up some confusion between theories and make for a great read. It is especially helpful in understanding how hominids originally populated the world and how we fit into the picture.The excellent photos and illustrations are helpful and compliment the text very well. A very good choice for anyone who wonders where we came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for understanding the ancestry of human beings","review":"An excellent and brilliant introductory book for the big puzzle of human origins! The writer transforms the anthropological and evolutionary literatures into a popular reading.

It starts out in New York, moves to Hong Kong and then is set in Thailand. Exotic location helps but the author obviously knows his stuff.

This book was impossible to trudge through, and worse yet, the story itself was hard to swallow. By the end, not only had I lost all respect for the main character and wished I had left this book back in Thailand, but wished I hadn't spent the full cover price they were charging in Bangkok.

It still took 15-20 minutes to cook the potatoes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Book","review":"This delightful book tells the story of a family who leave the modern, fast-track life for the unexpected simplicity of the countryside. The author cleverly lets you into the different reasons that family members had for agreeing to the change in circumstances and leads you through little twists and turns as they learn to cope with a new life style.It is a book that, once started, has to be read; everybody can relate to it in some way, but I particularly liked the way that the author treated the subject with great understanding - just like real life, not everything goes to plan.

Of course, that's just too good to be true. Shame on the seller for writing it that way and shame on me for falling for it. Just so we are clear, I bought it at $2.36 each at a quantity of 10 total, expecting to get 90 strips, and yes, that is too good to be true. They now list the price as $16.14 each. So.

This is the third reading [of the whole thing and have read parts of it several times]. I used some of the documented parts - which is much of the book - in my classroom before I retired and took a group of students to Chillicothe, Ohio to see the outdoor drama \\"Tecumseh\\" based upon the book.The Bible, The Frontiersmen and Gone With the Wind are the only three books I have read that were worthy of reading more than once...so far that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"A great way to learn about our early American history (and how terrible the early settlers treated the American Indians).

Allan Eckert researched historical records for 7 years to write this book. Everything in it is true. The central character is an fascinating man named Simon Kenton. Into the wilderness at age 16, he led such an amazing life you'll swear you're reading an adventure novel! He was respected and feared by frontiersmen and indians alike. Captured by the Shawnee, almost burned at the stake, ran the gauntlet and even saved Daniel Boone's life with a feat of incredible strength. These are just a couple of the many stories of the frontier. If you only read one Kentucky Frontier book, you've found it. For more information about Simon Kenton, see his home page at:http://www.webpub.com/jhagee/kenton.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book due to the positive customer reviews and the interesting subject matter.

I loved to read as a teen. I loved history -- I went on to get my degree in it. This book threatened to change all of that.A ponderous piece of agonizing minutiae, this book brought me to the breaking point. I read it -- the whole thing. As a fifteen year old. I think it actually made me cry, I hated it so much. It's well researched, but seemed almost masturbatory in its envisioning of the motivations of frontiersmen. And excruciatingly long. Some people obviously enjoy this book. To each their own. But for the rest of you, it is okay to hate it. Really. You know you want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"i cant beleive i have to give this book a star. it is the most worthless peice of literature i have ever read. i feel dumber for opening it up. the book should be burned. it has absolutely nothing to offer. why would allan eckert think anyone would enjoy this crud. i want the 5 minutes back that i spent reading the first paragraph. leanr how to write a decent book"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Frontersmen","review":"Liked it at the beginning, towards the middle I began to question the author's percieved perception of the hero as a man of greatness.I began to view him as nothing but a land grabbing cruel man without any morals only the destruction of a way of life and the indian people.He fought to protect the settlers to increase the value of his holdings I was pleased to see that these same people that he fought to protect actually stole the stolen land from him.I actually stopped reading the book which is something I am loathe to do but as it rolled on and on it became a horror storyThe book is too long and the subject is truly not a hero deserving of statues"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly entertaining work from a writer of great integrity","review":"Eckert based much of this book on his studies of the exhaustive Draper interviews. He elegantly weaves the history together in a narrative that is hard to put down. Daniel Boone is here, but I think Simon Kenton and Techumseh play a much more vital role. Eckert pulls together the entire history of the settlement of Ohio, West(ern) Virginia, and Kentucky. There is a small section of this story that has turned out to be historically inaccurate. In a later book, \\"A Sorrow in Our Heart\\" Eckert points out the error, explains the source of the problem, and corrects it. My point is that this meticulous historian was not afraid to recognize and correct his own mistake. Anyone interested in the history of settlement of the Northwest Territory will be completely swept up in this epic narrative. I have the paperback, but I just purchased the hardcover edition. This book is worth keeping for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book have read it many times!","review":"It was required reading in a Kentucky History course I was taking.

I would have to say that this book is one of the best, if not THE best book that I have ever read. I am an 8th grade history teacher in Ohio. I use this book in my classes and try to make the name Simon Kenton come to life for my students. It's a shame that he is usually only mentioned briefly in most text books. He was a greater frontiersman than Daniel Boone. Boone must have had some very good PR people. For us that live in the Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Indiana areas, this book is must reading. As someone previously mentioned, the historic sites in The Frontiersmen are within a few hours drive. This helps make history come alive.

The 500 plus pages fly by as you become engrossed in the struggles of our forefathers to establish safe homes on the frontier. However you cannot help but sympathize with the Indians as they see their ancestoral lands stripped away as far away governments vied for ever more land. Eckard's superb use of chapter notes adds clarification for geography buffs who try to place the sites of events and battles.A great read at a great price but I did find a slight fault with the quality of this publication created by Jesse Stuart Foundation. Strangely the front and back covers began to curl up and stay that way.

He became a friend of Daniel Boone and in fact saved his life in a daring rescue at Boonsboro. The book includes many detailed facts gathered from diaries, memoirs, historical records and many other sources and each is carefully footnoted. Many references are made to geographical locations of events so that you can actually drive up to the place where these historical events occurred.

What doesn't repeat is the music and they offer jazz, classical, etc., so that's how they're getting away with the 600 minute claim. The music just continues on and on over the same old images. I feel completely duped. What a waste of money. I bought the DVDs hoping for at least an hour of footage over which I could play my own music, and after 15 minutes of repeats I'm already bored with it.

I almost put my foot through the TV on several occasions.It is arguably the worst sports movie ever made and anyone associated with it should be ashamed of themselves. Only rent it if you're curious how bad it could possibly be... but rent a second movie that you can watch after you throw Slap Shot 2 out the window after ten minutes.Actually what may be fun is get a group of people together... that way you can at least take pleasure in yelling at the TV every time something stupid happens (and trust me... you have no idea what you're in for... you can't even imagine how [bad] this movie gets by the end).

The Hanson Brothers are still on the roster, apparently so the team can meet the league quota for 50 year olds. I don't want to \\"ruin\\" the \\"plot twists\\", so you'll have to sit through it to find out. Must be seen to appreciate how god-awful it is. Gary Busey zombie-walks through his role as a right-wing media mogul who purchases the team and moves them to Nebraska. In a movie full of imposibilites, the most riduculous event is the hot female coach falling for Baldwin, who looks and acts like a complete dork throughout the entire movie. Don't purchase this piece of garbage, rent it instead. If you're a fan of the original movie, avoid this at all costs, unless you also enjoyed Blues Brothers 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I love hockey. I love hockey movies.

How did the \\"movement\\" incorporate and become synonomous with abortion? Mrs. Sanger, at least in this piece that she wrote, was outspokenly anti-abortion. Yet, her brainchild- Planned Parenthood- is the largest national provider of abortions today. I took from this book that Mrs. Sanger was a bit naive and surrounded herself with some sinister circles. Circles that saw the profit that could be made through abortion. Sufficing their desires for population control and greed. Mrs. Sanger helped in the opening of a Pandora's box of eugenics and moral relativeness.

I found the sound output rather amazing for such a small package. AM reception wasn't great but adequate. FM was fine. SW left much to be desired. My wife was born and raised in Africa and I bought this radio with the idea she might pickup stations from South Africa or Kenya. We could get very few stations at all and none from Africa.And the worst has been after less than six months use I found the radio sitting in a pool of \\"radio blood\\" this morning. I suppose some large capacitor inside leaked (no, it wasn't batteries). So now it doesn't work.

So much has happened since then, television series, movies, both of his first CDs going gold, staring on Broadway and being nominated for a Tony. I am honored to say I am still a fan and have grown with him and his constant growth. If you are a fan, get this CD just to remember the thrill of hearing \\"Over the rainbow\\" WOW! Back at that time, all we had were weak singers like Paul Young (where is he today and who cares?) so when Sam hit the stage, history was made.But I can never tire of \\"Rainbow\\", that song still makes me shiver.

I was excited to see some of the songs were reissued in this compililation. If you are a fan of Sam, this is a great starter CD. He has such energy and vocal talent. The reason why I did not give this CD 5 stars is because I am spoiled. There are so many great songs on the vinyl records that are not included on this complilation.

What happened to \\"Sugar Don't Bite\\" and his tremendous cover of \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" as well as other great LP tracks? For those of us who wanted Sam Harris' Motown records on CD, this one is sure a major disappointment. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it has got \\"Over The Rainbow.\\" Come on, Motown, you could have done better than this thrown together collection.

You do need to purchase 2 thin cement blocks to weigh it down. It brought up a lot of thatch - more than I expected - without tearing up the lawn.

Erotic, but not \\"in-your-face\\" like more hardcore movies. Unfortunately, this movie tried to be too many things to too many people and instead ended up failing at everything. At its heart is the marriage of a professional couple that lacks passion. The wife ends up in a lesbian affair with a pretty photographer. But things turn quite weird when the husband becomes involved. A bizarre love triangle is formed, and the movie goes from romantic to dramatic to just plain weird. I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but the plot twists can be seen a mile away. And to make matters worse, the ending is downright depressing (though by this time, any semblance of caring for the main characters has all but vanished).Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice atmosphere.

However, for the last couple of days, the line appears as soon as the tv is turned on, and does not go away. I searched the internet, and sure enough, this is a rampant, well-known defect of the Panasonic plasma panel. I tried to contact the plasma conceirge that Panasonic provides its high end plasma customers. For well over an hour all I got was a busy signal.

His detective work leads him to explore the wild party scene of the 20's where he discovers a cocaine ring.Lord Peter must exercise his considerable charm and social skills to penetrate what appears to be an accident and is in fact an almost perfect crime. He takes his middle names--Death Bredon--as his pseudonym, and his predilection for chit-chat is utilized to the utmost. He develops another alter ego to penetrate the cocaine ring that is as dark and mysterious as Bredon is civilized and chatty.Like most of Sayers stories this book provides a slice of life from a time long past. The lives, relationships and values of middle class advertising employees are cleverly and sympathetically portrayed. In addition, there is an ingenious murder that must be solved by Lord Peter's intuitive and intensely analytical mind.

Embarrassing to give this as a birthday present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun","review":"My kids and my neighbors' kids love the popsicles I make with these. They are huge. Since they need to stand up in the freezer until frozen, you really need to make sure you'll have room for it in there, it's probably around 6\\" tall, and 5\\" wide.

Unfortunately, it wasn't much help. I don't think Joshua the raven genuinely discovered his true purpose in life at the end of the story. I don't believe that God speaks to our minds with such specificity and clarity as he does to Joshua the raven in this book. To me, this is a children's book. I wouldn't encourage my children to read it, however, because I believe the messages it gives about how God communicates with us are misleading and may confuse and distress young people seeking purpose in their lives.

Met Sam a couple times at a couple performances. This CD reminds me of some of the performances I saw live on the Open-Mike nights. Wonderful.My favorite song on this CD is Let Me Sing. What a fun uplifiting song. Always makes me sing along in my car. All songs and performances on the CD are terrific. Treat yourself to this CD - you will be pleased. I can almost picture them being performed live. I miss those days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice companion to the book","review":"If you plan to use The Five Dysfunctions to actually build your team, you will need to do some training and team meetings.

The included guide also helps the novice to facilitate a structed program for introducing the key elements to a team. The product is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD drive? No famed customer support","review":"Basic problem is I can't move files from old computer to the new GT5228. The GT5228 DVD drive reads all data CDs burned on the old machine as blank. Three calls to Gateway tech support have bordered on ridiculous. I'd be better off asking some teenager on the street. One said I'd be better off returning the machine and buying a Dell (she also said everything was a \\"third party\\" issue, so she couldn't help me). Another told me to not worry about the DVD drive and just buy a thumb drive. That's all well and good and might finally get me around the problem, but it doesn't fix the problem that my DVD drive can't write or read a disc for the purposes of transferring files. That's a basic notion. I dread what else might be wrong inside this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought 5 books for a recent trip to Ireland and this is the only book I did not even bother to bring with me.

It needs more pictures...a lot more pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"This book is a very good reference for all the major attractions that you would want to see in Ireland but it lacks intimate knowledge of the areas that I was hoping to find in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition useless for actual travel","review":"I was pretty proud of myself for planning to go \\"all Kindle\\" for my upcoming trip to Europe. What I mean is, instead of buying the dead tree edition of this book, I just clicked the \\"download to iPad\\" button and thought I was good to go. The night before the trip I took a second, closer, look at the contents of this ebook. OK, the text is not as nicely laid out as in the paperback editions that I'm used to. But the real deal killer was the maps. They are all crappy: Low resolution, pixelated and hard on the eyes. Some maps are readable anyway, but some (for example \\"Greater Dublin,\\" location 2135) are blurry and completely illegible. And the whole-country color map, always found on the inside cover, doesn't seem to be present at all.I have no opinion on the contents of this book yet. I'll let you know after I buy the paperback edition and take it on the road.

I have been to Europe several times before, and usually enjoy the Lonely Planet series- I can credit 2 great vacations to their recommendations. Sorely disappointed in this edition. Terrible information regarding public transportation (which was significantly less available than in other major european cities- and which I would have liked to know)- there was no mention of the fact that in order to get the student fares on the train system, you have to come in to the country with a 'student identification card' that you have to apply for weeks ahead of time. Visiting Ireland is nearly worthless if you don't rent a car, I found out by the end of the trip from my own experience. Sorry Lonely Planet, this time, my trip was more costly than anticipated, significantly less exciting, and I came back feeling \\"eehhh\\" about the whole country."},{"rating":"1","title":"not specific enough...","review":"Although Lonely Planet Ireland is wonderful for short trips around the country, stays of over two weeks reqire much more detail.

The writing about Irish culture seemed strident and raw, as if written from embittered experience. I wasn't pleased to encounter profanity peppered into the descriptions, including the f-word and p-word. Sure, I'm a grown-up, but I thought this was a travel book? Then I encountered the text attacking the church, and the boxed section devoted to quoting and promoting a gay rights activist. Now, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I bought the book for an objective take on Ireland, not to promote or read about the writers' political or social agenda. I wish I'd known what we were getting before my wife bought the book. I can't trust a guidebook that seems to revel in its own slant. We're giving the book away to Goodwill, and we'll rely on the other guidebooks we bought, like Rick Steves' (there are so many out there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need","review":"Just the guidebook you need to see Ireland at any depth, for a short visit or an extended stay.

Why would I want to waste my time buying something for x amount of dollars for a few episodes when I can pay the same amount before for half a season.

Even though I transferred it to cd, I wanted a clean new copy of that song. For some reason, I thought this would be it. WRONG! This banjo-mandolin-laden silly-sounding array of (here-to-fore) wonderful classics is the worst album Parton has ever produced and she should be ashamed. It's like she's some kind of plastic doll you wind up and it spews out the worst versions of beloved songs an arranger could possibly put together.I'm still looking for that early version of Turn Turn Turn, where she sounded like she actually listened to the words she was singing.If anyone knows how I can get that song on an mp3 or cd, let me know!Oh, and DO NOT BUY THIS DISC.

With every song, her personality is present and her voice is angelic as ever. Every time I hear Dolly sing, I get goose-bumps from the power and purity that is Dolly Parton.

I'm sad to say Dolly did no credit to any of these songs; many sound campy and her \\"I'm on the verge of tears\\" style of singing on a lot of the tracks grows wearing fast.

Intrigued by the story of two high school friends reuniting to backpack together after many years of silence provoked my interest.Unfortunately. the brautiful backdrop did not overcome the bland reunion of these colorless women. Their whining and meaningless memories left me void of any interest for their future relationship.

They now find themselves alone together on what had been planned as a reunion camping trip with the gang of five girls who had been best pals in high school.

ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Book If You Want To Make Beads","review":"Like others have said,\\"If I had this book when I first started\\".This book has something to learn on each page. The colored pictures help show you step by step insturctions on forming beads for different levels of your lampworking. For what you spend on this book you could never walk out of a class with this much infomation. This isn't a book that will be viewed a few times. It is one that you will wear the pages out and might even want to replace. Corina has opened up lampworking for so many beadmakers by offering this book. I look forward to her next although I can't imagine what would be in it. I'am sure she will come up with it. I don't believe five stars comes close to this books rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passing The Flame","review":"This is one of the BEST lampworking books I've seen/read.

As someone who has torched for a number of years, I still find it a go to book for clarification on things. recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible for Lampwork Beading","review":"I had read another book on making lampwork beads which left me wanting so much more. I decided to purchase Passing the Flame and wish I would have purchased it first. Cornia's step by step instructions are what I needed as a beginner. I read her instructions, try making the bead and if I fail read the instructions again. This is a must have book for any lampwork bead creator, especially if you are a beginner. She \\"talks\\" to you and makes everything very understandable. I can't thank her enough for her instructions and tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of Beadmaking!!","review":"Hello,My name is Brenda and I am a Beadmaker.

I have found it to have helped me through my beadmaking every step of the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Book - Even if you aren't a bead maker!","review":"This book is worth the price even if you never intend to make a bead. Gorgeous pictures of lampwork beads make you wish you owned all of them.

VERY COOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You want to learn to make glass beads? this one is for you!","review":"I have taken classes with the best, spent many hours on my torch, have all of Cindy Jenkin's books and Jim Kervin and All You need to Know about Glass Bead Making and I still really loved this book and use it to all the time- I could care less about a few typos- the pictures and clear description of the steps taken to achieve a given result are very good and I learned a lot from all the \\"digressions\\" between the \\"how tos\\"- If you agree with the premise that to become an artist who creates original work you first have to master the basics then this book will teach you not only all the basics but also how to move on and try your own style. Best $75 I spent on this obsession of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone who knows Corina knows she works in soft glass","review":"This book is great especially for someone like me, a newbie.

I recommend this book to my students. It is a MUST have for every lampworker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lampworking book on the market !!","review":"This book is awesome! Teaches you how to work soft glass.What can I say... it teaches you practically everything you need to know about the basics of beadmaking and more! Before I started lampworking I bought the book first and I read the book from cover to cover anxious to start my new adventure which is what this book teaches you ~ how to make all kinds of different shaped beads, stringer decoration,how to pull stringers... the list goes on. Without this book I would be lost in the lampworking world. This book is a must have for all those beginning to lampwork. It's like having a teacher in your own home."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredible tale, poorly written.","review":"The fact that the Chunnel is in operation today has to be one of man's greatest achievements. The story of the construction of the tunnel itself is amazing, but the entire history and the efforts of the companies, governments, and individuals is even more incredible. However, the book itself is did not do this story justice. I found it very difficult to follow both chronologically and factually. The book jumped around in time which made it hard to distinguish how things took place. There were so many characters not germaine to the project that it was hard to keep the names of the people involved straight. I found that without diagrams or illustrations, the explanations of the construction and engineering was difficult to comprehend, and I am an engineer. I understand there may be a video, I suggest renting it instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has no business being a book!!","review":"Fetherston,a business writer for Newsday,has made this as interesting as having the Dow ticker between hardcovers.Chock full of names,acronyms,quotes,financial arcania,and administrative jealousies....everything but a story.At a minimum,there should have been organizational charts and time lines, synopses and summaries.Just about UNREADABLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star","review":"I like this book I give it a 5 star rating because i like this book alot to I think you will like thes book becase I liked it and I like alot of books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"The musical qualities of this score do not overly impress in themselves, but the really important thing is ... despite what other reviewers may attest ... and it was on account of those reviews that I bought this score ...

So this book wasextremely helpful - who pays for what, the differences between two people, what to call the in-laws, how to save money.Very insightful, very funny and practical.

Ordered it from a search of \\"solar umbrella\\" and did not realize it was not solar powered as were the other 100 items on the list. Fabric is quite sheer, not exactly see through but nothing close to canvas as I have experienced with other market umbrellas."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighted unbrella","review":"I was not looking for a lit umbrella, but I think the lights will make for a cozy summer evening. It is too early in the season to give a accurate review, other than say this is a very nice umbrella and seems it will be sturdy. I have never left a umbrella up in a strong wind, in fact, I completely remove it, so I would not be able to comment on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI: understand \\"canvas\\" before you buy","review":"I read the other reviews and looked at the pictures before I ordered this umbrella. Seemed OK.However, what was not reviewed was the fabric of the umbrella- the \\"canvas.\\"To me, the common understanding of the word \\"canvas\\" is a heavier weight cotton or cotton blend- a durable fabric. The fabric on the umbrella I received was like thin nylon. Most disappointing. I returned the umbrella.I think the product description should be corrected for a truer understanding by the shopperbefore deciding to order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighted Umbrella","review":"I love my umbrella!! The lights put out a beautiful amber glow. I received it on time, as promised and would recommend to eveyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Umbrella!","review":"We bought this umbrella as an add on for a cheap-o patio set that we picked up.

Nothing cheap or cheesy about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umbrella did not open","review":"The umbrella was defective and broken when i received it. The first time i tried to open the umbrella, it would not open with the crank. I agree with the comments related to the quality and look of the material on the canopy as it did seem like a cheap plastic like material versus a nice cloth one that i expected. The one positive is that Amazon allowed me top return it with no issues and no cost to return it. I definitely do not recommend the umbrella as the quality seems lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLEW IN MY POOL AND STILL WORKS HAHAH","review":"Pretty decent for the price and lights up!

We have had wind and sun as well as fog and they have performed very well. One of them is bent a bit from a flight over the pool deck, but all in all, I would buy this product again.Was surprised to get the chargers and find out that the lights don't just self charge. It has to be very dark to get some light out of these - but something is better than nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No lights- Updated","review":"Just got mine. Quick shipping. The construction and materials are what you would expect for [...] bucks. Setup easy.

Their website is a joke.MADE IN CHINA.Updated 8/30Made phone call to manufacturer customer service. A one man operation. Nice guy,but wanted to send me a new adapter to try.

But, it was very minor and did not affect the look or functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age: GREAT ALBUM!","review":"I rate this album 5 stars because of centimental value. It is memories of a great time with my first boyfriend, (True Love). This cd was totally played out, it skips on the best songs: Intimate, One in a Million.

It isn't the best, I would actually give it about 3.5 stars, however it is a solid debut and these guys can really harmonize, buy it for the slow cuts.

I really now want my money back cause it doesn't take a month to get this order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures, difficult to follow and there are errors","review":"I decided to check this out of the library before purchasing and I'm really glad I did. Found several errors, including a major one on my favorite pattern, the bobbles and vines. Found the descriptions at times difficult to follow. Would have been easier to follow a chart.My interest was in the lace patterns and this for me was disappointing. Did not really focus on the other chapters but perhaps for some those would be useful.I do love the yarns they chose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This stitch dictionary book is well laid out and easy to follow. While this book doesn't contain charts, the following Vol. 2 with cables has both the written and charted format. Vogue Knitting has corrections on it's website and does relay what patterns were displayed at the beginning of the chapters. I found the size and color of the pictures to be delightful. I recommend this to anyone who loves stitchinaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only stitch guide I'm keeping","review":"1. I have not found any mistakes in the pattens I've tried so far;2. The green yarn used may not be something I'd choose for myself, but it shows the pattern nicely;3. Every pattern is easy to understand so it can be used for sweaters, blankets, etc. with minimal fussing;4. It's a single book with so much to choose from that you'll have more ideas than you know what to do with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety","review":"I love this book. As the title says, it is just a straight-forward \\"stitchionary\\", no patterns, very little text. It has lots of variety within k/p stitches. Every stitch has a photo and written instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"sandi","review":"If you like the layout ofNicky Epstein's Borders books you will like this However the various shaes of green did not appeal The patterns especially the Lace look great but I have not had a chance to check the accuracy I look forward to the cables version"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I like to look at the pictures in this book. I suppose if I ever get around to designing my own projects I will use these. Until then, it is a good inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the charts?","review":"The blurb for this book states that it includes charts, but my copy has only written instructions. What happened to the charts? I'd be more inclined to use this book if I could SEE how the stitch patterns are formed. I'll also think twice about buying Volume 2 (cables) when it comes out in May if it only has written instructions.What a disappointment. Vogue Knitting was a pioneer of charts for knitting patterns way back in the 80's. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No charts - What were they thinking?","review":"The patterns in this book are beautiful, but they're useless to me because they don't have charts. I've never seen a book of this type without charts.They should have used bigger needles for the lace patterns - many of the patterns were hard to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, with some flaws","review":"Bought this product to go along with my son's Thomas wooden railway set.PROS: Realistic and durable. Versatile - top piece can be removed and mountain still looks good.CONS: Although the top tunnel has enough clearance, the bottom tunnel has low clearance. If the mountain is placed over wooden track, some Thomas trains (Thomas, Annie, Clarabel) will pass through, but some others will get stuck. The generic wooden tracks the come with the set do not have the exact same measurements as Thomas track. The staight and curved pieces are slightly longer. The ascending piece is about 1/2 inch longer and 3/8 inch shorter than the Thomas equivalent. This may not affect the overall layout but the connections aren't as smooth. The ascending Thomas track actually works perfectly here.Overall, it looks good but ended up not using the bottom tunnel. It's reasonably priced compared to other Thomas accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Awkward","review":"This piece may be fine if you have very little track already or have the world's biggest train table. Otherwise, it is so cumbersome with very little going on. Not worth the space on our table as we have plenty of cooler things to build with. I was hoping it would be more versatile, but it is not. There is a back slope that takes up tons of space and has no track/opening that can be used. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with Chuggington trains!","review":"I bought this based on the good reviews. The product seems durable and will probably stand up to my 2 year old. However, I bought this trying to find a tunnel that would fit Chuggington trains. They are a little bit larger than the Thomas engines and don't fit under the Thomas bridges, etc. This one said it was compatible with other wooden track sets, BUT IT STILL DOESN'T WORK WITH THE CHUGGINGTON ENGINES AND CARS!!! Therefore, I am giving it a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your definition of compatibility","review":"The hand cleaner dispenser is claimed to be compatible with many hand cleaner containers. But, almost all products from Permatex (including DL) come in containers that have no special attachment for the dispenser. So, you take off the top, flip the plastic tub of cleaner upside down, and poke a vent hole in the bottom (which is now on top). The tub just rests on the dispenser, which means that it's easily knocked off. Permatex claims that it doesn't leak, even though the vented, open-on-the-bottom tub is just sitting on the dispenser. Permatex does say that their 1-gallon tubs of cleaner have threads that actually screw on to the dispener. But, the only such thing I've found is Devcon Fast Orange in the Flat-Top Gallon container (23104). List price seems to be $40 - $50, and almost nobody carries it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt Fit their own product","review":"According to the lables of both the Permatex DL handcleaner and the Permatex Universal dispenser they are both compatible fits. The reality is they do not. The cleaner fits inside of the retainer ring which is clearly made for a much larger container. When upside down and in place the cleaner is held on by gravity alone, easily knocked off. How they can claim that the 2 items are made for each other is beyond frustrating. Permatex does not seem to even create a product that fits their \\"universal\\" dispenser, nor does anyone else. I took it back off the wall immediatly and returned it for another brand. How very odd that this product design ever made it into fabrication. Gojo makes a dispenser that allows cleaners to be \\"snapped\\" into place, and you can tell that they are not going to fall off. This product is not even close. Shameful indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Permated 95140 dispenser","review":"I bought one of these thinking it would be good for dispensing the cream hand cleaner. Like the other review said, with the 4.5 lb container (standard) the tub just basically sits on top of it. It appears there is a provision for retaining a larger container, but I have yet to find one.With aggressive pumping of the dispenser, the container can just fall off to the side due to no real provision to attach it to the dispenser.I am buying a GoJo dispenser because it got good review and appears it was designed for the 4.5 lb container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and badly out of date","review":"I wish this text hadn't been chosen for my Foundations of Distance Education course (MS.Ed. program). It may have a 2012 copyright, but it's quickly apparent that while the copyright has been updated, the content has not been. I know technology is ever changing, but the technology covered in the book is out of date to the point of irrelevancy. I also didn't care for the conversational style used by the authors.

The pictures were beautiful, but it was very difficult to navigate. I do not consider myself an expert gardener, but I have been creating flower beds for the past 30 years, and have many garden design books. I found this book to be very time consuming as well as confusing if you are not well versed on botanical names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly commended and highly recommended reading","review":"Ably written by magazine columnist and international speaker Ellie Kay (best known for her regular guest appearances on CNBC's \\"Power Lunch\\"), A Woman's Guide To Family Finances is a no-nonsense guide to keeping the family out of debt, ready to weather financial setbacks, and with an eye always vigilant toward future financially relevant plans. Do's and Don'ts of spending; various investments; saving; and planning simplify the complex task of managing money while minimizing risk (especially in today's unpredictable and volatile era), A Woman's Guide To Family Finances is strongly commended and highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money advice and humor--all in one book!","review":"As a banking consultant and MBA, I've gotten the finer aspects of personal money management pretty well nailed down. But I never miss the opportunity to pick up a good financial read, and will say this book had yet new ideas and fresh reminders on keeping my family's finances in good shape. Great take-aways.The style in which author Ellie Kay writes carries the reader along (with a whole lot of laughs while Kay reveals her hilarious personal foibles) so what could have been a boring tome truly morphs into a page-turner. Don't pick it up if you've got insomnia, because you won't be falling asleep! I've read Suze Orman, David Bach, Andrew Tobias, and many other best-selling financial books. This one is right up there, and not to be missed.No wonder the book is featured by Wal-Mart. I checked out the author's website and found some v. entertaining video clips as well, fyi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew finances could be so much FUN!","review":"Ellie Kay does a masterful job helping families manage finances. In fact, the book should be titled, Family Guide to Finances, because she has the whole family involved! Having been raised by immigrant parents whose values helped me to become a responsible spender, saver, donator, Ellie's book still offers reasons to keep reading--from the eight money-saving/spending personalities (including, Love Ya Louie and Balanced Betty), resources for saving money online, keeping track of what we spend, to the Money Pyramid (starting with 10% FUN money). Most of all, her stories and digressions make this a real page-turner filled with valuable nuggets."},{"rating":"2","title":"McPhatter at a point of innocence.","review":"It's interesting to listen to this CD because as a collector of his work, I concentrate on his voice. On this CD his voice has a sound of innocence and although emotional, not as realistic sounding as his later work with the Drifters and then his solo career. I can hear the growth in his later work."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible for the price","review":"this train is of very poor quality. I would prefer a wind-up train to this... we've had to replace the batteries at least 3 times in a couple of days. Even with fresh batteries the engine is so weak it can't even get up a tiny incline by itself let alone with a load attached... it also moves very slow.to replace the battery for the motor you need to have a really small screw driver and its completely ridiculous that this company assumes everyone has one of those.no wonder it was on sale..

There are definite strong points and weak points to point out:+ Strong pulling power: makes it up a steep uphill incline with three cars attached.+ Price: got this for half the price of some more expensive Brio models.- Poor switch mechanism: uses a slider bar that you push one way for forwards, the other way to go backwards, while the center position is the off position. This switch requires a little too much finesse for a little one, especially compared to the simpler mechanism found on the Brio motorized locomotives.- No auto shut-off: if left on it will consume the battery in hours (much faster consumption than Brio trains)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one day.","review":"This train was bought at local big box store.

I know of few other books that give a realistic sense of missionary work. This book is the story of Dow and Lois Robinson's work amoung the native Aztec people. It tells the story of Dow's work in translating the Bible, his experiences with the local peoples, and his encounters with the Holy Spirit. This is missions not based on an idea but on an actual encounter. I can also attest to the genuine love the author has for the people due to my friendship with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor execution.","review":"Twin brothers, a fifty year old grievance, and an anagram set the stage for another adventure with Chief Inspector Morse. A good start, but the rush to the conclusion in the last two chapters causes the otherwise intriguing story line to collaspe into a shambles. A poor performance by Colin Dexter ruins a potentially good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dexter!","review":"This book is classic Dexter. There are more blind alleys and corners throughout than you usually find in two or three books, let alone just one. This case causes Morse to use all his skills and abilities when he tries to unravel this mystery. It starts out with a headless torso turning up in a nearby river. Morse and his faithful Lewis have to identify this body as well as find the killer. More bodies keep turning up and it soon appears that they don't have any suspects, let alone an identity to the first murder victim.

Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting? No. Good plot? No. Good? Yes.","review":"I came across this book in a second hand book shop. Battered and dog-eared it set me back two pounds. Well worth six times that. Harvey narrates as if he is talking right to you, all the while probably wondering if your going to buy the records he's offering or if you'll leave in time for him to watch the game. His stories are rich with human insight, a special fave of mine being a single page story when a nerdy looking filing clerk hurts his finger and gets a plaster for it only to be unexpectedly hugged by a weeping black vietnam vet who had his life saved by him. Other gems are Harvey getting shortchanged for some grapes and his seemingly endless old book and record bulk buys. If it sounds boring, trust me, it's not. American Splendor is also drawn by a massive variety of top artists, Robert Crumb, Chester Brown and Jim Woodring to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"More interesting than it has a right to be!","review":"Seinfeld, a show about nothing? Pbbbb. Never thought it was that special. Heard about this guy named Harvey Pekar who writes comics about well, nothing. Not nothing really but ordinary, mundane everyday things. Saw the movie, liked it, picked up the Anthology at the library. Hooked. Want more. More. The first friggin' page had me hooked, the old fella telling Harvey about the rag peddlers cry. 'PAAAY-PER REGGS'. The thing is I don't think Harvey needs every dollar now. Between the movie and his work being reissued and the new found interest in him and his comics, he's probably laughing, or brooding, all the way to the bank. Good for you Harvey Pekar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin Shines thru as usual","review":"I have read most if not all of W E B Griffin's books.

It turns out to be the total opposite. A big bore. I agree with a previous reviewer's comments about too much intimate encounters of the main characters. Oh, and way too many characters' names to keep track of. 80% of them non-essential to plot. Affairs and adultery run amuck. The actual main mission doesn't start until around page 350 and last for about 20 pages. I also realize that setting up a mission of that sort requires a lot of preparatory work, but this was ridiculous. The book runs 384 pages and 75% of it is wasted on establishing the 2 first main characters absurd and imature personalites. As some might know, it a Men At War series of books, which I will not continue to follow. Save yourself some time and read something better and real, like To Hell And Back or Beyond Valor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill a minute","review":"I have read everything W.E.B.

This is a very good tale of how things may have been leading up to Pearl Harbor. The only negative thing I have to say about it is it sounds vary familiar. I have stated in the past and will do so again, Mr. Griffin needs to expand his basic character base. We seem to always have the rich kid, the poor kid, and the wealthy parents and in-laws. I want to read about two guys that don't have a trust fund. THis book is worth reading if you are a fan of Griffin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"As a fan of W.E.B. Griffin, I found THE LAST HEROS to be disappointing. It is supposed to be about the Manhattan Project. In fact it isn't a novel, it is just the introductory chapter of a novel-a very long introduction, with an intriguing premise, but it really doesn't get beyond that. I found the \\"romance\\" to be a shallow distraction. Apparently, Mr. Griffin had an idea for a novel, which he planned to milk into a series. Replace \\"milk\\" with \\"water down\\".

Not much of an ending - obviously setting up for (hopefully more and better) action in future novels in the series.This is my first Griffin novel and most likely my last. \\"Stuff\\" happens, but nothing very interesting. It made me think differently about the early battle for the Philippines; that was the most I got out of this book. I didn't really care what happened to the main characters - lots of drinking, lots of sex - so what? Even with historical figures like Roosevelt, MacArthur, and Donovan, I just didn't care what happened. I finished the book hoping it would get better, and it didn't.

If you want a feel for the war and want someone with imagination to connect the illogical dots surrounding FDR, MacArthur, and Corregidor, then read this novel.Richard Canidy and Eddie Bitter bring the \\"Flying Tigers\\" close to home and Richard Canidy gets swept off on a James Bond-type adventure.

The information in the book will make the building of a stove as a secondary heat source something I can feel confident about while knowing the stove will perform efficiently.

The bar performs well and does what it's supposed to do, but it lacks the features of high-end bars made by other manufacturers (e.g. storage on the motor home, only having to get the tow vehicle 'close' to the bar to complete hookup, etc.). Additionally, the kit doesn't include safety chains (although the bar has mounts for them). A trip to the local Wal-Mart solves that issue.Given this towing solution costs hundreds of dollars less than a higher-end one, I'll put up with the minor inconveniences encountered while hooking up/unhooking. Overall an economical way to tow flat-bumpered cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gits 'er done.","review":"I have owned this tow bar for a number of years and used it to tow my '87 4WD Toyota pickup behind my full size Ford F-250 and then my 28' motorhome for literally thousands of miles.

In the first movement of D850, it seemed as though Schubert had written repeated accented chords and then filled in the interstices with scrimshaw, and with scrimshaw a bit unsure of itself at that. I was alway brought up short, thinking that we ought to get somewhere with this, but we didn't. It went on, more banging, more noodling, and more banging, until I ejected the disk and gave it away. Schubert doesn't normally require patience. If you want to live to be 150 in subjective time, try Philip Glass or that patience-trying \\"Bolero.\\"Out of respect for Schubert, whom I don't know as well as some of the oher great Teutonic composers, I'll look around for another version.

The new one is nearly identical to the old one, and just as addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't relate to the posted prices!","review":"This looks like the same game that I have had for many years. It is my \\"library' game, along with an original BW version of Gameboy. I think that I might have paid around $[...] for it. So, I am wondering is this some \\"new\\" version of the game I have? Or is this another case of pricing an item wayyyyyyyyyyyy above the true value? [...]+ is unbelieveably ridiculous... Believe me, is fun, but not THAT much fun! And I agree with some of the older reviews regarding the limitations of repeated tile selections and vowels are definitely hard to come by. Often the computer takes wayyyy too much time to play. I have to lay it down and return later."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is hard to put down!!","review":"I love this game! It is small in size, yet has a large, easy to read screen. There are interesting variations and skill levels, one can explore. The game does not shut off for at least ten minutes, after use. This does not seem to be draining the batteries though. I have been playing for hours on end, with the original batteries. The game does cheat at times. It makes up words and uses them when it feels like it! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass","review":"I have two complaints about Scrabble Express.First, if you have no play (or just want to pass your turn), the game provides no way to pass or dump your tiles. To advance the game you must make a play on each turn.Second, the game board isn't full sized (at least when compared to the board version of the game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather limited in scope, but can be fun.","review":"The game works well and has never malfunctioned, so physically it is very good. However, the letters in racks given are unrealistically skewed towards high-scoring letters like Q and X. Vowels are fewer than real games. The board is very small so naturally the probability of high scoring plays is small, but any good player could do well despite the size of board. I would not recommend this for adults who are advanced players as this device may be too limited in options to satisfy skilled players. However, very good for amateurs and occasional players, and has the added bonus of having a built-in dictionary so that one can be sure that all words employed are real words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down!","review":"I can't believe I wasted over (dollar amount) on this game. I ended up giving it away after less than a month. It's so frustrating that the computer won't accept perfectly valid words from you, yet it allows itself to use words that would never fly in a real Scrabble game. The lack of vowels, the extreme slowness of the computer, and the annoying lack of versatility (despite claims to the contrary on the package) are just too irritating. I highly recommend that you PASS on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portability","review":"This review is second hand. That is my wife bought her origanl game at a yard sale, it lasted just long enough to get her hooked. When it done the deep six on as old or missused games will do, my wife had me look for local stores. When tha did not pan out she asked me to go on-line and get her one. Well that brought me to Amazon.com and the purchase I made for her. She's happy I'm happy, so that makes the hole thing rosey, thank you Amazon. As to portability it is well traveled.I DLGSR of Brown City Michigan give you 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous Price!","review":"$189! This is a very truncated and limited game and there is no reason for this price other than highway robbery! I paid about $25 for a new one at least 10 years ago and was hopng the company would come up with a new and improved model. But, according to other reviewers this is exactly the same and almost 8 times the price! I hope no one falls for this! I enjoyed playing it in bed for years, though I dropped it from the bed to the heavily carpeted floor several times and eventually it died. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait! YouThis is a waste of money!","review":"This device is not only too small, but visually difficult to see. There is no backlight to the dim screen and the buttons are small and awkward. If you love Scrabble then save your money for an IPAD and download that game ....Much more bang for the buck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Scrabble Lover","review":"I was very disappointed in this Scrabble game. The characters are sometimes difficult to read, the colored tiles are a little difficult to see, you're practically never given any vowels, and I first thought the game kept locking up on me until I realized that the computer-player was just very slow at times and it wasn't my turn... I guess if you just HAVE to have a Scrabble \\"fix\\", it would be worth having the game for those \\"emergencies\\", but I found that I much prefer the hand-held BOGGLE game for a word challenge. It's addictive! Whereas, I lost interest in this Scrabble game VERY quickly. Oh yeah, for some reason, the computer will just end the game too. I haven't figured this one out yet. Most of the time, I've been ahead and have always had a full hand of tiles, so it's not because the other player is running out of tiles (especially, since my computer-player seems to add only one tile to make a word, quite often.) I'd love to see an improved version made."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT useful for someone just learning Scrabble","review":"Make a word from this: C,Z,S,D,C,M,V (our actual letters just now - one vowel was open on the board). I bought this game because I wanted to encourage my 8-yr niece's new interest in Scrabble, but it did exactly the opposite: she stopped after 5 minutes, \\"I can't make words with this\\". (She may have learned a new word or two from my husband, who became quite annoyed when he tried to help her with it.) There appears to be no way to get a game which includes a reasonable number of normal letters such as \\"A\\", \\"B\\" or \\"E\\". Buy the \\"Scrabble Word Building\\" book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The games are very short, and seem to end when the computer wants them to. The computer is stingy in handing out vowels, so you often end up with a rack of N Z T M O Q Z, and end up in a battle of three-letter words. The computer can take five minutes or more to make a play. If the game sits for a while, it \\"sleeps,\\" and picks up where you left off, which is great, but if you've been playing with the sound off, the sound turns itself back on. I also wish the screen was a full-sized, easily labelled Scrabble board.Not bad for the car, but not great for when you're just kicking around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversexed and characters that are unsympathetic ruin the story...","review":"Warren Adler's \\"Casanova Embrace\\" is an overdone and oversexed book about 3 women and their lover, a Chilean in exile.

Horowitz is one of the premiere interpreters of the Romantic repertoire and his playing of the Chopin Etudes and Mazurkas is no exception.

Bill Butler's guitar and Bubba Brooks' tenor sax were the model for hundreds of 50s musicians; especially, those loving both jazz and the blues. In this album are most of those numbers calling those of the 50s era back to the dance floor: Ding Dong, Hammer Head, Ram-Bunk-Shus, and Shindig. This album is an excellent suppliment to the \\"All His Hits\\" collection, which includes: Honky Tonk, parts 1 and 2, Slow Walk, Blip Blop, Hold It, and Smokie.

My wife and I were going to buy this for my folks as a gift, since they never saw the original series. But after reading about how they changed out the music, we are no longer interested in purchasing it.Since the DVD producer has apparently been duplicitous, Amazon.com should do the right thing and disclose up front that this is not really the original series due to the swapped out music.The apparent dishonesty of the DVD producer is not surprising.

So I tried Amazon and through a 3rd party.They arrived intact, on time and as advertised. They come in little antistatic cases. Putting them in is a bit of a hassle - but that was all due to the design of the motherboard. Two of the DIMM slots are traditional uprights. But two are on a slant which makes it awkward to seat the DIMMS.

I've used Trader Joe's sulfate-free shampoo, yet I think it still lathered a bit so it was easier to get through the hair.

Initially I picked it up thinking it was a non-fiction, first person account of life in the US Navy. After reading a few chapters, I couldn't put it down, as I couldn't believe a story this thin actually got published, so I needed to see where this story would actually go (not very far, it turns out) . One of the more interesting aspects of this book are the many misspellings and typos. It appears that no editor ever looked at this book, only a computer spell-checker. If you must buy it, don't spend more than a dollar or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving Schizophrenia","review":"Outstanding book.

The \\"schizophrenics\\" act in ways that bother other people, and professionals like Torrey become influential and wealthy by diagnosing and \\"treating\\" them (against their will). The pseudoscience that Torrey promotes in this book has been thoroughly debunked by Thomas Szasz and others.

Flip-flops/sandals are never ideal footwear to run in, but I feel it's a good testament, that these fit so well I could emergency-run in them if I chose to.

It cuts out on us from just one room away from our base station and it is virtually impossible to use from upstairs. You would be better off to stick with your existing phone or buy a 2.4G phone because this one is completely useless.

The problem is with design. Why, in heaven almighty, did the people at Uniden think that a smaller telephone is a better telephone? The buttons are way too small on the base!!! If I need to put my face constantly within 12 inches of the phone in order to see what the buttons are, then that phone is staying in the store. And my eyesight is pretty good.The phone can have all the bells and whistles it wants, but it needs to meet minimum ergonomic standards for convenience purposes. Uniden failed here.There are many people who seem to love this telephone; however, I bet there are many more people who passed this phone over for the same reason I mentioned above. Hopefully, Uniden will correct this flaw in the next release of this line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uniden TRU8885-2","review":"We're ready to throw this system into the trash. When someone calls us, if one of us picks up the phone, we cannot call the other to pick up their receiver. It just says \\"line-in-use\\" On some occasions it works and can we both talk, but more often it won't let other handsets join the conversation. I certainly hope there is a way to bypass this feature, because if there isn't, we'll have to just junk the whole system which has six handsets. I have tried the instructions on \\"call transfer\\" and that is a complete joke. All the other handsets then say \\"out of range\\" even if they are lined up right by the base unit. If two people want to get on the line at once to chat, it seldom works, short of going through the trouble of setting up a conference call. Our old system didn't have this problem.Kenneth Potter, Valley Cottage, NY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reception and person on other end comlains of noise.","review":"I had been looking for a good 5.8 system so it would not interfere with all the 2.4 equipment in my home.I bought this Uniden and have been very disappointed. It has poor reception and lots of stray noise on both ends of conversation. It sound like an ocean pounding on the beach.I tried a Panasonic that my sister has, in my house and did not have the same problems.Looking at other reviews, others have not had the same trouble, but I have to be honest and say mine has been nothing but a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This System Just Doesn't Work","review":"I live in a suburban area where we have had no trouble with previous 900 GHz and 2.4 gig phones. As Uniden has an excellent reputation, I tried this 5.8 GHz system.After 3 months I now have to buy a new system. The phones are very erratic with reception fading in-and-out whether we walk with the phones or sit still in some rooms of our house. There is often distinct background noise, and callers tell us we sometimes sound as though we are \\"underwater.\\"One of the 3 extra handsets completely failed within 1 month. It cannot connect with the base unit, even when fewer than 6 inches away from it.This is just not a good system. I have read other reviews from people who love it. Perhaps these phones work well in some areas; they are definitely substandard in our area.These phone are a big risk, and that's just not worth the money unless you have money to burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I am replacing my uniden system because it has become unreliable. These things occured when I initially got the phone 2 yrs ago, but they're increasing. Sometimes when I'm talking, the handset will go silent -- the call is not dropped, and the handset is fully charged, but I will \\"lose\\" the connection even though I am not moving from the base unit. When dialling out, I will sometimes get the message \\"out of range\\" even though I am standing next to the base unit. I've also experienced no dial tone; unplugging the base unit resets the unit and resolves this problem.I like the variety of features, but the entire system has become too quirky for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I agree with most other 4-5 stars. I have owned nothing but junk in the past, as I really do not use land lines often. But now that we have this phone, I find myself using it often for local calls, and even answering calls coming in for my fiance (yes, our previous phones were that bad :).

They have such a great reputation and this phone is beautiful design.It has everything I was looking for.BUT there is a huge problem, which is that all of the callers and people I am talking to say that I sound like I am underwater. Or in a tunnel. Every single person I talk to has a really hard time hearing me clearly. This is so sad and annoying. It's unacceptable from a company like Uniden. Now I have to shop around again, and that is a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service","review":"I purchased TRU9485-2 and had a couple of questions about speed dialing from handsets.Speed Dialing does not seem to work on the handsets.The seller told me to call Uniden at 800-297-1023.This is the second time I have tried to call Uniden.I have been on hold for over 2 hours on this call without ever getting to speak to anyone.Very Unfortunate. This is definitely a deal breaker to me.Uniden has lost me as a customer.My experience seems to imply Uniden does not have much interest in providing customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good phone but terrible answering machine","review":"The phone works like any normal cordless phone. Battery life seems good, sound quality good, has held up just fine through a few falls. No problems with the phone itself. But the answering machine is sketchy. The biggest complaint is that it records a message for every call. Even people that hang up as soon as the message starts. So for every missed call, you have a blank message. Not just one for the people who actually leave messages. And after each person hangs up (whether during the message or after they leave a message) there is a dial tone sound for a few seconds on each message. This is SOOO annoying. Annoying enough that I'm getting rid of it and getting a Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Phone","review":"Good phone. Only complaint is phone book doesn't auto sync with all phones in the network. Only a problem if you use multiple phones like me. I love distinctive ring tones based on caller ID. You can set certain ring tones to different numbers. Major upgrade from my old Panasonic phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"Mine is faulty. Like another reveiewer's unit, mine drops the dial tone and resets itself occasionally. It's flawed. Design and feel are also not that great: tiny buttons and less than intuitive controls. Orange display is not a plus. I recommend that others look elsewhere: the Uniden model is not as nice as the six-year-old Panasonic I was trying to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good features, some bad","review":"I've owned this phone for about a year, and I find I'm having more issues with it.1 - the phone's reception is really, really poor -- especially for a 5.8 gHz phone. I'm usually talking right next to the base station, and in half the calls it either echoes or breaks up to the point I can't hear them clearly (just like a cell phone) and have to call the person back.2 - it doesn't have a \\"channel\\" button!! So if it does break up, you have no alternative than to try calling again, or go running in your house until you find just the right spot -- like some other reviews here mentioned. I couldn't agree with them more. Even my cheapest 2.4 Ghz phones had 'channel' buttons.All in all, I'm sure you can find a better phone for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Features. Terrible Sound","review":"I had hoped this phone would be a winner, and I did find the features, and the sound quality of incoming calls to be superior. But when three of the first five people I phoned said the line sounded terrible, I knew it was a loser. I switched to another phone and everyone said I sounded much better. This search for a decent cordless/answering phone is more difficult than it should be and so many phones are hit or miss. I cannot recommend this phone and wish I could. I have returned mine for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"This telephone is great!","review":"I've had this telephone about a month & I love it! Everything about it is easy to use. The reception is great! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good cordless telephone."},{"rating":"1","title":"These units suck","review":"I don't know who writes these reviews stating no problems, but I've had nothing but problems with them. The handsets keep going dead, that's right dead, nothing works. I've been told to reset them by holding the \\"*\\" and \\"#\\" keys while pluging in the battery and wait for the beep, this actually worked once, never again. I've got a total of 4 handsets and 3 of them are currently dead. Obviously it wasn't a fluke that one or even two went bad, but now 3 out of 4 are worthless and I can't reset any of them. Replacing these via Uniden is not worth the effor it would take to have this done, if you've read their replacement/repair rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden TRU8885-2 5.8 GHz Cordless Phone","review":"I've gone through many cordless phones and the change to this one was due to interference on my wireless network from a 2.4GHz phone. The interface is the most user friendly of all the phones I've had. Especially simple is accessing call waiting and creating a conference call. The bright orange display is easy to read and it's a cinch to program in numbers. The answering machine, self-contained in each handset and on the base station, is easy to program and has a very clear sound. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of features, lack of range","review":"The Phone is stylish for sure. Has a great many features to it, but the distance is very lacking. I have the base located in the second story of our house, toward the middle of the house. The phones have a lot of static at very short distances (room and a half away) and becomes almost useless when I goto the garage.If our vacumn cleaner is running, these phones dont work at all, too much interference.When I have called home from work and someone uses the phone, they sound kinda distance.Compared to our 7 year old 900mhz phone, the Uniden has a lot more features, but the sound clarity is not near as nice.I am going to try moving the base to other location to see if I can get better sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone","review":"Went from a Panasonic 900 mhz to this phone mainly for the capability to expand to many rooms w/o having to wire new jacks. Others have a fine job in their reviews, so just want to comment on what other see as a flaw but I see as a positive which is the Caller ID delete functionality being independent on each phone and the base unit. Some have said all should be able to be deleted at once--a \\"universal\\" delete. We have three users on the phone line each with their own handset. The way it works now, each of us can determine for own handsets which ones to delete--if Uniden ever goes to the universal delete, I hope they give the option to let the \\"deleter\\" choose which handsets (or the base unit) to do the \\"univeral\\" delete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wireless phone","review":"Can't say anything bad at all about these phones. Crystal clear sounds. Many different ringers, even CHristmas if you want. Works great with cables phone service as well. Has blinking red light when you get a message which is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power out takes out phone.","review":"I've had the Uniden phone for 2 months now. It worked fine until today - nothing special but a solid phone. After today's power outage, I now have to purchase new phones. The Uniden base unit no longer boots. We did have a short period of low voltage during the power out which I'm guessing took out the phone. It is the only thing in the house though that didn't survive. I'll not be buying another Uniden phone after this experience. I just expect better quality out of a \\"quality\\" device. If you have one or are buying one be sure you place it on a surge protector with low voltage protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a couple of weeks","review":"I did a lot of research (consumer reports, amazon, etc) and decided to get this phone. It has worked excellent for a couple of weeks. Now all of the sudden, the static, or interference, has been unbearable. Like the other reviewer said, you can't change channels or anything. The user manual says \\"1)Keep the handset away from microwave ovens, computers, remote control toys, wireless microphones, alamrm systems, intercoms, room monitors, fluorescent lights, and electrical appliances. 2) Move to another location or turn off the source of interference.\\" Are they kidding? Power down everything, then use the phone. I am going to return and buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound quality","review":"We bought this phone to replace a bad GE cordless. After doing a lot of research on expandable cordless phones and their features and reading reviews, we bought this one. All the features are great, but the sound quality is horrible. It is not consistent. The handset will sound great with one call, but the next will sound terrible. We can hear fine but the person on the other end says that we sound muffled and/or like we're in a tunnel. It's the same way when you use speakerphone or a headset. I thought for the money we paid we would have gotten a great phone, which it is if you don't care if the person you're speaking to can't hear you. This phone is being sent back today and my journey to find a good phone continues..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"I've had this phone system for quite some time now and I am still as happy with it as the day I bought it.

Recently I went to answer this phone picked it up and put it to my ear and nearly broke my ear drum. it kept ringing, I paniced and started pushing buttons, the phone just kept ringing, the handset was charged but would not respond.

There's nothing too violent, but the nice couple are rewarded and the creeps next door get what they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tiny gem of a book.","review":"This book and its companion, \\"Color Image Scale,\\" are excellent sources of palette ideas for web work.

It is perfect for drying items that need to be hung, like lingerie and tops. I use the hooks on the towel bar often for small items.

Let me preface this by saying, I love _Bye, Bye, Birdie_ --it is among my favorite movies as a child. So, after watching _Viva Las Vegas_ tonight, I rented via Amazon Prime, _Girl Happy_ (which I have not seen since the 60s). There is no comparison. Goofy and campy, yes, but at least it had a plot. So does _Blue Hawaii_ for that matter. Love the song, \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" but not the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like picking at a Technicolor scab","review":"Despite the rave reviews from foreign lands, I found this film lacking both a coherent plot and a consistent, identifiable point of view towards its protagonist. Is \\"Lucky\\" Jackson a tragic victim of his own hubris or a hapless existentialist antihero who must choose between two equally pointless fates, laboring as a waiter or risking his absurd existence in the pitiless desert wastes, symbolic of the spiritual wasteland of Las Vegas? The filmmakers were apparently too lazy to decide or perhaps have left it up to the viewer. Robert Bresson's Au Hazard, Balthasar deals with many of the same themes in a more compelling fashion, although the donkey upon whom that film bases its narrative is not as hot-looking as Ann-Margaret. So it evens out more or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viva Las Vegas","review":"I purchased several DVD's at the same time and all of them are in perfect condition except Viva Las Vegas.

Of course the music is truly Elvis. This is a must have for Elvis fans - it shows him at his best...and let's not forget the automobile race.

Hard to believe it's 45 years old, kudos to Warner for really cleaning up this old gem!Admittedly, most Elvis movies were forgetable but not this one, it's a lot of fun. I enjoyed the scenery of old Las Vegas and the songs were quite good. Elvis himself seems to be having a good time and so do the other actors. No doubt he enjoyed this movie more than others of the same era, you can see it in his performance.But what really makes the film special is Ann-Margret! She is incredibly beautiful and alive. Whether dancing, singing or just being - every scene she's in glows plus she breathes life into Elvis' performance too - there is real chemistry between these stars.If you're looking for an Elvis movie to watch, this is one of his best.

Although not Hollywood masterpieces that was never the point.

Ann Margaret is stunningly beautiful and a great dancer. Unfortunately her singing isn't as good as her dancing, however watching the scene stealing Ann Margaret can never be thought of as a chore. One of the best dance numbers is set at the University of Nevada campus, film buffs might want to see if they can locate Teri Garr amongst the troupe.The Vegas scenery from the 1964, including the neon \\"Strip\\" from the time, is fun to see. Even the desert car race, however improbable the action, has some great vistas too.This audio and visual quality of this reproduction is excellent, and fans and soon-to-be fans won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Las Vegas DVD","review":"One of the more exciting ones in my opinion.

My sister and I tried to follow two of the hikes ( in different areas of the valley) with no success and much frustration. We are not inexperienced hikers - my sister has hiked all over the world, Peru, Spain, etc. We made a comment to the store manager at Indian Canyons that we had not been able to find our destination. She asked if we had tried to use 100 Great Hikes in and Near Palm Springs. Surprised, we answered yes. She said that they are recommending that you use the book only if you have someone with you who has previously hiked the trails (i.e. the directions are inaccurate). She said that means all the hikes, not just Indian Canyons. She said that she has heard numerous complaints from other hikers. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really found this book useful.....","review":"I found this book very useful. To my knowledge it is the only comprehensive book on Riverside County hiking. It goes beyond the desert areas for all \\"season\\" trips.

It also gives some of the trip details without giving away too much so that you can make your own discoveries....thank you Mr. Ferranti, job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackfield","review":"Blackfield is the side project of Porcupine Tree front man Stephen Wilson and Israeli pop star Aviv Geffen. I admit to being a Stephen Wilson junkie as I think just about everything the guy does songwriting, playing, singing, and producing is brilliant. The Blackfield album is a fairly mellow affair with occasional heavy bombastic guitars making only brief appearances. The songs are all on the short side, and it definitely has a bit more of a pop feel than what you might be used to with Porcupine Tree. Wilson takes the lead on the majority of the album, although Geffen gets in his share of the spotlight here and there. Highlights for me include the title track, \\"Glow\\", \\"Summer\\" and \\"Cloudy Now\\". The lyrics for the most part are on the downer / depressive side, but that should come as no surprise for fans of Wilson. Is this as good as a Porcupine Tree album? In my opinion no, but it is a solid disc that fans of PT will surely get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, haunting, stays with you","review":"I'm a 46 year old mother of 5 kids, and heard \\"Pain\\" playing in a store I was in.

I even called my daughter in college and told her I had some great music to compose a dance to (she's doing Modern). I can't play \\"Cloudy Now\\" in front of the kids because of the strong language--too bad, because otherwise it's a good song. Most of the album's lyrics are sad and verge on despairing, but the hope is found in the melody and richness of the instrumentals. It's a beautiful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Side Project of Porcupine Tree frontman","review":"I really enjoyed this album. If you like classic Porcupine Tree, you should like this album. It sounds very much like Porcupine Tree, with plenty of piano and good melodies and catchy vocals. This is a very melodic, and for the most part, slow album, with no heavy tunes to be found. If you're a PT fan and are looking for heavier songs like \\"Shallow\\", \\"Strip the Soul\\", or \\"Open Car\\", you won't find them here. And don't expect to see any long \\"Porcupine Tree\\" syle songs. These songs are are just your normal, under 5 minute, staright-to-the-point pop-rock songs.

Here she examines what makes a human being \\"tick\\" and how an actor can use this to enhance his/her performance. Too many times books on acting tend to be very bland, and uninformative. Or even worse, they tend to take an almost clinical approach to our art, making it impossible to enjoy, and almost equally impossible to learn.Having read many books on technique, I would consider this one of the best. Unlike Stanislavski's trilogy, which to me is like reading a science textbook, it doesn't bore the reader while trying to teach him, but rather inspires the artist to a greater understanding of his art and himself as an artist. In the book, she challenges us to work to achieve a higher form of theatre, one that works collaboratively, not individually. In summation, all I can say is that, for me, she speaks to my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uta Hagen is a better actress than a writer; however...","review":"...fortunately for anyone who might want the benefit of some of the late Ms. Hagen's acting advice, her writing improved enormously and her second book 'A Challenge For The Actor' (published in 1991) shows her capacity to grow as a scribe as well as a thespian. I would recommend that an aspiring acting student, especially one who is early in his or her career purchase 'A Challenge For The Actor' instead of 'Respect For Acting' as is 'A Challenge For The Actor' far less muddled and obtuse than 'Respect For Acting'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"My husband and I live part-time in Italy and found a great deal of erroneous information in this book.

Anyone who is considering a career in the theatre should definitely read this book. Anyone who isn't considering a career in the theatre should definitely read this book. After you read this book, you feel like you know William Redfield. And everyone, John Gielgud, Richard Burton, etc., were correct when they said that William Redfield and Clem Fowler were the best Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.

With a 1.25HP Sprunger it ripped and crosscut through 6 sheets of 3/4\\" Birch plywood from Lowes cut after cut after cut. The number of tear outs is ZERO. Not one! Amazing. I did use a zero tolerance insert I made from MDF. Great. Be careful it is so sharp you could easily cut into a finger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around performance","review":"I build hardwood furniture for my home and love the way this blade performs on solid stock. The HIATB does an outstanding job on cross cuts and requires less feed force than my other blades. I would rate the rip performance better than Freud does, and I use it all the time in this capacity. When making my blade selection, I was a little unsure of the HIATB, having never owned one, but now I'm sold and would buy another.

That was March, and I'm still on my second set of batteries without using any kind of adapter. I've probably taken 700 photos with my C200. Two words of advice: 1-close the cover and then reopen it when the battery reads DEAD; it's good for another month (I wasted those first 4 batteries!) at least. 2- get the HP PhotoSmart P1000 Printer ($700 for both before the rebate). You just plug the disc film into the side and the printer does the rest. Great Quality, nice companion for the C200.

I am very happy with the response from HP. The batteries dont last very long if you use the monitor, but I find it easier to just use it like a standard camera. Then the batteries last a long time. Like anything else you have to give yourself time to get to know the camera. I used a 35mm SLR totaly manual camera for 30 years.

I've taken about 40 shots, used the lcd and downloaded a couple times and still on the original batteries. Use the HP premium plus or other heavy weight photo paper for best printing results. I bought the p1000 printer also. I'd highly recommend this. Only drawback IMO is the digital zoom. Since you're looking through a viewfinder and not the lens, you don't see what the zoomed picture looks like and there's no button on the camera for zoom...you have to go into the lcd/menu on the back of the camera to select the zoom...very awkward. Great camera for the price and seriously, you won't be able to tell the difference between regular camera pics and these...just get a good printer and good paper to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP C200 is great","review":"I bought my C200 about a month ago, and have taken about 100 pictures so far. Overall, they are outstanding, especially for a camera at this price. I find the flash is not quite as strong as I would like, though. The software works wells and is easy to use also. After 100 shots, I still am using the original alkaline batteries that came with the camera, and the battery indicator shows that the batteries are still nearly fully-charged. The time to download photos directly from the camera to the PC takes FOREVER, so I bought a Sandisk Imagemate USB Compactflash External Drive, and it is great. It downloads 16mb of images in just a few seconds. I have found when using the 2X zoom, the picture quality is poor, but in all other respects, I can heartily recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not supported by Win2000","review":"I bought the c200 a month ago,but since then i could not download images to my computer since i run win2000 and the c200 does not support this OS.

Takes good pictures.Drawbacks other than battery life:1. Only 1 pic review at a time as opposed to a collage review by the Olympus brands.2. Long delay from the time you hit the photo button and get a picture causes folks to relax before the pic is taken. Ruins some shots.3. Very clunky camera considering it has no optical zoom.Now, the battery life. I have yet been able to fill my flash memory without having to change batteries. I get about 10 -15 pictures before it is flashing and beeping to tell me the battery is dead.

The producers should have preserved the original voice of the artist, with English subtitles for those of us who do not know German. A similar problem plagues the almost ninety-minute long Schubert recital. It is a wonderful recital, but without subtitles. This is inexcusable, given the capabilities of the DVD technology. I have the DVD of F-D singing Schubert's Wintereise, and the subtitles immeasurably add to the overall experience.This is unfortunate.

I am now a children's librarian and when I remembered these books I looked for them for the Kindle and I was delighted to find them both. After reading books such as \\"Walter the Farting Dog\\" and other books of the same ilk I was tired of reading books that really seemed to have nothing to offer my students except some toilet humor. These books are both examples of wonderful literature and offer a view of another time and a different life for children.

Todd provides quite a different perspective when he deserts the Army and his country. That decision which worked out well for Todd as he is a highly regarded journalist still effects him deeply with regrets and sorrow when he chose the exile path at a critical crossroad in his life. Well written, though at times quite maudlin, DESERTION IN THE TIME OF VIET NAM brings home an era when everyone seem to know someone fleeing the draft or the war. However, the uniqueness of his personal story is what happened to him and others after they left home.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowardice","review":"Todd is a coward and his self-serving mea culpa an affront to the memory of my friends and comrades who placed duty, honor, and country ahead of themselves.May he live out his life north of the border surrounded by thousands of unsold books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening cowardice and narcissism","review":"Why books like this continue to get published is beyond me. The author is a not very interesting sad case. Having washed out of Marine Corps OCS he turns against the entire United States and its armed forces. The story is one of personal cowardice in search of a moral justification which the author is pathetically unable to provide. Why publishers remain obsessed with deserters and antiwar protestors remains a mystery to me; I'd rather read about the heroism of the men who served in Vietnam. I'd like to invite the author to come to any of the many military unit reunions held every year in the US to celebrate the brotherhood and comradeship of those of us who answered our country's call in its hour of need, some reluctantly but all did their duty.

It makes what could be a very dry topic (especially if you have PhDs teaching who are clueless about all things clinical or just plain don't care) into one that is enjoyable to study and learn. The writing style is great, the diagrams awesome, and the cases really help improve your clinical reasoning.

I only wished I had this book as an intern so I could have read it then. The only negative about this book is that it does not focus a whole lot on the peripheral nervous system.

This book, as previous reviewers have noted, is a good introduction for a medical student, and for a psychologist, it is a gold mine. I wish I had read it before taking the gross anatomy class.

Have Vista? Forget this interface, Mackie seem to have stated on the support forums both that they're working on a driver and that they aren't going to make a driver, which fills me with little hope that one is on the horizon any time soon. No 64-bit support either. I could not even get it to install on my 64-bit Vista machine. The forums are the only easily accessible support mechanism, their website unsubtly states that their phone support won't be much of a help.Great hardware, but great hardware isn't of much use when you can't use it, and especially when once it doesn't work there's not really anywhere to go for real help from the manufacturers.

It's not that I am unaware of the travails of families who lived off the land -- I come from people who lived in the backwoods and made it through the worst times of the Great Depression.I just don't want to read about their struggles over and over and over again.As to comparisons between William Gay and William Faulkner -- GET REAL! This guy can't even stand on Faulkner's porch. Faulkner may have created sentences that ran on for 3 pages, but he was smart enough to use punctuation, for heaven's sake.I guess the literary world is so desperate for quality these days that they'll latch on to anything different. In this case, however, different isn't necessarily better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I grew up in this region and I can tell you, this book did not ring true to me at all. I read all the wonderful reviews and I held high hopes for the book. I felt it was completely dis-jointed and a huge disappointment. This is only the second book in my life that I felt like I was sorry I had wasted my time by reading it. Maybe the 'high literary' content was just lost on a country girl. This is not descriptive of the people of the region - sorely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prose with a universal theme","review":"Provinces of Night is a haunting, comic, bloody novel that takes the reader into a back country, intense world. The novel does elicit comparisons to Faulkner and Wolfe in that Gay uses the book to portray a very specific time and place while exploring universal themes of family and responsibilities. These themes go back to the earliest biblical stories, yet are fresh and evocative in Gay's beautiful prose. Provinces of Night is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cormac McCarthy rip off....","review":"The title is lifted from Cormac Mcarthy's 1973 novel, Child Of God. That book is far better than this one.William Gay, a talented writer, does not speak with his own voice.

It is the story of Kenrick, who was introduced in book one: Heart of the Hunter. Kenrick is a former Templar Knight who has studied the Dragon Chalice. The story begins with his visiting an old friend, only to find the castle burned and the family dead. He also finds a woman wounded, fevered and unconscious. Kenrick learns from villagers that she is Haven, an herbalist. He takes her to his castle to care for her in hopes of learning more of the attack. When she regains consciousness, however, she has lost her memory. Most of the first half of the book is made up of the slow recovery of memories and the growing attraction between the two. In the second half the enemy returns, Haven regains her memory and difficult choices have to be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting to Pick Up Speed","review":"I was soooo looking for to the second book in the series.

Furthermore, the characters were either black and white or the author stated out right the character's feelings without allowing the reader to interpret on his or her own. There was no clear villain as one of them was mostly an animal that never actually did anything bad and the other was a woman who turned out to be confused. The book read like a really long children's tale. Also, the premise for war between the two lands was not convincing. The characters' every emotion was stated and analyzed by the author making it a really boring read. I would never recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I got this book used a long time again and really enjoyed it but my copy is falling apart so I was happy to find it as a kindle book.

It is an intriguing story set in a mythical world. Cultures crash, wars are declared and all fight shadows until the real threat is revealed. The story is told through multiple storylines that create a fable you will never want to end. The complex interplay of perspectives is brillant. It is clearly the best fiction book I have ever read. I teach reading for middle school kids and the ones that can read it are amazed by the beautifully crafted story. None debate my contention that it is the best story ever told. Middle School kids agreeing with an adult? They just don't make 'em like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"a great read... inventive, timeless, and perfect for anyone who loves dragons.don't let the length scare you out of reading it; it has slow bits, but so does every great fantasy, and the character variety is stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't finish it...","review":"I rarely give up on books.

I learned my lesson, always finish the book, you just never know how it will end up. I have tried reading this book, but I just can't finish it. It doesn't keep my attention. While you're reading it you realize that the storyline and plot should make for a very interesting book, but it just doesn't seem to work.

We've positioned the seat reclined as much as is allowable, and it's still too much of an incline. We've got the head support installed, and we've even tried additional head support, but his head just won't stay up. My solution has been to always have a 2nd person ride in the back seat and make sure his head doesn't fall forward. I can't imagine this is a safe position if we were in an accident. I'm highly considering returning this and buying a typical infant seat. On the positive side... we love the weather guard at his feet and the cannopy. THey're great features!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but comfy, stylish, and convenient for a big boy","review":"I love the Mosaic pattern, the stroller is great which was why we chose to get this car seat. I had an 8 pound baby, at two months he is 13 pounds and 24 inches, so we'll need the extra room this seat allows for in his first year.My only complaint- it's cumbersome to carry around and get in and out of the car. I have a Honda Pilot with a big back seat, but it takes me a few lifts and jostles my little guy around to get it out of the car. I am not a small person- I am 5'9\\", and pretty strong, but I won't take the baby anywhere where I have to walk very far carrying the seat because it's that heavy.Again, kudos to the Mosaic stroller and car seat, great pattern, sturdy stroller and seat, we love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Cute boots!!!

I finally found a copy and eagerly dove in. Big disappointment, for two reasons.First, I couldn't wrap my head around that title. It drove me crazy: It should have been called Woman as Eunuch.Second, as a cultural icon and journalist, I expected much more from Greer's writing. It would never fly today: heavily anecdotal, sweeping generalizations with no backup data, no citations to anyone or anything. To illustrate that girls are overprotected, she cites the \\"case\\" of a girl using her last dime to call her mom for a ride home, and then being left with no bus money. Huh? This is supposed to prove that girls are overprotected?I gave it 150 pages, then quit. Not only did she not have anything new to say, what she said was said poorly. Sorry, Greer.

The fluted edges are just the right size in that whether it be shortbread dough or biscuit dough that I'm cutting, the fluted edges stay clearly defined but aren't huge \\"daisy petals\\" either.

Now that it is winter, I wear them more with socks, and they are even a little loose with just bare feet now. I would suggest getting these a little small, and giving it a couple days to break in.

I was unsure about the sizing because I never wear smaller than a size 10, but everyone said to order small, and I'm glad I did. I got size 9 and they are definitely snug but not tight or uncomfortable to wear. I can definitely see that the material will stretch the more I wear them.

It is a kind of picaresque novel. I think my favorite part is poor Dorothy trying to be a good teacher in a very bad school, and having the parents object, saying saying things like \\"We don't want her taught decimals, we want her taught ARITHMETIC.\\" Her struggles with her monster of a father is memorable, and the ending, where she cheerfully resigns herself to her fate, seems to foreshadow the ending of \\"1984.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clergyman's Daughter","review":"This book is absolutely marvelous.

The gears seem to slip or get locked into place. Maybe Makita spent too much time on their battery technology and not enough time on the gears.If you need a Li-Ion drill now, buy the Hitachi.

She fleshed out a storyline from her first novel and respun the tale into something engaging. Her narrative voice may sound preachy to some,but in this context of a Christian thriller-IT WORKS!

This may be a very broadminded idea, but for the average reader this means that even the smallest step is elaborated. Just to give you an idea: if you add yeast, you first have to dissolve this in tepid water, then add to the must, mix after some hours. But this takes 2 pages to explain. First we learn how to obtain water of a certain temperature, either by mixing hot and cold, or by heating cold water in te microwave (and for the really retarded: don't forget to take out the thermometer!). Then we are told what \\"a couple of hours\\" means: if you add the yeast in the evening, mix next morning, but if you added the yeast in the morning, wait till afternoon!But if you are really slow-witted, this book may be just ther thing for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Southerner with plenty of pride","review":"I have to agree with the first reviewed.

I regret to inform interested listeners that this compilation is really meant for the hard core fan. Even then, it's mainly a collection of live performances. If you've seen the Cocteau Twins live, you know that their sound is difficult to reproduce live. I have been a fan from the beginning and I understand the fundamental movement indigenous to innovative labels like 4AD. If you are seeking something to sink your teeth into, try Blue Bell Knoll or Heaven or Las Vegas. These two CDs offer two distinct, yet equally compelling periods within the Cocteau Twins experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"~ dig deeply ~ make it raw ~ make it real ~ cocteauuuu","review":"WOW. If you're like me, you NEED this. CD1 highlights- tracks 1, 2, and especially \\"Hazel\\" are essential whether you were into CT's first rough albums or not. CD2 highlights- \\"Volaine\\" has gone from blah to stun-material! Check out the cut-throat majesty of \\"Seekers Who Are Lovers\\", one of the best Cocteau songs of all time. I can't tell which is better (bbc or original). We're talking some serious six stars here, with only five possible. (If I let it rule me, I'd give this whole thing a fiver based on that emotion alone.) \\"Half-Gifts\\" here is also necessary. While obviously not all tracks are probably going to be stellar on a BBC collection, this compilation is required for CT lovers such as myself. Drawbacks: uneven representation of work over the years (wish some other songs appeared); Liz sings in a range too high on some of the later ballads featured on these outtakes.

WAAAAaaaaaa i never DID see them live :'("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"live\\" performance!","review":"Beeing a fan of Cocteau Twins since 1992 my reference album was and still is Heaven or Las Vegas.

The alternate versions of early songs esp. highlight Liz's uncanny, howling delivery (I never understood all the comparisons to Siouxsie). \\"Strange Fruit\\" is a jaw-dropping fusion of post-punk and the blues... whew! while some tracks are redundant and strictly fan-friendly, nothing seems like filler. The later tracks are a bit weak. However, they feature Liz belting things out in a manner that became increasingly RARE (in the studio at least) after, say, 1988. The band that once sounded like it had at least two vocalists was starting to sound a LOT like its imitators. However, this is highly recommended, especially for those that like they're Twins simple and STARKLY, DARKLY beautiful, rather than obviously \\"pretty\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love them, but live Cocteau Twins isn't optimal","review":"I'm as big a fan as they come, but live Cocteau has a problem -- there's just one Elizabeth. On studio albums, as you know, there are numerous vocal tracks, creating a rich, layered sound. I never knew how important this element was until it was gone. Live recordings (including the BBC Sessions) just feel sort of anemic, because only one melody is being sung.

BIG disappointment. Gary Puckett and Gary Lewis didn't sound anything like they did years ago =no resemblence at all. It could have been strangers trying to sing their songs. The Association was so-so. Their voices were weak and the harmony sometimes clashed. This concert series is totally depressing, and the DVD set is trash as far as I'm concerned.

The next Artist was Gary Puckett?With this DVD, I was disappointed? I remember Gary Puckett & The Union Gap riding around in my 1969 Goat. He was Awesome.

The voice is totally gone and then he tries to make up for it. Does not sound at all like him! I do not recommend this DVD. He should never have recorded this and rather left us with the pleasant memories of years gone by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they should be.","review":"Sadly, the performances caught here aren't always what they should be. This is a much later version of The Association and the sound isn't quite right and some of the songs are shaky. The other shows aren't consistantly strong and there's this annoyingly fake \\"applause swell\\" that becomes painfully apparent when they show the audience sitting still during the fake applause.

Because this system relies on small cards with pictures of the chores, children do not have to be able to read before this system can be used easily. Also, because of the way the rewards are given, there is the daily reward of Dad Dollar or Mom Money, which has been a great incentive for our son. I also liked how she set up the Chore Store, which is open only once a week, so there is a learning of delayed gratification and saving of dollars. This has worked wonderfully for our family and I think would for anyone with children that need a reward system and aren't ready to read, although I see no reason this wouldn't work with older children who do read. It's been just great for us and we are extremely happy with the results.

The outline of the film follows the details of his life well, from his start plugging tunes on Tin Pan Alley to fraternizing overseas with refined society.Gershwin's own friends appear in the film. Oscar Levant plays himself, as do Al Jolson, who introduced Swanee, Paul Whiteman, and George White.One of the best things about this movie is the extensive use of music.

My first one failed because after it droped it went beyond the wind-up point and just stayed at the bottom and ran the battery out/ burned up the retract mechanism.

Much better then usual \\"buzz\\" sound.However, hold the button too long to silence and you end up changing the time. One frequently does this because the simple act of pressing the button is not enough to turn the alarm off. Then you end up having to reset the alarm time.

Both the clock and the project are tiny, which would be great if I wanted to use it as a travel alarm clock.The instruction manual doesn't offer instructions on how to operate all of the functions of the clock. It does, however, include instructions for setting the time, which seems silly considering its supposed to sync automagically with the Denver atomic clock. The clock has yet to sync, which could be because you aren't supposed to touch any buttons once it has power otherwise it interrupts the sync process. Not touching a button while inserting batteries or the power cable is difficult because of the clock's design.The buttons do not depress well. Rocking the button while pressing sometimes helps it make the connection, but be careful as you might activate one of the settings menus rather than displaying the indoor temperature.Also, it's too light to make a good paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's simple but does the job","review":"When I first started to read the instructions I was thoroughly confused, but after rereading a few times it started to make sense.

Tony Martin did not deny that slavery existed in the Muslim world, did not deny that Christians were a major part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, did not deny that African traitors sold their African brothers and sisters into slavery. But by teaching that there was extensive JEWISH involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which there absolutely was, and by bringing a certain book that Jews don't like into his classroom, Martin inspired that tsunami.

I emailed Redexpress.com (their support) to get assistance and was asked to send the log file so that they could identify the problem. I did that on 3 occasions.

If all you need to do is copy a single disk movie, then it's ok, but if the output needs to span two disks, then the results are completely unpredictable. Some times the first disk works but the second doesn't, sometimes the other way around. Sometimes the movie's menu works on one disk but not the other.

It has been written by someone who not only obviously loves his subject, but who has written a clear, easy-to-read amd well-illustrated guide for those of us who have developed an interest in early American furniture but who lacked expertise. It also tells you how to care for furniture.

The item was as described. It arrived VERY quickly after I placed the order. I would use this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scientific calculator with nice features","review":"This calculator is a good scientific based one with lots of great features for use in just about any engineering discipline. Overall I like the way the keys are laid out and the dual functionality of having both a solar cell and a battery for use when the light is not quite enough. The only complaint that I have is that the entry method is not as intuitive as my old Sharp calculator for things like hex conversion. Other than that, it is a great calculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"No POS is not a math term. This calculator is a piece of #$%^. Unless you are an engineer or have access to someone who can explain to you why when squaring the sum of two exponents you need a bevy of parentheses you are wasting your time with this. The manual is pretty much a joke being that nothing is explained to any degree. For what it it worth you are better off buying a graphing calc for anything real and a simple calc with DMS for trig. If you accidentally change a setting you are left with resetting the whole calculator. Just frustrating as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good If Keys Go Bad!!","review":"Well, it worked for sixteen months before numeric keys 5 and 6 stopped working -- four months beyond the warranty limit. When comparable Sharp calculators were still being made in Malaysia they were excellent. Granted, this one may have more features but what good is it with two bad keys? I probably will not buy the Sharp brand again if I have a decent alternative. I own another Sharp model, the 516, which I bought at the same time and it is still working fine (for now, that is). They are certainly feature-rich, but I don't want to buy a new one every 1-2 years -- that is ridiculous.I have a Casio solar-powered calculator purchased in the early 1980s. It only stopped working properly about three years ago, so that Casio provided me considerable service for 25 years. Its failure led me to buy several new ones for home and work, but, may I say, they sure don't make them like they used to!

Billy May, Denns Michaels, Don Menza and Frank Collett provide 17 swinging arrangements, and the Frankie Capp Orchestra guides them home without diminishing Keely's unique vocals. As you listen to this, you can't help but recall the golden days of Capitol records when Sinatra, Smith, Nat King Cole, the Four Freshmen, Peggy Lee and other stars turned out hit after hit.

This is a woman in her 70's singing on these CDs, and it is obvious. Her voice is not a strong voice of someone in her youth, but she still tries to sing as if it is, and it just hurts. Also, for some reason, her pronounciation of her vowels has changed from her earlier recordings. To my ear, she is mis-prounouncing words, and it is very annoying.

Still, it's always fun to bash an opponent or a friend off their motorcycle with a bat, a chain whip, taser, or whatever you have at your disposal. It's still fun to jump over cars by popping a wheelie or to watch someone hit a car or another object causing themselves to crash, or to hit innocent bystanders. The motorcycles are still cool looking along with the characters, but the character models are recycled along with your environments. The graphics look bland and too blocky by today's standards as well. But it never really gets old to hop on your motorcycle and bash an opponent off their motorcycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.

Also, on my unit, none of the \\"controller-setup extras\\" seem to function (become a Cop after winning, faster bikes, etc.), therefore surmise the \\"Expansion Pack\\" is a must (have none this moment, but will have ASAP).

Both single-player and multiplayer are lots of fun. The physics are excellent, especially when you crash! The combat is a riot (especially with the great sound effects). The only (very minor) disappointment I have is that there are only two songs on the soundtrack, so they get a little repetitive. I guess that's due to limited space on the cartidge though. All in all, I'd say this is a must-have game for N64 owners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worse graphics than the NES","review":"This game is fun to play, but the graphics are terrible. The terrain is green, with some very sparsely placed trees and signs.

At first it was a bit frustrating because I didnt know the controlls. Later on learning them, it didnt get better. The collision detection on the attacks (one of the main parts of the idea of road rash) was horrible, i'd swing the weapon right through people at times. Then the mercy rule was way to strong. I'd purposely sit there not driving for almost 20 seconds and then within 10 seconds I'd be caught up and in first place usually. The races are completly random, usually the person in last place with 10 seconds left wins. I usually like to play bad racing games forever but this game held my interest for 10 min tops. Buy Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for any N64 collection!","review":"Road Rash is well on its way to eating up every single moment of my spare time! This game just plain rocks. From the hardrock soundtrack to the excellent graphics and game play, this game makes having an N64 a MUST. Even though it took me only a few days to win every race and qualify on every level, I continue to work through the levels time and again to buy new bikes and find new weapons and paths.

I was embarrassed on his behalf, and wondered if he knows what this author did to him. Apart from that, given its shortcomings, such as personal bias and structural weakness, it was interesting to read. I'm not sure, however, if someone who had never been to West Africa, and in particular Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, would understand it fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing hodge-podge","review":"The book splits evenly into two halves. The first half recounts Joris's travels in Senegal and Mauritania (the book's high point), and introduces us to Mali. The second half, also dealing with Mali, is an account of her friendship with the singer Boubacar Traore, and her efforts to delve into his personal life. Traore comes across as an abrasive and tempermental character; it's very odd that he should be the focus of the book. Joris's writing style at the beginning of the book relies on indirect quotations instead of actual dialogue, which makes it quite dry; later in the book the writing quality improves markedly where dialogue is concerned. This is more the memoirs of Traore than a travel narrative. It's a sad oversight (but emblematic of the book's flaws) that her only visit to Mali's Dogon region is one day-trip, recounted in a few pages that highlight Traore's role as her guide rather than the Dogon people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo Child: The illustrated Legend of Jimi Hendrix","review":"The book is really nice and worth the expense in all respects.Great story, great designs and a really great storytelling!If you like Bill Sienkiewicz, this is a purchase that is over time, in this book its graphic skills are very high!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comics are for the Sunday Paper, not Jimi Hendrix","review":"This one left me a bit short. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform at the Cafe Wa in Greenwich Village, NY. Also saw his 1968 Experience concerts in Hartford at the Bushnell Memorial concert hall and outdoors at the Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood, CA and he was amazing! This comic depiction is not completely accurate and since I was there it does not hit home for me since the information is off and not overly complete. Nice try, collectable, but not for the purist Hendrix fan. The CD which comes inside rear cover is a nice touch and bonus almost worth the price of the book.

In fact, this comment from the liner notes on page 18 about \\"Tem Quem Queira\\" (Someone Else Will Want It, track 7) by Rita Ribeiro should be rather interesting: (It) reflects the blend of Portuguese and African influences that are the foundation of Brazilian music (not to mention, the majority of the songs from this compilation).Even if this isn't like the more high-energy sambas with the dozen-plus backup singers, the rhythms and harmony here are just as great, if not better. :)BRAVO AGAIN PUTUMAYO"},{"rating":"2","title":"6 great tunes","review":"I really like the songs in this collection by by Gal Costa, Paulinho da Viola, Márcio Faraco, Mnica Salmaso, Lucas Santtana and Lula Queiroga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shostokovich's Musical","review":"Since this production had received good reviews, I was extremely disappointed with it.

Do read this book if you hate the current state of the world, like depressing novels, don't want the \\"disney\\" ending, or like other books written by the author. I read the Kindle version of this book and there were a lot of typos. I am not sure if that was due to the Kindle translation or if the novel itself was that poorly written and edited.

I will not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I got his book thinking that it would be great. I love fairy tale retellings and this looked like a great one. It started out good, and I really liked that it had more than one fairy tale in it. I even liked the part when she went to faerie. I love faeries! but from there it seemed to be going nowhere. It was depressing that she got old so fast, and had almost no good life. After reading this I didn't want to read for a while, because it made me so upset.

A great mix of humor and serious moments, they were always tied together by Dino's great voice and his joy in performing. Live at the Sands captures this.This is the kind of CD that could actually be the focus of an evening. Gather some friends around, turn off the TV, lower the lights a bit, and pop open a bottle of Chianti.

It makes you feel like you are back in the sixties. Dino is in great voice and having a lot of fun. CD is high quality and very clear.

Adams was a clerk in the Agriculture Department, so her vision of Washington was less lofty than Brooks or other correspondents; she focuses on the weather, fashions, and the Agriculture Department. BUT the book is rendered far less useful by its awful index. I knew the book mentioned Seward, because I had seen a reference elsewhere, but he is not in the index. A patient search through the text found several references. A quick check revealed other names not indexed, including those of some Michigan men in Washington hospitals. No index is perfect, but this one mars the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the board before bedtime!","review":"This is a great little game.

A time when American GIs could give mess hall apples to taxi drivers in lieu of cash (Thais love apples but they don't grow well in their climate). Dean Barrett handles character and dialogue quite impressively, and his protagonist (\\"Pineapple\\") is a remarkable reference point amidst the madness of war in Southeast Asia. It is a very funny and very special novel, tremendously entertaining and would make a fun movie. It is as spicy as the food of the Thais and his knowledge of both military madness and Thai culture is obvious. I also enjoyed the love story between the soldier and the Thai woman but it is the satirical humor that stands out for me. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to peaceful parts of Vietnam War","review":"I enjoyed this book as a non-veteran. It made much of the military history I have read more \\"real,\\" by looking at it from the perspective of regular GIs.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is brilliant","review":"This book is brilliant. I live in Bangkok and loved the attention to detail.Memoirs of a Bangkok Warrior is brilliant.

When I ran out I RAN back to the store to get more only to find they were out. Target, Walgreens and Rite Aid didn't have it either!!! Hopefully it was only because people are buying it like crazy and not because they are discontinuing it!

Our generation has little appreciation for what it took to win WWII and the awesome bravery and commitment demonstrated by the generation who fought to secure our freedom. The story is compelling, weaving between our parents' world and our world, contrasting our challenges with theirs, which eventually makes you see how great we have it today and why. It's an incredibly poingnant book about the importance and impact that the WWII generation has had on our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"A major disappointment.

When I bought this book and began reading I could not put it down until I finished. Trying to understand what men like Lucky went through in war cannot be imagined, only experienced. For his children to understand a small part of their father and the amazing camaraderie men in combat experience is depicted extremely well by Jim Loose.

I use a lot of this Dap Dynaflex 230 premium indoor/outdoor sealant. This product is nice to have around as it dries clear and so it goes with almost any repair on any color. It is even paintable. This product makes a flexible waterproof seal that is also crack-proof. It is good to seal out water or air leaks around doors or windows.The product is mold and mildew resistant. I even use it to seal out spots where insects like hornets can get into small holes to build nests.I have had it shrink quite a bit and I deducted one star for that issue. It just makes me seal some larger areas more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well...","review":"I'm not sure why other reviewers are ragging on it... It is what it says, a MIXTURE of latex and silicone. I've just gone through a few tubes of it, and it works quite well. It appears to have the best attributes of both latex caulk and of silicone - it stays flexible when dry, but is actually paintable. They claim 50 years for durability. No way to test that, but the stuff I applied three years ago is not cracking the way cheap latex caulk sometimes does. This is great for windows and doors where you want to paint over it. Not really recommended for tubs and showers - use 100% silicone. As to price, it is a bout $1 more here than I paid at a major chain home improvement store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error in price of this itemj","review":"The price of this should be between 3 and 4 dollars.

Did he think it would help?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hate, just appreciate","review":"Reviewers are typically villifying this album because they either 1) hate Manilow OR 2)hate the songs; or both. The 50's are not my favorite period, but Manilow's interpretations are just fine and respectful of the originals. Why is this a #1 album? Because no one records these kinds of songs anymore and very few singers can do them just justice. Give Manilow some credit here...I too, prefer his original music, on much less commercially successful albums (Mayflower, Paradise Cafe, etc.). The album is well crafted and pleasant to the ear. Give credit where it is due...Manilow and Davis unlocked a key to something many, many people wanted to hear (sales talk, folks)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and velvety!","review":"I adore this album. The arrangements are lush, and Barry sounds great, as always. Barry has a strong, young voice, as evidenced by his duet with Phyllis McGuire. Barry is the only artist I know that makes me feel as if he is singing only to me. I think his version of \\"Unchained Melody\\" is the best I have ever heard! I also love \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" and his sly reference to a song from \\"Here at the Mayflower,\\" (\\"Some Bar by the Harbor\\"). I love this album, and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manilow for the Non-Manilow Fan","review":"I have never been a Manilow fan and I practically slunk into line at the record store to buy this one. You can tell by my use of the word \\"record\\" I am of a certain age. I like the selection of songs. From \\"Rags to Riches\\" to \\"Venus,\\" they cover my childhood through my 13th year and bring back memories of that time. Besides his savvy selection, Manilow's appeal on this album is that he can sing well and he has respect for the songs. After all, they're his memories too. I'm familiar with the original versions of the songs but for the most part, I am satisfied to hear Manilow's interpretation. The only exceptions are \\"Are you Lonesome Tonight?\\" (who can compete with the King?) and \\"What a Difference a Day Makes\\" which totally belongs to Dinah Washington. That said, this is a terrific album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre .","review":"Banilow looks great with his new nose job on the front cover , and be cursed anyone who says otherwise! but this very compilation, I believe, lacks sincerity, passion, truthiness, so to say:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE: MANILOW HITS A HOME RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Without a doubt, one of the best albums ever. Manilow has proven that he CAN sing the standards, and sing them well he does! Probably his finest albun in years. It is so great to hear real music again. For this guy, the past 12 months I have been blessed with Buble, Midler, Diamond, and now Manilow!! Michael Buble said it best:\\" Don't let this music die!!

BRAVO!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Manilow, you'll love this...","review":"I had a little apprehension at first about getting this CD, but it soon vanished. This is an awesome CD of covers that grabs you beginning with \\"Moments to Remember,\\" the very first song and just keeps on going.My most favorite song on the CD is \\"Unchained Melody\\" which I usually associate with the Righteous Brothers and that scene in \\"Ghost\\" with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore at the pottery wheel. After seeing the music video for Barry's version, every time I hear Barry sing it, I'll replace that scene with Barry's \\"Unchained Melody\\" music video images of our troops coming home to their loved ones who missed them so much while they have been away doing their duty for our country. Thanks so much guys for defending our freedom!!!!The bottom line....I've never been one for covers, but this one is a winner with me. If you know Manilow, you know he loves to sing a song with a story, and these songs fit his style perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No, Barry!","review":"I grew up listening to the songs of the fifties, and loved them. They had wonderful vocalists for those songs, and the operative word here is \\"had\\". Barry Manilow just doesn't add the spark or emotions these songs need, and he really should get used to the fact he cannot hit those high notes, no matter how hard he tries. That said, there is probably a redeeming factor in this album. If you are an insomniac and need something to bore you to sleep, by all means, get this. It will probably work faster than any sleeping pill. Barry drones on and on here. I gave mine to Goodwill. Shame on me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manilow, Fifties and Sixties","review":"Folks - I am a long-standing Manilow fan in an environment where it is not always considered PC to be in that Category. I think his \\"Paradise Café\\" album is one of the all-time greats. But these two are rubbish.The voice has gone - it even SOUNDS 60+. The selection is great, and so lulls one into the notion that BM plus whatever just has to be good.That used to be the case. I think BM's rendition of \\"Come Fly/Dance With Me\\" (on the Sinatra abum) is at least as good as the originals as well as being more innovative. But I hafta say that every one of the tracks on these two albums is inferior to the originals. I am not alone in this opinion - everyone to whom I have spoken has expressed disappointment in the discs and is looking to sell them off as rapidly as possible before the news gets around that Manilow has bombed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good overall :-l","review":"I'm not normally a fan of this kind of music (as you can tell by my other reviews), but Barry Manilow still has a fantastic voice no matter what you think about his choice of songs. Apparently he whittled down 70 choices of music to get to the final count on this cd. There are some good songs on here; not all are great choices for him, but a lot are beautiful. All I Have To Do Is Dream would be one of the best here, but as I said, I'd get this for his voice alone. He still has it. Now if only he'd quit the plastic surgury to keep the gorgeous looks he used to have when he was younger. He still looked like a guy back then. I imagine this won't be appealing to young kids or anything, but for people who can appreciate great talents and beautiful voices - go get this. It is kind of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry the Musician","review":"Mr. Manilow is truly a musician in every sense of the word! This CD is another example of his expertise, his devine talent and his love for all genres of song. I think my favorite on the album is \\"Venus\\" and it's just finely tuned with his back-up group (I believe they are the Manilows)sounding exactly like the original girls. This is an excellent CD for evening listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding..","review":"I can not describe my amazement at beauty of this CD. As a Manilow fan for so many years, I can tell you when Barry has his heart in a project, it will be fantastic..not just for the Manilow fan, but for the general ear as well.My mom who married in the 50's is getting this one for Mother's Day, and she will be thrilled..so thrilled.Clive and Barry, an amazing duo indeed. I recommend highly also purchasing the dual disc, that is wonderful as well. A great background of the arrangements, the recordings and interview with Barry, well worth the price indeed. ENJOY!RW"},{"rating":"1","title":"For tea-dance parties in nursing homes.","review":"Never been crazy about him as as a singer.

Wrong songs, wrong arrangements. Bad through and through. Clive must have had one too many. But your SIXTIES album (see separate listing) is FABULOUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy effort","review":"Manilow is obviously sincere in his attempt to resurrect these wonderful old songs. He probably remembers many of them with fondness (as I do) and wants to reinterpret them for a new generation. The goal is laudable. Trouble is, he's not up to the task. His limited vocal range and off-key singing are more often than not embarrassing and at best merely passable. The too-lush production is inappropriate for most of the tunes, accentuating the blandness of the vocals. In every case, the original version is better. In spite of its hefty sales and over-hyped promotion, this album is destined to be quickly forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARRY NEEDS TO TRY AND GET THE FEELIN' AGAIN","review":"Those who know me know that I also worship at the Shrine of Manilow. Those who wonder why I won't this time need to listen, even once, even briefly, to this dud. These iconic sounds cannot be duplicated. Manilow's take on them, while heroic, falls far short of the mark.; the originals sounds are simply too ingrained in our ears, the original artists' sounds simply to too strong and vivid to be surpassed, even by someone as talented as Barry. What's scary is how unsteady and unsure Phyllis McGuire seems to be dueting on the medley of \\"Sincerely\\" and \\"Teach Me Tonight.\\" Moments to remember? We think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully lost in the 50's","review":"Five Stars? This CD deserves more. How many stars in the sky? Thank you Barry Manilow from all of us Seniors.This CD has us singing along and yes dancing to the fabulous songs of the 50's! As one of the tracks says...we are once again..\\"Young at Heart\\". Hats off to Rod Stewart(Great American Song Book) and Carly Simon{Moonlight Seranade}for starting this trend of bringing back these great oldies!My favorite track is the duet with Phyliss McGuire...\\"Sincerely-Teach Me Tonite\\" Buy this CD!! Then get yourself wonderfully lost once again in the 50's!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"After listening to this album, all I can say is \\"WOW!\\" Barry continues to sound just great. I really enjoy his music (after 25 years as a fan) and find his renditions are even better than the originals, although I've always been a fan of Johnny Mathis, Bobby Darin, and Frankie Avalon. Barry always has just the right touch on every song. The feeling he puts into the words and his phrasing are super. A must CD for every Manilow fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Songs of the Fifties by Barry Manilow","review":"From an \\"ultra\\" Manilow fan -- he just keeps whipping 'em out and they are the greatest! I like this album even more than Barry's \\"Sixties\\" album, but they are both being played constantly around here. Every song is done with the OUTSTANDING Manilow flair and beautiful orchestration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hy Zaret would have loved it.","review":"Hy Zaret, who wrote the words to \\"Unchained Melody\\" never liked Bobby Hatfield's (Righteous Brothers) version of it because he \\"jazzed it up\\". So, I think he would have loved the way Barry Manilow sang it on this cd. By the way, for those of you, like me, who always wondered where \\"Unchained Melody\\" got its name, it was featured in the obscure 1955 prison movie, \\"Unchained\\". It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song but lost out to another song on this cd, \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Thing\\". History aside, I like the way Barry Manilow presents these timeless classics. He sings them with the feeling and respect they deserve. It's much more than easy listening. It's a time capsule back to the '50's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manilow gives us even more moments to remember !!!","review":"This CD, put together by Barry Manilow with a little bit of help from Clive Davis (the founder of Arista Records), is a total smash! These are great \`50s hits and the CD offers up a beautiful set of songs guaranteed to make you thrilled! I really liked \\"It's All In The Game;\\" and \\"Young At Heart\\" is very well performed by Manilow! Another plus: Manilow is accompanied by Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters on the medley of 1954 hits, \\"Sincerely/Teach Me Tonight!\\"The sound quality is good even on my portable CD player. The musical arrangements are well thought out and they are performed without excessively drowning Barry out.So get a glass of your favorite wine, lower the lights a bit and maybe plan a little but of romance when you put on this CD! Barry is on top of the world and he'll put you there, too! Enjoy Barry's great voice and the memories of the '50s that so many of us will forever hold dear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not this time","review":"I have been a huge fan of Barry Manilow since the seventies and he is always better singing his own songs than the songs of another artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"love ya barry, but....","review":"...not since Julie Andrews starred in the Broadway version of Victor/Victoria has a singer I admire been served so badly. I could only bear to listen to this once after purchase -- his voice is harsh and hoarse and he strains constantly to hit the upper register notes. Glad it's done well for him moneywise, but this is the nadir of Manilow recordings. And is it just me, or are the songs of the 50s -- if this is the representation -- hopelessly gooey? This makes every Manilow penned song look like the hardest alternative rock. Let's hope that the next outing (so to speak) is vastly different."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big ripoff not \\"new recordings\\" as advertised","review":"marketed as \\"new recordings\\" these are obvious low fidelity re-recordings of the originals.

The real Moon Mullican is shown off better on traditional C&W; sides like \\"So Long\\" and his later Blues influenced stuff like \\"I'm Mad With You,\\" \\"Well Oh Well,\\" and the truly rockin' \\"Seven Nights To Rock,\\" which Bruce Springsteen covered on his 2003 tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 and Pregnant, Season 1","review":"I love this series. It gives you a brilliant look into the lives of young women aged 16, when they first get pregnant. It shows the decisions of keeping a baby and parenting, giving the baby up for adopotion. It catches the hard decisions of what they have to do now, learning that they are still teenages, but are also now moms. I recommend it for anyone that is thinking of having children, even if you are older than 16. It shows the impacts of life change so much, and it is worth a deffiant watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 and pregnant","review":"The show should have spent more than 1 episode per girl.

Would Buy Again.","review":"I purchased 16 & Pregnant, Season 1, because I had watched all of Teen Mom and was intrigued to see the girls' stories from the beginning. I must say that watching 16 & Pregnant, Season 1 gave me a whole new perspective of the girls' situations, and I had not expected that. Frankly, I never thought I would change my feelings concerning Farrah, but after whatching 16 & Pregnant, Season 1, I am much more understanding of her.The only con I have is that the video's colors only include that of black, green and pink, but it is still very watchable, and I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"This is a terrific show on MTV.

But what about the father's????!!!! I am really upset that this show has the opportunity to really educate young people and all it does is man bash. There is no one telling the young father how to be a dad or anyone for that matter telling Maci how to support the father of her child (not $ support but emotional) she is seen always taking care of Bentley but not encouraging Ryan.With the crisis in our country of fatherless children... MTV you have the opportunity to encourage boys to become men. And i feel like you dropped the ball.At the end I just wanted to have someone take Maci aside and say - Yes its hard for him too, just because you dont see it doesnt mean it doesnt happen and doesnt mean that he doesnt think about the awesome responsibility. And have someone do the same for Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show sends the wrong message","review":"By creating this show, MTV is sending a message to all teens out there that if you get pregnant there is a possibility that you will get to be on MTV. This show does nothing to educate young people on the dangers of unprotected sex nor does it provide them with the tools to stand up to peer pressure. MTV does a disservce to teens everywhere by giving (some) teenagers the idea that if they get pregnant there is a chance that they will get a show on MTV. Unfortunate to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doormat?","review":"This doormat is incredibly lightweight and moves around when you step on it. I originally bought this for my dog door.

So buying this game should have been a no-brainer in terms of getting something fun for them to play with. Right? Well, sort of...There isn't much challenge to the game, so my 10 year old was quickly turned off to it. Not even the fun-fact cards could sustain her interest in the game.My 7 year old son was another story. The roaming crocodile that pops Steve (or Terri) off the fence gets him every time! Ideally I'd like my son to sit still long enough to absorb the info. on the game cards.All in all...a fun game, but for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter loves the crocodile hunter game!","review":"My 5 year old daughter is a big fan of Steve Irwins show, so we knew she would love this game. When we have to press the button to send AGRO running around the board, she gets the biggest kick out of it. We play it as a family... we all enjoy it.

Porter's voice is in fine shape and the songs are all good solid country music - not the modern sound. Thanks to Marty Stuart for producing the album. He's doing a lot for country music by helping keep the real masters from being put out to pasture. Marty and his band are the perfect accompaniment for these songs - these guys are real country players, the best. The last cut with Marty and Porter talking and Porter singing with just Marty's guitar is a great way to end. Highly recommended if you like country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Chance for Authentic Country","review":"Many thanks for Marty Stuart getting Porter back into recording again. As Nashville continues to put out \\"pap\\" for the brainless, the younger crowd would do well to just listen to this record. This is what country music sounded like when I was a kid in the 50's. This album is so beautifully crafted with just the right amount of Marty and Buck Trent's licks, Stuart Duncan\\"s fiddle and Kenny Vaughan on steel, and the wonderful Carl Jackson harmonizing. While Porter's voice is not what it used to be; it is now more soulful and authentic. It won't happen but this should be a grammy award winning album.

Most of the book provided a several page showcase for an individual bath with discussion of what made it special.Living rooms was OK. It's content was more canned, but it still had some inspiration and enough ideas that were useful that although I would not put it amongst the best such books, it was worth an hour or two to browse.Bedrooms hit the bottom of the list for me. The content seemed especially canned. The ideas were not fully developed and most of them appeared to me more appropriate to someone's first apartment than an established home (so it just needs the right audience?).

There a few of them out there.GOOD READING"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read book for every woman!","review":"Especially women over 35. Dr Lee clearly explains how we are exposed from infancy on, to chemicals that mimic estrogen. This exposure causes multiple problems that women in non-industrialized countries do not suffer. Few doctors receive any training about natural methods to counteract this exposure which work better and without side effects of conventional drug therapy. He states that even \\"medical journals are...thinly disguised advertising\\" for the drug companies.The auther is a retired doctor with over 30 years in family practice and often refers to his experiences.If, you want to take charge of you health, this book is a good way to get started. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Info.","review":"The fact that I ordered this book probably tells you why I didn't like Harry Potter. hee hee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book still filled with good advice?","review":"The recently stopped study of the effects of estrogen and progesterone (showing an increase in heart attacks, strokes, dementia and cancers) leaves me wondering whether or not the advice in this book is still sound. Estrogen alone did not show the increased risks leaving us to conclude progesterone was the culprit. These results were unknown when Dr. Lee wrote this book, but now I am wondering whether or not it should be mandatory for Dr. Lee to address these concerns before women start using this progesterone cream he advocates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reassuring tone can't mask flawed science","review":"While the tone of this book is, no doubt, reassuring to many women who feel triviliazed, ignored and misunderstood by their own doctors. the science on which it purports to be based is deeply flawed. If the authors are as well-intentioned as they seem to be, it is a pity that they didn't do their homework better, and that they have allowed their book to become the engine that drives an entire on-line industry of modern-day snake-oil peddlers who exaggerate Lee's claims even further in their quest for the fast buck.Progesterone certainly has a role to play in women's well-being, particularly during their reproductive years. It is not, however, a risk-free panacea for everything that ails us at midlife. Wise consumers will seek many sources of information before deciding to embark on any drug regimen, \\"natural\\" or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended for medical menopause @ 38 yrs","review":"The book does a good job of explaing options for women of natural menopause age. The part that concerned me was comparing a woman having a hysterectomy with a man being castrated. Being a woman doesn't only have to do with her internal organs it also has to do with her mind and heart. This was a one liner in the book but it was the line that I remembered. I may have taken it out of context at the time but still the comment stays with me. Other than that the authors offered many alternatives to synthetic medications and did a good job of describing those alternatives. I may give it a try after surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all women to read!","review":"This book and the one Dr Lee followed with: \\"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause\\" should be on every woman's \\"must read\\" list. Natural progesterone works for those unwanted symptoms of menopause, early menopause, P.M.S., etc., and makes logical sense to all of us who don't accept the idea of using medication that can produce dangerous and perhaps life-threatening side effects.

This one, however, only worked for about 3 months. I didn't have my purchase receipt for warranty repair so I bought yet one more. This time, the unit NEVER worked properly. Each time the unit failed (including the one I just received from Amazon), it was due to the rain guage losing contact with the main unit.

The comments about replacing the batteries are right on. Why must it be so difficult? Generally the unit gave reasonable readings, however very small amounts of rain did not record. But when one considers the tilting pan mechanism for measuring rainfall, this (at least to me) is not surprising. A small amount of rain does not trip the pan, and may evaporate before the next rainfall.During the time I owned the unit, the display would periodically start to flash, for no apparent reason. This could go on for days, then stop. I'd replace the batteries (as mentioned earlier, a big pain), but it would not solve the problem. I tried re-setting the unit. It did not help. I tried calling Customer Service. They were of no help. They claimed they never heard of a problem like this. So this spring, rather than waster money on a new set of batteries, I threw it away.

I tried to use this product for a year and found out that it just didn't perform as the description indicated. I even installed a post in the garden to receive the rain gauge receptable.

It is reasonably simple to set up and so far has performed well. Since I live in a grove of large oak trees finding a spot for a rain gauge has been problematic. Since the temperature sensor and rain gauge are wireless there are only distance restrictions on where they can be placed. I mounted the rain colector/measuring device on a 15' pole I already had in the yard. It's out of the way of mowing and other activities and not influenced by being shielded by buildings or the trees. The best part is I don't have to \\"dump\\" the gauge, clean out dead bugs or guess what \\"line\\" to read. The digital daily rainfall reading does reset at midnight; however, there is the \\"accumulated\\" readout which keeps adding to its total until reset. Long term reliability is the biggest possible concern I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little rain gauge!","review":"We bought this rain gauge for our friend and he is greatly enjoying it.

It worked wonderful, giving accurate readings. I noticed that it is calibrated for metric units and converts it to inches (therefore it measures in .04 inch increments), but that's not an issue. Two weeks ago the rain gauge stopped communicating with the receiver. I tried replacing batteries, resetting both the rain gauge and receiver, moved them next to each other, all with no success in getting a reading.

Out of this transitory period emerges E. W. Hornrung's Crime Doctor. After surviving a grievous head wound attained during the folly of the Boer War, a brutal campaign in which atrocities where committed by the English against Boer civilians, John Dollar lays down his rifle to pursue the noble calling of medicine. He establishes an exclusive practice, one that only caters to the criminal classes. It is his belief that most criminals are unbalanced individuals and given the proper treatments can be cure of their compulsions. Of course, there are a few setbacks... deadly setbacks. And these failures serve as the motivation for Dr. Dollar to take a more hostile approach to the business of crime. After reading this absorbing collection, I guarantee you will be wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FUN AND FABULOUS!!!","review":"Pick this up! It is amazing, and so much fun!

This made the chapters on bourne, c and korn shell very difficult to learn from. Try Ellie Quigley's book \\"Unix Shells by Example\\" for learning shell scripting. Quigley provides plenty of examples to learn from and provides step by step explanations on shell scripting.Sobell does a good job Chapter 7, networking. Most of this chapter is explaining concepts and not teaching and explaining Unix commands.I would not recommend this book if you are learning Unix.

She is an apostate nun with lots of big bones to pick with Christianity. Unfortunately, Christianity is not her chosen topic, and it is a major distraction to have her continually turn aside to land a few outraged whacks.

The possession, printing, reproduction, sale and distribution of the publications were prohibited and offenders could be jailed for 3 years or fined RM20,000 or both.Any book banned by the same government who banned the Bible (in one native language and later recinded the ban) should be seriously considered for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"symphatetic biography","review":"Armstrong's book has a definite direction.It provides insight into much of the 'humaness' of the prophet of islam and the realities of the socio political climate of the time. Her sympathetic biography is particularly useful in potraying a constructive and positive profile to those less familiar with the prophet and Islam. On a personal level, for me as a muslim, I loved the sense of identification and inspiration that the book provides - it often allowed for the message of the prophet to be understood in real terms not estranged from our own times, as overzealous reverence for the prophet often makes one miss this.The book is however specific in its potrayal as is the value derived thereof and is by no means intended to be authoritive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I purchased this book believing that it would be as advertised, a balanced look at the life of Muhammad.

She does not reflect on how Mohammad conveniently received revelations to wiggle out of some dilemma involving his relations with his wives (which makes one wonder about the source of those revelations) and on why these revelations should be considered the Final Revelation of God. To me, that's insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair minded Catholic writes biography of Muhammad","review":"Despite the \\"reprehensible\\" reviewer from somewhere in the US one can clearly see a non Muslim but sincere author treating a life in its time and place with some fairness.

After that she covers Muhammad's(peace be upon him) life and the situation of the Arabian peninsula at this time in great detail. Many times she will refer to the prophets of the Torah and Bible/scriptures in these books in order to make a comparision. This is great for someone who is familiar with the earlier books. She has a way of bringing the chracters to life and showing that they were human too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"It amazes me that a serious student of history would go to a book such as this to learn anything.The life story of Mohammed, the last and final prophet, (salallaahu aleihe wasallam) is based like any reliable history upon the chain of transmission of information and upon the characters of the transmitters themselves.Ibn Ishaq wrote SIRAT RASUL ALLAH and Ibn Kathir wrote AL- SIRA AL- NABAWIYYA both authoratative texts on the subject full of exhaustive detail, complete with sahih hadith (absolutely confirmed reports).Karen Armstrong's work seems derisory in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"religion, a garbage of human mind.","review":"what can i say about karen armstrong, who is stubborn to defend a man, who did his best to demean and degrade women and killed, torutured, slaughtered and massacred innocent pagans,( sirat rasul allah, by ibn ishaq, written 1300 years ago, its translation has recently been printed in pakistan)?muhammad did exactly what moses and joshua did in their time.

It is very relevant to what is happening today in the world, as one fifth of the world owe it's faith to his efforts. The author very expertly explains how the Prophet with his devotion and powerful personality turned around a people primarily belonging to the desert, into a nation which conquered the two main world powers of that period, within 16 years of his arrival into medina. We have tried to over simplify the Prophet's life ever since, but as shown beautifully in this book, he was a human being experiencing and facing all the complexities of life as we all do. The book cover is magnificent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact over Fiction","review":"After 9-11 I thought it best for my perspective and thinking to read something about Islam. I did not want to be an ignorant propagandist responding emotionally to events without knowledge or insight. I wanted some fact less fiction.Having read most of Ms. Armstrong's other work I felt comfortable with her objectivity and fairness dealing with sensative historical facts, fiction, and mythology as she does.Muhammad is not about current affairs. It is not the story of the Muslims of the middle east today. It is not the story of the conservative Islamists of today. It is the story of Muhammad in the context of his day and his culture. As the story of Christ and Budda are best understood in the context of their day and their culture. All such stories of the Great Ones involve a certain amount of interpretation and conjecture but they are all relevent and meaningful.This is a very good read for any person interested in the world's Third Great Book Religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I love workout videos, but this was the worst!

I raced home and immedeatly opened the package. I took me a while to set up and learn how to play but I soon found out it was worth it. The game is basically a Buffy version of Dungeons and Dragons. And to my suprise, unlike the series the bad guys can win! I think they represented each season well. And for all you non- Bufsters the game will definately educate you on the basics of Buffy 101.

For the people complaining about bland taste, I think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is. I like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them, you can top with something savory or sweet.

Throughout the game, the character learns more about his past. The plot is very engrossing. The levels are bizarre and creepy. There are some very disturbing and gross parts, but they aren't inappropriate to the game or story.The puzzles are easy. I only had to look at the walkthrough once, and that is rare for me. As the other reviewer mentioned, make sure you are standing very close to an object before interacting with it, or the character will refuse to do it.I did run into two bugs that produced unwinnable conditions. Luckily I made multiple saves, and reverted to a previous save.I guess something that really struck me was the melancholy feeling in Chapter 4.

I loved it, and introduced it to many of my friends. I didn't find it scary, but horrific, imaginative, and intriguing, filled with atmosphere through its carefully wrought graphics and sound. Especially atmospheric are the music and sound effects. It is a game like The Longest Journey in which you don't want the journey to end. --Incidently I've recently reinstalled my 4-year-old Sanitarium on Windows XP Pro (with SP1) and it seemed to work fine.

It's puzzles don't take endless hours to solve, and when you die or leave the game, you return right where you were without all the tedious making up to do.

I would recommend this to those who like to play, but cannot devote their life to a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 years after its release and it's still fun to play","review":"That actually says a lot about a video game. Sanitarium is one of those games that grabs you be the ears from the very beginning and won't let you go. You'll find yourself getting very involved with the story line; so much in fact that you'll be thinking of different possible endings as the game progresses. The only problem is that the puzzles may seem a bit amateur for fans of the genre - Myst fans will find these puzzles to be a waste of time. But the game is still entertaining and very captivating. It's a wonder how this game never really got much publicity - definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"30th Anniversary Edition?

This one has to be their zenith, although the follow-up, 1975's \\"Fool For The City,\\" got all the attention. The title cut, \\"Blue Spruce Woman,\\" and the balls-to-the-wall slide rave-up \\"Chateau Lafitte '59 Boogie,\\" make this a must-have for any fan of the band or blues-based British rock in general.

It is also good for all kinds of stains...especially if you use the wand manually. Also, to keep the tube and cannister clean, I recommend cleaning it with baking soda and water. I put hot water into the sink and add a couple of tablespoons of baking soda to a gallon and run it through the hose. It not only cleans the hose, but the tank as well. I only wish the waste tank had a better way to clean it as I did not discover the soda idea till today.

One of my dogs got into peeing in the front room for a week or so-even on dried up areas is seems that the spot bot got the stain AND smell out. and I've been diluting the cleaning solution even more than they suggest. I did notice that the liquid spills easily when I move it from area to area-not a constant leak-just spills out a little. so don't turn it on its side when it has liquid in it. cleaning the hose is really easy just get a pan of clean water and vacuum it up.

It far exceeded my expectations. I used to use carpet spot remover and a hand brush. I thought I was doing a good job, but when I went over the same area with the SpotBot, the collected liquid looked like chocolate milk. I liked the results so much on the carpet that I tried it on the seats. I had the same \\"chocolate milk\\" results. After going over everything a couple of times, I can now say that everything is clean. You don't realize how dirty your interior is until you clean it with the SpotBot.I should mention that my great results came by using the machine on the \\"manual setting\\". I tried the automatic mode, but was not as successful due to lack of space. I am sure it would work great on home carpet. So far the SpotBot has worked flawlessly, but if anything happened to it, I would not hesitate to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy remanufactured - by new","review":"I only got approx 2 yrs service from the remanufactured SpotBot I purchased.

That worked for awhile then most recently pump stopped working so no spray - then it started to leak on the floor! Also - very heavy and had to store on waterproof mat as it would leak.

I did, the repair technician told me SpotBot electronics are junk. He said I could try hitting the machine where the circut board is. So I did. Surpise it started working again!

After a couple of cycles and manually sucking up the excess cleaning solution you end up with a clean carpet. But does that really save that much time and effort? After less than a year of use ours stopped pumping cleaning fluid (went through the troubleshooting, called tech support, etc) and we couldn't get it to work. So now we have an expensive scrub brush. Seems like our full-size Hoover carper cleaner (which didn't cost much more than this Bissell) has held up longer, does a better job and is more reliable.

The book systematically points out some of the most difficult problems of AS - disorientation, obsession, miscommunication - as if all person with AS experience all these problems. Most AS individuals are uniquely challenged, having shades of these, as well as other issues. The most disappointing aspect to this book is that it doesn't celebrate the gifts AS children may have - expanded vocabularies, intelligence, honesty, a fascination for stories and books, advanced computer skills, and often, artistry.

It has very remedial information on how Asperger's Syndrome (AS) appears to others. In this way it can be informative to those who don't have AS (why is he doing that?) as well as to those who have AS (how am I different?).

Not so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Asperger Syndrome","review":"My husband and I were both REALLY disappointed in this book. As it states in the book, kids with AS are often very smart.

The moves are all simple and straightforward to perform with no long button combinations. This was obviously designed with the wrestling fan in mind, as opposed to Attitude which seems to be aimed more at serious gamers. Single player is also infitely better with the 'Road To Wrestlemania' option and computer opponents that actually prove challenging. Multiplayer is fantastic and playing with three mates is the most fun you can have with a joypad. The only area it falls down in is presentation. The game needed more options and the graphics and sound could do with some tweaking but that not withstanding, this is the first choice for everyone out there that hasn't missed a WWF pay-per-view for the last ten years and anyone who is just looking for a brilliant multiplayer experience in general"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks","review":"It Wasnt even the right game i ordered wrestlemania 2000 and they sent me turok with a wrestlemania cover on it this sucks and it really makes me hesitate to order from here again cause they wont let me get my money back"},{"rating":"2","title":"the easiest wrestling game on earth!","review":"the controls are very very easy to pick up.you can,with very little real effort do spectacular feats of dexterity and skill.you can also make your own wrestlers.no i dont mean some wanker with someone elses moves.i mean you make him and you program like 180 different moves into him!theres like over 10 types of suicide dives alone!it rules!if you dont like the guys you get,you can go in and change them also.you cant change the moves,just the appearence.youll be on medium level in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AKI makes the best engine for any wrestling games","review":"It's a shame THQ didn't allow AKI to develop there games for the PS2 as well; the ridiculous system Yukes developed for \\"Smackdown!\\" makes me feel like I'm playing Mortal Kombat instead of wrestling. The AKI system provides the best wrestling simulation of all games. The movement is accurate and believable, and the reaction the characters have after hurting a particular body part makes for a good wrestling experience. I also particularly like the fact that there is no \\"health bar\\" on the AKI games.

The moves aren't complicated the game play is excellent and THQ put in all almost all the details (trinitron, theme music, faces were almost identicle to the actuall wrestlers). This game just flat out blows away the compition and i'm looking forward to the next WWF game by THQ (and if you didn't already know I think the WWF signed like a 10 year deal with THQ). The finishing moves are easy enough to do. Some people have said that \\"Road to Wreslemania\\" is to hard, I agree with them by saying that it is hard but it's better then not having a challenge and I didn't find it terribly hard anyway.

It lets you watch the move being done on a dummy before you select it. The only problem was in Road to Wrestlemania. There are quite a few tag matches which soon become more of a pain then a challenge. Also when trying to win the WWF title the computer reverses every move you do. (You might get lucky though.) All in all though a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrestlemania 2000","review":"There are many different things that I didn't like about this game. First of all, it was too difficult for me. Even when the game is set to easy, there are some players, in Road to Wrestlemania mode, that are just almost impossible to beat. They avoid every grapple and they counter every move. I also didn't like the fact that the characters in the game looked nothing like they do in life. Such as the Hardy Boys, they look nothing in the game like they do in real life.

The moves are very easy to execute and are pretty slick. The create-a-player mode is easy but it takes about 40 minutes to make a guy...it's worth it 90% of the time though. Road to Wrestlemania is very challenging, even on easy.

Although it's a work of fiction, there are numerous references to actual people and events that help lend authenticity to the plot.

Carrots, tomatoes (if I was willing to clean up the mess afterwards), apples, turnips, onions ... nice and neat little chunks in a very short time, happy joy. But then I found the Nicer Dicer's kryptonite--rutabagas. One piece KILLED the large grid, bending several of the blades irreparably. A couple of other people I know (freaks who also like rutabagas) confirmed that they couldn't cut them with the Nicer Dicer either. If you stay away from rutabagas you should be okay, but as I mentioned tomatoes (even the hard ones) will make a mess and items like potatoes and carrots will pose some difficulty if you don't set them just so. Williams-Sonoma sells a very similar product for about five dollars less than the Nicer Dicer that's a lot sturdier and offers more options, including a measuring cup.

It's taken an while to get it to work, but the sound and functionality is great.The manual leaves a lot to be desired. The remote is an unintuitive challenge to figure out. The unit doesn't include the SVHS inputs that the higher end models have.Kenwood wants you to be happy and offers phone support and a web site. The web site isn't great. Like the remote, it's hard to figure out.But when you've finally gotten it to work, the sound is really magnificent. If you buy it, get it to work, and have good speakers, you will enjoy the sound.The good or bad news is that only you will be able to figure out how to work it. So if you're a control freak on your equipment, have no fear, you will have no challengers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looks, mediocre component....","review":"I bought the Kenwood VR-2080 about 5 months ago. I have to admit that it does a lot of really cool things, but then there's a lot of bad things about it to. The remote for instance, It's really cool how you can use the LCD screen to control everything, but what good does it do you you if it takes you a minute before it actually establishes a 2-way connection with the reciever, it doesn't work past 18 feet or so, I really wish I hadn't bought this reciever when I did cause I saw the great price... Right now, I have no idea what's wrong with it, but no sound comes out. I think there's a short inside one of the amps or something.

This was not covered in the book so I emailed their tech support. 2 Months later they replied asking for the exact title & ISBN. I replied. They obviously didn't read the bit where I described what was happening because they just pasted in the relevant, wrong, section from the book.

In the hands of a kid, this toy would be broken into a dozen pieces in a heartbeat.Cliff notes: if you're a careful collector of Transformers toys, I can recommend this toy to you.

I simply could not get his hood and the second half of his body to line up correctly, leading me to throw it against the wall.

The only possible good reviews for this piece of tripe would be from someone who listened to this in the '70's and has warm, nostalgic feelings for it, because it is terrible! If you want '70's hard rock, skip this! This album is about as heavy as the Little River Band. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE the Little River Band, but not this waste of time. You want '70's, go buy Tyranny & Mutation from BOC, or Rocks from Aerosmith, or Montrose, or Double Live Gonzo. The only thing entertaining about this CD is the ridiculous clothing the band is wearing on the inner sleeve! Avoid if you know what's good for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice rumble pack","review":"When I first tried my rumble pack it didn't work like I expected it to but the more I used it the better it worked.

If you still have a chance I would recommend getting one."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls short of expectations","review":"Jennifer Lopez's cd, \\"On the 6\\" falls very short of expectations. Her debut song \\"If You Had My Love\\" is a very well manufactured single, guaranteed for success because its what the general public wants right now. Following in the wake of Ricky Martin's equally disappointing album, Jennifer is guaranteed a few more hits off this album, before this latin music fad fades away."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW~ Livin La Vida Lopez~ She's Hotttt!","review":"Ricky Martin watch out Jennifer's taking the throne and I don't think she'll be gone as long as Latin Music lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One or two tunes worth a listen","review":"The photos on the cd insert are almost worth the price of the cd.

Many thought it would be a joke in the beginning, but she has proved everyone wrong with one of the hottest singles of '99 (If You Had My Love). This album packs enough good songs to keep people listening and having fun. \\"Let's Get Loud\\" makes you wanna dance. \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" just plain rules. To anyone who likes this type of music, this album is a good buy. 'On The 6' has many fun songs on it. To all Jennifer Lopez haters..... \\"Leave us fans alone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is my first Jlo album ever, yes I have a guilty pleasure of listening to her, I won't lie. Mi cansion favorito, \\"No Me Ames\\" or my favorite song is \\"No Me Ames\\". It's a sentimental and sad song, translated from a Italian poem, well that's what I heard. And Marc Anthony does the duet beautfiully with Jlo! And another favorite was \\"Should of Never\\" and of course, \\"If You Had My Love\\" or \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" in English and en esponal! Recommended for those who listen to Jlo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This just isn't very good.","review":"Ok, I tried to be nice but she deserves this. This album bites. She released all the songs that are half decent and left all the crappy remainders for those who were suckered into buying this trash.AND under NO circumstances should you repeat same songs in the album. What she could have done is put \\"Una Noche Mas\\" on one of the singles or something but she just forces you to listen to more of her music.This album is a mix between boring and downright painful to listen to. This is why downloading MP3s has become so popular. Because you could download \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" and \\"Feelin' So Good\\" then leave the rest on the shelf of the store and save your time and money.The highlight of this album was the pictures inside the sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COLLOSAL DISASTER","review":"PLEASE DONT EVER MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING OR EVEN LISTENING TO THIS CD.THIS MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE LOUSIEST DEBUT ALBUMS EVER RELEASED BY ANY ARTIST .THIS AWFUL BABE HAS NO TALENT WHATSOEVER AND HAS AN ANNOYING VOICE THAT I DISLIKE.AVOID THIS CD AT ALL COSTS.NO STARS.GET ANY ALBUM FROM MOUNTAIN INSTEAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it, didn't like it, and NO voice talent!","review":"This album is horrible!

I can't believe this was allowed to happen. I'm sorry for ranting, but, WOW!Lopez has one of the worst voices in music and cinema history.

I really liked the singles \\"If You Had My Love\\" and \\"Waiting for Tonight\\". The whole album is generated with horrible beats and too many corny songs. I think that Jennifer has a great voice, but this album did not work for me. I really appreciated that this album incorparated latin rythms in it. This could've been a good album, but it was simply overproduced. This cd, in my opinion, is not worth buying. If you like any of her songs, I advise you to buy the singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Well, now we know where all of Mariah Careys rejected songs ended up. The only good song is Waiting for Tonight, the dance song that has the gay dance clubs rocking. Warning; if you are expecting a dance CD, don't be fooled. It's low budget, poorly sung songs that you will quickly forget. If you want great dance songs look somewhere else. Trouble is this CD has been a hit so we are in store for more of no talent Jennifer Lopez. What a dissapointment this CD is.

Her delivery is bland without a touch of emotion. Recently I spoke with someone who has worked on the sound engineering for her recordings and he said that the technology that is usually used to smooth over slight vocal imperfects (minor bleeps & glitches) they used on her voice to correct all over the map, up to an entire note. The fact that someone like this has a career in music is astounding and disgraceful. When there are people who have real talent out there and are struggling and who will never be heard on the radio, JLo has made a singing career out of low-cut dresses and a big booty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Actress Fails at Singing!","review":"IT'S JUST BAD, although I do get a kick out of listening to the limitations of her voice every time she tries to hit a high note. Perhaps that's why they teamed her with Marc Anthony on \\"No Me Ames,\\" where his voice draws attention away from her. As for the song, \\"Let's Get Loud,\\" I find it hard to believe that Gloria Estefan meant for that song to get recorded, unless it was a practical joke on Jennifer...note to Jennifer, there's an \\"s\\" in the word \\"gusta,\\" so you don't pronounce it \\"gu'ta.\\" It's sad to see such a bad role model for Latinas. You can wrap her up in Channel, Gucci, or Prada, but she's still a tired street girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"No voice, No talent, just body","review":"You know you're lucky you're with the \\"wanna-be gangsta\\" (puffy), it's because of him, (oh yeah you also better thank Marc Anthony for putting you up there for a while) that you are even known. You are not a good actress, and thanks to technology you sound ok, but even that can't hide the fact that you cannot sing. Go back \\"On the 6\\" and find some other talent. Do modeling at least. Your body is all you got. Plus, the lyrics to that song \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" was originally written by some other group that never made it either. How ironic, your not going to last that long either. Take my advice, do modeling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tone-deaf","review":"saying she has no talent isn't a reach.it makes sense that puffy is her man because they both lack any musical talent.hearing her scream out in her songs is a hurting on the ears.you have to have a pitch.but she is tone deaf.i'm sure of that.she needs to just stick to 2nd tier films&forget about putting a hurting on ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the 6?

This album is a joke. She is one of the worst singers I have ever heard (right next to Briteny Spears). Her album wasn't even all that. She had 3 decent songs. She sounds like a cat being drowned.Miss Lopez needs to brush up on her acting and keep the singing to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a sick joke put out by sony?","review":"I can't believe all that hype was about this album. Honestly it stinks, its poorly put together, and her voice is very average, so whats the attraction, i don't know i guess she will end up like all the other actor turned wannabe singers did ex(Don Johnson). oh well what can we do but hlp each other out by warning everyone, SAVE your money it stinks, and her lyrics are so silly and dopey that you can't sing along if you wanted to. One star is being generous, the worst song is waiting for tonight and that duet with marc anthony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with acting","review":"Jennifer Lopez probably won't win any Oscars but she's cute and she's got great screen presense, but what she does not have is a the ability to sing well. She can dance though, I'll give her that. I think that if Jennifer Lopez stuck with alto rather than straining to hit the high notes, she'd be better off. It might also help if she settle on a cohesive overall sound. If You Had My Love is catchy and has a good beat, but is too often marred by her embarrassing falsetto. Her current single wisely positions her voice behind the music - well, actually no. The music isn't that great either. It's almost like listening to her from underwater, but I doubt the song would be any more impressive than the music. Otherwise, her album skips from one musical style to another without her leaving her mark on any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer es una verguenza para nosotros los hispanos","review":"Pues, nos pinta como cuerpos esculturales pero, sin cerebro.

Sorry people, I like Jennifer as an actress but not as a singer. Her tunes are popular because they are catchy and they ooze the latin flavor everyone is begging for. But that still is not enough to hide her weak vocals. Let's see how many people like Jennifer's singing when her beauty fades away. If she is still singing that is.... (which i am extremely doubtful about)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the talent?","review":"I think Jennifer Lopez is famous for all the wrong reasons. She isn't the greatest singer in the world and if her video is supposed to be a reflection of herself then it seems like she's a little self-centered. Her vocals are disappointing especially in \\"If you had my love\\". I admire all the people who managed to extract something good from these musical monstrosities. I however could not force myself to find anything good in any of her songs. Sorry Jen but this is my honest opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!","review":"Usually a movie star crosses into music because he or she has some talent.

I only like music that I can FEEL and she puts NO feeling into her songs. Also she has a weak voice. I believe Marc Anthony did her a big favor by agreeing to do a duet with her. The tropical version of \\"No Me Ames\\" is really the only song on this CD worth listening to and its only because of Marc Anthony's terrific voice. If you want to listen to some good R&B try Monica, Brandy or Mariah Carey. Better yet, listen to some good latin music by La India, Olga Tañon, Gisselle, or anyone...except Jennifer Lopez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Embarrassing....","review":"My brother bought it and played it on the hifi and wow...Yeah it is that bad.

Her image is that of a latin goddess, but instead of the sexy, husky voice we are used to hearing in her movies, like \\"Out of Sight\\" and \\"Selena\\", you discover that her singing voice is a lot higher. The lyrics lack soul. The one good track on the album is her duet with Marc Anthony, \\"No Me Ames\\". It is a beautiful, hearttugging latin song. Still, Jeniffer should stick to the big screen and ditch recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep up the good work Jennifer","review":"I think Jennifer Lopez sings pretty good.

If she did not look the way she does and have the connections she does, this album would be at the bottom of the charts where it truly belongs!

Jenifer thanks she can make all of us boys buy herc.d. just b/c she is striped down to a sweater and her panties!O.k. she is a little pretty, but who buys ac.d. for the front cover anyway!Moving on to the music itself, there is boppy/pop music that is on the edge of being flat out annoying. If you would like an example, the song \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" goes: \\"I'm waiting for tonight..............................WOOOAAAAHHHH! \\". While this seems o.k. @ first, it becomes REALLY bad after about the 57th time! I have yet to meet somebody that has listened to the c.d. all the way through without speeding it up, or just turning it off.As if boppy/pop music is not bad enough, midway through the c.d. a big fat greedy rapper comes on the c.d. to blab about the fact that he \\"never shares his money\\", oh wonderful!

Most of the songs on the album are very average and similar sounding ballads. Only 3 songs stand out. \\"If You had my love\\", the first single, produced by Rodney Jerkins, is a sexy dance number which reminds one of Toni Braxton's booty call classic \\"You're makin' me high\\". \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" is a very Mariah-esque house number, not unlike Ms Carey's own \\"Someday\\" or \\"Prisoner\\". Perhaps the best song on the whole album is \\"No Me Ames\\", her duet with Marc Anthony, which is a breezy latin ballad which evokes summer, palm trees and lazing on the beach with a cocktail in your hand. The Puff Daddy-produced \\"Feelin' so good\\" is the worst song on the album. It ranks as Puffy's worst production effort yet, even though it features a rap by Latino MC, Big Punisher.

I think she has SOME of the greatest songs out there, but she doesn't need to be singing them! Jen struggles to hit notes and we suffer through the song.

Jennifer is smart, she's popular and wants to explore all her possibilities while she has that fame.

Besides IYHML, there are only 2 more good songs on this album, \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" and \\"Let's Get Loud\\". If you likethe latin groove that is popular right now, but, you're sick of 'LIVING LA VIDA LOCA', you should like \\"Lets Get Loud\\". Besides this, the only other good song is \\"Waiting For Tonight\\". You may have seen the video for this on MTV or VH1. I agree that the songs and the vocals drag on this album. Listen to this at the wrong time and you'll be ready to put it away for a year!!! She has an ok to moderately good voice, but she needs to find music that lets her take her range to different levels. She also needs music with just a little bit faster rhythm to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Would be a Negative 10 (-10)","review":"Yikes! Please don't do it again. I remember when I turned on the TV and saw a snippet of her video, the first thing I said was \\"another actor trying to sing\\" trying is the operative word. Horrible, I didn't buy the CD, borrowed it and gave it back quick fast and in a hurry! I've watched her incessant interviews and she stresses, \\"you know I started out singing before acting...\\" ok, right whatever. She's convinced herself enough, unfortunately she hasn't convinced a lot of people. I rate her up there with Janet Jackson and Madonna, on singing ability, (stop trying to hit the hight notes). Luckily they are good entertainers. Sorry JL, can't sing her way out of a (wet) paper bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TREAT!","review":"I expected when buying the CD that apart from 'If you had my love', this album would soon start to bore me. Luckily I was wrong. La Lopez is definitely on the right track with this dazzling debut album. Upbeat songs like 'Let's get loud' and 'Una noche mas' get your feet moving and ballads like 'Promise me' and 'Should have never told you' are golden. My favourite is the ballad version of her duet with Marc Anthony 'No me ames', although her version of 'Do you know' should not go unmentioned either. This album was a total surprise and money well spent. It is a great mixture of English and Spanish songs, of ballads and dance tracks. Conclusion: Jennifer Lopez is more than just a pretty face, she's got the music in her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Every one has there own opinion but I listened to this album and was dissapointed! Its really not good, catchy tunes but thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"left me hanging...","review":"i bought this cd because i liked 'waiting for tonight' and 'if you had my love' - but it turned out those 2 were the only good songs! i felt the rest were missing something - and there was no punch to it. she has a lot of slow songs, and it's fit for background noise - you hear something, but don't know what she's singing about because she's whining. i was disappointed overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and Ordinary","review":"Someone once said that it is much nicer to see a singer/musician try their hand at acting, and that an actor trying to pursue a recording career was....not as nice. That little afterthought definately applies to Jennifer Lopez, who somehow managed to gain great success with this cd. True, the albums two best cuts, 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight', were released as singles, giving us the impression that the album might have other worthy songs to boast. That is not the case, unfortunately, as the rest of the album, with a couple of exceptions,is nothing but mediocrity, especially the ballads, which do nothing but show what a thin, weak voice Lopez has. All in all, a truly subpar effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good CD overall!","review":"I think for a debut album, it's very good. Plenty of dancy tunes and it's fun to listen to. Jennifer Lopez rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the screen...","review":"Yet another pretty face used to sell a studio producer's pet project. Es muy mal."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best female album","review":"jennifer lopez's album is one of the best female album i have heard.....she bring out the pop and dance together....and she is fine to top it all of.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Jennifer Lopez has a weak voice. That combined with the average music makes for a waste of time. It's \\"star\\" appeal that makes this CD work, definitely not the singing. Maybe a second CD will come out, hopefully not, and comparisons to Paula Abdul will run rampant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited vocal ability","review":"She can sing; However, her vocal ability (limited) sounds pretty much like any other top 40 female pop singer out there. At the very least, Jennifer is trying to look like Vanessa Williams and dance like Janet Jackson ( sorry, these ladies are in a class of their own; It's called talent and style)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is horrible","review":"This may be 1999's worst album the only reason it sold so well was because people were curious to hear what she sounded like. After listening to Waiting for tonight I realize she will be shelved away as a one hit wonder, Her voice is so irritating and studio created that I can't really imagine anyone buying the album and saying it was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album this year","review":"Its not even her lack of class that offends me i think its more her lack of vocal talents and sincerity. She is attractive but i would kill myself if had her look not into it. But anyhow, this album is sooooo over-rated and the worst song is waiting for tonight, its so repetetive and its clearly a studio creation. go back to the bronx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality-exactly what I was looking for!","review":"It was a great price and excellent quality.

She should just stick to acting because she has no kind of singing talent. The only reason why I gave her two stars was because the duet she did with Marc Anthony is kind of catchy and Marc Anthony is truly a singer!! If you want my advice, buy Marc Anthony's cd better because in her songs all you'll hear is the sound of a screaming cat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad if you don't unwrap it","review":"If you feel compelled to purchase this album, you may want to heed this little tidbit of information: It isn't good. I admire Jennifer for having an interest in music. I also admire her for being really hot. But Jennifer, please save music for the musicians. You already have a job. It's called being a hot chick. The only excuse I can see for buying this CD is the cover picture. It's really nice. You can then use the disc as a coaster or a frisbee or something. Just keep the album away from any CD playing device and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did her voice get flattened by the 6?","review":"Ok so Jennifer Lopez is hot. That's all she has going for her. This girl can not sing a beat. She held together fairly well on \\"No Me Ames\\", a terrific duet with Marc Anthony. Only problem was, Marc had most of the singing parts. \\"Promise Me You'll Try\\" was a good song, but everyone else stunk. I'm not \\"Feelin' So Good\\", because it's \\"Too Late\\" to say no to this CD. If you respect music at all, record a few songs from a friend, and end it there! Save your ears the torture like so many of us have regrettably already done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor girl.","review":"How sad that Jennifer is being exploited for her name and her chunky body to sell CD's. God knows it's not for her terrible voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A CHICK","review":"I haven't heard the whole CD not even half of it but because she is such a chick I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep acting but stop singing","review":"If it were not for all the hype surrounding her so called \\"debut\\" album, this album would have failed completely. Her videos are completely full of herself posing like a seuctress in effort to boost sales of an album which cannot even boast musical talent. She sounds like any other person attempting to sing along with a radio song, maybe worse. It's a shame when latinos such as myself have to bash one of our own, but be real, if she wasn't attractive to look at there would be no album sales. (And this is one of the male listeners speaking) The music industry doesn't need another doll, let alone one with no vocal talent whatsoever. Don't quit the day job of acting, because your \\"music career\\" isn't worth hanging on to. Oh, and by the way, I wonder if the words \\"sell-out\\" mean anything to you....it's great to be Latin but not when certain folks use it solely to advance their \\"careers\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES SHE NEEDS WORK~!!","review":"i dont like this album but i'm going to give her credit for trying. i only like 2 SONGS OUT OF 14!!! if she makes another album i hope its MUCH better then this one.... she has the voice to become REALLY big like britney spears and christina aguilera but get some FASTER beats. her songs are mostly luv songs and there all slow pretty much. hope u do better Jeniffer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JLo 4eva, baby!","review":"This CD is a great debut for a talented singer. The songs get you moving and the ballads get you thinking. No matter what song, they all keep you singing. I cannot wait for her next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Latin Soul Singer","review":"First of all, to the negative reviewers who must of had cotton in their ears when they listened to Jenny sing you are truly mistaken because she can sing and the beats are great. If you are suspicious of her vocal ability just listen to the \\"No Me Ames\\" ballad version and you will see why she got the record deal! The mistake that people make is that they compare her and other artists to other supreme singers so that is why people may say she is not talented but just because someone is better at singing than her dosent mean she can't sing or dosent have talent. Other people are jealous of how beautiful she is and feel they have to degrade her to make themselves feel better. But if they would stop comparing every singer to Whitney or Mariah then there would'nt be all this hate! Well anyway she shines on all of her tracks lets face it if she couldn't sing no matter who she was she wouldnt get a record deal or be on heavy rotation on MTV no matter how much money she paid them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but to many remixes","review":"You see, I love Jennifer Lopez and all of her original songs, but her C.D. is just full of remixes! My favourite song is De No Ames with Marc anthony, but the remix is absoulutely horrible. It's good C.D. though, and buying it would be worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"CATCHY SONG BUT NO REAL VOICE TALENT!","review":"The song, \\"If you had....\\" is catchy, but it grows old and there is no real voice. She needs to stick to acting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with just acting chica!","review":"WOW did this cd suck! Hey jen you should really just act,singing is definetly not your thing.Hey maybe if she got singing lessons her cd would be worth actually buying!!!!!!!! SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Go GIrl","review":"I think Jennifer is a great actress singer and not so much of a good dancer but you go girl!!!! you keep on making us Boricua's look good keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"needs alot of work","review":"jennifer is sexy, jennifer can dance, jennifer can act but jennifer cannot sing. her music is very nice but she needs more coaching to compete with other divas in training out there like brandy monica and britteny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actress/Dancer, vocals very weak, machines helped some","review":"Jennifer, what were you thinking? I am a big fan of your acting and dancing talents, but you are not a singer!!! I respect your right to try, but give it up. I exchanged your CD, but I did like the video. Lose the blond hair, does not blend with your skin color. Stick to reds and brunettes."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAMITA IS FINE, BUT CAN'T SING!!!!!!!!!","review":"Jennifer Lopez is one of the most beautiful women in all the world, and I even think that she is a great actress. However, the best part of her album was the pictures. If it wasn't for Marc Anthony, this CD would probably be thrown in a box, to never be heard of again! I would rather have downloaded the pictures from her website, than pay $15 for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD That Gets Better Every Time You Listen","review":"This CD is, I think, best after you've listened to it a few times. I love Jennifer Lopez, but her voice isn't that distinct. (It isn't bad though.) And most of the songs are pretty generic. The biggest standout is \\"If You Had My Love,\\" a really great, catchy song. I also really like \\"Let's Get Loud\\" and \\"Waiting for Tonight.\\" Most of her songs have a nice beat...the only song I don't like is \\"No Me Ames,\\" which for some reason is on the CD twice. Overall, it's worth the purchase. To take words from 'Feelin' So Good\\": Jenny, you da bomb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great, Sounds Real Good","review":"Jennifer has one of the sweetest faces and voices on film and now on record too. The songs are catchy and refreshing at the same time. Many instant hits for people into dance and pop and looking for something a bit unique with the sophisticated Latin influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milli Vanilli's real voices are better","review":"The first single off the album is catchy and the chorus is good but she didn't write it nor is she singing the chorus. Her voice is awful the worst voice I've ever heard. It just goes to show that anyone can make an album if you have the right connections and people writing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actress,Great dancer, Mediocre singer","review":"Even backgroud vocal is better than her voice. Her first single is actually \\"the boy is mine part 2\\" and it should be better to sing by Brandy. All ballad songs in this album are lame except duet with Marc Anthony. Her voice is quite the same as Lisa Lisa & cult jam or Expose' with now out-of- date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actress, not a great singer.","review":"I think Jennifer Lopez is a talented actress and dancer, but I don't think she has much of a singing voice. The best song on her CD is \\"No Me Ames\\", and that's thanks to Marc Anthony. Her voice isn't anything special and she can't even hold a note for long. She should just stick to acting and save her singing for when she's in the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"I personally didn't like the cd. I like mostly pop music but also some hard rock and latin. In the CD it seems like she is trying to be someone who has done this for years and knows a ton but Jennifer admit it you don't know what you are doing. I f you are thinking of buying this Cd, don't, it will be a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not worth your money...","review":"Look, it seems as if most of the people that have given her five stars are just big fans of the person.. Rate her for her musical talents and not her as a person. Disregard the fact that she is so popular and nice or whatever else you all think about her, and think about her music. It sucks (with the exception of that duet with Mark Anthony), and I think she should stick to acting and dancing. She has no creative drive in terms of lyrics (I'm not sure she even wrote them), and her voice is just kind of annoying (it seems like she's trying too hard). I am hispanic and from the Bronx and take the 6 train every once in a while (Really!), I'm not lying about this, so if anyone should be proud of her it should be me, and I am extremely happy for her success. But if you want good quality music, try listening to Julio Iglesias, the smiths, the cure, depeche mode, and U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A male perspective","review":"Obviously everyone giving out five stars here is either pre-pubescent or male. So here's another male perspective. ROTTEN in GOTHAM! This girl doesn't need fans - she's already madly in love with herself. You want to hear real talent? Try Estefan, Tanon, Hawkins, Jackson, Madonna. You think she can act? Try Streep, Paltrow, MacLaine, Sarandon. This girl ain't even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"singing lessons recomended","review":"she is not a bad singer the only reason she got to sing is because of her body and she screams in lets get loud she is a fair actress the only time her voice really sounds good is when she sings in spanish so jennifer sing in spanish or take singing lesson if your going to sing in english"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Who the hell is this chic anyway. This album is horrible \\"If you had my love\\" is a good track but in Jennifer's case it could have been sung by a real artist. She really wants to blow. She should stick to trying to be an actor. i saw her on Letterman and i almost had a heart attack after hearing her. She sounds terrible. Jennifer, not everyone can sing baby. And she got nerve to diss other people in the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my money","review":"This CD is so bad that I was tempted to throw it away, despite the 15 bucks I had just spent on it. It is a horrible CD and there is nothing else to say. Besides she's hot and IF YOU HAD MY LOVE is good. but other than that the CD is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think We've found the 6th Spice Girl Fluzy Spice","review":"I respect, i mean i used to respect Jennifer as an actress, she was one of my favorites in fact, but in the last year she has lost it... this album is very weak, little to catch the audience... like the spice girls she can not sing... to me a good singer has to be able to carry his or herself live... so i have dubbed her the 6th spice girl, Jennifer should not have quit her day job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or Money!","review":"Like most males, we were attracted to Jennifer Lopez's album by her sexy body and her so-so acting ability. Unfortunately, her singing ability falls short of any type of talent. The CD is full of boring,sappy love songs that Jennifer fails to communicate to her audience. The rest of her songs such as \\"Let's get Loud \\" and \\"it's not that serious \\" are just bad songs to begin with. \\" Let's get Loud\\" is a horrible interpetation on spanish music and would probably sound better sung by Gloria Esfain(sp).\\"No me ames\\" happens to be the better the song on the CD, thanks to Marc Anthony who carries the song so much passion that Jennifer fails to do. I know most of you will probably dismiss this review, but the truth is the truth: Jennifer Lopez just can't sing! I really tried to like this album, but Jennifer lack of talent and songwriting skills ruined it for me. Sorry, Jennifer! Stick to acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"?!","review":"Sinse when can J. Lo sing? Come on, all she does good is dancing and some of the movies she played in, she has no voice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much engineering; not enough singing","review":"This CD had potential...she's got a great pop voice, and, of course, a diva presence. On first listen, I felt as if I could really, really like this disc. But the more I listened to it, the more bored I got. The slow songs are feelingless; the fast songs are great for dancing or working out, but it seems as if she's relied too much on what they can do to enchnace her sound & not enough upon her own talent. Her delivery is young & inexperienced, I think she will get better, but this offering's biggest offering is its potential that she will be the diva the media hype has created her to be in the future. The girl can sing ~ just not yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice is very weak!","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a very beautiful talented ACTRESS! This feeble attempt at pop stardom is a laugh at best. I have tried to like it, geez I have tried. Her voice is so weak and mild, even the best of electronic engineering cannot save the performance. Sure she can shake and shimmy with the best of them in her seductive videos. Videos call heavily on the \\"acting\\" element, something she is a pro at. My advice, save your money, watch the videos on MTV. She's got a bright acting career ahead of her, the music is a pipe dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, It's not the worst","review":"On the first listen of this cd all I could think of is that this was one of the most boring cds ever. There are a few bright, upbeat moments. I really like \\"No Ames\\" with Marc Anthony because I love the spanish language, and \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" is okay. The rest is very dull and it doesn't seem that Jennifer's voice has a very large range. It seems that she sings the same five notes over and over except in those two songs. I will give her credit; it is not the worst cd I have ever heard and if I had to, I would listen to it if I was without any other cd rather than listening to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR","review":"I should have known better than to buy this CD everyone told me it was going to be a studio creation, and I did not listen! well i am telling you DONT BUY IT! its really bad , I feel emabarrased for her thats how silly the lyrics are. anyway I am turned off I liked her in \\"Out of Sight\\" but now i think shes trying to jump on some latino bandwagon. ok back to the point, THE CD is bad, lyrics are dopey, and her voice is hard to tell because its a lot of stdio stuff and she has never sung live so i think that says something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to acting","review":"I'm sorry, Jennifer cant sing worth a darn. The only reason why she has a record deal is because of who she is. I cant believe how bad she sings. I cant believe people are actually buying her album. I love Jennifer, and love her as an actress, but she needs to put down the mic. I guess she has been hanging around Puff Daddy to long, because he thinks he can rap, and she thinks she can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenny... Jenny... Jenny...","review":"Who told you this would work? It amazes me how overexposure will sell anything. Put your clothes back on, sit at the piano, and SING darling... and watch how this won't sell.

You sold out and you obviously have forgotten where you come from. You'll make a few bucks on this - show enough flesh and everything sells. But when everything starts to sag, talent is what will carry you through. So save your money and invest it well... the gravy train won't last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Studio Creation...","review":"I guess anyone can get a record deal if they bang Tommy Mottola.

She flipped back and forth mid-lyric. Please, go back to movies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!!","review":"When I first heard that Jennifer Lopez was going to have an album, I thought she would never make it because I heard she had a bad singing voice. She proved me wrong with \\"If you had had my love\\", and with \\"No Me Ames\\". Though I think Selena had a better voice, Jennifer's is not to bad! Her cd is ok, but she need to work on making the other songs on her album good, like \\"if you had my love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","review":"I THINK THAT JENNIFER LOPEZ HAS THE TALENT TO SING BUT IN REALITY HER VOICE NEEDS MORE DEEPNESS, IT FEELS AS IF A 16 YEAR OLD IS SINGING THIS. SHE CAN DANCE BUT INSTEAD OF BEING LOOKED AS A SEX SYMBOL SHE CAN PORTRAY A BETTER IMAGE. SHE NEEDS TO START VALUING HER INSIDE IMAGE THAN HER OUTSIDE. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TWO PERSONALITIES, WHICH SUCKS. BUT, IN THE OTHER SIDE SHE CAN ACT AND MOSTLY SING, SHE JUST NEEDS TO WORRY LESS ON HER PHYSIQUE. HER ALBUM IS OK"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated!","review":"Before I even bought this CD, I had downloaded \\"If you Had My Love\\", from the net, and burned the mp3 onto a recordable-CD.

ON THE 6 is a good example of that. With smash hits like \\"if you had my love\\" and \\"waiting for tonight\\", ON THE 6 is a great debut. Besides the smash singles, songs like \\"should've never\\", \\"no me ames\\", \\"promise me you'll try\\" and \\"talk about us\\" are great ballads. Even though Jennifer's range was limited it turned out well. Overall I enjoyed ON THE 6. It's a great mix of ballads, hot dance numbers, and R&B/latin influences. At first I thought that Jennifer wouldn't go far with her singing career but ON THE 6 proves that she's got what it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"...what else can you expect from \\"Puffy Daddy's\\" girlfriend?","review":"Today was one of the most horrendous days in my life, because I went to visit the dentist and his assistant played the hole CD while I was being treated for a cavity. What's wrong with this woman? Isn't she happy with its actress career? How can she dare to sing with such a \\"voice\\"?...and she sold a couple million copies out of this album! She doesn't even have a defined style, she tries with RnB, salsa, latin, house...and she fais, fails, and fails. This is nothing but an another commercial product on the streets, another piece of .... ready to hurt our delicate taste for the good music. Ms. Lopez, not only you have a severe lack of talent to be a good actress...you can't sing either! So please...GET A LIFE! ... and don't fake da funk! Peace. Sergio ROLLERFUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of the Jennifer Lopez craze, already!","review":"Sheesh! This girl, great as an actress, has insured her whole body for a billion dollars, and she wanna show off her behind to men. Also, she wants to draw pre-teens and teenage girls alike onto HER side instead onto God's side. And the great Puerto Rican crooner Marc Anthony's not helping anything. I will exclude \\"If You Had My Love\\" from all this, though, but its video is too fresh. The song should have gone, \\"If I had a voice and I turned away from sin, would God comfort me?\\"Bottom line: buy this album at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. I'd seen Jennifer's obvious talents in dancing and acting and thought that this CD would be worth a listen. Was I wrong!

Stick to what you know, Jennifer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 5 Stars","review":"I'm not a 'Spice Girl' fan, but their song 'Spice Up Your Life' is more latino than what she did with this album and better.

I wonder if her voice on that demo was as studio-enhanced as on this, her first album. I guess good looks will get you to high places. What saves this album, are its special guest artists. If not for that, this was an over-hyped debut. I didn't buy this CD, it was a gift. But man, would I have been pretty upset. I think someone nailed it right on the head earlier-Where is her voice? still On the 6?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Sorry, but lets face it she's an actress not a singer.

Stick to the acting buisiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but not overrated!","review":"I see a lot of dissing of Jennifer here, with the term 'overrated' used often. This is simply untrue--she was presented as a hotty who could sing a little, not as the new Whitney or Mariah. And although her voice IS pretty weak, she is better-looking than a lot of other singers out there! (Whitney and Mariah excepted, of course-- hey that booty is a little oversized) So, if you want a nice-looking cd cover to stare at, look no further!

These songs just don't have the \\"hit\\" quality needed to compete (or stand shoulder to shoulder) with the caliber of female vocalists/performers out there. She sings with little conviction. I can bearly make out her voice in some of the tracks and the music seemed monotonous at times. Maybe next time Jennifer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Hit Wonder","review":"Jennifer Lopez is another one-hit wonder for the glitz-n-glamour but no substance 90's. On this so-called \\"latin jazz\\" or some crap like that album, there are only 2 good songs: the infectious hit single \\"If You Had My Love,\\" a rich R&B-salsa song and the slightly above-average \\"Let's Get Loud.\\" The rest is mindless, horrible filler. Buy the single, not the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This CD is pretty week. She sounds like a gloria estefan/selena wanna be. the words and rythmes of her songs are kind of lame and i was completly dissappointed. Atleast she has her gorgeous looks to fall back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER ACTOR DECIDES THAT SHE CAN SING","review":"THE STATE OF MUSIC IN AMERICA IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST LOPEZ,BUT THEIR ARE SO MANY OTHER TALANTED LATIN MUSICIANS OUT THEIR THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND ARE STILL UNKNOWN. IF IT WAS NOT FOR HERE PRETTY FACE AND BODY SHE WOULD BE UNHEARD OF. PLEASE STICK TO BEING AN ACTOR. GIVE THE REAL MUSICANS A CHANCE.BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL BUY WHATEVER THEY HERE ON THE RADIO. SO I GUESS IT REALLY IS THE BIG RECORD LABLES FAULT FOR PUTTING STUFF LIKE THIS OUT.I HOPE ONE DAY WE WILL GET BACK TO PROMOTING GOOD MUSIC INSTEAD OF A PRETTY FACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LOAD!","review":"J.L. was \\"put-on\\" for only obvious reasons which I don't need to get into. Yes, she is beautiful, but the girl plain and simply CANNOT SING!!!!!(though she can dance) The first time I heard her single on the radio I just started cracking up. The first thing she said was \\"I won't take you cheating on me\\" and you must agree when I say \\"SPARE ME...PLAYED OUT, NEXT SUBJECT!!\\" Last but not least she needs to come off it when she says she's been singing since she was little...Okay, maybe she has, but somebody lied to her when they said it was good!! P.S.The 2 stars is for the beats, not her so-called talent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"Obviously Jennifer has a marketing machine supporting her. There is no doubt that she is going to be one of the next graduating classes of divas because of the kind of backing that she has. I like her music but I agree with other reviews that she needs a little instruction on how to use her instrument(her voice). If she chooses to stick with a music career there is no doubt that she will learn how to better use her voice. Ciria is a good example of a Latin artist with an excellent voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be pragmatic here","review":"OK. First of all. People here are giving reviews for the wrong reasons. Like, hey she's Puerto Rican, so am I..I think I'll give her 5 stars, or hey, she's really pretty..I give her 5 stars. Let's be real here. It has nothing to do with so called \\"playa hating\\" If she was fat, ugly, and had that same exact voice, people would say she sucked! She has NO TALENT IN THE VOCAL DEPARTMENT. If anyone wants to hear real talent, check out Whitney Houston's CD! And as far as comparing her to Madonna....give me a break! Madonna is Madonna, and she can get away with not having the greatest voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Do I Begin.....","review":"Now, as most of you may know, lots of actors and actresses sometimes record an album, once and a while, all of them, with the exception of John Travolta, and this new \\"Gimmick\\", have proven to be wery of their decision. Now, the CD comes off on a good note, with the jammin' \\"If You Had My Love\\" which is probably going to be this summer's theme, then we go downhill, at 140 km/hr. from there. Congratulations Jennifer Lopez, you have shown us yet ANOTHER reason on why your an actress. Stick to it (the acting!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very emotional and thoughtful!","review":"I thought that Jennifer Lopez was very emotional. She deeply express her feelings into all her songs. Although I'm not Latino, I feel that she is a great influence to all Latino's in the world. The main song that I was feelings was \\" Should've Never\\". I thought the song was beautiful! It reminds me of the past relationships I been in! I also think every movie she played in was great. I think Jennifer Lopez deserve support, because she struggle to become what she is now. I admire her because she teaches all that you should never stop trying to become what you want to be! I thank you Jennifer! Because I'm working on my singing skills and I'm writing! To everyone, stop hating on her! She's just a Latino woman who is trying to do her thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"J-LO can't sing!!!!","review":"She should stick to acting!!!! Who told her she could sing??? This album is a joke!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is not good at all!","review":"The only song I liked on the cd was No Me Ames. Don't buy this cd.I borrowed it.Iam glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful Looks with a Beautiful Voice","review":"Jennifer finally found my soft spot! Her voice is so amazing! Her acting and singing are the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to find talent????? PLEASE!!","review":"First I would like to start off saying that Jennifer is very beautiful but she should stick to acting. I heard some songs on the radio and some on the net and can we say no skills. Her voice is basically computerized everytime she tried to hit a high pitch and she sucks. The only reason I gave her two stars is because of the song she does with Marc Anthony which I have to admit is quite catchy. If you want my advice get Marc Anthony's cd instead Now there's real talent. But if you still have your doubt go on... buy the album you'll see she sounds like a screming cat!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline, and Barely Worth the Bother.","review":"Middling debut album with only a few tracks worth the bother. \\"If You Had My Love\\" is a pleasant tune from Rodney Jerkins and \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" is a highly energetic disco stomper that makes the best use of Lopez's barely-there voice. It's pretty much downhill from there. \\"Let's Talk About Us\\" is Babyface redux and \\"Let's Get Loud\\" sounds forced. And, please, should she ever feel the need to do a duet, don't let it be with someone as vocally talented as Marc Anthony. Anthony's powerful voice only dwarfs Lopez's and, thusly, does far more harm than good. This record may have been a million seller, but credit that to her image and attitude. The music on this album, though not disastrous, is merely an afterthought."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for the 2 stars.","review":"\\"If You Had My Love\\" is a groovy, top notch, dance track. Very impressive lead single. The composition grabs you and won't let go. The production isn't tired and the vocal is just right and crisp. The ONLY drawback to this track is that I would have preferred the coda / intermission instrumentation on the LP (only heard in the video).\\"Waiting For Tonight\\" isn't as strong as IFHML, but this song does drive you to the dancefloor and is great ear candy.2 stars. The other tracks are horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album from Jennifer Lopez!","review":"This album was obviously her best one IMO. I like every song on the album, except for like three of them (#6,10,&12). It's a R&B/Latin CD. I didn't give the album 5 stars though because I really don't think she's a good singer. Her backup singers are awesome and they make the album very listenable. The duet No Me Ames with Marc Anthony was a standout song on the CD, for him. He really outshines J.Lo. This man is truly a gifted singer, she's manufactured. I think this is why she loves Marc, because he has something that she doesn't have...singing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"what ?","review":"The only good song on this cd is waiting for tonight. Other than that, don't bother getting this album, She really CAN'T sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Debut is Lacking","review":"Jennifer Lopez burst onto the music scene in 1999, right in time for the summer. Her debut single \\"If You Had My Love\\" was just burnin up the chart. I thought why not check out her album. Sadly I was disapointed, this album has strong moments but overall falls flat in the end. The highlight is definately \\"Waiting For Tonight\\", the album's second single, however Hex's Momentous Radio Mix of this song is much better than the original version. Other winners include the upbeat \\"Lets Get Loud\\" and the R&B tinged \\"Feelin So Good\\". The rest of the album is weighed down by boring ballads which don't suit her voice very well, the only good ballads are \\"Talk About Us\\" and \\"Should've Never\\". Overall a very bland album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"This is an impressive debut. I've found it to be really enjoyable. It's the kind of album you can listen to repetitively and it still sounds fresh. The singles \\"If You Had My Love,\\" & \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" are great. Some other hightlights include: \\"No Me Ames\\" a nice duet with Marc Anthony, \\"Feelin' So Good,\\" and the pretty ballad \\"Should've Never.\\" I find it hard to understand why the majority of reviewers are criticizing her singing and making derogatory comments about her character. I don't share their sentiments. If you like hip, savvy, upbeat music, On The 6 has it. It's highly recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's A Much Better Actress!!!!!","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a great actress and I loved her in \\"Anaconda.\\" Unfortunately, acting is where her talent stops, atleast in the entertainment business. I don't like her music, and I don't see how she's so successful now. Maybe it's because of her career as an actress? She definitely should keep her acting job, because she's just not cut out to be a singer. However, as long as she's climbing the charts and making money, maybe she should continue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try but I won't buy","review":"I didn't like this album at all and wouldn't consider wasting any money on it I like R&b but did not find anything likable about this album, I think this album is about as good as the movie Selena, which isin't saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer, honey, stick to acting!","review":"I'm sorry but that song \\"If you had my love\\" was way to long and boring. If she wants to dance she should go to Broadway and if she wants a shower she needs to go home. The video basically said the same thing the song did. . . nothing. In the song she said the same thing over and over! It got old fast. I think she's gonna be a one hit wonder. To be on the safe side she needs to stick with acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Equal To Ricky Martin","review":"I was kinda \\"iffy\\" about buying Jennifer Lopez's c.d. , but after listening to it , I think it's pretty good . She made a good blend of latin , jazz , and R&B . Much like her male counter part in Latin America ( Ricky Martin ) , she grips with meaningful songs , that make you want to dance , without being stereo-typical , and using say only salsa beats , and instead explores . I'm now very happy I bought it and would recommend it to people who like latin and R&B . Long Live Jennifer ( * And to those who think I was sold on sex appeal , I was not , I'm an 18 yr old female * )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My, what happened here!?!? Basura, basura, basura!","review":"She cant sing worth her life. First of all I wont take you cheating on meeeaeasuughhhhhh! Can not hit anything, her live performances are horrible.

What bothers me the most is why she had to lip-synch over Selena's voice on that movie she sings great and she's so hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible C.D.!","review":"I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez! Her music is awful! This C.D. is awful! Don't buy it; it is a waste of money!Also, I hate Jennifer Lopez as a person. She grew up poor, yet she never gives any aid to poor people. She doesn't care about anything but money.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"hello! would someone please keep this woman from singing! do not buy this cd, the songs are so cheesey and the singing is so awful. jennifer can't hold a note, has no range. every song is sung in the same monotone key. but the worst part is when she tries to hit a high note.....my dog sounds better than her. in the future i won't buy anymore of her cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money..","review":"It's not worth it. I for one, don't like Jennifer Lopez, not even her acting. That's another story. I though I'd give her a chance and listened to it..The beats on SOME songs are not bad.

DON\\"T WASTE YOUR $"},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever.......","review":"she can sing? nah...i've heard better. she really does try and i give her credit but she doesn't carry the vocals well at all...the only two songs that are really ok to listen to is \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" and \\"If You Had My Love\\" which ironically is the only 2 that plays over and over and over on the radio to the point you can actually say her songs are not the best. I don't think she did well as an actress (except selena, she did a great job there)either now not the singing department. It's like she's trying too hard guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"On this album, Jennifer is wonderful. I love the beats, and her voice sounds great.

This is over-processed garbage that's sucking the soul out of music, literally as I sit here and write.There are much better singers and songwriters than the camera-loving J-Lo, you just have to search them out.

Being hispanic myself, I recognize that and support her acting. Even though since she did \\"Selena\\" her ego went straight through the roof!! As far as singing goes, she should think twice and stop now before she humiliates herself. As I recall in an interview where she criticized several actresses, including the even more talented Salma Hayek. She said that they were no good and should not spit on her profession. I think someone should stand up and tell her not to do the same (not spit on their profession, singing) By the way who taught her those awful steps she dances on the video \\"If you had my love\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer please stick to acting!!!!!!","review":"I like Jennifer Lopez and always have, hey, she's from the Bronx, took the 6 train, and she's boricua(Nuyorican), (Just like me). But just because of this doesn't mean I'll support her voice. There's just one word for her singing skills:HORRIBLE!! Jennifer please, you're a good actress, and you can dance, but you just can't sing. The only good song on her cd is \\"NO ME AMES\\". And that's because Marc Anthony is in it: Now that's a talented man. His voice is beautiful and truly passionate. My advice? Buy all 3 of his cd's plus the English one coming out in August. He's worth it. For what I see, once you're in the industry you have a much greater chance of moving professions, but no matter how many connections you have, voices like Jennifer Lopez' should not be heard over the radio. La India, Olga Tanon, Celia Cruz, Gloria Estefan, and Ednita Nazario now those are truly talented women. Jennifer's just a wanna be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we really call this singing?","review":"I have no problem with Jennifer Lopez, but she needs to stick with acting. When I heard her first single I thought ,\\"STUDIO CREATION!!!\\" And I was proven RIGHT!I saw her perform live on the tonight show, OH MY GOODNESS, YUCK!! I was right if I was her I would be embaressed. See in the studio they were able to cover all the bad singing with that computerized stuff. But , they could't hide it when she sang live.SHE IS NO CELINE DION,OR MARIAH.Don't buy this album if you want to hear a real singer.The only reason why I gave it one star is because the producers did a good job on the music,it isn't there fault she couldn't sing the songs right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Act Girl!","review":"Either you CAN sing or you CANNOT sing...this girl CANNOT sing (even with all the reverb and audio airbrushing)....in a world with Gloria Estefan, etc...WHY would someone want to listen to this CD??? sorry jennifer....enjoy your movies though...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"I haven't had an opportunity to listen to the CD which is why I came to this page - now I am really wondering how good or bad her voice is being that none of the songs are listed to listen to. I saw her weak performance on Letterman and her lip-synched performance on the Blockbuster Awards - We all must remember how Madonna started out - she to used to lipsynch her performances and concerts but developed her voice - hopefully Jennifer will too - maybe then I will invest in a CD that shows her true vocal talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy the single","review":"Don't waste your money buying the whole CD. \\"If You had my Love\\" is a great song, so just buy it.

I havent seen her act on the lettermen show like many of others have but I could just imagine...it seems like her ego has skyrocketed and that she prefers to talk about others and then when she gets heat for it she retracts...the two songs i have heard \\"No Me Ames\\" and \\"If U Had My Love\\" are pretty good but the reason they are good isnt necessarily because of her musical talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm really happy that Jennifer got into singing.

Songs such as \\"If You Had My Love\\", \\"Let's Get Loud\\", \\"No Me Ames\\" and \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" will definitely put her on the map. This cd has something for everyone. Hopefully, her future recordings will continue to showcase Latin/Dance music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Jennifer...","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a smart girl and she knew that putting a yummy picture of her on the cover of the cd would certainly get people to buy it. Well that picture must have blinded many listeners to the music inside. Lopez may be a good actress, with a great body, she may even be smart, but a singer she is not. It's a catchy album, sure, but actually good? does she sing with actual talent? Nope. With all the backup singers, with the all-star producers, whenever Lopez is called upon to sing, she can barely stay on key much less add any personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good but needs work","review":"If any of you are considering purchasing this CD, I would like to establish some credentials and main reasons. The words and voice itself are terrible in certain areas with perpetual rhytms and ptch variations such as \\"Waiting For Tonite\\"....Her music is good and if she worried less about her body and in espanol her \\"moda y arreglo\\" Then her music would be great and less of a MTV song perfect for videos showing much. She should look into being an actress for not just regular movies. Great stuff Jennifer, you go girlfriend"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO VOICE","review":"I don't know who in the world told this chic that she could sing. This CD has a few catchy tunes but they would sound alot better in the voice of someone who could really sing. The duet with Marc Anthony \\"No me ames\\" was the only good song and only thanks to him. You don't even hear her voice in that song because Marc Anthony's is so powerful that it drowns her voice. Marc must really like her to have done her the favor. He should do her another favor and teach her how to sing. I like Jennifer, I think she is a representation of Latina women but she should really stick to acting because she cannot sing a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This album stinks, its very amateur and her lyrics are silly. she is very low class and you can tell from the lyrics in her song. Trust me dont buy it, b/c you will be sorry the only good song is \\"IYHML\\" and by now I am sure you have heard eough. basically I listened to the whole album and i give it 1 star, and warn you to save your money, especially since the best song on the CD is always on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"she looks good at least ok actresss","review":"it's a funny disc i couldn't stop laughing with her voice.let's see sony music actually put money behind this (no pun intended she looks good)and got these results?oh yeah i forgot Mariah,celine are on this label it makes sense over excess.i gotta believe JL is a tax write off cuz if she isn't then that label is in trouble.her movies are average but at least they are kinda bareable unlike this joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not too sure about this one.....","review":"I was really looking forward to this one, i was quite dissapointed. The songs 'If you had my love, 'Waiting for tonight' and 'Let's get loud' are good. But the rest of the album is basically furball love songs which you should be prepared to choke on, don't even buy this album even if you ADORE love songs, as these are BAD love songs. Just buy the singles instead, or tape it off someone who was unfortuanate enough to buy it. Actually there is two extra songs on the British version, 'baila' and 'Do you know where you're going to'. Baila was quite good but, BUT, the theme from mahogany was quite frankly slaughtered by Jennifer introducing latin instruments and whiny singing, euuuurrrgghhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did her \\"voice\\" get flattened by the 6?","review":"Jennifer Lopez should stick to the acting. This girl can not sing a beat. Sometimes she makes a half-hearted attempt to sound good, but usually not. The 3 singles are pretty good, but nothing really spectacular. The best song on here is \\"No Me Ames\\", the duet with Marc Anthony. Marc has the most singing in the song, but his tremendous voice sort of inspires Jennifer to turn in a good performance. The only other good song on the CD is \\"Promise Me You'll Try\\", a soft ballad that is pretty good. If she wants to act, let her. But she really needs to cut out the singing. If you want real music, try Britney, Marc Anthony, or Mandy Moore. They surely will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jennifer can't sing for peanuts . It's a waste of money buying her album and I'm so glad I only borrowed it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase the single and save yourself some money","review":"I loved the single \\"If You had my Love\\", but the rest of the CD is dissappointing. Ms. Lopez's voice has no range or power. Sometimes artists can compensate by having great material, a catchy beat or a great producer. Unfortunately On the 6 has none of the above going for it. Although \\"Let's Get Loud\\" was a decent effort. I was hoping for more - - maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor song choice emphasizes limited vocal range","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a very talented actress, but a talented singer she is not - at least, not on this album. You can hear inklings of talent hidden in her music, but the songs chosen for this album only emphasis her lack of range instead of helping it. The synthesized instruments are too high and all in the same range as her voice. It ends up making it quite clear how small her range is. More bass and contrasting arrangements would have gone a long way towards making her a more interesting singer.Most of the songs are uninspired and sound like watered down versions of other artists' songs. \\"It's Too Late\\" sounds eerily similar in stylings to Brandy's \\"Learn the Hard Way.\\" Lopez has several great songwriters on her album who sold her mediocre songs.Although she has a limited vocal range, it's easy to see that with better music and arrangements, Jennifer Lopez could create a really good album. Unfortunately, this album doesn't come anywhere close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try but better luck next time","review":"Two words: Studio Star. Its a real shame that anyone can cut an album these days with minimal singing skills. Not to downplay her acting talents but she is an entertainer and not a singer.

In fact, I once took a terrible sounding tape from a friend, remixed it and he sounded great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great CD, and it reminded me of Selena!!","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a symbol of Selena to me !!!

Now I'm hooked! The interface was easy to use. However, I didn't like the tray sorting system. If you're trigger happy with the mouse, your trays end up getting combined or dumped pretty easily. I ended up not using it. I was concerned that the exploration part would be kind of skimpy but was pleasantly surprised. There are more puzzles once you're inside the mansion as well as the mystery to solve. The graphics were very good. It was also neat to see the mansion from the inside and be able to identify features that you put together in the puzzle segment of the game. The attention to detail was great. I can't wait to do the Castle and Notre Dame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its the ADHD book of Design","review":"This book has plenty of great information in it. BUT, I refer to it as the ADHD book because it is all over the map. In the span of 4 pages it might hit on 12 different topics. The book is fine to pick up and read a page or two here and there, but as a textbook I find it is very difficult to teach from.

All of the songs are so great - hearty, bluesy, and unlike anything I've heard. Because of Jack Dupree, my daughter loves the blues - and this is the REAL blues, too. Not at all watered down, but the kind you'd find in under-the-pavement blues clubs in Savanah or New Orleans or Mississippi , the kind you have to know about to even begin to discover.

The plot turns are predictable, the film making without artistic merit. I heard good things about the book, but this film does not inspire me to buy it, since here we are told a thoroughly generic intercultural story, with no nuance and no true depth. I've never cared to write a review on amazon.com, but was appalled when I saw the high approval rating (99 reviewers, 4.5 stars) for this poor excuse of a movie. If you like good cinema, don't waste your time with this pap. It's laughable. (Oh, and my girlfriend groaned in disbelief too. There was, I must say, perhaps one upside: it's been a while since I've read Gogol.

They never achieved the commercial success they deserved. The Swansong label had signed a great band that had bad luck. This band was hard to deal with and they would self-destruct, and would keep on messing up. Their music and talent were wonderful though, and they rocked! This is one of my top 10 albums of all time. This to me is Pretty Things at their best, with Savage Eye following. The vocals and instrumentation are great. The Pretty Things are one British band that should not go unoticed in your cd collection. The Cd packaging on this 1974 release is also very good.A great cover for an album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and well researched","review":"Given the subject matter, it is no surprise that this book is very controversial.

Widman seems angry through out the book. He talks of people being racist, but some of his comments seem to be a bit prejediced toward people. The last thing that I thought was kind of ironic.

The tracking is a bit touchy especially at slow speeds doing small movements, as compared to Targus laser mouse. What irks me is the shape of the mouse. It is hourglass shaped, but the narrowest part is situated about 2/3 towards the rear of the mouse. When I try to hold the mouse towards the front where the buttons and the scroll wheel are, my grip gradually slides back to the narrowest part. The plastic is very, very slippery and hard to get a stationary grip like others with rubbery grip areas. Lastly, the laser eye is also situated towards the back of the mouse, which makes the cursor's movements \\"fishtail\\" when the mouse is operated by holding it towards the front. Very annoying. Unless you like to hold a slippery narrow mouse by its rear end, there may be other more ergonomically designed units worth considering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"I dont know what the other reviewers where talking about,this force pack doesnt require batteries. Its also a total peice of junk. The feedback is very weak, the light is annoying. Upon opening the device, I discovered that the feedback is being achived using one very simple motor/weight system, which explains the weak and jerky feedback. However, its possible to disconnect the stupid light, so I guess thats a plus. Don't waste your money on this product. I purcased it on clearance for $1.98 and I paid too much. Totally worthless.

I don't think I would have found the cathedrals quite so interesting if I had not done this puzzle. I recently just finished the platinum level but did have to go to Wrebbit site and and get the final clue to free Esmeralda. The puzzle clues change on every level.

It has been two weeks and I have not heard more from Wrebbit.Also, I found the use of the display to be very poor. I have an XGA screen, which I think is now pretty standard. The program used only a VGA (640 X 480) window in the middle of the screen. To compensate for the lack of screen real estate they have a complicated system of procedures to scroll the small window over the tabletop.

Changing a blade is a breeze due to some smart engineering. The fence is very nice. Quiet. Adequate power. Base is well-made. Dust collection works tolerably well. Handles smaller tasks beautifully.The only weakness I've found is that it cannot resaw 6\\"-wide boards well. 4\\", yes, but anything larger and the blade starts to wander. No amount of blade tensioning and/or adjusting can cure this for me.

Like everyone else, I received an ideal saw. The blade that came with it, like everyone else said, was not the best, but when I replaced that, all was well. That blade made be good for different applications (it is a narrow blade, perhaps 5/16ths or less, and so good for tight curves.) I got the riser block, but have not installed it yet, as I had some pressing jobs to finish first. All in all, I give it five stars. I'm happy and making lots of sawdust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw for the price","review":"I just assembled this saw with the riser block option. I have used it very little so far, so this review is just my first impression. It is a great saw! Many standard features on this saw are an extra expense on other saws costing much more. I paid just over $500 to get the saw, riser block, and 2 extra blades. The Jet and Delta versions of this are $650 without a riser, and they come with no fence and no miter gauge.It is a quiet running saw and it was not difficult to set up. The alignment is good and the adjustments are easy. The fit and finish are excellent. The table top is ground to perfection. The fence has an easy to read scale that is real easy to set up.I made one mistake when assembling the saw. I used the wrong set of threaded holes when I installed the fence, and it made the front fence rail too high. After I realized my mistake it was very easy to take it off and re-install using the proper holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality bandsaw--works great","review":"I bought the Grizzly G0555 14\\" Bandsaw, 6\\" riser block and resaw guide one month ago for the immediate purpose of resawing a 10\\" oak board to make a 10\\"x8\\"x3/8\\" lap board for a friend who uses a wheelchair. The saw and attachments arrived promptly (I picked up the 200# saw at the freight dock) without any damage. The saw took me about half a day to assemble and adjust, and it ran well when I plugged it in. I was skeptical that the included blade wouldn't saw that hard 10.5 inch oak board, however by feeding the piece slowly I resawed two separate boards very well. I've also used the saw to rip and cut curves on some picket fence boards. I had to adjust the blade tension once but that was not hard to do. I'm very happy with Grizzly and I appreciate feedback from other reviewers prompting me to decide on this particular saw. It seems to be a quality product for the price and I don't expect to ever have to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can pay more and get a lot less Bandsaw!!","review":"I will get the only negative thing out of the way first. There is an adjustable slider (round plastic disk with a bolt through it) that fits on the end of the fence. The manual said nothing about installing this. Didn't take much after looking at the detailed parts list to figure out what it was and where it went. That's it for the negative, everyting else was there and covered well in the manual. The best part is the bandsaw worked perfectly after following the setup instructions. By the way, it comes essentially assembled. The only thing you have to \\"assemble\\" is the stand. Even the blade is installed! First thing I have owned from Grizzly, but it won't be the last. I was so impressed with the bandsaw I just ordered the G1182Z jointer.

I guess it is not \\"in\\" to like the quality of the \\"lowest\\" priced items but boy Grizzly has them all beat on quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bandsaw","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I too could not decide which bandsaw to purchase. Wanted to upgrade from my 12\\", so looked at and read all reviews on bandsaws before choosing the Grizzly G0555. I can't believe Grizzly can sell this for $375 + shipping. After receiving the saw, it was better quality than the $800 saws I was looking at. I also bought the riser block for more resaw capability. Never used the blade that came with the saw. I opted to go ahead while assembling and put a Timber Wolf blade on. This saw is great. If you are thinking about a new saw, you won't go wrong on this one. Good job Grizzly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, but beware of blade tension","review":"I generally agree with all the other positive reviews here. Very good value bandsaw. I've had mine for about 2 years, with light use. I'm a weekend woodworker but occasionally resaw 8in+ maple and cherry. The riser block system works well. HOWEVER, I just read about proper blade tension being around 15K PSI. When I used a tension guide on my 3/8 in blade, and brought it up to tension, I managed to strip out the square nut that screws onto the tension rod. I spoke with Grizzly tech support (very friendly and competent) who didn't recommend using tension that high. Replacement parts came to around $30, so not too expensive of a lesson. Buyer beware, and save the high tension for a beefier bandsaw..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very happy with this saw","review":"I am a novice woodworker and after much research, decided to invest in this band saw. After using it for the past two months, I am very pleased with it's quiet operation, stability and overall quality. The aluminum fence is great and with minimal tuning, I got this baby up and running quickly. It is very heavy...I don't recommend trying to put it together by yourself. I've quickly determined that have a couple different sizes of blades is a must. I've been using Timberwolf blades with great success. Most importantly, as I have recently confirmed...buy the best quality you can afford...it'll make your experience much better if you're new to the craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"modest saw, mediocre price and poor customer service","review":"Recieved saw and upon assembly found that the riser block kit was missing the guide tube, rendering the saw unusable for my purposes. So far I've made 3 calls to Grizzly customer support, spoken with 5 different people and have yet to recieve any commitment from Grizzly on either sending me the missing part, or returning the unit as defective. The technician who said he would call me back never did, nor did the customer service rep who made the same promise. The one manager that I've spoken to suggested that my only recourse was to write an email to customer service, which has gone unanswered. My pre-purchase research had lead me to expect *much* better customer service than this, perhaps their standards have fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was my first band saw","review":"As a new wood worker I wanted to fill my garage with quality tools at a reasonable price. Grizzly seems to really fit the bill when it comes to this. I've had the g0555 for a little over a year now and I've enjoyed it so much that I purchased the 8\\" parallelogram jointer yesterday. The quality of the band saw is a lot higher than I expected for the price, and I was pleasantly surprised when I picked it up from the shipping depot. When I first used it I was impressed by the quietness, and the stability, but not the quality of cut. For a while I was a bit put off by how much drift I was getting in the blade. As soon as I changed the blade that came with the riser block kit for a higher quality blade, it was like using a new machine. The bottom line for this saw is that it is a fantastic value, but buy it along with a good quality blade and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great saw horrible shipping and customer service.","review":"While I love the saw, the shipping and customer service really set a poor foundation for the Grizzly name. When you pay for shipping one would expect it to be delivered to your door, not with Grizzly. You need to unload the package from the truck or opt for the warehouse pickup. Why would I opt for a warehouse pickup after paying +/-$80 for delivery. Add on an additional $30 to that and you can use the trucks lift gate to lower the item to the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought this saw after reading all the glowing reviews on the \\"ultimate\\" bandsaw, Grizzly G0555. What a joke. This saw comes from the factory with wheels out of line, with a blade the doesn't cut and a table that warps and fence that can't even be adjusted to within 1/64 of an inch. It vibrated so much that it almost \\"walked\\" around the shop. The 2 speeds are useless for my applications and the 3/4 hp motor on the Ridgid does a much better resawing job than the 1 HP on this turkey. The extension block is a nightmare to install and is really useless on wider lumber anyway. I returned this critter and just bit the bullet and bought the Jet. If you are a professional woodworker, I recommend that you pass on this saw. If you can't afford the Jet, buy the Ridgid. If the Ridgid doesn't meet your needs, it is an easy return at Home Depot. While it may be ok for the weekend wood butcher, It is no where near the quality of the Jet and no better that the $300 Ridgid."},{"rating":"1","title":"alignment","review":"the blade on this saw simply will not stay on. even after hours of set up to make sure the thing is balanced and all guide wheels are correct, the blade comes off, binds on even the easiest things to cut. had better luck cutting things above 1in thick with my $100 craftsmen bandsaw if that says anything. currently have some 3/4in mdf hanging off the side of the table because the blade bound on a stright line cut, popped off, blade reset and motor cant turn the wheels. the motor may be rated at 3/4hp but with the belt slipping constantly it makes that power useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Complete trash.","review":"I don't know where to begin with this piece of garbage. The wheel was bent when I got it, but unfortunately it took me near 2 years to find that out. Besides that, I've been on and off with tech support for 3 years trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with this thing as it still bows and twists when I resaw things.If I had the money and were looking to purchase this thing again, I'd use the money to start a fire...at least that would be somewhat useful. Now I have this piece of trash sitting in my garage, rarely ever used, and hope I can come up with the money needed for a high end bandsaw. I'll use this thing to cut plastic pipe and non-finish projects, but never, ever for something above the quality of oak.What a piece."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-1a89408e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/35.md","filePath":"glossary/35.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/35.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
