Written and directed by Argentine director Santiago Carlos Oves. Jaime has just lost his job. Now his wife wants him to tell his mother to leave the apartment she lives in so that they can sell it. So Jaime will spend more and more time with his mother, talking about her, about the past and about her new boy-friend who's 69 years old. I liked a lot this bittersweet comedy coming from Argentina. The performance of veteran actress China Zorrilla and EduardoSon of the BrideBlanco is gorgeous. As the topic of the film is universal, you'll surely appreciate two or three well-observed truths about our modern societies.

It is very much within the Latin idiom and will instantly be identifiable with countless millions of Spanish speakers, being as it is Argentinian cinema at its best. That is not to say by any means that others will not appreciate its delicacy and humour, since we all know about wise, understanding mothers and their overgrown\\"baby\\" sons, which this films so well explores.If you want to know exactly what it is about, you can read the Amazon synopsis.

The conversations are witty, intelligent and at times, quite bittersweet.I watched this movie with my own elderly mother (also a Latina) and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

The outside is a purplish-brown color, while the inside is a murky, dark green. The color is so far from what you see on screen that I suspect it's a different model bag entirely. The reason I bought this bag is because it's one of the few out there with a cotton cover both inside and out - but if you are buying this as a gift, beware that you won't be getting the cheerful red bag with a classic plaid lining, but instead something that looks like it's designed to blend in with the ground it's used on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Cambridge","review":"I had ordered this item online on Amazon as the price seemed appropriate but was surprised when the color did not match the one shown online.

The first time I tried to watch it I fell asleep so that tells you something there. I continued watching it and was utterly disappointed in the movie. All this movie has is some guy who looks like a cross between Jimmy Fallon and some other guy dragging through the movie looking through closets. He can't act and it seems as if he's just going through the paces. The best part of the movie was the first five minutes with the demise of his father. Don't even get me started on the CGI antagonist in the movie. It looked so fake. I was not scared at all. I would have rather the filmmakers cast a real person for the part. If there is anyone who wants to see this movie I highly recommend that you don't. Stay far, far, far away from this sorry excuse for a horror movie. Don't waste your time or money.

(No joke I yawned so much tears starting coming out it was THAT awefully dull.) I had a VERY hard time staying awake, and it totally relies on sudden loud noises to so-call scare you. Scare? Tell me what is so scary about this movie other than boring me to silly, bad script, bad acting, and a complete waste of time.

Unfortunately, good storytelling doesn't seem to fall into any of the aforementioned requisites, and it is in criminally short supply in BOOGEYMAN. Barry Watson, who is only slightly less charisma-free than former TV sibling Jessica Biel, plays a man still haunted by...darkness, or something in the dark, or someone in the dark--there is a point somewhere in there, but halfway through this lazy, suspense-free non-thriller, you're going to want to bolt and truly not want to know the whole point of this waste of filmmaking. Suffice it to say, the plot is a slight re-telling of that horror \\"classic\\" from a few years ago, DARKNESS FALLS, only about ten times less interesting--yes, a scary sheet flying around on a wire hanger was far scarier than anything here. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"Not as in scary, as in...horrible. Seriously, quite possibly...one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

They made you think this was going to be a scary, Nightmare on Elm Street type of flick but it's nothing like that. For one thing, you're never sure whether the hero, played very well by Barry Watson, is dreaming or imagining or whether the events are real. He keeps going into these rooms where he knows the boogeyman is waiting for him but does he even carry a weapon of some kind? Nooooooo. I couldn't tell whether his father was really captured by the boogeyman or whether this was a dream. This movie tries hard to be like \\"The Others\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense\\" but doesn't come anywhere close.

It will have you jumping a few times and asking a lot of questions, many that never are answered because that's just how it's written. It's not written to make any sense or have a great story, just to have some \\"make-you-jump-scenes.\\" Hollywood even hinted at it's terrible screenplay when they hid it from critics. The movie couldn't even get a quote from a newspaper or anybody for that matter for it's cover because it would ruin somebody's credibility.

What the hell was this movie? OK I got it. You saw Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" and you were inspired, but why imitate in such a degrading way elements from that masterpiece to create such a bad movie. Something exciting and original could have been used in \\"Boogeyman\\", and for a moment there I thought that there might be something intelligent coming out of this film.

First of all, it feels like you're watching 2 different movies in one. You go from one scene to another scene and then back to the first scene in a matter of like 2 minutes. Secondly, you never get a glimpse of the BOOGEYMAN. It would be nice for a moviegoer to at least see whoever it is you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie could have been much better.

The reviewer exclaims something along the lines of how it's the scariest movie he's ever seen. I can only conclude that the man who wrote this review has only ever watched reruns of Sesame Street, because this movie is the LEAST scary modern horror flick I have seen in a good long while. It's completely free of any sort of entertainment whatsoever. The characters aren't likeable, they're dumb. The plot is alternately mind-bogglingly stupid and confusing. Don't see this, rent something more effectively scary, like The Ring. Boogeyman is a giant waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie flawed","review":"At the start of the movie,the boogeyman looked as though it was going to be a good horror movie,but soon changed.This movie is more of a phycological thriller than a true horror movie,like the Grudge.All in all it was an enjoyable film with an interesting plot and set of characters.The story is about a man named Tim, who as a child of 8 saw his father taken by the boogeyman.Tim,now 23,is terrified of closets,small rooms,and tiny openings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should only get -0 stars!","review":"I thought about buying this movie but decided to rent it first.

Boring! Second, there is nothing scary about this film, only jumping! There is no gore, no zombie, no ghost, and no horror. Well at least I find the end very amusing and comical.

I wish that I hadn't gotten my hopes up to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie!","review":"Boogeyman was not a good movie. It was boring and the plot was driven down by trying to hard to be scary and romantic at the same time. I just feel that I wasted my time as this movie wasn't scary and its plot was-honestly I am not sure what the plot was!? I just feel this may be a good rent and who knows it may even be better. But for the movies as much as it cost even the cheap one I went to was not worth my four dollars. I don't even know how to explain this movie and to describe it because I was so bored I tended to not even watch it all. This is a clean drama like movie with no umph.

But, if the whole movie was as good as the first 20 mins, I would have easily given it 5 stars. But its not so wait for DVD for this one, but shut it off when the first 20 mins are over.

The previews of this film look great, as is the premise. Great concept and attention grabbing beginning, but beyond that, I was very disappointed with this film. Aside from the previews, I was encouraged that this film was from the producers of \\"The Grudge\\", which in itself was okay, but other than the first 30 minutes, you'll be disappointed with Boogeyman."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE EFFECTS!","review":"Ok, the plot was cool, the ideah was creepy. But the effects were so cheesy it looked like they were trying to make the monster as a cartoon. NOTHING LOOKED REAL! OMG PEOPLE IF YOU CANT DO GOOD EFFECTS DONT DO EM AT ALL!

Truly nothing happens in this movie after the first five minutes. The lead guy walks around teary-eyed and looking mysterious at half opened doors or ceiling tiles......and then.....nothing. Don't waste your time with this thing, if you want something that sets a pretty good eerie mood, get \\"Fear of the Dark\\" instead. It's shot on almost no budget, with no stars of any kind, but at least \\"Fear of the Dark\\" gives the viewer some kind of pay-off, and packs at least a minimal fright factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"TONS of missed potential......","review":"Boogeyman could have been a very scary film except that the director and producer wanted that all-important PG13 rating. This is killing the horror movie as an art form; Boogeyman is a clear case of shocks traded in for an imaginary audience who likes bloodless horror movies (like \\"The Ring\\").This movie sets up an interesting story, then does almost nothing with it. And the \\"surprise twist\\" in the film was a surprise only to the 5 year olds in the audience taken to this film by their baby-sitterless parents.I miss the old \\"Hellraiser\\" days when horror films strived for an \\"R\\" rating and wore it as a badge of honor. I hope Hollywood will start making films like that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows like I thought it would","review":"Let's start by saying I hate the sudden surge of all the pg-13 horror movies directed at making pre-pubescent girls jump (there is a reason the only good review on this site is from a kid). This movie actually manages to be less scary and make less sense than \\"The Grudge\\". The only scary moments in the movie are jump moments and not one of them made me jump, there is no tension or creepy parts in the movie at all. The last half-an-hour of the movie doesn't even make sense by horror standards. The only reason I'm not pissed that I saw it is because I saw it for free. The only entertainment that can be derived from this waste of celluloid, is that you can watch it with your buddies and make fun of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst horror movies I've seen","review":"I thought this movie was going to be good, but I don't see what was scary about it at all. It started out looking like it could be scary, but then it ended up being ridiculous. It didn't seem very believable to me that an adult man would still be afraid of the same things as when he was a child. The movie was very boring to me. There were too many scenes where nothing significant was happening. I only finished watching it because I thought it would be worth it to finally see the boogeyman later on in the movie, but I was even more diappointed when I saw it. The monster's CGI was too terrible for it to even be scary. The ending also wasn't very good and left too many unanswered questions. I would only recommend this movie to someone who likes one of the actors or actresses in it. If you want a good horror movie that's worth watching, this isn't it. Some better horror movies are \\"The Ring\\" or \\"The Sixth Sense.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The ONLY scary thing about this flick: the fact that I wasted money on it.","review":"This film might have been scary in 1994, but after seeing The Ring and The Grudge, this one is pretty tame. It's comparable to Darkness Falls, which was ultra-stupid. There were some pretty tense moments when it looked like something geuinely scary was going to happen, but all those moments ended in disappointment.Then you get to near the end, and the Boogeyman looks like one of those silly CGI zombies from Pirates of the Carribean.This flick had some somewhat creepy moments, but they seemed to be building up to something that never quite materialized.My advice: save your money. Go rent The Grudge or The Ring, because those films will scare you out of your mind. Leave this one alone. Wait for it to come out on video, then rent it-and make sure you're renting it from one of those \\"all you can rent for one monthly fee\\" services so that you're not actually wasting any money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"This movie just flat out sucked.

From there, it just got increasingly boring and increasingly cheesy. It's a decent story and it is at least somewhat spooky, but it is by no means a horror film. There are many boring lulls in the movie that will lose your attention quite easily. The boogeyman looks pretty freaky, when you finally see him, but only for the first few shots, that are CGI mixed with someone in actual makeup. When they switch to the CGI boogeyman alone, it just looks fake.This movie is disappointing. You will probably not be frightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOGEYMAN GARBAGE","review":"THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOVEVER.

This movie that I just wasted 88 minutes of my life on (which felt more like 2 1/2 hours) isn't worth a real review by me. I just didn't like seeing this movie having a 2 1/2 star rating.

(like the girl in the mental hospital - BM was watching her by lifting up a panel of drop ceiling - cool!)If so, was Tim around when all the other children were 'taken'?If not, why is Tim so sure he conquered the BM and that 'its over' and 'he won't be back'?As far as Tim's ability to travel from the motel to the house via the closets (like the BM) - what's up with that?Is this an ability of Tim due to his connection with the BM or was the BM just messing with him?Not worth watching after the first 5 mins - but those 5 were pretty cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE REAL BOOGEYMAN WAS THE DIRECTOR","review":"This movie can be compared to the scary things lurking on the floor of the movie theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinding Editing","review":"Creepy at first...Then begins the Headace Induced editing...My vision was blured for two hours after seeing this movie...My Eye Balls were Slam Dunked...Bounced..Spun Around...Back Handed..and visually assulted by the fast shifting editing...I hung in there waiting for the pay off, but even the end only a few minutes long was BAD..BAD..comic like C.G.I...and even that was sped up and even more Eye Damadging...and they lived happily ever after, the end...

It's not \\"House of the Dead\\" or \\"Alone in the Dark\\" bad, it's problem is that it's not doing ANYTHING even remotely interesting or inventive on any level. \\"Boogeyman\\" is just a clone of both \\"Wes Craven's 'They'\\" and \\"Darkness Falls.\\" Neither of which were really memorable for ... well ... much of anything. In fact I almost felt as if the opening scene when Tim's Dad was taken was almost LIFTED DIRECTLY from \\"Darkness Falls.\\"I could NEVER recommend buying a copy, but if you wanted to rent it you could do it without feeling robbed. For that matter, if you need a scary movie for someone a little younger, there's virtually no gore and I didn't notice any foul language. In that role maybe this has a little bit of value. Not much, mind you, but maybe a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and dragging","review":"The movie was way too slow. It didn't capture me at all, nor was it scary. It is always talking about how Watson is scared of the closet, and they were on it too much more than necessary. I found myself very bored. The movie finally picks up a bit in the final 10 minutes of the movie. That \\"climax\\" was way too \\"unclimaxy\\". Ends were not tied well.Don't waste your time and money. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've never been so confused by a horror movie. Why is there a Boogeyman? Why does the Boogeyman kill people? And how was the Boogeyman defeated in the end? The directing is SO BAD in this movie that in the final battle with Boogeyman the camera is all over the place and I haven't got the slightest clue as to what was happening. All the sudden the movie was over. No explanation as to how this guy defeats the Boogeyman or how he knew how to defeat him. And the Boogeyman looks terrible too. Very bad CGI work."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!","review":"This is a bad bad movie... nothing happens. It's not scary at all, it's ridiculous!!

I would give this movie zero stars, but darn that's not an option. I have rented this movie from Blockbuster (thankfully) hoping that I would get a good scare. After turning on the movie, I could barely keep my head from rolling all about. The beggning of the movie has the most suspence and action and thats only 5 minutes of the entire movie. For the rest of the snooz flick I kept fast forwarding and the only part i got a kick out of was when the crow smashed into the car window. It has been done before and the movie was very UNSUSPENSFUL and very BEEN THERE, DONE IT theme. The end of the movie couldn't come fast enough and the ending was bull**** anyways. If you think this movie deserves 5 stars because its soo scary then you must be the kind of person that pissed in their pants during Bambi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be!","review":"Not nearly as scary as the reviews claimed it was.

There were a couple of suspenseful (think the feeling you got when Michelle Pfieffer's hand comes out of the bath tub in \\"What Lies Beneath\\") moments.After the beginning, it's pretty much down hill from there. I thought it odd that only one person seemed to think that the main character, Tim (played by Barry Watson from \\"Seventh Heaven\\") needed mental help, yet no one suspected him in any of the disappearances.When Tim finally faces his fear, I was so glad. That meant the movie was over. I'm really glad that this was a rented movie and not something that I wasted more than 3 bucks on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Bad !!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you MUST rent this movie, just watch the first 5 minutes... that is all that is good about this movie.After that it falls to the level of typical cheese and B movie lameness. (not to mention the subtle attempts at mimmicking certain Hitchcock Psycho images).Everything else you read on here about how bad the movie is about sums it up.Although DARKNESS FALLS was not a GREAT movie either, it is basically the same identical theme and plot line but is better done and more worthy of renting over this dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i thought","review":"I thought this movie was going to be spectacular, judging by their fantastic website.

Boogeyman is just a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I would give it 1 star but I like Barry Watson too much to do that. It isn't what I expected it to be.

He goes back and finds it. Trouble is, it's never scary for us along the way. In fact, it's totally forgettable.A ton of scenes in half-lit rooms with shadowns moving about and things going swish in front of the camera can't do a thing to add aura or tension to this marshmallow of a film. The bad guy is not going down in film history as being very memorable, either.Forget this thing and move on to something else if you're looking for thrills, scares or emotional involvement with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Horror Films in the Last Decade","review":"This is in my opinion the worst example of a mainstream horror movie in the last ten years.There is almost no point to anything shown in this film. Much of this movie consists of just a bunch of random scenes of the main character opening closet doors while overusing cheap scare tactics such as loud shrieking sounds. When we finally get a chance to see this Boogeyman it is terribly done with a really bad cgi boogeyman. It comes off as corny and not in the least way scary. Forget the fact that there's no plot, there's barely any real scenario at all. The only thing close to a positive thing about this film is the fact that it does create a sense of atmosphere and also maybe that the film isn't really that long at only about 88 minutes. Overall a terrible film that is filled with bad horror cliches and little entertainment value. This film did however make enough money that two sequels were made. They however went straight to video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good cure for insomnia","review":"A young kid sees his father killed by the boogeyman. Years later he's in college and gets a message on his phone that his mother's health is failing. Could he come and visit her? He doesn't even bother responding to the message, it's much more important to him to go to a party with his girlfriend. Yeah, real sympathetic character. Then his mother dies and he surprisingly finds time to go to her funeral - what a guy! - and he's also inherited the house where he saw the boogeyman kill his father. So he wanders around the house for most of the movie. He's terrified of dark closets, so at one point he goes into a dark closet and they edit a whole bunch of shots together of him being in the closet, while dramatic music plays. Yawn. This crap goes on forever.Overall, it's a boring movie and I didn't care at all about the characters.

So it was a good idea to make a movie out of it. The previews on tv look somewhat interesting, but when it came to watching it, it was horrible, boring dumb, etc. The worst part is the ending.

No imagination at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply miserable","review":"In all seriousness, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Most crappy movies, I can look at and laugh at the worthlessness. This one was beyond that. There was about 5 minutes of action, and the rest was just a stupid storyline that made no sense. There was not a bit of horror in this movie. In some scenes they just moved the camera around, but literally nothing actually happened.

First of all, Barry Watson had NO chemistry with his rich-bitch girlfriend. I wanted her dead moments after meeting her. This wasn't scary at all. This was one of those flicks where the characters just continued to make very obvious bad choices which led to their demise. Rent Texas Chainsaw Remake where they stumble onto trouble and try to get away, as opposed to looking for trouble and doing nothing when it hits. Just plain bad.

And the ending had to have been the corniest ending possible, the sky is suddenly all blue and sunny...aww how sweet...pfft, the movie sucked all together and was the first one that I haven't really been scared of, well and Saw which my fearless friend was also terrified of and I wasn't.If you want a laugh, see Boogeyman...hahaha.I agree with the guy who said that the boogeyman looked like a homeless bag man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable","review":"The first five minutes are practically the same as Darkness Falls, except the Tooth Fairy had a reason to kill.

Those reviewers are clearly expecting (and looking forward to) yet another teen slasher movie. This isn't one of those. This is pure psychological horror, and done exceptionally well. No blood and guts, does not rely heavily on sound effects - this is a movie from someone who understood terror on a very fundamental level and put it in a movie.

At times the film showed promise as for example the hotel scene but it just whimpered out in the end. I kept hoping at least the lead actor would show some skin to compensate me for wasting my time.

My only assumption is that no one at Toshiba actually used it. The fast forward, advance, reverse, and enter keys are all at the bottom of the remote where you can't easily get to it with you hand. I constantly have to take it out of my hand and look at the remote to find which key I'm looking for. To me, I should be able to get to all of the important keys without having to look.

Jill Thompson's drawings of the chibi-Endless are cute and entertaining, but all the attempts at humor in the writing fall flat. Since the story is from Death's perspective, most of the compelling parts of Seasons of Mist as seen by Morpheus are left out, and they aren't replaced with anything compelling. The story is simply a bunch of repetitive fluff with no point except to give Thompson a vague structure in which to show off her art.

I once had the 1400 case in my backpack carrying a camcorder while riding a motorcycle. At about 120 miles per hour, the zipper on my backpack opened, and the case fell off the back of the bike. The case slid about 100 yards down the road, and had no more than a few scratches. The camcorder was completely unscathed. I'm still using my first case (I haven't even replaced the O-ring, which I don't recommend), and just ordered my third case. I'm currently using one to store two GoPro cameras and the various accessories for them. I couldn't imagine a better product for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: NO Foam included!","review":"Received this item today, and was surprised to find out it does not come with the foam insert - quite unlike what the picture shows.

A little off, but even so or because of it, the graphics aren't as good as MS AOE series and seems really dated.

Here are 11 of the Stones' best songs, as you have never heard them before. This cd is certainly a tribute to the melodic and lyrical genius of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and crew, but the impeccable London Symphony Orchestra and guest vocalists transform these catchy rock tunes into incredibly haunting and powerful musical sagas. The versions of \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" and \\"As Tears Go By\\" are really amazing and even tragic. \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" has an operatic feel to it. The child-like innocence of \\"Dandelion\\" is really quite entertaining. Considering the Stones were really a blues band at heart, one wouldn't think initially that their repertoire would translate well into a symphonic format. But it does. There is only one way to enjoy this rare musical treat-buy this cd now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"If you enjoy Classical versions of rock music, this is one that you must get.

I have to admit this film seemed a bit disjointed at times, and didn't really show much of a pattern with Bundy. It came across more like stories sewn together. Sometimes that is okay, but I think it took away from this movie. Maybe even random comes to mind. It didn't really reveal how sick Ted Bundy was, and it was hard to feel much emotion with the storyline being so choppy. Dealing with a depraved individual I wasn't expecting to see details of his murderous spree, I expected to see those eyes which leave no doubt about this man. Even looking into this case on the internet, you see those ruthless eyes that reveal his true character. This film failed to show the many facets which a serial killer can have. While the \\"other\\" film on Ted Bundy made me very angry at Mark Harmon, this one just left me scratching my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This was a DVD about Ann Rule not about Ted Bundy.We gain no new insight into what made this monster what he was.This is an embarrassment of a DVD and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"The MOST inaccurate version of the Ted Bundy story I have seen.","review":"Having worked on Death row with Ted, speaking with him in great detail and reading almost every book about him, this version of his story is the worst I have seen in terms of accuracy. It's like they not only did not try to present the facts of the Bundy case accurately, they seemed to have tried (and succeeded) to present the story as fictitiously as possible. Some of the court scenes were sort of accurate, but not many.

This marriage between the two is an unholy and dull attempt to recreate that post-goth, post-emo dance-y sound that kids with too much black eyeliner like. From start to finish, the Static Age create a layered atmospheric sound using synths, delayed guitars and modulated bass; however, nothing sticks out. Of the nine tracks on Neon Nights Electric Lives, two have been remixed. The AFI cult will eat this up since Jade Puget remixes one of the songs.

It is well written and the arguments for a goddess religion in Malta and the Orkney and Shetland islands is indeed convincing. The pictures are beautiful. That neolithic society was matrifocal and that the religious pantheon was dominated by female entities is, in my opinon, established beyond any reasonable doubt by authors like Mellaart, Gimbutas - and Cristina Biaggi!But one thing is quite disturbing in this book (at least in the edition i have). \\"BCE\\" is generally replaced with \\"BP\\" witout changing the numbers! It may be some computer mistake but the unitiated reader might for example get the impression that the neolithic culture at Malta existed between 1500 - 500 BCE - since the book claims it existed between 3500 - 2500 \\"BP\\".

I thought I was going to try this one as it involved ghosts. To be honest, I haven't finished the book yet, but in 172 pages, nothing has happened. The narrator and main character, Tarquin Blackwood tells his story to Lestat the Vampire about his family, hoping he can help with his haunt, Goblin, sometimes good, sometimes malicious. This sounds more like a biography of a fictional character rather than a ghost story. As much as I don't mind and understand that you have to introduce characters in order to understand what goes on in their mind, etc, 172 pages worth of this is just too much and I don't know how much longer I'll be able to read on. I'm highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the FLUFF?","review":"Wooose. Maybe I am partial to female protagonists, but why is this one so ambivalent and woose-like? Sure ends are tied up from the Talesmaca and the Mayfairs, but the rest is just fluff!!! The book could have been 20 pages and told the story. Seems more like Jackie Collins! Anne, I know you have voluptuous desires, but reeeeaaaly, the finesse that you have shown in the chronicles do not shine in this tell tale....please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but pretty good","review":"So this book wasn't the usual for Anne. She actually created a good little mystery here. I think the book would have been better if she'd left out the vampires altogether, and allowed the main character to remain human. I found him to be sultry but stupid. But then again, what 18 year old isn't stupid? There are alot of characters in this story, and that takes some paying attention to keep straight. This detracted somewhat from the story. Her descriptions are spot on as always, and she doesn't shy away from some pretty unusual erotic scenes in this one. For those who have already read this book, I found the shower scene to be a little disturbing, and even more so when Goblin's true identity is revealed! I mean Yuck! But yeah it's a good read, and will keep you entertained with all the plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh if there is a heaven, bring it down on me!","review":"I have been an avid fan of Anne Rice since the tender age of 14 when I discovered \\"Interview With the Vampire\\". But! This book drove me slowly crazy. It was too painfully dragged out. Lestat is such a main component in the chronicles and here, it just seems like he's a watcher, and Quinn, who is this new Vampire (shouldn't this belong then in the New Vampire Chronicles) and talks like a vampire of old. I don't know. It just didn't rub me the right way. Not like the first 5 or so. Don't get me wrong.

I find that Anne Rice hadn't at all lost her touch. I loved the southern style of life that Quinn lived. I think Aunt Queen was a wonderful character showing alot of love for Quinn in grand southern style. I never found the book boring nor do I critise the romance of Quinn with both male and female. Goblin was an added feature that I wouldn't have expected at all. What a book covering Blackwood, Mayfair Witches, Taltos, and Lestate all in one book. Anne went out with a big hit on her hands as far as I am concerned. Wish she were still writing these wonderful books of which I have read them all. Thank you Anne for bringing me such joy in reading your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"As far as this story goes I read it because a friend told me Lestat was in it. And being a long time fan of the Vampire Chronicle novels up too and including \\"Body Thief,\\" which is undoubtedly one of my most favorite. I found that yes indeed the brat prince is there.However I found our Lestat to be quite the disappointment when not presented in the first person. I also found the story to be uninteresting and written like a first draft which had not been checked over afterwards by the author. There was one page in particular I took note of where nearly every single sentence began with the same exact word. Something that gave it an extremely repetitive sound which I encountered time and again throughout.It was at about halfway through this book that I closed the cover, and have never picked it up since, having completely given up trying to get any enjoyment out of it at all.A sore disappointment indeed, wanted to give it no stars but apparently you have to give it one to post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some should drive a stake through her heart....","review":"And spare us so many pages of turgid prose, stilted dialogue, and by the number plotting.

I am an aved reader and long time lover of the Vampire Chronicles and really anthing that Anne Rice writes. I find her characters in the book amazing, Quin is amazing and his love afair with Mona is heart wrenching. I felt that although i loved this book a year or so is too long to wait to see what happens to Mona. This was one of the better V.C.'s of late and if you read Blood and Gold and were dissapointed as I was (my favorite characters were not in the book) you will not be dissapointed this time. I can not put into words my love of both the V.C and the Mayfair Witches and this combination adds an elimate to her books that I have not yet been experienced.

If I'm reading about vampires, I want my skin to cringe and hair to stand on end (also a little thirll doesn't hurt!). Quinn was a sniveliing, mealymouthed vampire - - I would not enjoy getting bitten by him. I want to read about vampires that I'd at least get a thrill out of dying for!

The book was mildly entertaining. I kept waiting for something good to happen. Ms. Rice almost did something cool here. She really could have, and if you've read the excerpt available here you know what I'm referring to. But in the end she took the easy way out, the same way her characters solve too many problems by throwing wads of cash around.Now that it's over I just keep fighting the urge to pick the book back up to see if there's something I missed. Some important key moment that didn't sink in. But I don't really believe that's possible, and the truth is that unlike many of Ms. Rice's earlier works, I'll probably never pick this book up again. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure I'm Dead, But I'm Rich!","review":"Used to be, Rice's books had narrative, thrills, and even some decent writing. Now, she is in thrall to a sort of materialistic version of porn, and a view of the South that - if it ever existed as she writes it (and I'm a Southerner) - died out 72 years ago. Am I the only one troubled that, when the narrator is grieving over the death of his dearest friend, he takes pains to mention that he rode to her funeral in the deceased's \\"luxurious limousine?\\" Welcome to \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Undead.\\" Oh, and by the way, the story is awful, and no character is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desparately Needs an Editor!","review":"Rambling, random collection of words and images without plot or point. In Rice's first three vampire novels, but particularly in \\"Interview...\\" one always had the impression that the story was going somewhere...that there was a definite point to the tale. Lately, and most particularly in \\"Blackwood Farm\\" one realizes that Ms. Rice is being paid by the word, not by the quality of the story. The character's motivations are incomprehensible, their actions random and where characterization exists at all the actions are dissonant with the character's previously stated motives.

As much as I hate to admit it, this book was simply dreadful! The first two chapters were promising, but then the next 3-400 pages plodded along like nails on a chalkboard.The characters were bland and uninspired, and plot dragged at a horribly slow pace. Even the short appearance of Lestat failed to help pick up the pace. Towards the end of the book, I was hoping Lestat would just kill the main character, Quinn, and put us all out of our misery!If you are a big enough fan of Anne Rice's work that you still feel the need to read this disaster, at least save yourself some money and buy it used, or wait for it to come out on paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book as the others?","review":"I thought Anne Rice couldn't get more sophomoric than she did with \\"Merrick\\" but I was wrong.\\"Blackwood Farm\\" is stiff, stilted, seeming more like the writing of a 12 year old adoring fan than Rice herself. The book bogs down in trivial minutiae while glimpses of tantalizing (not to say interesting) stories are ignored in the background. We learned too much about things nobody, not even the characters, cared about.\\"Blackwood Farm\\" really feels more like a book written to fill the wallet than to truly entertain Rice's readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans only","review":"This is the only Anne Rice novel I've read, and this books seems designed to carry the characters forward, but it is not a good story.

I found myself being bored by Quinn's excrutiating detail of his early life before being a vampire. And what happened to Lestat? He's not the same character anymore. He use to be so alluring and attractive. Now he's just annoying and over-done.

Why doesn't she get it that we don't care for the new characters (who gives a hoot of \\"Goblin and Quinn\\")that she constantly writes about(except Merrick, that was very good). All we care for are the vampires we came to love since the first few books! I want to hear about \\"Lestat\\" and his stories, \\"Louie's\\" adventures. I'm also tired of Anne not using an editor for her books. She has great ideas if only she would let someone edit her books as it was done in the past, then they would make more sense to read! Without one she just rambles and rambles on and on! Why let us read the Letter to \\"Lestat\\" in this story if \\"Quinn\\" will mention the same damn letter to \\"Lestat\\" AGAIN! She just repeats the words over and over, till you're mad! I really dreading her next book.

Great: he's in REHAB and Anne doesn't even know it! Ow, it hurts!O, Lestat, Lestat, Lestat. Do hope you enjoyed the countryside, so peaceful, so restful, so far from the cities, the rush of modern life and from that troublesome--and still pending, I remind you--SCIENCE problem. You know, the one you, Louis and David have all at one time or another wondered out loud about? \\"And what if some scientist had gotten hold of me... and I'd been incarcerated, inspected, identified and classified...to the satisfaction of the worst mortal skeptics worldwide,\\" wasn't it?

I was very pleasantly suprised to have enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed The Witching Hour. I have enjoyed each and every one of the Vampire Chronicles each with their own purpose.

As an avid reader, I must say that when it comes to turning the last page of one of Anne Rice novels, I can just barely bring myself to do it. She has such a profound way of snaring my attention and holding on until I can barely gasp for breath.To no such surprise she has done it agian. This book was great! I adore Tarquin and his honesty.

The Tale of this New Vampire Tarquin Blackwood is extra-ordinary in its twists. The fact that it made little reference or focus on the past characters makes it easy to understand even for new readers.I for one have never read of Rice's Mayfair witches but I was still able to comprehend the story.Tarquin Blackwood was the poor little rich boy who spent almost all of his life enclosed in his family estate 'Blackwood Farm' But his life was anything but uneventful. He have himself a constant spirit companion by the name of Goblin, he sees and talks to ghosts, and fell in love with a dying Mona Mayfair.I especially love the final conclusion on Goblin's true nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts of a little slow, but then it is captivating","review":"When I first started this book, I was a little worried, we meet Tarquin Blackwood who needs Lestat's help. We begin the full, long story of Quinn's family history(to which he is telling Lestat), which by the end of it I was ready for it to begin with the present time in the book. It then picks up full force (which is what we expect from Rice) it is captivating, once I reached this point in the book I couldn't put it down. When you come to the end, you go \\"No, it can't end like this\\" which to me is great, and exciting. Now I cannot wait to see what vampire chronicle book is released next. We also get the introduction of 2 vampires, who are very old in age, which makes me believe we may be seeing some of these characters in their own spinoff books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice - Blackwood Farm","review":"I loved Interview with a Vampire - one of the best vamp books ever written.

Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This is the first Anne Rice book I've ever read, although I have been familiar with the movies based on her works...and I came out of this book fascinated and amazed. While I was on chapter 10 I was a little weary of the nonstop back story, but the rest of the book had me mesmerized. GREAT ending, as well. I should have thought of it beforehand but instead it was a happy surprise to me.In response to another reviewer's post, I think Quinn is a very likeable character. His youthful innocence, shelteredness, pride, and strong family bonds were really captivating.I borrowed it from a friend and now I will definitely be getting my own copy. I already want to start it over, to reread the beginning now that I'm so familiar with all the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I didn't finish in quite some time","review":"If you're into homo-eroticism... then this book is for you. If you're not into homo-eroticism... then there are approximately 2.2 trillion more books out there that you would probably like better. They may not all be at your local book store, but they're probably worth searching for online rather than buying this off the shelf.

I must admit rightout that I had to read the first few chapters a couple of times as there was so much information here...For the record, I did this with The Witching Hour as well. However, reading the first few chapters a couple of times did not make a difference on my 5 star rating of this book. There is so much involved!! This book has my heart as do the Mayfairs. From family history, to a beloved hero, Quinn, to ghosts and shrouded mystery, this book had me glued to the end. This book, once again, took my breath away. There are multiple simultaneous plot twists and subjects in general to keep the reader so entirely focused on Quinn's world, they forget their own! Absolute must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice is back!","review":"I just finished Blackwood Farm and absolutely loved it. I have been a bit disappointed with some of her past works but she is back in full force! Her descriptions are rich and full of detail. I was thrilled with the addition of the Mayfair witches. My only complaint is that the ending seemed rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Work in a Long Time","review":"Anne Rice can be a great story-teller, and this is one the best stories she has written in a long time. She creates a new family, the Blackwoods, puts them on an estate in a Louisana swamp with ghosts and a spirit called Goblin, salts them with characters from her other works (the Mayfairs, Lestat, and the Talamasca), and just lets the story unfold. There are no metaphysical musings to get in the way here; just smoothly-flowing prose. My only gripe (and this is farily minor) was that I knew how the book was going to end well before I got there."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real","review":"even for Anne Rice, this one is bit over the top. the main character is foppish and ridiculous. trust me, rich 18 yr. old boys in south Louisana DO NOT sleep (as chaste bedfellows) with the family help. give me a break. some of the dialogue was utterly absurd. this is some sort of pathetic caricature of southern life.

I felt like I was being punished for deciding to finish the damned thing once I started it. The text and dialogue were repetitive to the point of irritation and the characters were flat. Must every line of the book be so melodramatic - it makes the parts of the book that might be exiciting rather anticlimactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Installment","review":"Blackwood Farm was disappointing not because the plot was uniteresting but because the writing was so poor. As with so many of her books since The Queen of the Damned, Rice seems to have had no editor--no one to polish her writing. Where her writing used include exquisite descriptions, now it is overly flowery as if her writing has become an exaggeration of itself. It makes one wonder if she is really writing the books herself anymore. I found Lestat's repeated use of the nickname \\"little brother\\" annoying in its frequency as well as somewhat contradictory to his character. Quinn was almost too sensitive and melodramatic a creature to believe in or like. I believe it was curiostity, and not a love of the characters, that made me finish the book. The story line itself is interesting, its too bad that Rice's writing no longer lives up to her imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many misses and not enough hits. Rice strike out, again.","review":"With the possible exception of \\"Merrick\\", \\"Blackwood Farm\\" is perhaps the worst book Rice has written in years. Just when I thought I had seen the last of the excruciatingly boring Mayfair clan, they reappear in this cast of new duds, the Blackwoods. Most notably, one Tarquin Blackwood and the idiotic \\"Goblin\\". Quinn is the most inane caricature of a teenager ever written. Anne needs to take some lessons from Greg Berlanti if she hopes to bring this type of protagonist to life. She has failed miserably and only succeeds in irritating the reader beyond words. How the character Lestat could become interested in Quinn is beyond reason. He should have saved the world the misery of this book by offing the fledgling Quinn at the outset."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst. book. ever.","review":"What an awful book! (Having said that, I did actually read the entire thing.)Irritatingly, most of the book is a monologue, spoken by Tarquin (yet another impossibly rich, overdressed, beautiful and campy vampire) to Lestat, who doesn't even chime in with an 'mmm' or 'ok' or 'by the gods, you're an insufferably boring lad'. This struck me as very un-Lestat, and a dialogue with Lestat would have at least broken up this hefty monologue.The entire book is strangely written. The words and phrases are different from her previous works. The tenses and writing style is a departure from the tried and true method and I couldn't help but wonder if this was even written by Anne Rice. Maybe it was, but she had a 4 year old for an editor.Whatever, this book was a sore disappointment to me, and I'm sad that I spent $50AU buying the hardcover. You owe me some cash, Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick a fork in it; it's done","review":"This book is just another one that should never have existed. There is mention of thing, but they are never explored. There's another vampire-who-is-just-like-all-the-rest named Quinn. At this point, a series that was once so amazing is ruined. Blackwood Farm is beating the dead horse beyond recognition.Rice also tries to mesh her worlds again. Mona Mayfair is mentioned as a vampire, and Merrick comes in and dies (YAY!). The meshing is horrible. This is by far the lowest point in the series so far. Maybe she'll stop.The only good thing that happened was Merrick dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than most of her recent works","review":"Which, of course, isn't saying much.Is she really in such desperate need of money that she needs to give us yet another book that's clearly only half finished?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief Response to Brian Carey's review","review":"As a former student of Professor Hacker, I've developed much respect for the man.

Having said that, it is a very difficult read, so I am not surprised by the not-so-good ratings.I studied Spanish literature, history and culture in college, and I think it is paramount for the reader to know the history, not only of Per��, but of Latin America as a whole. Knowing the difficult history, laced with dictatorships, crime and struggle will help you understand the book. His literary style is very unique, so reading in Spanish is MUCH MUCH better than reading the English translation, however good that translation may be.

In France, she is forced to experience new, unknown French ways instead of being a sheltered teenager. For example, she must learn to navigate around the French metro.On a romantic level, this novel was a bit cliche for me. She falls in love with a French guy - why does this always happen in every exchange novel/movie?!?! The romance did add a little fun to the book, however, so I would recommend this book as a great read, especially if you like to be exposed to different cultures.

I gave the first season a four star rating. But this third season? I can't even finish watching all the discs. There are two major problems with this. The first is that virtually all of the comic book elements that make Wonder Woman interesting (which were embraced in season one) have been ditched. The second is that this is just bad TV. Plodding direction, weak and/or ham-fisted acting, dull scripting.

Season 1, as a period piece set during WWII (the original Wonder Woman story) is timeless and still holds up today.

I would have liked for the series to end with a purpose. Just like it starts with a reason for Wonder Woman to return to America, it should have ended with a reason for her to leave for Paradise Island.

I did not, however, read any of Miller's other books for the simple reason she has never had children. Her views are from a \\"textbook\\" point of view, very professional and well written.

Blow out the candle and the air returns to normal almost immediately. There's no smell I could detect and I have severe asthma.Minimally, and temporally, affects the climate and targets only flying bugs. We have flying ants, deer flies, and gnats that also fled the area. Since we live in the mountains of SoCal we also have many kinds of spiders and other benificial bugs we did not want to kill off.

This is the perfect album to listen to when you want to be alone, go off somewhere by yourself and just really think. Missing You is a very introspective song. It makes you think about relationships you may have had in the past, and what went wrong. Kaleidoscopic Events features the most wonderful fluttering arpeggio's that can really put your mind at ease. Serene is simply beautiful with it's glassy marimba and dream-guitar synthesizer sounds. My favorite song on the album is probably Comfort, with it's soft gentle rocking melody, to me it's almost maternal. Rain is also beautiful and hypnotic.

Unfortunatelly after that album, Larry is concentrating on instrumental music, which is the case of the album \\"Genesis\\". Larry has had excellent instrmental albums, namely: \\"Scenarios..PT2-Ice Castles\\", but Genesis repeats ideas used in his previous CDs. To make matters worst the tracks are long and simple ideas are repeated to death. He also uses the same arrangements we have heard on other records of his.

I should have been tipped off by the authors statement that he's the \\"foremost authority on the HA in North America\\". Clearly that's BS as any HA member would be more of an authority. It's like a dog claiming to be an expert on kitty litter. Then there's Tait. I found nothing respectable about him. The thing is, everyone can smell BS when you're standing in it, and this book reaks of it. Maybe I'll send to some $$ to the HA legal defense fund to make myself feel a little less soiled by this sad attempt at exploitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, good subject","review":"Never in the history of Bikers has there been written such worthless textualmatter. Can not be followed from page to page and has no praisworthiness what so ever. Next time I'll spend my money supporting the \\"Big Red Machine\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little truth and NO honor","review":"The author knows little about the real Hells Angels and has never spent time with them. He gets his information from a paid rat and a bunch of cops, each trying to justify and glorify themselves and support each other's lies in an effort for self-aggrandizement and profit. They try to trash the names of people I know and respect. I met Tait at the Hells Angels clubhouse on several occasions and had a bad feeling about him, the only time I met someone there I felt that way about. If they told the truth, they would be the ones in jail for the crimes they committed against America's favorite motorcycle club. I will always respect and support the Hells Angels. I have been proud to call some of them friends. The book is loaded with lies, as was Tait's testimony."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing true, but slanted account of the Hells Angels MC","review":"First of all there are a lot of Bikers who are pissed off at this book. Anyone who gives this book less than three stars is very biased and shouldnt be taken seriously. This book is exciting. It does jump around a little, but it is far from being hard to follow. This book is also biased to a certain extent. Yes, the author believes that the Hells Angels are criminal organization during the duration of the book if not to present day. The author presents a very compelling case for this. The story is centered around Anythony Tait the FBI informant on the Angels during Operation CACUS. If you aren't interested in someone who goes into organized crime and helps the government take them down, dont read this book. If you want to read a book about the Hells Angels Drug dealers and upper leadership being taken down from within by an FBI informant this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"nt good","review":"i bought this book a few years ago and began reading it as soon as i got home. i got eally bored with it, really fast. i stopped reading it about half-way through, and have not picked it back up since.this guy became an informant long before he could have done anything for the HA that you would find interesting to read about.dont buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's insane prejudice","review":"It's very hard to get a factual or non-biased read from any of this author's books. Even his commentary on TV is awful. I found it very hard to not be disgusted by his diction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what the Feds want you to know","review":"First of all, if you haven't read Sonny Barger's book, don't read this one until you do. Tait was a traitor and a phony. He proved this by becoming a dirty informant. If the Angels killed his family or burned down his house, I could understand his motives. They didn't. He was a greedy little worm who wanted some of Uncle Sam's cash. In Mr. Barger's book, he tells the Angels' side of the story, not the one fed to the FBI for money. If you want to know some general stuff about the HA, Lavigne's book might be good to read, but take it at face value. It's more inflated than those trashy supermarket tabloids, especially if Tait was the one supplying the \\"facts.\\" By the way, I gave it one star only because Tait managed to spell all the names right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than dragging your tongue through broken glass...","review":"I'm not sure what was worse, the page after page after page after (you get the picture) of legalese or the one-sided view of the outlaw biker. The author had some pretty stout words when they're printed on paper and not spoken to Ralph Barger. This book is only about someone who didn't like the path they had chosen in life and tried to do something that would make themselves feel better in retrospect. Read this book ONLY after you've grown tired of smacking yourself in the head with your shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book was excellent, it painted a really good picture of how the Hell's Angels are vulnerable from within. This book depicts with true detail about how Anthony Tait worked his way up through the ranks while being being the most graphic informant in the FBI's history. A must read for anybody with interest in the outlaws mc's of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because there is no \\"zero stars\\" option.","review":"The author and the informant put a lot of self love into this garbage book. Just... terrible. Tait (the informant) wanted to play secret agent, but lacked the discipline to be an actual law enforcement agent; so he turned rat. Lavigne (the author) wanted to write fiction, but lacked the imagination. Thus a partnership of convenience was born. Their lovechild was this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of time","review":"after reading hell's angel,the life and times of sonny barger,i was completely pissed off i bought this book. it took all i had to read about 20 pages before i gave up(sonny's book was a page turner). it seems to me that the author took sniper shots from a safe distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biker Trash or Writer Trash","review":"First, I don't normally write, but as a biker with a voracious appetite for all things literary I felt a need to express my opinion about this book. DON'T BUY !I have never read a book whose storyline was so erratic. The timeline bounced so bad that I was never sure what year I was in. This book was written as if the author was dictating to a tape recorder random thoughts while on the run from the HA and then published without proofreading.This is the second book read from this author with similar results so I have learned my lesson. If readers desire readings about the Hells Angels, there are quite a few books that cover the subject properly from both sides of the fence.Even Sonny Barger expresses his story better than Yves Lavigne and I believe his expertise is in other areas.To sum this up, Yves Lavigne writes the way Hunter S. Thompson talks.Maybe the literary police will arrest Yves before the Hells Angels find him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful!!","review":"I have never taken so long to read a book in my life! Boring, boring, boring! Even if you skip the many pages of legal mumbo jumbo, you still have to read Tony Tait's constant whining and moaning sections. I can't believe this author even wrote about this guy! Generally, I find the subject of Hells Angels to be entertaining but this book was an exception to the rule. Anthony Tait manages to make Hells Angels seem totally boring but if the truth be told, Anthony Tait is the most boring subject I've ever read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some parts interesting","review":"This book was OK. There were a lot of parts that i just scanned when Lavigne was talking about the interworkings of the Federal and State Law Enforcement because i simpley dont care. Tait is a top notch scumbag as well. He didnt do any of it for the greater good, just to make a name, and his desire to go into law enforcement. If he wasnt an informant, he would have been no different than any of them, maybe worse. The one thing i did like was the taped church meetings. For the first time we know what they were talking about at Local, Coastal, USA, and World Meetings. The author was definately biased, and to claim he is the top Hells Angels advisor is rediculous. Also he says they started from the Boozefighers MC when they actually stared from the Pissed of Bastards MC. Isnt as good as other books out there. Read Williams Queens book 'Under and Alone'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst textbook ever","review":"This is by far the MOST CONFUSING textbook I have ever had. Note the fact I said \\"had\\" and not \\"used\\" because I cant even use this book because it is so confusing, and I don't know a single person taking the stat course that even refers to this book. Even my instructor agrees it is a very confusing book and does not even use it himself. The writer throws in all these relations and far too many greek symbols in my opinion, he needs to get down to the point and just give the concepts and the formula's. The stat book I used before was MUCH EASIER to understand than this one. Makes a great paperweight however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview, missed action items","review":"I really liked the book's coverage of the issues and the consequences. I liked the comparison of government's stand on outsourcing to the Jimmy Carter energy plan. Retraining will not be enough. (Retrain for what?) Outsourcing will get bigger and affect more people and government will do nothing until it is too late for many. Author's bottom line, Look around and justify your job. Make sure your company can survive the new world. If it can't, change companies or jobs or go into business for yourself. Not a pleasant outlook but very realsitic. I'm glad I read the book before I am outsourced again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author should be sued","review":"As a business person whose company was nearly wrecked by outsourcing, I can tell you firsthand that this book is just a manual for bankruptcy. Yourdon fails to warn his readers about the poor service, the shoddy work, and the threats from anti-outsourcing zealots. Our system were down for a week after some hackers targetted it - I think they were former employees. If you want to destroy your firm buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect price","review":"This was much less expensive than at the store and I knew what it would look like beforehand, so I wasn't disappointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD - Blue Vinyl","review":"A timely transaction with the product carefully packaged, etc. I would not hesitate to shop with this merchant again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and insipid - oft seen story","review":"The documentary talks about big corporation and pollution issues around vinyl - but the narrative is too slow and seems too familiar, with many of us having seen the similar issues addressed in other documentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Ugly","review":"These looked much better in the picture.

The politics are radical, the grooves are hard, and the lyrics are amazing. Buy this album and get righteously angry for causes that matter. If you enjoy RATM, you should buy some MC5 like \\"Kick Out the Jams\\", anything from Gang of Four, and Public Enemy's \\"Fear of a Black Planet.\\" This album is a firestorm of heavy riffs and angry lyrics and should be in the music collection of anybody who wants to change the status quo. Also, Tom Morello's guitar work is phenomenal. I've never heard anything so avant garde on a mainstream rock album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Empire calling for...Communism ?","review":"Musically is not bad, the guitars, the bass and the drums are perfect. Not much into this rap metal, but is still a very good musical album. Once again, i'm talking about the instruments.My big issue with this album are the lyrics.This band is nothing but some ''minorities'' calling for Communism. As i did my homework, their website is full of criminals like Lenin, Guevara and others. Should i add the Black Panther thing ?No, thank you, i'm ok . I'm not a Communist, i don't hate white people ( hello ? i am white). Therefore i'm not into a racist band that glorifies vicious Communist criminals."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd for anyone that is ready to stand for there rights","review":"i really really REALLY love ratm. there lyrics are awesome, Tom M is an insane guitarist, and just they are freakin sweet how they blend rap and metal together.

RATM follows up four years later with a phat album that feeds all their fans with more defiance. This CD put RATM on tha charts with singles, \\"People of tha Sun\\" and \\"Bulls on Parade.\\" This CD led them to tour with U2 and Wu-Tang Clan. No guest appearances on this one but it is still an awesome CD. Cant wait for tha next one. RATM just keeps on getting better and better. RAISE THOSE FISTS AND RESIST!!

This album definitely gets the award for most sounds coming out of a gutair that you would'nt think could come out of a guitar...but are the sounds that good? Sometimes yes, but most times no. The oly track I can truly recommend is \\"bulls on parade\\", which you can get on a single anyway. This is not a terrible album, but you would expect more from a band with such an amazing debut album and such talented artists"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage's worst album","review":"_Evil Empire_ is easily Rage Against the Machine's worst album. (I haven't checked out anything after _The Battle of Los Angeles_, though.) Although the CD has a few good songs, it is not that far removed from being a piece of garbage. This album fails to build upon Rage's 1992 self-titled debut. _Rage Against the Machine_ had energy and good musicianship; _Evil Empire_ is mired by sloppiness and repetition. This album is not total [drivel], but you'd be much better off checking out _Rage Against the Machine_ and _The Battle of Los Angeles_. Tom Morello's unique style of guitar playing really doesn't shine the way it did on this band's debut. Pass on buying this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"RATM is the best band in the world!!!!!!!","review":"If you are angry at how screwed up the world is today, Rage Against The Machine is the band for you. I don't like Korn, Tool, Limp Bizkit or any of that crap because they only sing about meaningless stuff like drugs and sex. RATM has a deep-meaning and gets the point across by embodying the violent spirit of today's world and presenting it in a musical format. Yes, Rage is musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"The songs and lyrics are awesome. Veitnow, People of the Sun, Bulls on Parade, and Down Rodeo are the best songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Empire is the best album of the decade","review":"Hey you want some amazing sounds of rage this is the album you got to get. If you thought the first album was good...This one is great. And they say the next one is the best one (rage) is gonna be thier best...good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where can I buy the instrumental version?","review":"Some bands are sooo close to being great, but one element just blows their chance. Think of Smashing Pumpkins without Billy Corgan's nasal whine. Then there is Rage Against the Machine. This CD has all the muscular riffs and beats that you could ever want to find in one place. 'Bulls' is incredible sounding and then...Zach begins singing. It's not just his lack of any kind of vocal ability, its also his feverish lyrics that have all of the political sophistication of your average community college freshman. Hey Zach, throw in a \\"tired of working for the man\\" everyonce in a while, and you will have moved up to your sophomore year. Meanwhile, a tight rhythm section and some hot guitar go to waste. Maybe Empire will be re-released as an all instrumental some day. One can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ragm is such a great band.... on paper","review":"What a bright and original idea for a rock n' roll band. combine the militant rantings of Chuck D. (of P.E. fame) and a doomsday prophet. Mix in the wild funk metal of faith no more and the skeletal Post hardcore guitar stylings of Fugazi. Then add in a bunch of smart radical lyrics and you would have a great band wouldnt you? Well Yes..... but ragm just dont dont pull it through.There songs are just a bore to listen too. Either keep it short fast and brutal or incorporate some god damn melodies. RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE just fall flat and it pains me because they have such a great sound too. Why couldnt they just make these songs Interesting?.Well If I ever want some good militant socialist music I usually head to Crass, Refused, or good ole' public enemy and if I were you i'd head there too.Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPOCRITES","review":"So Rage Against the Machine thought fit to burn the American Flag at Woodstock. It's Bad Enough that they have Chosen for their Poster Boy a convicted MURDERER of a Police Officer who was only trying to PROVIDE a safe ENVIRONMENT for these MORONS to Spout their Venom. Truth be told, they have a few good songs. But you people, just be AWARE. They're quick to BURN the AMERICAN FLAG that your grandfathers, fathers and brothers DIED to DEFEND, BUT... YOU DON'T SEE THEM BURNING the U$S$ DOLLARS on STAGE that they're MILKING from YOU. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING from THESE BASTARDS and Hopefully the REST of YOU Will do the SAME.

I am a true Rage fan and I still like the older one better but, this one is a fine sequel, with timeless classics people of the sun and bulls on parade. I think the band are the only people on earth that know what they are singing about, This CD is not singing, it is PREECHING"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!!!","review":"Although alot of people have said that Rage's first album was always the best one, Evil Empire, the second album, is awesome in it's own right. This album demonstrates Tom Morello's pure genius and creativity in playing the guitar and using it to create different sounds. For instance, in \\"Year of the Boomerang\\", he used an allen wrench to make the scratchy , raw intro riff. One of my favorite Rage songs is on here, and of course, thats \\"Bulls on Parade\\". Yes, i sound like all of the other fans, but it's so damn good! The simple, yet mosh -worthy f# octave intro and the perfect use of a wah-wah pedal add up too a head-banging good time! There are plenty of other great tracks on the record, like \\"tire me\\" which won Rage a Grammy. And \\"Down Rodeo\\", an often overlooked song but worthy of recognition. For anyone wanting to get into Rage Against the Machine, this album is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a quiet peaceful dance/For the things we'll never have","review":"Firstly, EE is, in my opinion, better than the debut. However EE is quite different from the powerchords and heavy riffs of the 1992 album. There's more feeling in the songs here, it's a lot funkier, and if you ask me Rocha outdoes his performance in the debut by far. He's just far more raw, he beats out those lyrics like he really means them (and although they are difficult to fathom at times, it's well worth the wait when you figure them out). The best tracks by far are Revolver, Down Rodeo and The Year Of The Boomerang. This album touches me in a way 1992 never did. The riffs may be more clean cut in 1992, but they never had the emotion EE has. When i first listened to this i was disappointed, but you have to let it grow on you.Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"rage against rage against the machine","review":"this is the debut album with different lyrics. this album is so half-hearted, it's hard to believe they're actually all that angry at all. they should stop raging for a few days and use the time to write some new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"This cd was very disappointing, it was a waiste of $15. If you want good hardcore music check out both Limp Bizkit cds and Kid Rock's Devil without a cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no zero stars","review":"I don't even think this junk can be classified as Rap/Rock/Metal. You think that just because you add some guitars and drums that it will be considered rap/rock? There's not even any SINGING in it. I will have to give some credit to the instrument use, but other than that, it's terrible. All of their songs sound the same on ALL of their CDs. What we see here is an older version of the Beastie Boys. If you want rap/rock, buy Chronic Future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band sucks","review":"This is the best band of the 90's,ha!!!Admit it they were sellouts who sang about anti establishment then partied with president of treir record label in his mansion.They were corny then and crappy now, thank god they broke up on my birthday which made an excellent b-day present. Tom Morello was an overrated guitarrist who used elestronics to hode the fact that he can't play guitar.Zack de la Rocha was a horrible singer thats why he had to rap instead. The rhythmic section was a lame excuse, just lame.Skip this band, overrated,overhyped and undertalented.

His lyrics are thoughtful and his delivery is unique and passionate. This album however is a tedious and stale affair. Rage's debut is arguably the greatest Rap/Rock album ever and probably always will be. Everything seemed to gel together on the debut. It was fresh and exciting and it rocked hard. On Evil Empire they have become more of a straight ahead rap band without the rock. The band doesn't get to flesh out its sound like they did on the debut. They seem to have been demoted to just background noise for Zack's political rants. The songs are very repetive and predictable and the vocals start to gripe really bad. Tom morello makes all sorts of bizarre sound effects with his guitar but thier are no great hooks. Thier is little rage or intensity on Evil Empire, it's all very calculated and contrived. Thier next album would unfortunately follow the same trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this cd is great","review":"In my opinion this Cd is great.

They definitely tried some different things here. I get this feeling they were thinking 'scratch the itch' 'scratch the itch'. More of the same can be very tedious and tiring. They wanted to brach out and prove they can do multiple things. The political lyrics are still there but the sound is quite different. Still good nonetheless.My favorites are: Bulls On Parade, Vietnow, Snakecharmer, Tire Me, and Without a FaceRecomended.Also check out:Rage Against the MachineThe Battle of Los AngelesRenegades"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"This CD, Rage's follow up to the hit debut self titled album, contains eleven songs, all of which I like. From \\"People of the Sun\\" to \\"Year of the Boomerang\\" all the songs pack a punch to get anyone excited.

Unfortunately, the rest of the album is day-old hash, a repetitive, mushy mixture of sounds. De la Rocha's yelling is monotonous, and if you make it through the fourth song without pressing fast-forward you're a masochist.

The riffing isn't as repetitive as the first album, and the lyrics aren't quite as juvenile as that release either. (Yes, I realize that their first album is considered a modern classic--but that doesn't mean it isn't without its faults.) \\"Evil Empire\\" is the only Rage album that stands up to repeat listenings, in my opinion.

If the meterstick were as think as most metal yardsticks I would have rated it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are our myths?","review":"Not really a history so much as an essay on the significance of myth and its role in human society and psyche. As is typical with much of Karen Armstrong's work, she shines best when writing about Western religious traditions; the bits on Eastern religions and philosophies seem almost perfunctory. This would make a good book for a discussion group as it raises a number of interesting questions (and at 150+ pages it is not hugely demanding). Armstrong notes the necessity of myth for both individual and social sustenance, and laments its disappearance from contemporary capitalist society. But as the new world order shows no signs of imminent collapse, is Armstrong's thesis correct? Is myth indeed necessary? Or, is there perhaps a mythology that we can't yet see, a forest for the trees?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Karen Armstrong has produced an intellectual history of the idea of mythology and its role in supporting religion, philosophy and science. Like in her other books, the former nun has leveraged her deep knowledge and understanding of religion and philosophy to create a thought provoking book on the role of myth over the last several millennium.The voice over of this audio book was well read, with inflections and changes in tone coming in appropriate places.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"A lot of this work could be told in far fewer words. Much of what the author says is stuff I knew already and nothing she said added anything new. It may well be a good book for someone just starting to study sociology and myth, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boiled down just right -- why and how we gained and lost our myths","review":"If you don't have much time for myths this book might just do the job for you. It's good and short. Man developed myths because he needed them to cope with life. Without myths, life is hard and then you die. The author claims that the problem with modern life is that we have been demythologised (reason pushed myths out of our lives). Her solution is; read novels like Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and turn to other forms of art that can replace the function of myths for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Armstrong's worst book.","review":"I am a long-time fan of Karen Armstrong's writings. \\"A History of God\\" changed my life. \\"The Case for God\\" is brilliant. \\"The Great Transformation\\" is filled to overflowing with information and ideas. Even her books about the Buddha and the Bible are worth reading. But \\"A Short History of Myth\\" is boring, badly written, light on content, and generally uninteresting.I will admit that Armstrong has some good ideas and is able to draw an emotional response out of the reader. Occasionally her words make me feel a drive to connect with the \\"Something\\" that religion and myth are all about. It feels like Armstrong teases you with enlightenment and pulls it away like a bullfighter's red cape. Not to mention the fact that this book is boring. I have tried to read this book no less than three times but never got more than halfway because it is so incrediby boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worth reading","review":"By no means exhaustive but a painfully clear dissertation on what we have lost.

Nicolas Cage's funny \\"sidekick\\" was a good addition that added a lot of laughs and one-liners. For me, one of the bests part of the movie was the on-location filming in the rotunda and other parts of the National Archive, which I happened to have visited this summer (by the way, if you get to Washington D.C., make this your first priority to go see. It inspires lasting awe, and would you believe it's free). Like the DaVinci Code, which had a lot of readers dashing to their computers to look at \\"The Last Supper\\", I bet a lot of people who see this movie run straight home and Google Ben Franklin's Silence Dogood letters. If you like history, or fun movies with a happy ending, this one won't disappoint. Go see it.

A treasure map being on the back of the declaration of independence just seems like a silly idea. It was done surprisingly well, though.

Here's a man with obvious talent yet something in his mind compels him TIME AND TIME AGAIN to accept roles beneath him. Part of it is ego. He wants to bolster his image as a he-man, but he fails more often than not. Examples? Just about everything he's been in. I remember the days when I watched in amazement his performances in Raising Arizona, Leaving Las Vegas, Red Rock West, and Adaptation (his last great role). Everything else causes my head to ache in embarrassment. Thank god he didn't land the role of Superman. He CAN pull off dark, tough characters. Wild At Heart is a superb display of what he's capable of there. Unfortunately, he seems resigned to be an action hero / macho-stud wannabe. Such a sad, sad waste of talent spent on years of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's No Indiana Jones But He's Good","review":"This is the kind of movie that both adults and kids will enjoy.

This is a wonderful movie for the family with children of all ages. My brother and I saw this movie with our parents and we are both teenages. Not the kind you would expect to be going to a movie with our parents. Not because we don't like to be seen with our parents, but because we like different movies. We all went to see it together and we ALL loved it.While it's a wonderful movie for families, it does have some flaws. It is made for families and therefore includes no adult themes or such which is a wonderful thing for a family but not entirely realistic. The story is also a little too far-fetched but is still great and fully-developed in its own. Overall a great movie.. it's worth it to pay for a ticket and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goonies grown-up","review":"Disney has rehashed \\"The Goonies\\", with this derivative work.(minus Sloth)This is definitely geared to younger audiences. The almost laughable plot holes are patched over with scene changes and 5 second dialogue patches. I really only watched this because the filming in Philadelphia was directly across from where I worked. (I didn't make it into any background scenes... oh well). It's not that bad... but with a grown-up cast, I had the expectation for grown-up dialogue. (would have been nice.) It's fast paced (to the point of sacrificing plausability) Bad guys are bad for no real reason, and of course can't hit the broadside of a barn when firing their guns. I'm not going to address the plot or characters, its really not worth my time. Watch \\"The Goonies\\". It's got better characters, better dialogue and better treasure. (and Sloth!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting tale based on American history","review":"As others have said, this movie does bear some similarities to the Indiana Jones films... But it is no more a rip-off of Indian Jones than it is of the Goonies.

There might be a scary moment here and there for young kids, but overall, National Treasure is benign.I've often wondered about Free Masonry, their old history and secret rituals that some Christian groups claim are Satanic. All the better to build a screenplay full of historical side notes about the Founding Fathers; eight including Ben Franklin and George Washington were Masons. Add some historical hocus pocus having to do with Knights Templers, Egyptian Pyramids, and American landmarks; our modern Treasure hunters search through America's most famous documents and historic sites in their quest. This is fine entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"we take VISA","review":"National Treasure DVDNational Treasure reminds me of a scavenger hunt with guns.

See it with no pre-conception of what the story is. I can't wait to buy it as soon as it's out. My 14 year old daughter went with my husband and me to see it and she wants the movie so bad! What better testimonial than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This movie was fun. It was challenging to try to figure out how the historical \\"facts\\" connected to reality.

From previews, I guessed that this would be a take-off on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it is. We have a search for treasure that begins with a secret message on the Declaration of Independence (What?) and ends in a spooky grotto. Still, everything comes out fine at the end. The story almost lost me at the start. First, they have a stunning blonde in charge of things at the National Archives. Is this the same National Archives that I have visited? Second, the blonde plays fast and loose with the Declaration of Independence. That's even more difficult to imagine. But then the story settles down to one chase after another among our nation's historic sites, so you can just hang on and let it race off in all directions. It should entertain children as well as adults, and I don't recall any cussing, nudity, gore, or sex. That makes it a family picture, so sit back and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Ride","review":"Borrowed this from a friend. Had a great time watching it.

This story is about this man named Benjamin Franklin Gates, played by the talented Nicolas Cage, who is searching for this treasure that no one else believed in. Gates is now on his mission to find the treasure that many of our founding fathers were part of. He found out that there are many clues leading to the treasure. Will he ever find the treasure or is it all just a fake? You will have to go to the theatre to find out. I was wowed by this movie. The effects are awesome and the story line is excellent. It is like a wild goose chase to find this treasure. This reminds me of the popular book The Da Vinci Code in many ways.

A treasure hidden by the founding fathers that was handed down since ancient Egypt. But the acting performances were so bad you can't enjoy the movie due to the stench. That pretty girl who played Helen in the movie \\"Troy\\" was so bad I couldn't believe they allow her to act. Albeit we don't need a Meryl Streep for a movie like this, but can't we find a young actress that can deliver credible emotions? And what's up with Harvey Keitel playing a federal agent? That's like asking Hannibal Lecter to play Big Bird... it doesn't match and it comes across as goofy as slap stick comedy.

I hate it when such good actors sell out and make such bad films. At least with Indiana Jones and The Mummy films, I was able to buy into them and suspend my disbelief. With this film, its just so bad that you cant. The movie invovles a series of clues that Nic is amazingly able to figure out, no matter how vague they are. There are a few blunders in this film that were very obvious--poor job on the script editors part. I am in disbelief that this movie made so much money.

The movie is fast paced, exciting, and (despite criticisms) mildly intellectually challenging.Also, the characters are very likable. Yes, the roles are predictable from a mile off. But there were distict \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\", with a little bit of romance to keep me hoping but prevents my husband from calling it a chick-flick.I can pop this movie in and casually watch it while cleaning, or invite the whole crew over and know that everyone will have a good time.

But my question is: why let that spoil all of your fun?If you were at all interested by the previews, or simply enjoy a treasure-hunting tale, or simply are a fan of American history (regardless, of whether the \\"Da Vinci Code/Masons\\" story is plausible), you will enjoy this movie. Just don't take it too seriously. Nicholas Cage keeps this film afloat and the visual/camera work is very well done.So sit back, grab a bag of popcorn, and give yourself over to a Tom Sawyer tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than the critics make you think","review":"I went to see this movie with the idea that was not good since I read some critics reviews, ok is not Indiana Jones but you have some fun during it, the performances are fine (specially Riley and Ian, each very good in their roles), so I was entertained in those 2 hours and that is why you go to the movies.The plot is a little complicated, the Nicolas Cage caracther is a man looking for a treasure that has been hunting his family for generations, he has to follow a lot of clues to get it.. and if you want to know the rest go and see it, you will have fun!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something of an also-ran","review":"You get the feeling that this film was made in about 2 days with a massive budget and with an overwhelming need to jump on the 'Di Vinci Code' bandwagon.

I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm tempted out of morbid curiosity to see if the series can break its own record and be even worse than the first.A special zero star rating should be created just for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treasure is left over Junk.","review":"If you are looking for something remotely new, witty, or original then you may want to avoid the drek that is National Treasure. The movie, starring Nicholas Cage, is a perfect hodgepodge of every action-adventure you've ever seen or read. Start with a sprinkle of Indiana Jones, throw in a dash of The Da Vinci Code, then just two shakes of anything else you can think of and you've made a National Treasure mess cake.The dialogue is so predictable and trite you almost groan with foreknowledge. Cranky old dad? Check. Dastardly villian who's lines were written by a six year old? Check. Beautiful but brainy girl AND quirky sidekick with throwaway one liners? Check. All leading up to a perfectly Disney ending? Double check. So if you're looking for a nice little cotton candy film (you know the kind have big fluff and when you take a bite it all disappears), or have some Cage obession, this will be for you. Otherwise just go grab the Indiana Jones trilogy and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF CRAP","review":"Now if someone had the knowledge AND the balls to tell what the Masons were(are) REALLY up to and what those symbols REALLY mean- now that would be a heckuva movie.

Unoriginal. The first two words that come to mind if asked to describe National Treasure. Another one...formulaic. Anyone who has read The Da Vinci Code will recognize from the outset of this movie what a blatant and shameless rip-off it is of the best-selling book.For starters, the Knights Templar, The Free Masons, the secret societies, the mysterious and elusive hidden treasure, etc., etc. To make matters worse, I didn't exactly find it absolutey necessary for Nicolas Cage to launch into unprovoked historical pontifications ad nauseam while he deciphered the painfully predictable clues out loud to the audience - all of which made the whole movie nothing more than mindless fodder for the masses.The only thing stopping it from being one star is the stellar acting of Diane Krueger. How she put up with this drivel is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts the corn in corny","review":"what a load of rubbish..i bought this movie due to its rating on Amazon and for the first time in 10 years was really disappointed in buying a movie based on the vote of the public.To sum up it was silly,pradictable and boring.

The plot is not all that advanced, and if one was cruel one could call it paper thin and filled with silly plot lines that make no sense at all. However, the movie never pretends to be serious and therefore it never feels phony or forced. The action scenes rock and Cage plays his part well.

When I saw Ms. Laurens name on this novel, I assumed that this novel would be of the same strain as the others!! How wrong could one person be??

I sat through thinking it was going to get better, it finally got better when I finished reading the last page and closed the book!I went and re-read one of her other novels just to get the \\"bad taste\\" out of my brain from reading this novel! I do not recommend this book at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Laurens Book EVER","review":"I have read all of Ms. Lauren's book, and this was far and away the most boring.

I put the book down when I have nothing better to do, but I don't want to read it either. I find my self saying okay one more chapter and ... nothing. Antonia is fine, Philip is fine, but there is always a descritpion of her reaction to him, his to her, but it just falls flat after that. This book had great promise but Ms. Laurens just doesn't deliver. The pages just go on and on about nothing. It wasn't difficult to give up on this book in the middle of page 140. I don't know what happened after and I don't really care. I'm wondering why am I waisting time on this book when there are four new books waiting for me to get into. When you're in the midst of reading a book, you shouldn't be thinking of another book. I'm still a fan of Stephanie Laurens, but not of this particular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"i'm very dissapointed with this book. The whole story idea sounds fascinating, but. you see the book opens out with the point of view of Patsy, the oldest child in Patrick Henry's family. You really build a bond with her, when she crys you cry for her as well. Then her part abruptly ends and goes on to her sister Anne. Anne goes on and on about how evil Patsy is and she turns the readers against Patsy. So by the end of the book you hate Patsy but you also hate Anne for turning your image of Patsy to a bad one. The story itself ends tragicly as well. I total this is a book where nothing good seems to happen to break up the bad parts. i give it two stars for the Patsy part but overall i don't reccomend this book. i'm dissapointed also because there was hardly any mention to historical events and life. This book will leave you feelin crummy. don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Or Give Me Death...Awesome","review":"Or Give Me Death is an awesome book. It gives you the perspective of Patrick Henry's two daughters, Patsy and Anne. They give their opinions on their mother who hs gone crazy and is being kept in the cellar of their home and each other. Patsy takes over as \\"head of the household\\" when their mother Sarah Henry goes \\"crazy\\" and tries to drown her son Edward. She gains an overwhelming amount of power very quickly. Patsy feels Anne has been turned against her and when she realizes that one of them might have their mother's madness she becomes very worried. Anne finds out who has inherited it but she doesn't want any of her family members to know who it is. Anne talks about how hard Patsy is on her.

The earlier reviewer mentioned the socks sliding down the ankle and staying inside the shoe when the foot is withdrawn, supposedly because of sizing issues... But I am a size 7, and the same happens to me. It does, however, depend on the shoes that I'm wearing. Tighter tennis shoes tend to keep the socks inside when I remove my feet; loose sneakers slide the socks down my ankle when I walk.But well-fitting sneakers (athletic shoes) keep the socks nicely in place! If you're like me, and you keep about fifty pairs of socks around, these socks look great and are one of the most comfortable I've ever had--you'll just have to pay attention to which shoes you pair them with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy steps to profound spiritual shift","review":"I've read many books on spirituality.

By serendipity, many of her topics discuss exactly what is going on in my life. After reading chapter two on being the best that you can be, I had much more compassion for those who non-intentially tell me what they think I 'should' be doing.

That his amazing music is not as well know is tragic. Alkan was close friends with Chopin & Liszt, and an influence on both of them (as well as Brahms). His music is the most technically formidable prior to Godowsky. This CD is a recording of Alkan's most remarkable work (the Opus 39 12 Etudes in the Minor Keys). It could not be better performed by Jack Gibbons. Not only is Gibbons up to the pieces cruel technical demands, but he produces a lush rich tone that is a joy in itself. Listen to his performance of the Symphony for Solo Piano (Etudes 4 - 7): there is not a better recorded performance available. Any piano lover absolutely must have these CDs. They are a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely over the top!","review":"The main differences between this recording and the only other complete recording of the minor key etudes by Ronald Smith are:1. Superior sound2. A virtuosity that must be heard to be believed. Gibbons plays fast, Gibbons plays loud, Gibbons plays soft, Gibbons plays all the notes, and all the while Gibbons plays them musically! A truly remarkable performance of some very complex music.But the recording by Smith has much going for it too. In an ideal world, if you're a fan of Alkan, get both recordings. I've got them both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a fascinating account of an unusual character. Sir Francis certainly had an extraordinary life - from leading an invasion of Tibet to profound mystical experiences. Patrick French does a very good job in sharing this story. You feel he is sympathetic, but doesn't slip into hagiography and is careful to let the facts speak for themselves. If I had one criticism, it would be mingling his own story of writing the book amidst the life of Younghusband. This story and writing was fine, but I would have preferred reading the life of Younghusband without interruption. Overall the book is very good and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick!","review":"My toddler went through a phase when he loved to open and close our heavy sliding glass door to the back patio. I was so afraid he would pinch, crush or amputate his fingers in the process, that I purchased this product and it worked great.

Since our two oldest were born close together and are both boys, they were constantly trying to slam doors on each other. The door guards were an awesome way to prevent finger pinching! When our youngest became mobile and I couldn't find the door guards in our stash of baby safety products, I went looking for new ones. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any like we had before, so I bought these from Safety 1st. What a joke! They are too squishy and quickly broke. I tried using Gorilla glue to fix one, but that only worked to a point. The glue held fine, but the guard no longer fit the door quite right. I definitely recommend the harder door guards -- they still squeeze to fit around the door, but won't break when your child slams the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective--not tough enough to be safe","review":"We bought three of these about a month ago.

Our son likes to slam doors, so we bought this to keep him from taking his fingers off while we worked to train him to leave the doors alone. He managed to break both guards. They are soft and squishy, so he had fun bouncing the door against the jam (wrong message), and when he slammed the door hard enough they fell off or ripped.

Ditto on loosing one side . Amazon and Sony do not offer replacements. Other companies sell replacements but they are extremely expensive (~$10 + $7 s/h).

I have very small ears and the smallest size was perfect for me. I run with these at the gym and they stay in great. The way the lines connect is very convenient. You place the right earbud behind your neck, rather than having the \\"Y\\" style that lays in front. Also, this is a great feature because you can leave the headphones dangling around your neck instead of putting them away.Great buy.

By the time I called, it was out of warranty (though I'm not sure even if the warranty would have covered it).I called Sony, and replacements are $25. More than buying them here on amazon. Oh, well, I'll just keep the rubber earbuds as spares for the other Sony buds I have.Do yourself a favor and get the black equivalent - the black tubing is physically different (a little tougher, and doesn't decompose).

I bought them for working out, but they don't stay put. Also, I guess its supposed to be a good design but the right ear cord is bigger than the left, but I don't like that feature. The cord goes behind your neck and its annoying.Another annoying thing that, I, at least experience is that the headphones are so good at keeping noise out that you get this inside noise (like when you're under water). Not sure how to best explain this, but you can hear yourself chewing a piece of gum for example.So very good sound, but the cons outweight the pros.If you never liked these type of earbud headphones, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I have problems keeping those ear buds that came with my ipod in my little ear canals so I was looking for something that gave me a better fit and would stay in without hurting.

After returning these I tried many others and was very pleased with the sound, price and comfort of the Phillips surround sound earphones (14.OO) at Walmart. I then tried the Maximo earphones after reading the reviews on Amazon. The sound of these is phenomenal for the same price as the Sony'.

I found with the set that came with my iPod, I could never get the volume up loud enough and it never sounded clear or with enough bass. These sound perfect.

I bought these after I broke my iPod ones and, these are 10x better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love these headphones, but the cord is aweful","review":"These are great light-weight headphones, and they fit my ears perfectly; I will always buy these type of in-ear style headphones, but... the cord material is very fragile. After a while especially the section that goes behind my head from one headphone to the other, the cord is completely falling apart. The material has somehow broken down from the friction I believe and you can literally pick pieces of it off. I had to wrap the worst sections in duct tape...lame. I also have a pair of the MDR-EX71SL's these DO NOT have this problem. They must not use exactly the same material, b/c they are holding up MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"The bass quality in these headphones is pretty amazing to say the least. However unless you are a freak at keeping your ears clean, they will get waxy and sometimes will irritate your ear.

If I were you I'd pick something else as these are a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but junky construction","review":"These sound fine. In fact, I bought them in part because of positive reviews on the site. And they're quite inexpensive.But be careful: these are not well made. Mine broke after just 8 months of regular use, giving my ear an electrical burn in the process! And the warranty is a measley 90 days! I would most definitley think twice before buying these."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Manager","review":"These head phones are perfect for when one goes and works out at a gym.

When I first tried them, I was surprised at how tinny and treble heavy they sounded. Wondering if I was just used to my stereo speakers, I popped on my standard Apple headphone. Bam - the bass was back. I'd imagine they'd be good for running as they do fit snugly, but buyer beware. Cool looks, comfortable fit but not so good sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good Earbuds","review":"I have them like 3 weeks for my laptop and the Left earbud start to fail, and the cable looks in good condition and It really doesn't have a rude use.

I had trouble with them staying in my ear, they kept falling out. In order to get the sound everyone raves about, I had to jam the headphones way into my ear canal to the point it was uncomfortable. I realize the deficiency with this product may have more to do with the shape of my ear canal than Sony product design. These are not for everyone, I gather it's either a love it or hate it type deal. Unfortunately, in order to test them out you have to buy it (since they go so deep into the ear, its gross thinking about using anyone else's) - make sure you understand the return policy because the style may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as claimed by others","review":"It is not worth the money.

I've always had trouble with the sizing of earbuds (always too big). These fit perfectly. They stay in place at the gym. Sound quality is good. Great fit and great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"I heard negative reviews about the coating on the wires deteriorating, but I have not experienced this issue yet. I bought these as an Ipod headphone replacement, and I am pleased. The sound quality is superior, and the bass response is a world's difference (probably due to their snug fit, but who cares, it's the end result that matters). Speaking of, the earbuds stay put and are comfortable (3 ear canal sizes are included). I also appreciate the gold plated plug and low profile of the L-shaped plug. My only complaints are the cord length (at 4 feet it's a bit too long even though I'm 6 feet tall; it's definitely longer than the original Ipod length). Also, I'm not a big fan of the behind-the-neck style of the cord, but it's not a deal breaker, I don't think. I'm sure there are better 'phones out there, but they come at a cost. These seemed to have the best bang for the buck, and they're white if that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad buy","review":"These headphones were probably my worst buy of the year. As a musician sound quality and crispness is very important. These headphones have neither. Its true I really should suck it up and buy a pair of bose but once again as a musician I am poor.These headphones don't compete with the standard iPod earbuds as far as performance. As confort goes the sony's are fantastic but thats as far as it goes. Poor volume range and quality make for an extremely bad buy. If you like the sony's spend 5 or 10 bucks more and get the 81's (MUCH BETTER)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I just got these headphones and I think they're the best headphones. I listen to my music really loud and with a lot of bass, so these are just what I need. At first I thought the uneven cord was really stupid, but now I think it's the best. I can just turn on my ipod with these already around my neck in the hallway so I don't have to unwind or untangle the cord. As another bonus, they're basically noise cancelling. I can barely hear people when these are in my ears even without music on. This is awesome for my bus ride home from school to drown out people talking, but can also be annoying when my friends are trying to say something to me. Another downside is that they're a little more expensive than your average headphones, though I think they're worth it. But in the end, I definitely think the good outweighs the bad and would reccommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass-less review","review":"Quite disappointed with the bass response of these headphones. Might work for some kinds of music, but for my vanilla rock-n-roll even at medium volumes on my iPod, the low freqs were nullified. Asymmetrical cable lengths also takes some getting used to.Aloha, Neal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"Overall, I would say these are good headphones. The sound is as good as you would ever need; good bass and very clear treble. They are comfortable to wear, block out environmental noise and never fall out of your ear. The cord is a bit too long, and the design of one short and one long legnth wires between the earphone and the cord to the i-pod is a little annoying and looks funny to some, but not a big deal. All said and done, a good set of earphones for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"These are a great value for the price. I use them at the gym all the time, where they play extremely annoying 80s music at about the volume of a landing jumbo jet. So far so good--I hear my music and my music alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How come there others that cost $ 400????","review":"I bought the EX51LP because i was fed up with my $ 200 Shure ear in phones. The bass is simply great and highs are fair. Fit is better than previous versions. It is puzzling that there are other similar phones that cost up to $ 500. Is that a lack of self criticism or simply the dont mind to insult customers? I cannot believe my 27 dollars sound much better than my 200 ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good about these............","review":"After reading many reviews I decided to purchase these buds. It was a big mistake. I wanted to replace my standard earphones for my IPOD Nano. First off, I did not like the fact that one wire is longer than the other. They were comfortable when I placed them in my ears however the bass was terrible and the sound was very tinny and low. Needless to say I returned them immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful Headphones!","review":"These headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK....","review":"Bought to replace my Dell DJ stock ear buds. After having these things for 3 months, I'm glad to say that I threw them in the creek during my run today. They never stayed in my ears during a run (trying all three size fittings). And yesterday the left bud started shorting out, it's just over the 90 day warranty, JUNK!!! My stock DJ buds stayed in better. The only good thing is they did sound good if you held them in your ears with both hands!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Afraid, be very afraid","review":"I was wondering if my hearing was just plain bad, the ipod was fried or do these earbuds stink. Well, after trying a large assortment of earbuds I realized that I hear just fine and these things are crap. The botton end is miserable. If you like very little base response, Lots of mids and piercing highs then these are your buds otherwise, save your money and get a set of radio shack $19 foam buds because they sound better by far.I like the Shures, and actually the stock iPod buds are quite nice. I rarely will review a product and if I do its because its either Outstanding in its class or an absolute failure. The latter is the case here. Buy with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Lengths for Each Ear Very Annoying","review":"I cannot figure out why Sony would intentionally use different lengths of cord for each ear. It is incredibly annoying. Naively thinking I could somehow adjust the length, the slightest tug at the cords pulled them apart. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I had these headphones for five months. They began breaking apart one month after my purchase. One day, I fell asleep with my headphones on. When woke up in the morning, the lining had melted. Literally, parts of the rubber had dissolved and exposed the wires. I ghetto-rigged the wires with Scotch tape to salvage the $40 headphones. I think for the price, they should last at least a year. The overall sound was good. However, I don't think you'll be using these after the exposed wires begin to nibble at your earlobe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...at first","review":"Sound quality was great. The assembly and overall quality of the product itself: very poor. Would not recommend or buy again. The wires frayed and became exposed without very much use of the headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, good fit, lousy construction","review":"I've owned two pairs of these Sony headphones. The sound in the right phone of my first pair mysteriously died after about six months. I looked into it and a few other people online had the same problem. Some blamed it on yanking the phones out by the wires but I never did that. I'm gentle as a lamb with my electronics and their accessories. So I figured it was a fluke and I bought another pair.It's been a bit more than six months and my latest pair just lost sound in the right phone. I guess that's twice as long as the warranty but I'm not spending sixty bucks a year on headphones.The sound quality is nice and they're comfortable. But the lousy quality is so frustrating that I can't give more than two stars.My advice - in-ear headphones are the only way to go for those of us who have a noisy commute on a subway or bus. But stay away from Sony Fontopia. I'm going to give the Sennheiser CX 300S a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good experience, but low durability.","review":"I've bought about eight pairs of these, including three that I ordered today. They last about 3-4 months on average. I really like the design, and the sound quality is quite sufficient for my casual on-the-go needs (I mostly listen to spoken podcasts anyway).I tried a different brand recently--a more expensive model--but that set only lasted 6 months, and wasn't a substantially-better experience in terms of sound quality. also, the other brand wasn't a behind-the-ears design, which is tough to go back to once you're used to this type of design. So overall I would say it wasn't worth what I paid for it. This model, even if it's prone to failure, is a better value overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banging transfers through cord!","review":"The sound quality and comfort are fine, but you can hear a loud thumping through the cord as it bounces on your body during a workout!

They are a combination of protection, best sound quality and confort. Hard to find these three on anything you buy. I waited a few months to rate this item as I believe a couple days even weeks is a short period of time to rate anything. I can honestly say this earphones rock = very dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound... breaking after 3 months!","review":"I like these headphones... but the right side has begun to short out after just 3 months of use.I will look elsewhere next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Value","review":"The headphones are a great value. I've seen the exact same product on the shelves for nearly double the price in local stores. They do a good job of supressing - but not eliminating - background noise and I don't think you'll find a better product for the price. If you want sound cancelling headphones, these are not for you. If you want top quality sound isolating headphones, you will pay approximately double this price. I can tell you that these headphones are way better than my stock I-pod heaphones for hearing music on the plane, bus, subway train or any other noisy place. I bought a pair for me, my wife and my three kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very comfortable and fall out easily","review":"These headphones came recommended from a friend. Unfortunately, I wanted to use them for running and they are clearly not for that. They fall out very easily, even when you do the whole \\"pull up on your ear and jam into your ear canal\\" thing.They even feel loose when sitting at a computer, which is disappointing.The case/wire-wrap is a joke.The sound quality is nice, though - much better than cheap headphones as you can actually hear some bass and low frequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so Phones","review":"These are supposedly \\"Noise Cancelling\\" earphones but they achieve this only with extra padding around the earpiece which create a very tight fit in the ear.

Although the peeler has a good feel in the hand, the blade is very dull. This is fine if you are peeling something very hard, where you can press down and achieve an acceptable cut, it is virtually worthless on softer items, like a spear of asparagus. If you want an all-purpose peeler, choose another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grip? Hardly.","review":"I normally like Oxo products because of how comfortable they are to hold (I have arthritis in my hands), but this one is a dud. The handle is too short. The handle is flat where it needs to be round (where your fingers curl around it). And it peels too thinly - when I peel carrots, the thin slices just cling to the carrot.I bought this peeler to replace a Hamilton Beach peeler that I'd taken to work, and I couldn't find the HB peeler on Amazon. I thought because this was Oxo, it would be good. I was wrong. I've brought the HB peeler home again."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm actually quite surprised there are so many good reviews and none that are negative. I almost lost my finger using this. :( It was quite a traumatic experience. I never had a knife cause this kind of damage so easily. Please be extra careful if you use this.

It's a little pricey, until you use it, and realize why you spent the money. The blades are sharp, and the peeling is smooth and precise. It's almost kind of fun to peel vegetables now, believe it or not. The handle is comfortable, and if this thing gives out, I would buy another. Great peeler!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What about us left-handers?!","review":"I really do like this peeler. It does an above average job on all the things I have tried it on. My two \\"gripes\\" about it would be that sometimes the peel sticks to it and you have to clear the cutting blade to keep going. I think that tends to happen with most peelers that I have used though. My major problem with this peeler is that the little scooping edge is only made for right-handers. You have to turn it around and really work hard to make it do what it is supposed to if you are left-handed. Why not put one on both sides?? This peeler was built for a right-handed world. Poor lefties...forgotten again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peeler, can't complain","review":"Great peeler, can't complain. The peeler is solidly built and has a tiny shovel type device on the side that lets you dig out imperfections in whatever you're peeling. When it comes to peeling, it gets the job done. Only reason, I'm not giving it 4 stars is because I have a cheaper peeler my mom gave me that peels just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HATED IT!!","review":"I can't even begin to express how much I hate this peeler. The blade is sharp, I will give credit where credit is due.It is not natural to hold the peeler in the manner necessary to peel anything. With the old standard peeler I was able to hold the vegetable and pull the peeler towards my thumb and in a complete motion I was able to spin a potato continuously and end up with one peel. When I tried peeling a potato with this \\"Y\\" peeler the skin came off in little pieces then I tried to peel a carrot and that also gave me little pieces instead of long slices.I am going back to the standard type of peeler which has worked wonderfully for 25 years that I have used it.I should never have tried to switch.Oh well... live and learn"},{"rating":"2","title":"I peeled a Turnip!","review":"I peeled a Turnip!

He tends to review films with an overly favorable eye. His year-end summary books always get me arguing with his points-of-view.Therefore, I was completely surprised when, after receiving this book as a gift, I fell completely in love with this book. This book shows an author completely in love with the movies. Here's a man who just wants so badly to share his favorites with his readers. The reviews are beautifully written and completely engaging. Instead of arguing about his point-of-view, I was again reminded of what a great writer Ebert is.While this book is written so that it can be picked and put back down as a reference, I found myself tearing through it in one sitting.

What's great is it's not just a list of Roger's favourite films but rather film's that are important, in other words, had a major cultural impact internationally. It's a great sampling from a variety of different genres and eras and gives the viewer the tools to then branch out with whatever films they are interested in themselves.And all the inside information in the films is great with Roger being a great one to deliver it considering he has lived through many of the most important moments in cinema history.

It is simply his opnion on films that he has a high regard for aesthetic, artistic or cultural reasons.One prime example is the inclusion of \\"Written on the Wind.\\" I recently viewed this film on DVD and was not overly taken by the movie. Basically, I did not really see why some film scholars regarded it so highly.

When pressing garlic, more comes up around the top than through the holes.Also, cleanup always includes poking a toothpick through the holes. My old zylzz went into the dishwasher and come out clean. This one takes 10 minutes to clean.This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in an OXO product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Agreed with other reviews. Problems:1. Holes too small, too much pressure to squeeze garlic2. No tool to clean the holes on the press. The fact that it comes out makes it a bit easier, but still need a toothpick or something.3. Because it took a lot of pressure to get the garlic through, I squeezed too hard and the screen broke in teeny pieces. So now I just crush and mince garlic with my french cutting knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks neat at first, but is a piece of junk.","review":"At first I thought this was a decent garlic press, but when the finish quickly deteriorated I began to have doubts. Then the screen shattered into tiny pieces without much effort while I was using it, sending shards of metal into my pan.If you are into nice, long lasting objects and tools, this is not the garlic press you are looking for. If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive fix that looks \\"cool\\", then this might work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Garlic Press","review":"Being that there are so far only two reviews, one with one star and one with five, I wanted to help provide some middle ground.This is surprisingly lightweight, and presses the garlic very nicely. It's very well-constructed and very comfortable to use. Yes, some garlic comes up from the chamber, but you just open it up, nudge it back in, and press it again and it all goes out the holes. The pressed garlic is a really nice chunky pasty consistency. The one problem with this: cleaning it requires a toothpick or a paper-clip to poke out the garlic that gets stuck in the holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great press","review":"I really like this garlic press. It is easy and very quick to clean if you use a small scrub brush (for dishes). Just press the brush into the holes under some water before the garlic dries onto it. You don't need to bother with a toothpick. I love how fine the garlic comes out of it without turning it to mash. I was looking for a fine garlic press and so far this works great. It pressed everything out except the thin inner skins. The only flaw with this press is after about a year of use the coating is starting to come off of it. Until I find one that is nicer than this I will replace it with same one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"The press part worked fine, But, for clean up it DID NOT rinse out easily. I had to use toothpick to clean. It is not worth the price. Going to go back to the simpler design. I still have my reciept and are going to return it. Wish my old one of over ten years had not broke it's handle. Can't find another like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Loretta's Best","review":"Thank goodness this wasn't the first Loretta Chase novel I read otherwise I would never pickup another one! I just recently discovered Loretta Chase and was thrilled to find her after reading \\"Not Quite a Lady\\" and \\"Mr. Perfect\\". I couldn't believe this was written by the same author! Not only was it missing the elements I loved about her other books (witty dialog, likable characters), but it spent way too much time on the mystery of the husband's killer. The heroine was far too emotional and prone to extreme tantrums. She was pathetic in her obsession with Comte D'Esmond, a man you never really got to know or like. I also agree with another reviewer that there was too much time spent on homosexual behavior. We get enough of this on TV and movies today, must we have it thrown into the historical romances too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I am an advid reader of romance, but I was very dissapointed with this book. While the plot sounded interesting, it took a long time to \\"get there\\". It was a struggle to finish this book. I speed read most of the pages. It just did not hold my interest. I do not usually write reviews, but I felt that I needed to for this book. Not a book I would reccommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and attractive H and h plus a good mystery","review":"Loved the tough heroine who helps peel the layers from the hero in an atmosphere of sexual/sensual tension while solving a mystery.

My reading experience didn't suffer from reading them out of order. I dearly love the tortured hero role and Ismal Delvina is one of the best. He achieved redemption after ten years penance as a government agent assigned all the worst cases. Our heroine was no simpering ninny either. I loved her reaction when Ismal confessed. The long wait to see them get together was well worth it. If only there had been an epilogue... dare we hope to see these characters again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Couldn't even finish it!","review":"Unlikable characters, dragging story line, and dark themes made this an awful read. I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them. This was just plain tedious. If you want good murder/romance read Amanda Quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book had it all!!!","review":"I couldn't put it down. Ismal and Leila were the strongest most perfectly matched pair I have ever read about. Her speech technique for Comte d'Esmond was so perfect I could hear his accent and even the tone of his voice. Great love with a mystery that, at least for me, didn't unravel till the end. Loved everything about this book. Looking forward to reading the 4th in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"One of Chase's other books contained a reference to the characters in this one. She said something to the effect of, \\"the husband lusts after d'Esmond, who's after the wife, who only wants to be left alone to paint\\". Right then, I wanted to read about Leila and d'Esmond, and Chase didn't disappoint with their appearance here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly..............dissapointed.","review":"Ms. Chase is a highly talented and interesting writer. However I found this book to be just plain awful.First of all there is a lot more mystery than romance. And the plot just seems to drag on and on and on...While I enjoy heriones that are strong willed. This one bordered on \\"lunatic\\". I just can't like a character who throws tantrum after tantrum and even hits the hero on the head with a chamber pot while screaming that she is going to kill him. And on the next page she is in his arms.... She was just way too dark for my taste.The hero is okay. Nothing out of the ordinary and the secondary characters are just fair.If you want to read an amazing book by Ms. Chase, then \\"Lord of Soundrels\\" is a wonderful choice. Pass on this one...wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch of Fate -- Going Back to the Basics of Moviemaking","review":"In an era when US movie screens are increasingly dominated by male-targeted flicks featuring explosions, violence, and special effects, it is a pleasure to see a US film that focuses on the \\"traditional\\" basics of film-making: dialogue and character development. This is not a big-budget movie, so don't expect to see lush million-dollar sets and aerial camera tracking shots. However, you may find yourself being moved emotionally by the story of two late thirty-something-year olds whose lives cross paths during a late-night traffic accident. A woman from New York City has come to a small town in North Carolina hoping to join her fianc��e, and a stressed-out businessman from Los Angeles has come to visit his elderly mother. After the accident, they get to know each other. As you learn about their family and personal struggles and aspirations, you become engaged in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching stories","review":"I have a copy of this but I bought this one for my sister-in-law because I knew she'd appreciate it.

Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I'm the mother of a two year old boy. I bought this book to read about other peoples relationships with their sons.

I was incredibly dissapointed. The novel, based on the true story of an indian girl who survives on an island alone for 18 years, was slow and tedious, and at times way too \\"mushy\\", as my brother would say. It has no rapport with young male readers, even though there are some aspects of adventure in the novel.

She was very picky and being a 1st time mom I was really frustrated when I wanted to get my daughter off the baby food and become more creative with fruits and vegetables. This book saved me! It gave me the confidence I needed to try new things with her. It's definitely a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice recipes","review":"Nice recipes, photos, and discussions.

I think not. The author says to add things like this to baby food to make it taste better... but that is not a good way to train your kids to eat their veggies, especially not a 6 month old. Not to mention it does not follow most accepted nutritional models and recommendations for infants. Don't get this book. Total waste of money. Instead just look on the internet for ideas. They are free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Pass!","review":"I bought this book on recommendation of a fellow mother and I feel like it was a total waste of money. The recipes call for ingredients like butter, fish, and citrus which I wouldn't give to my baby until 1.

This book had a lot of recipes that looked really tasty, however, most of the recipes added butter and salt which I didn't want to feed my 6 month old. There were a few simple recipes for purees but then most of the recipes were very involved and inpractical for my schedule. I found lots of much easier and healthier recipes for free online.

Because I really like my pediatrician, I bought this book without any doubt. All the recipes are interesting and they look really good and nutritious. My son actually likes the food I made with these recipes. It's so tasty, I finish it myself when he can't finish his food. Most of the recipes are fairly easy to make too. It's a plus for me as a working mom. I can make two kinds in one night that lasts for at least a week. However, be mindful with the cheese. There are some recipes that I found are way too salty for a baby because of the amount of cheese added. I thought salt is not recommended for baby less than 1 year old. But overall, I really like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but contradicts what our pediatrician told us","review":"Great recipes and the baby seemed to like most of them. The pediatrician advised us that we should not feed certain foods to the baby before 1 year but many of those foods are present in dishes in this book. Also, some of the items are, for lack of a better word, oriented around British tastes and are a little foreign to what you might have in a typical American fridge. But all in all, if you want to make babyfood yourself, this is a helpful way to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussy little book","review":"Some of the vegetable and fruit combinations were creative in this book, and it certainly has pretty pictures, but in terms of providing useful information and recipes, it was somewhat disappointing, and at times even insultingly simplistic: I.e., How to make banana mush: take a banana, peel it, and mash it with a fork and serve. Now, why would someone need to explain this in a book? I suppose if you really are at a loss in a kitchen, this book might offer some useful advice, but it is not for anyone who has even a minimum of cooking experience. Because some of the food combinations were so unique, this might be a good second or third choice for a baby food library, but I suppose I was looking for a more authoratative book with information on the whys and hows of food introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a Healthy Baby","review":"I really appreciate this book on how to feed your baby fresh meals that dont include preservatives and additives.

Babies should not have butter, berries, or spices. They only need pureed vegetables and fruits.

Initially she did not want to eat the food - I think because she was not used to baby food that has so much flavor. Now she loves them! I have tasted everything I have made her and would honestly eat these meals myself. When she is older and chewing foods, I will make these recipes is larger quantities for the entire family. I love that the meals can be frozen and I made several batches at once, so there is always a variety of foods at hand for her.

My daughter has loved everything I have made from this book so far; my husband and I have even eaten a few- with salt and seasoning added for adult taste- and enjoyed them.I do, however, agree with Lynn W.- USE WISDOM with certain recipes, since the author does not seem to follow the AAP's recommendations about when to introduce certain foods, and seems to lack a current understanding about food allergies in children.

There are a lot of tips that I might have forgotten about myself (like using unsalted butter). i recommend to anyone who is thinking about making their own baby food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy","review":"Feed your baby pure whole foods, not processed jarred foods.

This book has top 100 baby purees and is easy to follow and a must have for parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I enjoyed this book great instruction and recipes to keep baby's palette happy. I really enjoyed and would recommend this book especially if you plan to make food for your baby"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic resource that takes out the hassle of creating your own meals","review":"I bought this book when I first started weaning my son at 5 and a half months. The recipes are great, easy to follow and my son loves them all. I would have found it impossible to think up the combinations of tastes, textures and flavours on my own so have found this book to be invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I never thought I would make baby food for my children due to time constraints, but this book makes it simple, quick & easy. It tells you about how long it takes to make a recipe so I can make it when I have time & freeze it. My baby loves it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious recipes for baby (and parents)","review":"I've been making baby food from the recipes in this book since my son was 6 months old. So far, I've made about 15 of the recipes and all of them have turned out to be extremely tasty. I love how the recipes are divided into age groups.My son is now 10 1/2 months old and just becoming accustomed to solids with thicker textures that require chewing, so over the weekend I made the Pasta Risotto recipe. It was easy, fast, and amazingly delicious. I really couldn't believe how good it tasted (I'm going to make a bigger batch for myself this next weekend). My favorite, though, is the fried banana with orange juice and butter recipe. I would have never thought of something so simple but so GOOD.This book has taught me basic cooking skills and how to make amazing, diverse food for the baby. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Was Looking For","review":"I am very happy with my purchase. I will be making my own baby food at home and needed a good book to keep for reference and general guidance before I got started. I was looking for a book that had recipes, cooking tips, nutrition info, freezing and reheating info, and general rules of thumb for selecting, introducing and feeding baby solids. This book has just the right amount of everything in it. Each recipe has helpful icons that indicate age, yield, cook time and suitability for freezing. I like the layout of the book, they visual appeal, and the overall organization. I especially like the helpful \\"food facts\\" included throughout the book, for example, \\"carrots are more nutritious when cooked with a little fat, such as a pat of unsalted butter, as the beta carotene they contain is absorbed more readily.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Check with your family doctor or pediatrician first!","review":"I recommend checking with your Family Physician or Pediatrician before following the advice in this book.

The bio on the author does not state she has any nutritional education whatsoever. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labor intensive recipes!!","review":"This book has beautiful pictures and seemingly great recipes. The only problem is, most recipes require you to make homemade stock. (Babies can't eat store bought broth.) I love to cook, but boiling a chicken carcass every time I want to cook for my baby is not ideal.

However, this book made me rethink that policy. I like a steamy story but this book took steamy into boring territory. I pride myself on finishing books started but this one was an exception. I hope Ms kenyon gets back to the dark hunter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being BAD is GOOD!","review":"What a fun book! This is an anthology of 3 novellas about agents in B.A.D. (The Bureau of American Defense), a C.I.A. clone of sorts, based in Nashville. The first novella was a tad clich��d in plot, but the other two were a scream, especially the last one. Kenyon has a wicked sense of humor, making me laugh out loud over and over again. No kidding. Snappy dialogue, great sex scenes, fun characters. This book was an absolute delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon is my favorite author. Her books are not only adventuresome but entirely hot and sexy. I would recommend any of Ms. Kenyon's books. The Dark Hunter, B.A.D. and The League series are very imaginative and suspenseful. You care about the characters and want to keep reading to see what happens next. I just wish she could write a little faster. I seem to go through her books like water through fingers. If you are looking for fun, erotic and adventure, I highly recommend any of Ms. Kenyons books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fair","review":"I do not think it is fair to publish stories that have already been published in different anthologies without letting the reader know. I love Sherrilyn Kenyon and just never thought that I would purchase a book that I already read 2 out of the 3 stories. Out of respect for devoted readers, the author should warn us of repeat performances. I'm not going to review any of the stories because others have already done so. I'll just say that they were not great the first time around and certainly not worth paying again to read. I'll stick to Ms Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series and forget her BAD stories which are in fact pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Born To Be Bad? At least the title is true...","review":"I am a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's writings, but this book was just soft-core porn, and not even erotic porn! I was so disappointed while reading these three short stories. Really, I can enjoy a good (or bad) sexy Dark Hunter with everyone else, but reading about these uninspiring heroines and their sexual (but not at all sexy) encounters was just sad.I really thought the worst thing she had written prior to this was Vane Kattalakis humping Bride McTierney in Night Play, which to me read just like a National Geographic desription of how dogs have sex. Now she's just fallen into bad role-playing. I would not recommend this book to a Kenyon fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"I had hoped for better since I have been a fan of the Dark-Hunter series. Unfortunately, I didn't get too far in this one. It is highly unusual for me to stop reading a book regardless of how bad it is, but I managed with this one. The Bad series reads like fast money for it's author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where can I pick me up one?","review":"Another fun read from Sherrilyn Kenyon. All the Men have hearts of gold under rough exteriors and all the women are adored by them. What more could you want? The scenes between the couples are very sexy and very funny! Sure there's a little bondange, but what's a little bondage among friends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"I LOVE Sherrilyn Kenyon's books! I buy her books just because her name is on the cover. However I feel it is bad form to sell a \\"new\\" anthology of short stories that contain two of the 3 stories that have been published in other ***VERY RECENT*** romance anthologies. Next time I will check the contents *before* I spend almost $8.00 for one of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is great!","review":"I like this book. It arrives on time and quite new. It's concise and easy to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like reading a play","review":"Rhodes's third collection, like her first two, is really a poetic sequence, and though it stands firmly on its own, it's wonderful to sit down and re-visit her first two books, reading them cover to cover and then picking up this book, Mother Quiet.Her books are filled with multiple speakers and becuase she is so clever at fluctuating inflection and scene, we are never confused. Reading her work I feel like I am reading a play because story, scene and characters develop over time. Martha Rhodes is a writer to read, re-read, re-read again, and learn from. This is a wonderfully rich book and she continues to stretch and grow. Mother Quiet is an exciting book. Terrific work by a challenging and remarkably gifted writer. I look forward to her next book and am so glad this one was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy production","review":"The Washington Post is a great newspaper.

With the Kindle version I did find myself reading the paper more but the price is outrageous. It costs more than the home delivery edition without all of the content. Very disappointed, will not be continuing with the subscription once the free trial period ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"Really like reading the Wash Post on my Kindle, and the fact I get it delivered where ever I am. It is missing a lot of the pictures, however, that are in the print version, which I think takes away from the story. Also, the hundreds of years of layout practice by print versions isn't there yet. The order of the stories seems to be random, and box inserts do not always follow the main story.Overall, very good. Needs some improvements. Nice green way to read the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Missing Newspaper Essentials","review":"I just canceled my subscription after 4 weeks because:1. I would not get the edition downloaded on my Kindle until after my commute.2. The articles contain some pictures but never graphs or charts. For example, the printed version had a listing of the ranking of Government agencies with respect to climate survery. The Kindle version did not.3. While they have added letters to the editor, it is still missing comics, crosswords, soduku, sports box scores, standings and a lot of other information that makes a newspaper a newspaper. It has obituaries but not box scores! Come on.I'll go back to picking up the Express on my way to the Metro platform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy!","review":"The Washington Post has the reputation for excellence in journalism, but you wouldn't know it from the digital edition. I've never seen the print edition (I don't live in Washington), and would never look for it now.

I have been reading it since I was 10 years old. So, I was very excited to see it was available on the Kindle. I immediately got a trial subscription. Boy, was I disappointed.Most of my favorite items, such as comics, The Reliable Source, Real Estate Matters, are not included in the Kindle version.

Everything I wanted--it's pretty much the whole paper without the ads and pics--came through and it was easy to find and read everything I wanted. I'd suggest just buying a single edition first (75 cents) and seeing if it's what you want. That's what I did, and at least initially I'm very happy with the subscription I bought the next day. I think it's better to simply buy one edition cheaply than to go through the free-trial route: That way you won't have to go through the process of cancelling if it's not what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington Post","review":"I enjoyed reading the Kindle edition of the WP, and will do it again.

I receive Post articles by e-mail for free and it's great. I assumed I'd get a similar selection on my Kindle or better since I paid for it, but it seemed like a really condensed selection. There was practically nothing there, nothing worth reading. The following weekend I downloaded the Saturday/Sunday Wall Street Journal instead. It was everything I hoped for. Hours of really interesting reading. I bought the paper version of WSJ also and every article I happened to check in the print edition was also in the Kindle edition.

The essay needs to be digested slowly with multiple readings. Piper has added many footnotes to help guide the reader through the more difficult passages.The first part is Piper getting you prepared emotionally and physically for the intellectual climb.

Maupin takes a group of oddly matched tenants and a mysterious landlady and mixes it into the most interesting book I have read in years. My eyes were drooping at 2 AM, but I kept on to find out what happened next to the motley group. There are elements to suit anyone's reading preferences: Several mind-tingling mysteries and puzzles, romance galore (both straight and gay), a commentary on the state of our country (from many points of view), and a chance to absorb an interesting account of events during a period of American history that hasn't been taught in school.

And the end was good ,but not quite what I expected( I just will not spoil it for you) Most of the action is believable though some 'supernatural' events do put speed bumps in the story-line ,for me. I bought this for my Niece ,for CHRISTmas and got the BONUS of being able to watch it on-line for myself. Quite a good DUAL GIFT.

Walking out of the theatres I knew I would be purchasing the blu ray when it released. However, that was under the naive assumption it would come with a real digital copy. I was so disappointed when I saw UltraViolet copy next to the title, which like so many have already stated, is not really a digital copy at all. I liked the movie so much I pre-ordered it anyways, but just recently I came to my senses because it's not nearly worth the price as long as ultraviolet is attached to the product.

When I saw that it was only being released with the UltraViolet format I decided to give it a pass. I only buy movies that come as a package with the digital copy, due to constant travel.

Bears no relationship to the original concept. I seem to remember watching the 2009 original, and must have enjoyed it. Turned this off about 20 minutes into it. Had already lost interest.

The movie had some of the same elements that made the first one so good, but it seemed to drag on longer than it should have been. Towards the end I couldn't wait for it to be over.

I have been ripped off at least four times with this new marketing scheme. In the beginning, they promised something you could add to your computer, but that was an ambiguous promise at best, because they never came close to doing just that.I want a compatible digital copy that works through I-Tunes on my computer at home. If a glitch happens, then I want to be able to access the copy rather than find out the thing no longer works because of some kind of expiration date. The other option is a ripoff. If consumers would stop buying this option, it will vanish. I will be buying it through I-Tunes.I refuse to go through the frustration of dealing with Ultra-Violet a fifth time for nothing but added disgust for the people marketing this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherlock Holmes - NOT!","review":"This movie has nothing in common with the original Sherlock Holmes except the 1890s London setting and the names of three characters, who are completely mischaracterized. The competing brilliances of Holmes and his brother Mycroft are completely missing. Turning Holmes into an accomplished, brawling martial artist is so misplaced that they may as well have cast Dwayne Johnson in the title role. Idiotic in the extreme.Arthur Conan Doyle would be mortified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Shut it off half way through.

Their customer support is just as horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, choppy, NOT Holmes","review":"If you're maybe 12 years old and like video games then this may have cinematography you would like. Like watching a movie with a strobe light. Holmes is an erudite British detective, not a comic-book super-hero who always has a 3-day growth of beard. A terrible waste of some otherwise decent costumes and sets. They basically took a cheezy Kung Fu action movie, changed the name of the character to Holmes and set it in turn-of-the-century England. Take away the scenery and make Sylvester Stallone the lead and you have a low-budget shoot-em-up action movie. Zero stars. And, subtract a few more stars for the total disrespect of a classic character."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this was terrible","review":"terrible movie. I do not recommend.

But I will NEVER buy a product that only offers an ultraviolet digital copy. In fact, I have stopped purchasing bluray packages that offer the ultraviolet copy.

Such abominable casting was a tragedy of positively Hellenistic proportions to a true Holmes aficionado.That said, my husband rented Game of Shadows last week and I was watching it before I realized what it was. To my astonishment, I found myself sucked in and thoroughly enjoying the experience. The only thing that bothered me (spoiler) was the incredibly trite \\"super villain amassing super weapons in order to start a war for profit\\" plotline. That part was boringly predictable and quite a letdown after the way it had been building up to that point. The sudden shift to comic book style villain was jarring and disappointing.All in all, it was still a dramatically visceral take on Holmes and his world enjoyable enough to make me watch it twice and then rent the first installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"surreal","review":"An interresting adaptation of Doyle's attempt to end the Sherlock stories with Holmes's death-electrifying action.The slowed action sequences allow us to see the character's thinking processes, an interesting story advancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The movie it self is great and everything came in the mail like you just picked it up from the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful, not worth watching","review":"As a kid I loved the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories and I wound up loving the original Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes -- Sherlock was tougher, funnier and hilariously played by Robert Downey Junior. Unfortunately this sequel loses the entire point of a Sherlock Holmes story: he's supposed to use his idiosyncratically brilliant deductive powers to solve mind-bending mysteries. In this movie Sherlock is more of an action figure who fights all the time, pursues a sloppy plot of international intrigue blah blah blah, and never solves anything. It's pretty sad: it turns out that a Sherlock without a confounding murder mystery is just an irritating twit with a few mildly colorful sidekicks. In a word: avoid. See the BBC production instead, it's far more Sherlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fraudulent Sequel","review":"What happened to Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Professor Moriarty? They are nowhere to be found in \\"A Game of Shadows\\" - a bad sequel to the 2009 original. Instead of a Holmes adventure, the producers made a James Bond retread set in the Victorian era. The film is a painful shambles: two hours of action-movie clich��s and cheap laughs minus the suspense, mystery and inventiveness of its predecessor. Only the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law survives intact - undercut by a fraudulently misguided script and Guy Ritchie's helter-skelter direction. The character names should have been changed to prevent Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from spinning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the most BORING movies I've ever seen","review":"I liked the first sherlock holmes, but this one was one of the most BORING movies I've ever seen.

It was completely lacking in dialogue or story--these are the key ingredients to any Guy Ritchie film, so I was doubly disappointed in that vein. Maybe I liked the first one too much, or maybe I like Sherlock (BBC) too much, because I could not stomach that much of this. I am selling it back largely unseen.

The casting of Eric Porter in the Brett series was a stroke of inspiration seldom encountered in television or anywhere else. That mountain of crags WAS Moriarty. He has been replaced here by a bearded cherub. But then this is the type of film that cannot be photographed with too much sharpness lest it be taken for a commercial film when heaven knows the director is making an A.R.T. film, the kind they drain of color except for flesh tones. I earnestly hope that they get the lead actor they wanted all along for the following films: Jackie Chan! He would fit right in.

I complained about Harry potter and now this one. iTunes is going to be the way I get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Having liked the first movie I was anxiously awaiting the release of the sequel. It turned out to be quite a disappointment, aside from some pleasant backdrops. There's nothing sinister about the villain and Holmes doesn't come across as anything special, certainly not the master of deductive reasoning that made the character. The plot was boring and mostly left unresolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive advertising","review":"This is a great movie but what is not great is the deceptive advertising that goes with it. I thought that I was getting a 2-disc version of the movie,dvd and digital copy. There is no copy, you get one disc. There was a little piece of paper on the front of the case that said something about going online and getting the digital. I didn't have any desire to do that so threw the whole thing away. Like most other things, they are now trying to rip off people with clever advertising - you don't get what you think you are, less for you money. They should not even mention digital copy or anything else, just tell it like it is - you are getting a DVD, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"panders to homosexuals","review":"The first 40 minutes were just so-so. Nothing special, and at that point you can't even tell where the movie is headed. At about 42 minutes into the movie is when the train scene starts. During the train scene \\"fight\\", Holmes is dressed like a woman. He struggles with Watson, and they engage in body \\"positions\\" which scream \\"homosexual\\". Yuck. I didn't need to see that. As the train scene continues, Holmes is half naked and says \\"Watson, lie with me\\" (i.e., lie down next to him while avoiding the bad guys). Both of these scenes clearly pander to homosexuals and the gay agenda. That's when I turned it off.Was there more of this behavior in the movie? I don't know, and I wasn't interested in finding out. Maybe some people are okay with that sort of thing, but I am not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow to start but still a good movie.","review":"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are awesome together in this movie.

I enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"Robert Downey Jr. makes a great Holmes and brings his unique talent to this classic tale. You will want to see more of this Sherlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great formula","review":"The cast is great in their roles and Mr. Downey plays Holmes like I pictured him in my head when I was reading these type of stories when I was younger. The gritty look at the genius and neurosis of Holmes makes him more human than other versions of this complex character. If you have the peculiar luck or misfortune to have a genius friend, particularly one you can stand to hang out with or with luck, relate to, you will recognize how spot on he is done. With the addition of Professor Moriarty it is brilliant to see them fight back in forth without throwing a punch, the chess analogy is used very well to show them in a high stakes contest and treat it like a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a gift","review":"This movie was a gift and as far as I know the owner loves it.

This movie is great, but suffers slightly by comparison because it wasnt quite as good.I like how they modified Sherlocks planning out anticipating fight scenes.

I enjoyed this one, Sherlock Holmes: A game of Shadows, even more than the last one. This time his detective skills and his other physical fighting skills are tested to the limit as he matches wits with his old nemesis. I imagine some old fans of Sherlock Holmes may not enjoy this more modern version of the brilliant detective, but I found Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal to be delightful, refreshing and brilliant.In conclusion, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you should enjoy watching this film.Rating: 4 Stars.

I need this digital copy in my itunes so I can put it on my ipod (it's an 80GB ipod classic), and although it is downloaded to my computer, it can only be accessed through the Flixster app which does not let you move it to the desktop or itunes.I contacted customer support and they told me to download the Flixster app to my iphone or Android.

We get to travel all over Europe in 1891 or a reasonable facsimile.The year is 1891. France and Germany are at each other's throats. There is a series of bombings. Most people pin it on anarchists. But Holmes has a different theory; we know what that theory is. We get to go along as Holmes proves his theory. What about Dr. Watson? Well it seems he's getting married. Will this throw a wrench into the works? And how can the new Mrs. Watson felt the Sherlock's brother is fond of her?of the new Mrs. Watson?

It is still a very fussy system and to me not worth the money, time and effort to acquire. I am still not sure what I have and how long I might be able to access it. You can download to UltraViolet - or perhaps Sony - or to Flixster, and watch it on UltraViolet - or maybe Flixster, but if you download to UltraViolet, Flixster might not be able to find it...and each account requires a new setup and password and you must be sure to use the same signin to each account or you will wind up with multiple accounts that can't be merged . . .just not worth it right now.

It was \\"entertaining\\" to watch him in this role and I have great respect for him as an actor.This film is a story of Holmes and Watson joining forces once again to outwit their most cunning and dangerous adversary, Professor James Moriarty. There were scenes that are surprisingly interesting and others can be quite dull.

It's SLOW, dull, you don't care about the characters (even the 2 leads), and it's boring!! Avoid this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"Sherlock Holmes; A Game of Shadows was terrible and completely unbelievable. It was too much like watching a cartoon or worse a video game. There is entirely too much going on and seems like it was made for individuals who have a short attention span. I dread to think what the third installment will be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPP-OFF!","review":"I'm shocked that this movie was released due to the blatent plagerism committed. This movie was a copy of the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Do people have the memory of a gold fish? How do so few people not release if you pay to see this crap you've paid to see the same movie twice. Both movies have the same story, plot, twist, character development, villian, setting and only the comic version of the LOFEG has Sherlock Holmes as the leader of the group. For some reason the studio changed the lead to Quartermain from Sherlock. However, both protaginists have the same fate at the end of both films. Guy Ritchie should've stuck to indie flicks cause he obviously can't hack it in the major league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coding Error","review":"Every 20 mts or so there is a judder on the blu ray disc which is clearly a coding/production error.

The pace is plodding and just so bad I could not sit through the entire film...made it about 1 hour 15 minutes before I gave up. Even if it got better, I really don't care. The first half was that much of a disaster....why bother? Save your money and go to the library to get this if you must...which is what I did so I don't feel bad about wasting real cash here.

The flashback sequences that are supposed to explain things more often than not are just as confusing as the movie. The slow motion scenes after a while just got irritating. At least the ending brought a bit of clarity, but it was a mess getting there. With some better direction and editing, perhaps this would have been a more enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bait and switch on teh digital copy","review":"everyone who pre-ordered this got screwed as the \\"digital copy\\" was the bogus ultraviolet garbageDO NOT BUY THIS VERSION THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE ULTRAVIOLET GARBAGE WILL BE FOR PEOPLE TO NOT BUY THESE VERSIONS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra violet is a SCAM!!!","review":"Ultra violet is not a copy, but access to a copy.

Ultraviolet is merely a copy in an online cloud and only accessible when ULTRAVIOLET deems it prudent to allow access. This is not to be confused with a digitial copy that you can actually have on your portable device or more precisely, your APPLE device.

I thought it was smart, action packed and that the ending was terrific. However, I will not be purchasing this Blu-Ray due to the fact that a real digital copy will not be included.

I have to add my lumps as well as the majority of other reviewers. The Motion picture industry continues to drive a wedge between themselves and the buyer by instituting things like this. Even digital copy rights are rediculous, due to the fact that you can only download one version to one type of device (either WMV for windows based players, or Quicktime for Apple). This Ultraviolet thing takes it one step further.In my humble opinion... When honest buyers aren't afforded the benefit of having there own personal copy to share between members of the same household, you run the risk of them just going to get it illegally. If you want pirating to stop... stop doing crap like this. The music industry seems to have gotten the point.Remember when they tried to make CDs \\"unripable\\" by encripting them. All it did was irritate the person buying it, because they couldn't play it on their MP3 device. Really short sited folks.

It was entertainingly funny, dramatic, & the special effects were pretty awesome. They used some really neat camera effects that I think are becoming the new \\"thing\\" in fantasy/action movies such as this and \\"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter\\", etc. Robert Downey Junior was great as a quirky, cross-dressing, embalming fluid drinking, butt-kicking Sherlock Holmes & Jude Law was fabulous as his Jimminy Cricketlike backup with a bang, Dr. Watson. The plot roled along nicely from start to finish leaving me actually clapping at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of Shadows entertains","review":"I've enjoyed Robert Downey's resurgence in the Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man series.

All in all a good sequel and the introduction of Jared Harris (the English guy in \\"Mad Men\\") as Moriarity is brilliant casting.The extras are worth getting the DVD for.

This was the first foreign show that I ever loved to watch. Ten years later I watched this in the US, still warm, funny, sexy, and thrilling.The first season is the best with a lot of subtle but intoxicating chemistry between Lois and Clark. Their characters are best described through their wedding oaths (4th season). Clark Kent is a man with \\"gentle grace and quiet strength\\", which Dean Cain is naturally gifted to portray. Teri Hatcher has successfully shown the evolution of Lois Lane, from a cutthroat career girl into a loving wife. The supporting characters are very good as well. Luthur, Perry and Jimmy are all memorable.It's a show that I may still enjoy when I am 37."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, good dvd set.","review":"The dvd has a couple neat interviews and behind the scenes footage.

Of course, I agree with Jean-Luc when he says if you're going to do it, you should do it right. Meaning they should be remixed in 5.1, digitally remastered, and, of course, have all the extras (commentaries, bloopers/outtakes, deleted scenes, as well as original TV spots/trailers) Fans truly appreciate the extras.With the success of Smallville, Dean and Teri coming out with new series' this fall, the upcoming Superman movie and the recent death of \\"Superman\\" Christopher Reeve, maybe the studios will be convinced enough that it would be worth their time/money.

Even though not geared to my age group(50ish), I am a big fan of Smallville and have the 1st 2 seasons on DVD already. I would think the popularity of that show and the fact they are from the same studio(WB)might get the studio execs to believe that there is a renewed interest in Superman that might get new viewers for Lois and Clark if it were released on DVD. I bought the 1st season on VHS from Columbia House and made my own DVD copies. The tapes were eagerly snapped up when I sold them on Ebay. The quality is still VHS though and I am ready for the other 3 seasons.

John Shea is a delectably evil Lex Luthor, and remoulding Perry White into an Elvis freak is a stroke of genius. The Daily Planet sets cleverly reflect the influence of a 1930's comic and romantic sensibility that permeates the show. Dean Cain can't act (to put it mildly), although he certainly looks the part. It doesn't detract from the series too much because everyone else is so good, and the scripts are generally witty. Even so, Christopher Reeve's Superman (although not the film) seems more and more definitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best tv shows, EVER!","review":"This show was my absolute favorite when it was on ABC, and to this day, it is still one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen.

No show before and no show since has given me a wonderful and happy feeling just by watching it. Smallville comes close, but it mainly lies on my love for everything Superman which started when I started watching Lois and Clark. Despite what most say about Dean Cain's ability as an actor, his wonderful talent was shown very much in this series. Teri Hatcher's sass and in-depth vulnerability made Lois Lane seem more like a woman you could possibly be, minus the numerous attempts on her life. John Shea, one of the, if not the best Lex Luthor of all time. Malicious and sex appeal made him the perfect villain opposite the mild-mannered Man of Steel. A wonderful show and a dream come true for Lois and Clark's fans all over. Hopefully we won't have to wait long for the next three seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Watching","review":"I have been waiting for these shows to air on tv ever since they stopped producing them.

You cannot be a real Superman fan if you are speaking negative against the shows. If yall was to pay attention, The shows changed with the times. If you go back to the very FIRST Superman and come all the way up to now, you'll notice changes had to be made.

I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself). I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today. I've been disappointed. I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information.I was between this one and the Carson commentary. Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.

I could identify with both. Being of mixed origin myself I knew just what Jai must have gone through. I have not yet read the sequel to this novel but am hoping to get my hands on it soon.

What could have been an interesting story is spoiled by heavy-handed paperback-romance techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above the Pack","review":"Captain David E. Meadows rises to the top of the military thriller with Joint Task Force: Liberia. His growing mastery of suspense and characterization captures the reader with his opening sentence: \\"Ullma pulled the children closer.\\" From here, he delves into the terror of ordinary citizens and children suddenly pitched into the lap of rebel extremists without a lifeline in Liberia. He not only paints the resulting American military rescue scenes with realism and true-to-life dialogue, he presents an interesting political scenario that nails the hidden agenda of a so-called ally: France. This is an author who knows the insides-out of his subject and gives us a fly-on-the-wall view of real possibilities in a world that now rocks with anti-Americanism. For this reason he stands apart from Tom Clancy and is building his own throne in military fiction. Kudos for the first of his Joint Task Force series. Can't wait to read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Meadows new series will be hard to top!","review":"Oh, what a wonderful beginning book to this new series! I could not put the book down.

There are valuable suggestions for organizing and writing the story of your family. Even something as basic as point of view is an important consideration: do you tell a third-person story of a family, or a first-person story of your search for ancestors? Documentation is important, even if you intend your story for family only. You may need to consider how best to handle \\"skeletons in the closet\\" and discrepancies (multiple versions of the same story). Sharon Carmack has done an excellent job with her clear writing, and I hope she publishes an updated edition of this book. The chapters on publishing and marketing in particular deserve a complete rewrite; there is so much to add now on e-publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliving my family history!","review":"Being in the middle of writing my history, I now have this excellent book to inspire me to go on.

While I like the characters and even the H/h of Nikolas as Paige I really didn't think the story focused much on them. Seemed like they were hardly together. Yeah they knew each other before and Paige spent time remembering that but really there wasn't much interaction between the two to warrant a romance.

I do not feel that the author focused enough on the oils themselves.In agreement with most of the other reviewers that rated this book low, I feel that this book was used as advertisement for Young Living's oils and the Raindrop method.

Annointing oils were never distilled oils (essential oils)and no where in the Bible is there any reference to distilled oils. Olive oil was infused with various aromatic plant material (not distilled) but this was never used to promote healings, it was only symbolic. God did the healings Himself and they were called MIRACLES. Did you miss that part, Mr. Stewart? I'm very sorry but you are obviously no theologian but merely a slick sales promoter for what appears to be Young Living's essential oils and this heretical book. Shame on you also for using Christianity & religion as a sales gimick. Double shame on anyone who is gullible enough to buy this book. It is not of God nor of His Word. If you want to know about Biblical healings read the Bible, not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS SO BAD I RETURNED IT!","review":"It certainly wasn't what I expected. 25% of the book repeats in several different ways how many times specific oils/plants/herbs are mentioned in the Bible. A large portion of the book is then devoted to pages the reader can use if he/she wishes to give a seminar. Of course, one would have to purchase the oil mixtures in order to give the seminar.

He claims essential oils don't kill people, but doctors and hospitals and drugs kill lots and lots and lots of people. He also says having a mastectomy when you've got breast cancer is an amputation, not a cure, but oils cure people. I hope none of you out there with breast cancer choose to reject medical treatment in favor of essential oils, because not getting medical treatment when they need it DOES kill people.That was just the chapter on \\"allopathic\\" medicine.

This book begins the same way -- which is fitting, since with Piercy the odd mix of characters is what propells the action, and the readers' interest. In this novel, seven or eight characters whirl through twelve-month's time in a small town on Cape Cod. Domestic bliss is challenged by the usual obstacles: envy, longing, and the common desires of the heart. Rifts arise between lovers and strangers come together.

Cape Cod residents depend on a freshwater aquifer that is constantly threatened by pressure from the surrounding saltwater. There is a mysterious quality about this water that makes the locals have sex frequently and in all sorts of combinations, and it is always very good. This unusual phenomenon is irresistibly appealing to a recent graduate who wants to apply the formulas learned in the creative writing seminar at Cape Cod Community College. The exercise has all the depth of an expanded version of a TV guide synopsis of the daytime soaps. One character appears to be developed with some complexity, but her problem is dismissed casually and accurately by another character as the result of menopausal depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"does NOT hold ID","review":"Although the description says \\"Ideal for carrying money, keys, and I.D.\\" you cannot put your ID there.

Neither the car adapter nor the USB cable connected to a PC provides enough power to charge the Palm appreciably over the length of a normal commute. (under 60 minutes)The only reason this doesn't get one star is the USB cable remains useful, albeit quite pricey compared to the equivalent product elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, if a bit pricey...","review":"Basically, this kit comes with two items. a USB cable, and a plug for your car adapter.I purchased this so I can sync my Tungsten E with my laptop as well as my desktop.

If 'Strong Lion' is the sound of Uncle Bob post-GbV, then all will be well with the world (at least the Indie Rock World, of which he is king). I love the fact that everybody's Fading Captain still gives the 7\\"/single format his time -- and big thanks to Must Destroy! for providing a 'Compound Eye' warning shot over the bow. Other than the jangly pep of 'I'm a Strong Lion' (is Bob ready to do a Christian rock album?), the single features 2 previously unreleased tracks (demos from 'Universal Truths and Cycles'). 'Breadcrumbs For The Whales' is a slow burner; almost bedtime storylike. 'Inchworm Parade' (exclusive to the CD single) is classic Robert Pollard solo material, sounding much like a 'Waved Out' outtake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin A/C Charger for StreetPilot C Series","review":"A standard A/C charger for a Garmin StreetPilot Series GPS.

But these are why it is such a worthwhile version -- more true to the essence of an epic: a story for the people filled with meanings on many levels. Be captivated! (then analyze. From here you may go on to the treatises about the Mahabharata). But when you first read The Iliad and The Odyssey, I hope you first read them as stories and had a sense of why spoken tales like these are, well, epics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused narrative","review":"I have today finished reading William Buck's retelling of the Mahabharata and am disappointed. English-language readers might be better advised to read Rajagopalachari version to get an overview of the epic.I should like to mention that I have Indian antecedents and have read various abridged translations of the Mahabharata in both English and Gujarati.This rendition is riddled with careless editing of the narrative. For example, the entire episode of the Aswamedha is omitted from the narrative yet Buck refers to Yudhisthira as \\"King of Kings\\".Besides removing important events and characters Buck displays a lack of understanding of dharma. An example will suffice: Buck has Arjuna marry Uttara, the daughter of Virata at the end of the 13-year exile -- since Arjun had been her teacher this act would be adharma. (Arjun's son Abhimanyu marries Uttara in Vyasa's Mahabharata.)Overall I cannot recommend this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emphasis On Morality!","review":"In this adaptation of the classic, William Buck retells the >3400 year old Sanskrit epic verse, the \\"Mahabharata.\\"This text provides detailed interaction between the figures engaged in the Bharata war that took place between the Kurus people and the Pandus or Pandavas people. The actions of the warriors of both peoples are portrayed in both a heroic and moral context, and it should be understood that the Mahabharata is a reenactment (allegorical) of a cosmic moral confrontation (by the gods), and not simply an account of the cataclysmic battle.Buck's version of the original is written in a smooth flowing and interesting way and is a good introduction to Dharma, Indian mythology, Hinduism, and the caste system. I rate Buck's version at four stars for an attempt at a flowing novel, but being a little \\"disjointed,\\" and lacking somewhat in detail. All in all, well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"This book is truly bout to br looked upon as just \\"a book,\\" as it pertains to historical times!

Anna Zilboorg insists that knitters understand what they are doing, not lamely follow instructions for techniques or patterns. Starting with first principles, she takes her readers step by step from the most fundamental concepts about how stitches are formed all the way through the most sophisticated techniques. She asks us to stop, observe, and think, and in so doing assumes the best of us--that we are aspiring to be artisans, not knitting machines.This is a must-have book for any serious knitter, novice or advanced.

On the contrary his dictatorship was very, very mild. And he had a lot of humanity. Nothing to compare with Hitler or even worse with Stalin. The film shows only the bad aspects of Mussolini, but does not show the many achievements Mussolini did during his time. It's interesting to read the very positive comments some political people did about Mussolini before the WW2: particularly Winston Churchill and Austen Chamberlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' story","review":"This documentary is about ALL the wrong things Mussolini did, and NOTHING about the good things.

History is unflatering to Mussolini because there was nothing good about the man. I think the only thing missing is that the Italian people are given a pass for their conduct during WW2, and history needs to be more honest in its assesment of them.If Mussolini had won in Greece would they have been so down on him so quickly?What if Italy had won in Egypt?

It claims to be washable and while it is, it recommends a front load, commerical washer which I don't have. I washed it in our regular washer and it did fine.

This one is nearly the same visibly and is plush but I would say has about 30% less filler and is less robust. The price is about the same.

The last act (at the jail) is also probably better in this version than the other two. In the first act, and the most important second act, however, the Kleiber and Domingo version(s) seem to get much closer to the operetta's spirit, frivolity, and joie de vivre; it's too bad that those gems will forever remain trapped in their pre-Blu-ray, full screen, medium. But for those of you with widescreen HDTVs, who have grown tired of the fullscreen (1.33:1) black (or worse, grey) sidebars, this Bluray Fledermaus takes full advantage of your HDTV's entire widescreen aspect, and it's not likely that you will be disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience, wasted time.","review":"I really wanted to see this one on high definition(yes, it is shown as widescreen on the back cover) but it looks that the disk manufacturer was not been ready for this release.I am sending the second disk back to Amazon for the same reason: error 408bc00d.

I hated cleaning out all the filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt slips off too often","review":"I thought maybe it was just me, but now that I read the other reviews I see there's a general problem with this vacuum. The belt tends to slip off fairly often. The last time it happened on my vacuum, it began rubbing on the plastic housing that surrounds the belt. It got hot enough to melt the plastic in several places to the point that the vacuum is beyond repair. I'm going to see if the store will let me return it so I can buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILED AFTER 4 MONTHS NORMAL USE - COMPANY SAYS NO WARRANTY COVERAGE","review":"Bought this because I heard that it was decent machine for the money.

I wasn't even in the market for a new vacuum. I loved my old vacuum, or so I did. When I used this Bissell on what I thought was a clean carpet, the amount of dust, cat fur, and who knows what else that came out of the carpet was astonishing. It pulled up the carpet pile with its powerful suction so that now my carpet looks and feels new again. I love the dirty/clean light feature. It does a fabulous job on my hardwood floors too, getting into corners on both sides of the machine. I am so impressed with this vacuum's performance that I am placing an order for one for my mom as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product. Good price","review":"I like my vacuum cleaner a lot. It serves the vacuuming needs of my 1BR apartment very well - both the hardwood floors and the carpet. I like the attachments and the red light for dirty, green for clean system. I also like the bagless feature, it is so easy to empty! Good suction and good attachments. If I had a more complicated place with stairs and lots of nooks and crannies, this might not be the best vacuum cleaner because of its size and weight. But it's perfect for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for pet hair!","review":"This vacuum has good suction and decent attachments. However, if you are going to be sweeping up pet hair then do yourself a big favor and don't buy this vacuum. The hair, along with most of the other waste gets caught in the upper part of the chamber. In order to remove it, you have to reach into there with your hands and physically remove the filth. This is tedious, disgusting & unsanitary and totally defeats the purpose of a bagless vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD VACUUM","review":"I really like this vacuum. Love the bagless feature. It has incredibly strong sucking power. The attachments are all very handy and convenient. My only complaint would be you can't really get under things very easily. The handle doesn't go down very far toward the floor so you can only go so far under tables, etc. Other than that, I really recommend it. A great vacuum for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Vacuum that gets the job done","review":"I received our new Bissell and was able to get it up and vacuuming with in 5 mins. I did a basic test by taking our old GE vacuum and vacuuming a 2' x 4' area. I then took the new Bissell and vacuumed the same area. All I can say is yuck. I pulled out the container and I was amazed at what this vacuum picked up that our old vac left behind.A couple of minor things I noticed. When the vac is in its upright position the brush bar keeps running. While this isn't that bad, you have to be careful if you are using this machine close to sheets or loose fabric.The 2nd thing is when I was vacuuming around our coffee table the front guard got caught under the edge of the table. I had to work a little bit to get the head out from under it.Overall this is a great vacuum for the price and is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great machine!","review":"This vacuum is outstanding, 5 stars! The turbobrush works really well on my stairs and upholstery and I was amazed how much dirt was in the dirt cup when I was done cleaning my house! The other attachments are great to. I have 2 dogs and a cat so I am constantly vacuuming, this vacuum is really doing the job! The clean filter indivator light is also good to have so I know when my filters need chanign or cleaning. I love my pets but hate their hair and this vacuum does a good job at getting all of the hair, even those deep in the carpet. I recommend this vacuum to anyone who wants clean floors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous cleaning machine","review":"We moved into this 10 yr old house of all dates 9/11/01 and we think it had never had a serious vacuum cleaning even with our present filter queen - we just bought this mdl 3596 and had to empty the dirt container 3 times - it was an off color blue carpeting but now it looks like its brand spanking new - we'll probably be able to breathe better etc. Would very highly recommend anyone that is in the market for a vac cleaner to hit upon this one - we thought our 30 yr old filter queen was good - it doesn't hold a candle to the modern technology of this Bissell unit. Can't say enough about this machine and ease of use = can't find any fault with it whatsoever.

Cleaning filters, unclogging the hose, reattaching the hose, etc... It's dusty and messy and has been since about the 3rd use. The only thing that's been consistent is the dust coming back out. It's too loud and messy and I'm kicking it to the curb next trash pickup. Wish me luck on my next attempt! Dirt Devils and Bissells are out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea for a vaccum, poor quality..","review":"I bought this vaccum because the middle canister comes out so you don't have to carry the entire vaccum when cleaning stairs. After having this vaccum for a little more than 8 months I am very unhappy with it. The dial on the bottom is stuck so that I can not change it from carpet to bare floor settings. The attachment that you use to clean stairs doesn't have any suction. I have to litteraly pick things off the stairs & put it down the hose! I thought bagless vaccum would be great, not having to deal with the bags & running out to buy them... I was wrong! When I empty the canister, dirt & hair go everywhere, making a huge mess for me to clean up. I think my next vaccum will be an Oreck. The bag idea seems a bit old fashion, but it is a lot cleaner. I am really sorry I bought this Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This vacuum is junk, it has to many filters that plug up with dust and dirt, then you have to take them all apart to clean the filters if you want to suck up anything.

However, and that's a big however, the wheels squeaked from very early on. I thought I could get used to it, or that my husband could fix it, but after a year, I had to get rid of it! It drove me insane! The noise was like fingernails on a chalkboard. It was high pitched, and never ever let up. My husband is pretty mechanically inclined, meaning he should have been able to fix it if it was fixable, but he never could get it to stop. I can't believe I just spent over $100 again in a little over a year on a vacuum, but I just couldn't stand it anymore. Maybe I just got a dud, I don't know, if it weren't for the wheels, I'd for sure still use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing in the center of these bones like when you buy them at the store!","review":"I usually buy these at my local pet shop, but thought I'd buy these in the bulk package. I wasn't very happy with them, because the center's of all these have completely cleaned out. My dogs like to chew through the hard marrow usually left behind. They also like the other stuff in the center of the bones when you buy them from pet stores. All that's left on these bones is what you see on the outside, which isn't much. My dogs wouldn't even chew on these ones, for more than about 20 minutes. They chew on the ones from the store with all the gunk, and marrow in them for days. So, while I like them due to being less messy, it's really about the dogs opinion of them, and they didn't rank them very high on their chew list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right movie","review":"I was hoping for the fun, happy cheerfulness of Jennifer Anniston in Wanderlust.

On applying the 4th and final coat, about half paint ended up crinkling. I didn't change technique or anything.After finding this epoxy spray paint, I literally sprayed ONE coat that was very thick and perfect every time.

Don't assume bagless means convenience or less mess. The unit is high maintenance, requiring frequent filter disassembly and cleaning. The dirt never makes it to the dirt container. After several calls to Bissell customer service and new filter kits, the representative claimed the unit is not suited for everyday or light vacuuming. Seems the small particles clog the filter and restrict access to the dirt container. I don't believe the unit is capable of handling heavy vacuuming due to its poor suction.

The fit and finish is great, with no less than 3 filters (2 are washable). It is very easy to empty also.The carpet height selector did feel a little iffy when I first used it, it made this screaching noise, would have sworn it was broken, the trick is to push down and twist it initially to \\"brake\\" it in.

I especially like the cyclonic cup system and the way you can remove the cup and all the chambers for cleaning (I do it in the tub and use the shower nozzle). That's a must with this machine ... keep it clean or it won't work well. I think this is the frustration some people have with these bagless vacuums.Filters should be cleaned each time it's used ... and it takes a few minutes plus drying time.The turbo brush works well ... but you can't work it too hard or you will get the \`melting' that others here complain about. You need to have a light touch to keep the roller spinning at high speed and if you are using this thing for more than 20 minutes at a time, you need to give it a rest.All of these consumer vacuums are plastic (even the ones costing $400+) so be reasonable when using it.

He had very little advice on what specific hands to select, how to play pre-flop, how to play post-flop, not to mention very little on play at the turn and after the river. I really enjoyed his second book on hold'em, but I want to warn anyone that is thinking about getting this book not to expect very much out of it.

It seemed so contrived and stereotypically alpha-male macho, and did not add to the story or the characters. I can accept that a certain amount of this kind of thing might find it's way into stories involving pimps, prostitutes, murders, mafioso, and the like, but it just didn't add to the story at all, and seemed more out of place in otherwise well written story. Is this here to titilate us? Spare me, please.I did go ahead and read all three, so it wasn't enough to stop me from reading what I'd brought along, but I won't buy any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aurelio Zen Lite","review":"Fans of the late Michael Dibden's Aurelio Zen novels will enjoy this. Camillieri does not write as well as Dibden, but this may be a problem with the translation. While Dibden based all his Zen novels in Italy (with the occasional excursion abroad), he wrote in English. Indeed readers who are familiar with Dibden's Blood Rain may get something of a sense of deja vue about the opening scene in The Shape of Water.This is also quite a short novel and a lot happens fast, so reading it it requires concentration. I read it in about an hour and half and it certainly held my attention to the end. My only serious criticism is that too many characters are introduced too quickly which makes it hard work to try and remember who is who. Maybe this will be less of a problem as one reads more books in the series and gets to know the characters - or at least the policemen and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"most satisfying indeed!!","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable adventures in mystery - largely because it is original, with a unique bone-dry taste - the Sicilian scene is glorious and the characters are quite luscious.... i look forward to reading the others in this series......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong author voice","review":"Loved the characters and the setting.

It is impossibly flat-I had to read the first chapter 3 times because I felt like I had to be missing something- and to me, under developed. It seemed like so much was left out in regard to introducing characters, and then just having them evaporate. Aside from the style and mechanics of the story, it was horribly lewd. It was disgusting to read, however, when I realized that this was a 70 year old man writing I was sufficiently repulsed; I assumed that discretion came with age. Don't get me wrong, I understand that certain characters are lewd, therefore lewd acts and language are required. However, this was over the top and unnecessary.

At least I knew they had water while I was gone!The plastic that it's made of is definitely sturdy - I wasn't worried about it tipping over. Plus it's really easy to clean.

I wanted one you can clean out with your hand. This one from Amazon does the trick. The mouth is wide and therefore easy to clean out the bottle. The base is well designed making the bottle easy to get into place. The one thing I don't like is the bottle is made of really cheap, thin plastic. The edges are sharp enough to give you a deep scratch. If it's dropped I don't think it'll stay in one piece. Bergan needs to do something about this.

A sugggestion is select a position that is out of the sun -- the water can get too warm. Only complaint would be the weight of carrying the filled container.

Works fine. On the bad side, the bowl does get very dirty in that amount of time. Bits of food and litter end up in there all the time. The tank stays clean quite a bit longer. Also the plastic tends to build up slime. As we fill it every week, it gets cleaned as well pretty often so it's not bad. For the price, this is a great option for anyone with more than a few cats.

But it washed off & everything was/is fine. We have been using it for a few weeks now. We have a 5 month old shepard mix who drinks a lot of water, this usually lasts her about 4-5 days. It cleans easy, & looks nice.Funny note though, the gray container where the water is actually stored, my wife says looks like a urinal, now every time i look at the thing it makes me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"From the getgo, the threads on the top of the container are awful.

Put a handle on top so it's not so hard to pull from the base.What would have been really great is if the refill lid was on top, so you could fill it with a pitcher.I just bought this thing a few days ago. I can see it will have to be filled up every two days.

First problem: The velcro loops that attach to the bike require a tube that is larger than most modern bicycles.

Second problem: The bottle is held on to its \\"holster\\" by a velcro strap that is under tension. When the strap is released (intentional or not), the bottle falls off the bike.

Check it out when you can. 'Another...' is the only (thank goodness) Motorhead studio effort that features one-time Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson. For certain reasons, I just wasn't able to totally dig on this album reissue. Not saying it's a bad Motorhead lp, it's just that I never was to thrilled about it. Tracks that I probably enjoyed the most were the handful of tunes that were penned by the previous line-up of Lemmy, Clarke and drummer Philthy 'Animal' Taylor. \\"Back At The Funny Farm\\", the ass-kicking \\"Rock It\\", \\"I Got Mine\\" and \\"(Don't Need)Religion\\". There are three bonus tunes added. So, what are you doubters waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good post-Eddie offering","review":"[...]\\"Another Perfect Day\\" comes closest to Clarke's work, just for the presence of ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, who, like Clarke, had a distinctive style and years of playing under his belt before joining Motorhead for this one album.While \\"Another Perfect Day\\" features the most intricate arrangements in the band's repetroire, it still bashes and crashes along, courtesy of Lemmy and Philthy Animal Taylor's brutal rhythm section. \\"I Got Mine\\", the title track, \\"Die You Bastard\\" and \\"Shine\\" are standouts.I have not purchased the remastered version yet, hence the four stars instead of five.

There are only very minor differences anyway, so it is not really a problem. There is a great section on jumping into using SPSS for some practice analysis. Much of the book is very helpful as a general stats resource, in addition to explaining SPSS-specific application. I would highly recommend it for statistics class students, though not advanced statistics.

Overall, it was ok. I am a junior right now, and although it didn't seem to offer much to the more experienced junior, it could definitely offer something to the novice in the field.

You'll see those on big trucks and have cables that are about 3 inches across. These are nice, strong, light duty tie downs for people with a pickup truck. For those people,these things are excellent. I found the hooks to be a little small when I used them on the adjustable mount points on my Toyota Tacoma (which are, a little bit thick and hard to use), but when hooking them to the hard points, which are steel d-rings in the bed of the truck, they hooked right up nicely. The straps are good and strong. The ratchet mechanism was easy to use and adjust (unlike others I've used in the past). I'm really quite happy with these. I'd have given them all five stars if the hooks had been just a little bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ratchet","review":"I'm a big fan of the way ratchets can very securely tie down a load. I'm not a big fan of the way the fabric straps can fold or twist. The ProGrip 314700 is not immune from ratchet problems. However, by keeping the strap flat and somewhat taught and ratcheting slowly, I've had great success with this ratchet. I secured a heavy, rear tine tiller in the cargo area of my Mazda 5 micro-minivan with the hatch open. The ProGrip held the tiller in place securely. There was no chance it was going to roll or tumble out the back. Anyone having trouble with this (or any other ratchet) would do well search for videos showing how to use a ratchet. The ProGrip is a good strap and should last a long time. I give it 4 stars, instead of 5, because it can easily jam if one is not careful and the instructions are lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author must have minored in English.","review":"This book takes the technology of 'readability' to new lows.

Theur vocalist is insane, the only problem I have with this record, is that it's almost impossible to discern anything the screamer screams, but the vocals are amazing and shred none the less. Great guitar work, drumming is tight, great double bass in parts.

These cards seem to especially appeal to men, which makes a nice change from all the \\"feminist\\" or \\"women's spirituality\\" offerings out there. It is nice to see something with a more masculine appeal, while not completely turning away any feminine readers.

Martin completely misunderstands the Kalam Cosmological Argument, primarily by confusing labeling and enumeration (!), and his attempt to revive the hopelessly falsified Verification Principle as a special-pleading stick to beat religion with does no credit to his intellectual honesty.

I have been a gamer for many years and while I enjoy it very much, I usually get stuck at some point and can't go any further. Not so with Pariah. It gets really tough at times but if you keep at it you can always find a way to get through. Without giving away too much, I got really involved with the characters. There is just enough story for me. It interests me and keeps me curious about what's going to happen next. The weapons are top notch. I have always loved my machine gun but there is a good variety. If one doesn't do the job you try another one and it gets it done. The graphics are extremely good for an older game. The only gripe I had when I started was no save game. You have to reach a save point to keep going. Having played for a while I'm not sure I would change that. I adds to the challenge. I haven't finished it yet but I know I'm going to.

While the creators tried to tell an interesting story, it was lost in the uninspired level design and irritatingly awkward weapons. Props for the healing tool, though. The way the healing tool and health are handled is the only innovative aspect of the game.The last straw for me was the fact that the single player game is checkpoint based.

But the fact that you cannot save this game before (or in the middle of) difficult sections makes it so frustrating as to be unplayable. Even the $10 I spent on it seems too much given that there's no way I'm going to waste my time trying over and over again to get past the third level.

This is probably the 10th game I've installed on my current computer and the only one I've had any problems with.EDITED TO ADD:So, I got this working. It doesn't run on dual core processors, so you need to google \\"processor affinity\\" and set it run on only one processor. Also I had to turn off full screen transform and lighting because it would turn my whole screen black every time a grenade went off. It's still a lame game.

I bought this primarily for a friend who is, in many respects, very much a beginner guitarist. I spend an inordinate amount of time editing the mistakes the software makes. I would not recommend this product to a beginner. An experienced player would not need the software because their ear would serve them better than the program. However, an intermediate player might find the product useful, especially the feature which slows down the song without changing the original key to the song. Good for practicing solos. But I understand there are other products that also have that capability. If you ignore all of the \\"noise\\" and by \\"noise\\" I mean unnecessary chord changes that the program picks up from other instruments or vocals, it will tell you the key of the song and (usually) the basic chord structure of the song. After that you're on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect any customer support...","review":"If you are looking for a \\"chord finder\\" software, then this is about the best you're going to get.

I tried several times to get it to work, but it never did. Don't buy it if you're wanting to use it on Vista! It works OK on WinXP, but there are still little things that aren't reliable...like the chords. I tried on several occasions to contact the \\"customer support\\", but I don't believe there is such a department. I never heard back from them a single time.

I had heard that the FM transmitter on the newer Starmates and Sportsters were useless (and that turned out to be true), but that didn't really matter to me because I hook it up directly to my car stereo via an aux input. However, I noticed right away after setup that the fidelity from the Starmate 4 wasn't as good-- it sounded tinny and lacking in bass. Thinking it was just my imagination, I then compared the sound from the Starmate 4, alternating with my car's FM radio and CD player, and then with my older Sirius unit-- and the Starmate 4 sounded lousy compared to all of them. Almost like an old transistor radio in comparison. Don't know about the new Sportster 4, so I am going back to an original Sportser or Replay, which on second thought isn't a whole lot bulkier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not as good as they used to be!","review":"I purchased this as an upgrade from my Starmate 3 receiver.

Sirius added an extra FM Modulator to the unit, to try to improve the reception, but in my opinion, it's useless!I LOVED my Starmate 3, and now, I only wish I still had that unit. I had heard from Sirius customer service people that they had to lower the frequency strength in the new Starmate 4 and new units to meed FCC regulations... what a shame, as it makes listening to the radio a drag sometimes....Bottom line, the unit is Okay, but I only can hope the Starmate 5 will be a better unit than the 4...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute worst customer service","review":"We had major problems with our after-market radio.

Then they would say things like \\"I don't see any orders on your account so I can't help you.\\" What does that even mean? They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them.

The Starmate suffers from the same issues as all the newer Sirius products. They had to turn down the power of their FM transmitter to comply with FCC regulations. The problem is that now unless you have the Sirius unit connected to your radio; your radio will pick up interference from older units that pass you on the highway. The older units were so powerful that I could pick up the Sirius signal in my house from my car parked out side. The new units are not powerful. Sirius has tried to compensate for the weaker signal by providing an antenna that can be feed into your radio. The problem is this makes the unit permanent to your car. I switch cars a lot and so I don't have the unit mounted in my car. Unless the unit is on top of the radio it will not work.

For those of you that have animals, I really mean that statement for you. The vacuum attachments have no suction power, the machine is particularly noisy, and you constantly have to clean the vacuum itself due to the dust all over the machine after using. Dust in one side and out the other. It will not pick up small bits of cat food from around the dishes, it will not pick up small \\"needles\\" from the fake christmas tree. I constantly have to clean the hoses out because the suction is so poor that it cannot get the debris up into the \\"bagless\\" container. If any does, usually some hair, it gets wrapped all around the spindle in the top and when you clean that off, dust and other material falls on the carpet as well. Too much work for the price. I adore Kirby's. I will stick with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I don't know why I bought this after the reading the reviews. big mistake. I have only used this vacuum 5 times. The dirt cup is very small and you have to empty it after each use. I didn't like the fact that you have to clean 3 filters after so many uses. I miss the old days when you just threw out the bag and no filters to clean. Now you have to take apart the cleaner to get to the filters. I can't imagine many single guys doing this. It cleans great. I noticed a lot of dust/dirt getting stuck above the dirt holder. On the 5th use, there was a terrible smell. Most of the other reviews says the motor only lasts about a year, after 5 months it gets much louder and they can smell something burning. So I returned it after the 5th use. Went to an eureka."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!!!!!!!","review":"Cleaning this vacuum is an ordeal. It should have a huge warning label on the box reading \\"Cleaning this vacuum is gross dusty mess, and you are required to do it often\\".

I bought one, and after using it only a few times the belt slipped too far over and burned off some of the plastic on the underside. I thought it was a fluke, so I returned it for another one. Same thing happened, but I couldn't afford a more expensive one. So I just got used to having to take off the bottom and move over the belt every so often when it would start to smell hot. I've been doing this for about a year, but today was the last straw - the belt completely slipped off it's retaining rod. Add the tippiness, completely illogical location for the base of the cord (on the side, meaning you trip or roll over it constantly), the \\"strips\\" on the left side that never got clean and had to be vaccumed a second time with the middle or right side of the sweeper... I would never, ever recommend this vaccum, and will never buy a Bissell again. The only things I WILL give it are relatively decent suction and the fact that it's lightweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"We've had this vacuum for less than a year and it has broken 3 times.

I guess you get what you pay for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER! Belt will burn!","review":"Here's the thing about this vacuum that makes me so angry- the belt is hooked over the brush where it sits in a grooved position holding it there so it doesn't slide around. Wonderful, my old Kirby didn't have that, the belt was on the bare surface of the brush cylinder. Now move towards the back of the vacuum and see the place where the belt hooks onto to make it move. A metal rod. That's it, nothing on the end of it. Nothing to block it from sliding off when it gets heated up and loose. *angry face* So it slides off and burns through the plastic on the side wall and starts to smoke. HORRIBLE DESIGN BISSELL! What were you thinking?? The only solution, from what I see, is buying new belts that are tighter so they won't easily slide off. That means spending $7 to $10 every couple of months on this POS. A Dyson will be my next vacuum. The money is worth it- I'll never have to deal with this incompetence again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Book for Practicing Lawyers","review":"This book is an excellent resource for attorneys and staff.

The dirt holder was a bit messy to clear out though as the dust tended to stay in the two smaller sections and its not very hygienic to reach in and clear it out.Apart from that it worked great until a couple of weeks ago where the external small brush has stopped rotating and the whole thing sounds like a jetliner taking off.

It doesn't get clogged either."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for awhile","review":"After extensive research I purchased this vaccuum knowing that Bissell was a great brand & I'd get great bang for my buck. It was trued for the first 2 months & then as time went on I lost suction until it quit on me all together. I returned it & exchanged it for the same model thinking perhaps that one was a lemon. I've had it now for 3 months & it's the same thing. The dirt goes into the 2 side compartments & all along the filter. It has to be cleanout out ( with your fingers digging out the dirt ) every time you do even a light vaccuum & the filters clog immediately. I've constantly had to wash them with is no small feat to get them clean. After 3 months of having this one I'm returning it for another brand.

This one is better than his first, and not as good as his next. Again, I was distressed that it ended so soon, but that inevitably brought to my mind a wonderful Whoopi Goldberg routine from her early stand-up days.When a creepy old man tried to woo her into a tumble by promising that old men can last a long time, she paused for a long Whoopi moment.To paraphrase her question to the audience:Now why... would I want to read a baaaaaaaaad book... for a LONG TIME?!?And indeed, I'd rather spend a short time with a book as wonderful as this than a long time with some of the mountainous drivel I've mis-chosen lately.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"I was told that the Montalbano books get better as one goes along, and wow, this one was already light-years ahead of the first one that I had read, \\"The Shape of Water\\". Many familiar supporting characters first introduced there return here, now creating a familiar environment for the adventures, mysteries, and crimes that Montalbano faces.I really enjoyed this book, finishing it in about a day and a half as I just could not put it down once the action started kicking into gear. The story unfolds into several connecting mysteries, the most curious being that involving the titular terra-cotta dog found guarding the dead bodies of two young lovers in a cave. Along the way the book is rich with Sicilian food, culture, and way of life, creating a unique atmosphere for a mystery novel.I am now a \\"convert\\" to the Montalbano mysteries and will be avidly reading the rest in this series after this wonderful installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dog","review":"Very enjoyable.

That was a recommendation I couldn't ignore so I picked up THE TERRA-COTTA DOG, which I could see dealt with the Mafia, one of my all time favorite topics. I read the book and enjoyed it very much, but I have to say the woman was a bit off in her comparison to Grisham. Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano is a bit more like Lee Goldberg's Mr. Monk--a cranky, idiosyncratic, but brilliant sleuth. He's a lot of fun to follow, and Camilleri's depiction of Sicilian society delights and surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please write another book Catherine & Roy!!","review":"I met Catherine and Roy at a dog show in Michigan during the early 90's.

Not so.It is his one true love who saves him. Wilson must deal with death. House kills himself. I will leave it to you to discover if a pulse remains. An obituary for the character of Greg House would consider his jerkdom having to take him to prison. Society's ultimate sanction. I would say being free brings an inner peace. Solving problems is his reason for living. A place for his wild spirit to anchor its creative talent. Sherlock Holmes indeed.That he has left me simmering over another motorcycle purchase may be a bad ass ending. For me. Now Wilson and House are pain free.

I am a huge House fan, and I was more than disappointed with Season 8. It ruined House for me. The acting from the new cast was terrible and the script was bad. House's character didn't have his usual wit.The season was not really about the medical cases, it was mostly useless drama with random cases thrown in the background.As far as I am concerned, House ended with Season 7, and Season 8 is just a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great episode","review":"In my humble opinion, this is the best episode so far in season eight. Well written with unexpected twists and turns, incredibly well acted and excellent cinematography (although still too dark). Jesse Spencer, (Dr. Chase) really is showing his acting talent in this episode - in prior seasons he came across as more the \\"hunk actor\\" with limited range, while in this episode he shows that he truly is a talented and versatile actor and is well suited to be a top star. Julie Mond was a great selection for the role of Moira and would have made an excellent addition as a recurring character. Voice recording is still a little weak, but pacing is much, much better - the slower, non-hectic pacing suits this series much better than psychotic pacing. Overall, very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ending to a awesome series!","review":"Loved the show for all 8 seasons. Very few shows do i set my DVR for and must wacth it, House was one. sad to see it end, it could have easily went on another season or 2.The Finale, I wish it was a 2 hour event, it deserved it! But atleast they did show that retrospective special right before it.I really kinda wanted House to really be dead as we thought he was for a few seconds. I thought, who but HOUSE would have the balls to kill off the main character and END the series! Seems every ending to a series these days, they ALWAYS leave a door open for a comeback special or something.Oh well. Wilson will be dead if they do, unless they drove their bikes down to Mexico and got some unorthodox remedy there.

What a stroke of luck! It's a great pot, it has a good heavy bottom and the glass lid allows you to see what's going on inside, but best of all the little vent holes which are desgned to allow you to drain/strain your finished product can also be positioned to allow a small amount of steam to escape while cooking. This feature means no more partially covered pots on a slow simmer with the condensation dripping back onto the cook top or down the sides of the pot..it's a small thing, who knew it'd prove to be so useful?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The label is terribly inconsiderate!","review":"They use an ultra sticky label that takes an hour to scrape off.

When it arrived in the mail, it looked beautiful. While not as heavy as my other 18/10 stainless steel pots & pans, it seemed like it would do the trick. After using it only one time (to cook some pasta) and then washing it up, I noticed a bunch of tiny little \\"divots\\" in the bottom of the pan, along with some rust spots. None of my other pots & pans do this (and they've gotten heavy use over the last 5 years), this is not the quality I was looking for, even at this price. If it does that after one light use, then I don't think I want to see what will happen as I continue to use it. Sad to say, I am returning it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This pan is nice in theory. If you only plan to use it for big noodles it will work ok. Plan for everything to stick to the bottom. And if you ever strain anything small the pieces will get stuck in the lid between the glass and the metal. Getting those out will take a thin knife or lots of sloshing and hoping. The space is too small to get a dish cloth into.

Much of the musical material is of little interest; you'll certainly not walk away humming melodies to yourself. And even in the best moments of the symphony Martucci relies too often on orchestral tuttis to bring musical phrases to a conclusion; I found myself tired of the technique, even at first listening.The performances seem committed, and this disc was a winner of the \\"Grand Prix Du Disque de l'Academie Charles Cros\\", whatever that is.

The threads do not fit the camera tube adapter. The microscope seller said this was an inferior piece of equipment, poorly machined and not appropriate for my purposes.

If you are a true Band fanatic, you will not learn a whole lot more but it will jog the older brain cells a little.

When I first took home Music From Big Pink and put it on my Sears phono player, my musical horizons were broadened immediately. I still play it at least once a month, it's my number one disc. I keep to 2 lp's, 2 cd's, a cassette and have a digital 5.1 copy. Concerning has anyone band gotten close, some reviewer or maybe the author mentioned Little Feat.

For instance, it has the wrong year for Robbie Robertson's birthday. It plagarizes a quote out of Levon Helm's book (a quote by Levon Helm), paraphrases it inaccurately and attributes it to Robertson. (pg 401). It misstates the name of F.S. Walcotts Rabits Foot Minstrels etc. etc. Quotes are taken from the interviews in the Last Waltz and deceptively placed here as if they were obtained by some research done by the author and again they're not 100% verbatim despite the quotation marks. There is an immense amount of conjecture and unwarranted personal opinion interjected throughout. The inaccuracies completely destroy all credibility of this book. Even Robbie Robertson stated in a Rolling Stone interview that he read the first 30 pages and had to put it away because of all the mistakes. This is a third rate product. There are better books to read to learn about the Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there no \\"zero stars\\" option?","review":"The only good parts of this book are those that are taken from--and attributed to--other sources. Then, of course, there are the many passages that were out-and-out lifted without attribution. Hoskyns obviously assumed that everything in print about The Band was accurate, because he even lifted the errors.A fun exercise: see how many pages you can find that DON'T contain blatant errors. Better yet, see how many PARAGRAPHS you can find that don't.Hoskyns would love people to think that The Band conspired to not grant him interviews, but that's not the case. The Band was very accessible when Hoskyns was penning this comic book; he just didn't try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book bought back many happy memories for me. Throughout the time The Band were playing and creating their wonderful music I was into jazz, blues and Bach, Beethoven et al. I listened to others, but The Band were the only group that I really admired and respected. They told me things about America that no other group, or musician did. Their first two records \\"Music From Big Pink' and 'The Band' retain hallowed places in my collection and is played often - they are simply the best two albums produced by American rock artists. And their movie 'The Last Waltz' is also a classic. This book gave me more insights into the making of these albums and the movie and allowed me to appreciate them even more. It should be read by any ageing, or even new, rock fan to understand what musicians go through to produce great music....and encourage more people to listen to their timeless music and see the movie.

Part of the problem with these newest films may be attributable to the absence of the trio of excellent characters--Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp, and Miss Lemon--whose interactions helped make the earlier efforts so delightful. Regrettably, we cannot recommend this extra series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poirot without the stupidity of Hastings & Japp","review":"More Poirot and less stupidity is better. These mysteries show Poirot in solid police procedural form gradually figuring out who did what to whom from a solid group of suspects. David Suchet, as Poirot, is as good as ever and we get more of him due to the welcome elimination of Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp. If you want to see Poirot in action with a minimum of silly distractions, then you should be pleased with each mystery in this new collection. The production values are solid and the transfers appear good as to both picture and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Poirot","review":"Lacks humor and is boring. Don't bother. Ms. Lemon, Lt.

Granted, the filming is quite modernized and very appealing, but the wholesomeness that the older movies had is severely lacking in these 4 videos. I only watched two of them, and decided to send the whole set back. I'm staying with the old colored sets. The production may be cheaper, but I thoroughly enjoyed every one, and that's the Poirot I want to see!Lastly, and maybe the least, the familiar (maybe annoying to some) theme song is sadly missing.I hope that any new videos may go back to the same wonderful nostalgia that I've come to enjoy with Acorn Media films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poirot does it again","review":"Although the new Poirot mystery series DVD is missing Ms Lemmon and Capt. Hastings, there is nothing as great as a good old fashioned English mystery.Sit back on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bowl of freshly popped popcorn, and indulge yourself in the 20's and 30's of rural and London ,England.

I have a better backward roll to handstand, more powerful round-off, and a fantastic front handspring, thanks to this book. My only complaint is the pictures showing the moves are really just 3D stick figures doing gymnastics. (I'm not kidding!) For example, they have no faces, they have sticks for arms and legs, and the apparatus was weirdly drawn too. I mean, a slanted line for a springboard, a little line for bars, two circles for rings, and three lines for a balance beam.

The few tunes sans Garabaldi with drum programming are good too and provide a good mix to the beats in the album. Plus, I believe this was recorded at Fantasy, so it perhaps put a nice vibe to their recording session.

I don't seem to be having any of the problems other folks are having with PSR keyboards.

I liked that they stacked and took up less room. After delivery I discovered that the stacking feature isn't that great because they don't really have any way of securely attaching to each other so the top one slides around and falls on the floor. In addition, it's a real bugger to twist the lid back on - for whatever reason the grooves on the lid don't line up with the ones on the container so you have to spin it about 19 times to get it to twist on.

The 60lb vaults each hold a large bag of chicken feed or large bag of dog food. We use the 40's for our cat and older dog.

If you absolutely need to stack the units, be aware that you cannot fill them anyway near their capacity.However, since I have room to keep these containers side by side, the caps are at the top of the container and I can fill them with 30 pounds of dog food.

The reason is that once you start the clock at 00:25 (25 minutes per person is the default start time for Scrabble tournaments), the seconds counter does NOT appear until much later! It immediately starts by showing 00:24. What is really happening is that it has started counting down: 00:24:59, 00:24:58, 00:24:57, etc. but the seconds are NOT displayed on the timer until later when it has counted down down to 20 minutes at which point, it will show 19:59, 19:58, 19:57, 19:56, etc. I have no idea why it behaves this way, but as it is, the Saitek timer is disallowed at official Scrabble tournaments.

The blade lock on this knife has failed twice in less than a year. This is very dangerous as the blade could close on your fingers when in use as the lock mechanism fails unexpectedly.SOG has a lifetime warranty. They do respond quickly with repairs, but something is clearly wrong with the design of this knife. I did write them about the problem so I might amend this review on a later date once I find out what action (other than another repair) that SOG takes.It is light and an attractive knife but in addition to the blade lock failure I mention above, the \\"assist open\\" mechanism requires too much pressure to open the blade.

It's this last one that is rather small, in a normal right handed grip it is under the ball of your thumb, you'd never feel it, but if you need to use it then it's hard to reach. Small as it is it sometimes gets pushed in to the locked position, when you discover this you need to roll it over in your hand so the thumb nail can click it back into the unlocked position. I carry this knife unlocked and it hasn't ever opened unexpectedly.With a little practice the opening becomes very easy, which is perhaps a little disconcerting for anyone watching the blade suddenly appear from a pocket.These things are so light that I don't notice I am carrying it, it clips in to my front right pocket and most people would have no idea it is there.I can't imagine what someone would need to do to this to break it twice in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"My son is obsessed with WWE and this tin is his pride and joy!

I should have read reviews first","review":"Well, I usually read the other reviews before placing an order but this time I screwed up. I didn't notice the spout was plastic until I received it. The Amazon description said it was metal (bronze). The only metal part is a brass adapter that connects the spout to your pipe. The spout looks nice but it feels cheap and sounds cheap when you bump/tap it. After reading the issues the other reviewers had I decided to return it.Delta seems to have slipped into the \\"economy\\" class of fixtures.

I'm a big fan of \\"First Person Shooters\\", and tho' I am also a decent real life sports shooter (you know, with REAL firearms) myself, I've never been tempted - by a computer game at least - to go out and do violence.But honestly, this game wasn't all that thrilling for me. I remember the thrill when I first got my Motor Vehicle Operator's Permit, but now - some years later - driving has for the most part become just a chore to get done with as little trouble as possible.And I'm not even considering buying a Minivan yet....Somebody else might find this game a lot of fun - just not me.The game did laod and run fine with no special PC upgrades.

It contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years. I took one of the CDs out of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and I were dancing. The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the Cameo Parkway \\"story\\" was an interesting read. There will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era. What great fun to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Take?","review":"The Cameo-Parkway cd set is something we all have been waiting for. And those who are interested in this set will not be disappointed. One of the first unique things you'll notice is that the information side of each cd is BLACK. The quality of the content is beefed up a little on the EQ but that's fine too. What bothered me personally was the one song I was looking forward to the most, \\"Let the good times roll/Feel so good\\" by Bunny Sigler is a different take than the one I have on record. I understand that the version on the cd is MONO but so is the single record but they're not the same take. It still rocks but it's a little different. Overall you will not be wasting your money on this long-awaited set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to have these out on disk and not bootlegged BUT!!!!","review":"The Selection was great, the book was put together very well.BUTNot one review talked about this so I'm assuming not to many people have listened to these disks closely on a good set of headphones. there is not one single track that does not reek of distortion. I find it very hard to believe that the first generation or even the second generation tapes would be this bad. I have heard Bootlegs which were taken fron albums sound far better than these. I know I have heard better masters for the Kinks, Sound Orchestral and The Ivy League. What happened? Fans have been waiting for these for a very long time and this is the best ABKCO could do. For those who want to know how bad. Take a 45 RPM only cheap record player from the 60's with a penny on the tone arm so it won't skip, take a worn out 45 turn up the volume all the way and you got it.

The authors tend to be biased toward certain theorists and theories instead of presenting the material objectively, and some chapters seemed to piece together strings of quotes from other authors (I don't know about you, but that's what I do when I'm not quite sure I'm grasping something). The chapter on phenomenology in particular was EXTREMELY difficult to understand what the authors were saying. I have my BA in Psychology and have been exposed to some of the theories presented in the textbook, so it was easier for me to understand certain chapters better than others, but without my previous training I would have struggled with those chapters as well. The structure and topics covered were good, just not written to be student-friendly. My 5 MSW classmates agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - Spoiler","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel.

Certainly I do not recommend seppuku (ritual suicide) as component of a healthy value system. But rectitude(justice), courage, benevolence, politeness, veracity, honor, loyalty, education, and self-control are healthy values which Bushido is based on.This book is not for everyone, Nitobe assumes the reader is well versed in the classics of western literature, philospophy and relgion. This facility would be common to college graduates of the 19th century, these days we do not receive such a broad liberal arts education. I found I had to do some self education to understand his finer points...yet I am the better for it.Not only did I learn more about Japan and Japan's place in world history, through Nitobe's analysis I became more aware of my own culture and it's standing relative to the rest of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians and/ or Armed Forces and those that want to be should read this book!","review":"For 20 years I was Agnostic, pacifistic, and respecting of the military.

I opened it up to see if it could be fixed. I was appalled at the poor quality electronics inside. A cold solder connection was the culprit in this case, but the wires soldered were barely touching, then globs of glue were slathered over the wires and components to cover this up and attempt to hold it together. Also, the unit runs only on 2 C batteries, no AC adpator. You are better off getting a hand-cranked manual sorter, or spending a bit more for something better. Avoid this product and this company.

I have loved the first two in this series even better than I did the first time some years ago and I'm sure I'll feel the same about the third one when I read that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Not too much to say that hasn't been said already. It is a great book, full of drama and some great urban fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to stop the apocalypse in one easy step","review":"Originally written to be a stand alone series, it has become the ultimate prequel to another existing series.For years Terry Brooks fans asked if this was in anyway related to his Shannaran series and at the time he genuinely did not believe it was or would ever be, but surprise... that is exactly what is has become.Revolving around the main character named Nest, the story evolves into a fantasy/horror/mystery novel that involves a new Character type call a Knight of the word who is in the service of a mysterious creature called the lady, his job is to stop the upcoming apocalypse that is being advanced by the creatures of the void.The Word and the Void have been at battle since time began, each working toward dominance in the world. If the void wins we will be plunged into darkness, and mankind will become enslaved by demons and once men.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good yarn that tantalizes the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Different","review":"This was my first Terry Brooks read. I'm thinking I might like to try the rest of this series. I'm typically a romance reader, but spreading my wings.It's just his writing is not what I'm used to. He writes all narative with way too detailed descriptives of every little thing. It came off as an author trying too hard - it convinced me the author was a male before I got to the back cover and had it confirmed. I've seen it way too often in male writers. Someone needs to tell them to tone it down and limit it to what helps the story move along.There were also a few places where the scenes were disrupted with backtracking of another character - it's hard to stay in the story when an author does this.I loved the story itself and John Ross is intriguing. I adored Pick and honestly wish I could purchase him to sit on my desk. The whole senario of the demon, feeders and the tree kept me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember watching a really stupid horror/suspense movie?","review":"I have been a long-time Terry Brooks fan and I have read all of his Shannara books and have been withholding reading this trilogy. I started reading Running with the Demon this weekend. When was the last time you've watched a horror/suspense movie where you were shouting at the TV because all the characters are too stupid to run away from danger? Instead they run towards it? Or go to places by themselves because they think they can handle this by themselves? The Knight of the Word was actually \\"bedding\\" a pretty lady while Nest was being kidnapped. First time I've ever screamed at a book because the characters are all stupid. It's like reading a \\"Scary Movie\\" spoof. I'd rather watch the Chainsaw Masssacre movie. Seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What this book is about.","review":"Sinnissippi Park, in Hopewell, Illinois, has long hidden a mysterious evil, locked away from humankind by powers greater than most could even imagine. But now the malevolent creatures that normally skulk in the shadows of the park grow bolder, and old secrets hint at a violent explosion. The brewing conflic draws John Ross to Hopewell. A Knight of the Word, Ross is plagued by nightmares that tell him someone evil is coming to unleash an ancient horro upon the world. Caught between them is fourtenn-year-olf Nest Freemark, who senses that something is terribly wrong but has not yet learned to wield the budding power that sets her apart from her friends. Now the future of humanity depends upon a man haunted by his dreams and a gifted young girl--twos souls who will discover what survives when hope and innocence are shattered forever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"Man, this one kept me up all night. I'm a big fan of the author, and I leaped out of my seat as soon as I heard his new book was out. THIS BOOK SIMPLY RULES! I'd recommend it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old themes in a new and darker setting.","review":"In this modern-day confrontation between good andevil, Brooks draws on many themes that his long-timereaders will instantly recognize: a young girlfaced with resisting the heritage of evil, a mancursed with the power and responsibility of tryingto change the fate of mankind, and a dark creatureof the Void who seeks to upset the balance of theworld and ultimately destroy it. All the elementsof magic that appeal to Brooks' readersare present, and his fans are unlikely to walkaway disappointed.The most unique and convincing aspect of this novel,however, is the splendidly well-drawn portrait oflife in small-town America. Nest, and her familyand friends are people I knew and recognized. Brooksonce again shows his masterful ability to capturethe elements of a collective subconscious. I foundthe bleak future he paints reminiscent of the works ofOctavia Butler. Even those who long ago gave upon Brooks' fantasy novels may want to give thisone a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of time and paper","review":"Terry Brooks' only brilliant move was glomming on to the popularity of Tolkein's works before anyone else did. Recently I decided to try any book that didn't have \\"Shannara\\" in the title just to see if perhaps he had an original thought of his own. [He doesn't--this is a bad melding of THE GOLDEN COMPASS and WATCHERS.] It shows the same limited vision and writing ability that his earlier works demonstrate. I tried to like it, I really did. Bottom line: The book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I usually like Brooks' work, but this was just aweful. His novels seem to get worse each year. Go back to his first 6 or so books and they are gems. This is just trash. Sorry to sound so negative, but I really am disappointed with this change in Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK IN THE SERIES","review":"The dialogue is awful.

It captured me instantly, although the dreams of the tormented knight keep you guessing if you're in the past or the future, it reads quite well. Is Terry Brooks a christian? One would think he is after reading this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less action, more descriptive","review":"I absolutely love Brook's Shannara series, and it was time to pick up this introductory series to \\"the Word\\" as mentioned in the Shannara books. I was very surprised to find a different pace and writing style than I had become accustomed to in the other series. The action is buried in tons of descriptive element (how many times can you describe the same park?). Although Brook's writing is always great and his wide and talented use of vocabulary kept me going, I grew weary of reading this book at times. This is a book I was able to put down quite easily to attend to daily life, unlike Terry's other books which were glued to my hand from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running with the Demons","review":"I am a huge Terry Brooks fan. This book does not disappoint. I have introduced my grandson to Terry Brooks, and he enjoyed this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool","review":"I have almost every Terry Brooks Book on my shelf, and I loved the Shannara series, and the Landover series has a flare of its own. Running with a Demon took me a while to pick up, but when I did I couldn't put it down. I liked the book being set in contemperary times, it added a wierd kind of \\"realness\\" to the book. I look forward to the sequel, especially since it is in Seattle, I'm sure that it will be just as good as the rest of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak for Brooks","review":"Nothing great for Terry Brooks compared to his Shannara series. While the story itself was good, it was just a bit simplistic in its explanations. Brooks usually does a better job creating a world entirely different from the one we live in, so perhaps his skills truly shine when he is forced to create everything from scratch, rather than sticking his story into \\"the real world\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite Brooks series, but the guy's still a genius.","review":"Okay, Running with the Demon was Brooks' attempt of making a fantasy-type story in modern times and in an actual location. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great either, but it's not my personal favorite. It's dark. (That's not the reason why I didn't like it as well as his SHANNARA series, but for the sake of saying so, it's dark.) The thing that's memorable about this is that is suggests and basically fantasizes that maybe there are some people with magical powers in a REAL world. Well, anyways. I didn't toally expect Brooks to understand a teenager (that's the main character, Nest) but it wasn't as bad as I'd thought it might turn out to be. The only reason I ever read this in the first place was because I love Brook's writing. I did give it 4 stars, though. What can I say, a good read but.. the SHANNARA novels are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running With the Demon","review":"I thought this book was an excellent book! It had me hooked from page one! I sat down and finished the book within 36 hours since I wasn't able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brook's","review":"As always Mr. Brooks has taken me on a great adventure. If you love Fantasy books that you can not put down, then a Terry Brook's book is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad new start","review":"The Shannara series was the first series I *ever* stayed with. I commented to friends how wonderful it was and drew them into the mystery. The \\"First King...\\" was an excellent work and I wish Terry would continue filling in some of the gaps of Shannara....(What ever happened to Shea's parents, Amberle's? The meeting of the Highlander and Shea?) I even met Mr. Brooks while on a business trip to Philadelphia. But I must say that I was disappointed by the book and will not continue reading the \\"The Demon\\" series. 'Nuf Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Terry Brooks Book Ever!","review":"I thought that this book was terrible. The story line was so predictable. I knew what was going to happen all through the book. The characters were stick figures. They had no depth, color or interest. I have read five other Terry Brooks books and thought they were all pretty good. But I keep wanting to leave this book on a park bench. What a waste of reading time. The only reason I finished the book was because I was on an airplane with nothing else to read. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read, but stick to Shanara","review":"I'm a devout follower of Brooks, having read all of his books while considering him the best of his kind since Tolkien. And this was a strong contemporary story that I devoured during a crosscountry flight. However, Terry, if you see this, stay with your Shanara format. I can read contemporary stories like this anywhere, but only you can follow Tolkien's enchanting stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book; good writing, different from his other novels","review":"I have read most of Brooks' other books, and this compares well. This book is well-written and well thought out. I was a little skeptical at first, but after I got into it, it turned out to be good. I like how he got off of the fantasy and got into this real-time kind of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and follow, entertaining!","review":"I'm an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader. This book \\"Running With the Demon\\" hit the spot. It's the first book by Terry Brooks that I've read and am encouraged to read more of his past works. I can't believe that I waited this long to read his work. His character building is great, I had a real feel for Nest Freemark and Pick. It was easy to read and become involved with. Good book! Could there be a second book coming? Seems that Nest and Pick still have work to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooks makes every word count","review":"An 8 for several reasons: Nothing Brooks ever writes again will touch Sword of Shannara. The ending which should have been the best part of the book was rushed, lacking description, and some excitement. From his Del Rey interview, generally I agree with Brooks that this is his best writing. Running With The Demon was better than expected and I look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Carbon Copy for once","review":"Of late fantasy and Sci Fi books have become so dull that I have just about given them up, \\"anyone for another quest with the kid with unkown powers to find the lost piece of rock that'll kill the evil king\\" zzzzzz , after reading the GAP series by Stephen Donaldson everything else has been, well just plain boring, I read the first two Shannara books ages back, didn't make it past the second one and was 50 / 50 on buying \\"Running With the Demon\\" but the fact that it put fantasy in a modern setting gave it a an edge and even though then whole book takes place in one town it has a nice pace that'll keep you interested as pieces of the story fall into place, sure you can hazard a pretty good guess at the outcome by half way, but then again you can with most books that are well written, unless the bad guy wins, which you don't see very often, a good book I'll be buying the rest in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get cover image","review":"I'm disappointed the publisher didn't feel including the cover image for the Kindle was necessary. All you get is a generic picture of the publisher's logo, not what's shown on the product page. I've contacted customer service but could not resolve this problem. This is not the first book I've purchased from the publisher that didn't include any cover art. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disappointing","review":"I've been a Brooks fan for the past ten years. So, I can say with great authority that this isn't just the worse book he's ever written, but the worse book I've ever read. The plot is trite and predictable. I could have told you the ending at page 20. Furthermore, the characters are extremely underdeveloped. At times their actions were mysterious for the simple sack of mystery -without any other function in the narrative. It was an extremely frustrating book to read. I'm surprised I was able to finish it! I still have faith in Brooks, though. Maybe the sequel will be better. It can't get much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's been years since I last read his books. I couldn't remember the story but I did remember enjoying them immensely. However, Running with the Demon is really weak. I had difficulty identifying one character from the next.I don't think the book even deserved to be call a fantasy novel. I am inclined to belive that the Freemark women suffered from a hereditary mental problem and imagined all those feeders.Frankly, who would want to be a Knight of the Word if all he gets are nightmares and nothing else. At least the Knight of Solamnia (Dragonlance) have their glory days before. This Knight of the Word is one big loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm confused","review":"I don't understand this book. John Ross dreams about a horrible future every time he falls asleep, a future that will happen if he doesn't stop it from happening. He's suppose to stop the Demon from getting to 14 year old Nest Freemark. But the Demon was never going to get to Nest because her grandmother had already taken care of things. The horrific, end-of-the-world future was never going to happen in the first place because of grandma! This book would have turned out EXACTLY the same without John Ross. Such a wimpy hero!!! I'm just surprised that more people don't find this fact really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still as good as I remember!","review":"I read this book in high school and loved the trilogy. I decided to buy it again due to some of the lore and characters tie into the Druids of Shenara series. A great, engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running with the Demon","review":"This was a decent read. Seems this trilogy gave Terry a new outlet in 2 ways. First, it was cool to see him write in 'our world', and do so well. Secondly, it was nice to witness a different 'formula'. Some of his books are formulaic, albeit enjoyable otherwise I wouldn't read them. From what I read before I purchased many reviews focused on how much the 1st was heads above the other two and how they were copies of the first. I don't agree with this. If you like the 2 main characters of the 1st, you'll enjoy the rest of the trilogy. I look forward to reading in a later trilogy how he ties this word vs void world to Shannara. Let this review stand for the entire trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running with the Demon","review":"THis is my all time favorite book. It was very easy for me to get into and I enjoyed all of it. It has the great mixture of Sci Fi/Fantasy and some mystery too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Brooks does it again!","review":"I was a little worried that Terry Brooks was starting up a new series until I picked up this book. Brooks moves into the land of fantasy/horror and does an excellent job with both the plot and the characters. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"If the author had the ability to make the journey enjoyable, this book's utter predictability would have been less problematic. As it is, the book has a flatness that derives partly from the fact that it's all been done before, and done better. Terry Brooks has ventured deeply into Stephen King territory here, practically duplicating the plot of one of King's novels. Brooks fails to provide suspense, unpredictability, or interesting characters. His characters' magical abilities and his descriptions of their use fail to evoke the slightest sense of wonder; they might as well be mechanics describing the repair of a carburetor. There are long descriptive passages that are dully written and don't advance the plot or tell us anything we need to know. They are padding, and it shows. For the undiscriminating only."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it and it has stayed with me.","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I couldn't put it down. I'm still thinking about the \\"ending\\", even though I finished reading it weeks ago. It is a departure from how he usually writes, but this difference doesn't detract from the novel. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terry Brooks best work","review":"I am a great admirer of Mr. Brooks. I loved every issue of the Shannara books. Unfortunatly Running with the demon temporarily put me off of Brooks. The book was extremley slow. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. It finally did in the last two chapters. I am almost scared to read his new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I have read every book written by Mr. Brooks, met him at one of his book signings, and await with great expectation every new book release. I have to say this was my first real disappointment. The world doesn't need another Steven King. It needs Terry Brooks. I'm sure he gets tired of the same old series and we probably would too eventually. But this was, as one person so apptly put it, \\"a real snooze\\". Take me to fantasyland Terry, not modern day Illinois."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment !","review":"As a devoted fan of Terry Brooks, I was looking forward to reading his latest novel, in spite of the somewhat mixed reviews that it had been given. I was quite disappointed with the novel, and found myself skipping pages while only half way through. I finally gave up and skipped to the last chapter. No surprises there. Unlike all of his earlier works, this book dragged on, lacking the character development and fast moving pace of everything he has previously written. The ending was obvious from the half way mark, and the plot became tedious. In the mean time, I plan on re-reading all of his earlier novels, safe in the knowledge of how outstanding they all are. I hope he resumes writing in his original style, and do look forward to his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bromidic Sermons","review":"A good casual read, but lacks the depth suggested from the other reviews. More enrichment can be found in Charles R. Swindoll's book on the same subject \\"The Bride\\" written two years earlier. Maybe \\"Many of today's believers jump from one congregation to another\\" in search of guidance less trite. Probably why you can buy this book new for 39 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holy Grail of Grammar and Comp","review":"I first used Warriner's Grammar and Comp books in 8th grade. They helped me to build a solid foundation for my reading and writing immensely. Now back in college, I decided to order this again because although I have a TON of books- this one is as always my go to. It answers everything you need to know as well as providing exercises to refresh things you may have forgotten. I keep this close to me- because it is one book I would ABSOLUTELY save from a fire. :) Great for students, teachers, writers, and anyone who wants to have a strong understanding and foundation for their writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful bar map","review":"This is very useful if you go on rides that have detailed turn by turn directions.The velcro closure at the bottom is nice.The only problem that I had was with the velcro straps that anchored the bar map. In order to keep the bar map from moving around I needed to use clips in addition to the straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Works better than expected. Although intended for the front handlebar, this also works on the back of a tandem. Much easier (and drier) than keeping maps in the back pocket of my husband's jersey! Very stable during the ride, the velcro closure makes it easy to change maps, and there is a lot of visible space so you don't have to change it every five minutes for rides with lots of turns. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I was a little skeptic at first but gave it a try and glad I did. I do a lot overwinter cuttings and seedlings inside and the moist soil is a true magnet for fungus gnats. I have had them inside every winter and never had gotten rid of them. So I applied this stuff to every plant and flat following the directions closely then I had a few gnats in the air which I manually killed then none. None of the eggs were able to hatch. I applied in Nov and it is now march 14 and not one single gnat. Now with this blast of 70 degree weather for the past week I saw a few inside one of my flats , time to reapply. Also this stuff is toxic to insects and also birds so beware of when you apply this so when you put your plants outside they will not be affecting nectaring birds such as hummingbirds. I cant say what this will do to aphids or anything else but Im sure it will be worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes lives.

With just a few basics to work with, Fawcett creates a plausible world for Mycroft to inhabit. The adventure, dealing with political intrigue and occult trappings, moves along well and many details of Mycroft's activities are explained. The inclusion of two different perspectives on the adventure (one from Mycroft's adventuring secretary, one from his butler) add to the interesting format Fawcett uses to move the plot along. Good fun in Victorian espionage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric, Intellectual and Character Driven Story","review":"Fawcett has perfectly captured the Victorian zen with this addition to the Holmes tapestry. As most fans know, Mycroft, Sherlock's older and \\"smarter\\" brother is the brain of the British government's intelligence and counterintelligence services of the period, and Fawcett convincingly populates the time and place.The prose is wonderful, particularly the dialogue, which perfectly captures the essence of the highly articulate and oh-so-English main characters. It's a pleasure to read an author that places such an emphasis on the quality of the dialogue.The story itself moves forward with real momentum; I found it increasingly difficult to put the book down as I progressed through it.Highly recommended to Holmes fans, or any reader with an interest in Victorian settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Characterization","review":"Slow moving book.

The traditional Japanese diet is only part of the answer. Cultural pressures in Japan to be thin are overwhelming. If you live in Japan and gain so much as one kilogram, you'll hear about it before the needle on your scale can even register it. Both men and women watch every bite of food a woman eats in public. At the workplace eyes will roll knowingly if a woman eats four small rice balls for lunch. Conversely, women are chided or quized about \\"being on a diet\\" if they consume only two rice balls. The incidents of eating disorders is skyrocketing in Japan. Underlying everything is a feeling of superiority about being thinner and more youthful than people of other countries and cultures. Witness the title of the book itself. The title alone rates a zero in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please. The Frenchwoman did it better!","review":"As another reviewer said, this is a total ripoff of \\"French Women Don't Get Fat,\\" only with seaweed, dried fish flakes and soy instead of apple tart, vegetable soup with pesto, etc. (Which would YOU rather eat?) I can't imagine eating fish, tofu and/or seaweed for breakfast, no matter how healthy and slimming it might be. Every single recipe calls for at least one ingredient that I wouldn't have a CLUE how to find -- and frankly, not one recipe appealed to me. All the stuff about how bad the American diet is, is true -- but come on, we've heard it before. I am giving it 2 stars only to be nice, and because I'm not particularly a Japanese food fan in the first place, so I figure I'm slightly biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reality of the Tokyo Kitchens","review":"In reading the reviews, K.M. Harris and T. Tanaka (Japanese residents) have got it (mostly) right. This is not the reality of the modern Japanese diet, it is a look at traditional dietary habits. I disagree with reviewer Harris that Japanese genetics are the whole story - there is an increase in body fat and weight gain as reported by T. Tanaka and an increase in chronic diseases. These changes are in line with dramatic changes to the Japanese diet in a short period of time so it is indeed quite evident that nutrition can influence genes.For a more useful overview of the changing Japanese diet and the differences between Western diets and that of Japan, see the excellent new book by Logan - The Brain Diet.

The only useful advice it gives for losing weight and staying young are common sense things that you can find anywhere: don't over-eat; exercise regularly; watch what you eat, etc. Everything else is just the author saying how much better her family and her country do things than any other country. Even some of the Japanese recipes (the scrambled eggs and steak breakfast recipe) are actually western meals with added Japanese flavor (soy sauce). I would say, don't waste your money. Just buy a Japanese cookbook, don't over-eat, exercise, eat a variety of foods and lots of vegetables, and wash your face regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genetics, Cognition, Metabolism, + Diet","review":"Although genetics, self-thoughts, diet (consumption), and metabolic rate (exercise + caloric expenditure) play significant roles in appearance, this book includes relatively few secrets worth reading about, which include foods or ingredients consumed by the Japanese culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to tell you this but..........","review":"I am currently living in Japan as an expat and have been here for 10 months ( 2 more years to go).

Eating like the Japanese is not a diet or a weight loss plan, they eat allot. Please keep in mind that in Japan many people walk instead of drive so they are always on the go, it is much easier to walk most places and if you take a train of course you are still looking at tons of walking.Also if you like beer, it is heavy and has more calories than American brews.This is not a diet trust me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true","review":"Can I just say that Japanese women do get old , and not as fat as in other countries, but they do not sustain the figure of their youth.

After a fruitless search in various cooking stores, I found this. I chose this one over the plain pounder just in case I would want a tenderizer. Boy am I glad I did.With very little wrist movement, the tenderizer's weight flattens and tenderizes chicken with almost no effort (try that with one of those lightweight wooden ones).The large flat section takes just a little more effort (still very little) to make your cuts thin and even.Definitely one of the best things I have bought for my kitchen in a long time.

It comes with a second pair of wings - that wasn't my problem. The actual plastic that HELD the wing in was broken!

Years ago I decided that this would be the book I would use as a blackjack reference. I have never been sorry. I did not play well enough (my fault, not Revere's) to get rich. I did, however, play well enough to get shut down at two tables- one at the Stardust and again at the Thunderbird. Those that remember the \\"bird\\" know how long ago that has been.

Examples that the author provides do not give any additional insights. Every single topic covered in this text can be found in existing textbooks (Gandolfo, Van Long & Leonard, Chiang, etc. in addition to the already mentioned) presented in a more precise, adequate and interesting way.

For a small glass piece, there's no room for this in the design - looks kind of crude - not like my others which are much more refined/detailed in their design.Also, there are violet colors added at the bottom of the piece, and it's done so poorly that it almost looks like a child had dotted the glass with a felt tipped marker.None of these differences are visible in the product photo, but they're clear when you're holding it in person.

We did like the ending and how the town comes toghter.

With the title being Enola Gay I expected much more about the plane and crew itself, instead this is more a documentary on the atomic bomb itself than on the airplane.It is well done with interviews and actual footage of the bombings themselves.

However, they are largely unschooled in their religion and do not go out their way to encourage thir children to embrace Judaism.

If you are looking for an introduction to the Ramones it would be better to get one of the many compilations that are out there. The DVD has alot of their videos on it and added some to the Lifestyles of the ramones video that was previously available. The selling point for this item is the great comic book that comes with it. In the other compilations that are available someone always wrote a tribute to the ramones and gave some background. This is trully a unique item to find in a box set.

That I didn't recognize their amazing work was not because I was too young--in fact I was in my 20's--but rather because I, like most everyone in the 70's, was rock-n-roll shanghai'd by the mellow sounds of Linda Ronstadt, the Doobie Brothers, the Eagles, and other lethargic slicksters. It wasn't that I wasn't exposed to them; it's just that I dismissed them hastily as another \\"oldies\\" band like Sha-Na-Na, albeit with a harder edge. How could I have been so blind? At their core, the Ramones brought fast-tempo back to rock-n-roll---rapid fire 1/16th notes not heard since At The Hop, Great Balls of Fire, or Lucille. To that, they married a Warhol-esque world view and a Beach Boys liturgy of adolescent fun. The result was a reinvention of everything that made rock and roll great, and it was only a matter of time before anyone who loves it would discover the best band since The Beatles, The Kinks and The Rolling Stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HAIL THE RAMONES!!!","review":"Great value!!

Sure it's not a single masterwork, but rather many many essays, but it's amazing and complex and revealing... Now, none of it will likely make sense unless you're relatively deep into continental philosophy already, but for those who are readers in the field, if you haven't spent time on Nancy, you're just spinning your wheels. Yup. Oh, and this will put Being and Time into perspective for you too, and should be read alongside your Levinas, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Reading","review":"This book is another great work in defence of the Bible against the attacks from modern defenders of corrupt versions. This book not only defines many archaic words, but also shows some modern secular usage as well as usage of archaic words in corrupt bible versions. This shows how meaningless it is to stab at the Bible by saying that it is archaic. I have also read 2 other of Vance's books. I recommend any of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful, Articulate, and Clear","review":"On the day after receiving this book I was able to use it twice. It happened that I ran into the words \\"trow\\" and \\"youward\\" in my AV reading. Both times I reached for this book and easily found the word, its meaning, its usage in the AV, and how other translations have handled these words. I couldn't be more pleased. It is now on my shelf in easy reach when I do my daily reading of the AV.The book itself is bound well, opens easily and lies flat for comfortable reading. The print is dark, the paper thick enough so there's no bleedthrough from the next page. The print is also large enough for readers of all ages. In other words, the author/publisher has taken efforts to design the book so that the reader can actually use it with comfort.I am extremely pleased and recommend it for anyone studying, contemplating, or just perusing the King James Version."},{"rating":"2","title":"wealth of information","review":"I've been pleased with the book and find it an excellent companion for bible reading and study. It does fall short in one regard, to-wit: it does not include many words found only in the inter-covenantal books, or so called Apocrypha, which are included in the original Authorized Version. Denominationalism aside, I would love to see the author address this issue with the same degree of thoroughness, perhaps in a follow-up volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie to stream but EDITED","review":"Baffled! was a 1973 TV movie/pilot made in the UK distributed by ITC (The Muppet Show, Space:1999). It was also shown theatrically in some places. In the early 80's it was released to video by 20'th Century Fox video. Since then it was out of print until the mid 90's when it was released on another label recorded in EP. It also was edited compared to the 20'th Century Fox video version (I estimate the editing at about 5 minutes). That video is also now out of print. Now, Baffled can be streamed from Amazon, but alas has the most recent master which is the one that was used for that video and carries the edits. Still a worthy movie to check out, but I wish it was complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, Blues written by others or whatever you want to call it.","review":"This was just a OK.Would I buy it again, Nah!!!!

Next, retired Mr. Lapecora is killed in the elevator of his apartment house. One the list of suspects are his gorgeous cleaning lady and her son.Do the two incidents connect? Of course they do. And Inspector Montalbano figures it all out. As usual, he is down to earth and easy going and, in a way, he gives us a tour of his beloved island. One is tempted to pack up and go there. What a delightful book that leaves you smiling and with nary a bad thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snack Thief","review":"Another fun read about Inspector Montalbano.

Enjoyed Terra Cotta Dog equally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as a vacation","review":"It's so hard to get away these days -- between terrorist alerts and high costs of travel and vacation days being used to visit families, reading a book like The Snack Thief is a like taking a mini-vacation. Camilleri's village is fictitious, but his Inspector Montalbo is true to life. He also likes to read international crime thrillers, savors fine food, and has a laughably volatile temper that can be aroused even if the day is windy. There are episodes in this book that are truly hilarious, some that are horrific, and several that are sad. A good mix. And we're always anxious to see what has been left for his dinner in the refrigerator. Like the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency series, this series in its entirety presents a portrait of an unforgettable way of life in a specific place with a person I'd like to spend some time with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Complicated Mystery To Chew On","review":"Like any well told mystery THE SNACK THIEF takes awhile to unfold showing us more than what we thought was initially there in grand style. Inspector Montalbano is a cranky Sicilian policeman who, with his Sherlock-like and food loving mind,is called in to investigate a simple murder in the ficticious town of Vigata.And like his two previous Inspector Montalbano novels Andrea Camilleri serves up more than a simple murder with interesting plot twists and turns, political chicanery, a local police force you come to know and enjoy, and hey, even relationship problems that show us our hero is only human after all.Andrea Camilleri is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors and reading over some of the reviews here it's easy to see that he's appreciated by many others as well.Just bought the next novel in line and I'm grinning."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it and shared it","review":"great book to read and keep or to pass along to a favorite friend or loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Message","review":"The foundational principals of the Ten Commandments have shaped societies for thousands of years.

It contains mostly short pieces often played by him as encores. This release contains a couple of high points, for me. The Ravel 'Jeux d'eaux,' while not one of my favorite pieces, is played to a fare-the-well here by Moisewitsch.By far the most interesting thing here is the Delius Piano Concerto with Constant Lambert conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra, recorded in 1946. First of all, the Delius is a rarity in itself. Second, Moisewitsch, who championed this concerto throughout his career, plays it lovingly and makes as much as can be made of this admittedly somewhat loosely constructed piece. And if you're a Delius fan - and you know who you are - you must have this performance.The sound, as one has come to expect in the historical releases series from Naxos, is quite good, thanks to the meticulous engineering of Ward Marston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee blend, in my opinion","review":"I've been buying this coffee for something like a year now, ever since I first tried it.

Oh yes, and I must admit: in my relatively sedate middle age, the name, Rebellion Blend, does all the right things for morale. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth watching over and over","review":"I bought the ten pack of instructional dvds. I have learned much from the videos and have watched them several times. The one problem that I have is that not all the videos are divided into chapters so it is like watching a tape rather than a dvd. You have to fast forward through the disk rather than going to the particular chapter. I also find that on occasion Jensen does not describe what all parts of the body could be doing to achieve a more powerful stroke or more control (e.g. while the racket makes contract on the forehand, what the non-racket hand may do, where the knuckle is placed on the racket during the serve). I realize that for some these things happen automatically, but I think for some us, the possible optimum placement should be discussed. On the other hand, he communicates the basics of each stroke with a nice mix of the traditional and modern approaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"was thinking of buying this","review":"but after reading these reviews, i noticed that they seem to be all coming from the same source. obviously they seemed a bit biased, so i suspect the author is making these reviews up, or has someone writing them for him. i was considering buying the set, but based on the faked reviews, i will pass. if there are truly honest reviews of this dvd set i might consider. it's like cheating on a test in high school, no one ever gets a 100 percent score. so if you're going to fake your own dvd reviews, it would be more convincing if there were a few not so great reviews in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"SomeOfTheMostBeautifulAndImportantWritingInEnglishHerein.","review":"In this gorgeous book, R F Laird accomplishes many miracles, foremost among them an old man is lying on a gurney in a hospital doped up waiting to die and thinking back through his life and questioning his choices, his fate, his disappointments, and at one point his much addled mind grabs hold of first Jesus then Lincoln and makes a glorious amalgam of them in the torque of his heart's strings and the end of his rope and it is as beautiful as any passage written in English. This book was poorly marketed and its literary heights and cerebral depths and perceptual vistas are masked by the cover which is only in the most superficial and banal sense compatible with its content.

It was just him and his guitar. The gig was incredible. I purchased the CD there. Those whole album is great. He is a Irish born, Canadian folk singer. His songs sound like a cross between typical folk music with a bit of country and Celtic influence thrown in. Track #13 O'Shaughnessy's Lament won him the new songwriter award at the Kerville, Texas folk festival last year. The song brings tears to your eyes. There isn't one weak track on the disc in my opinion. His voice is strong and pure. He wrote the majority of the songs on the album.

Basically it's a box with 17 CD's in it. Nothing more, nothing less. I was expecting a lot more since they want $400 USD for this box. The Bonfire box set i bought years ago had way more AC/DC trinkets in it. There's just nothing in this but the discs. I figure each disc is worth $10 USD in the store X 17 albums so it would cost you around $200 to make this box set yourself off retail shelves. So i still think i got a great deal and getting them all at once remastered is a nice have it all now move. But no way is this box set worth what Amazon's got it listed for.

While the book touches on many tasks, touching on them is all it does; and most of the direction this book does give is wasted on generalizations and things that practically any Unix user will already know.

I'm new to Solaris, but quite experienced in the freenixes and BSD. I bought this and the Advanced guide based on the Sun name. Ouch. Don't make the same mistake I did. I still haven't gotten IP networking up, and there's nothing in the index of this book that I can find that says anything about installation and/or device setup other than modems and printers. All I need is to set up my danged ethernet card! Frustrating to say the least!I swear those users that are giving it 5-star reviews are probably Sun employees directly involved with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of paper","review":"For anyone planning on buying this book I have just one piece of advice...DON'T. This was the first Solaris admin book I looked at and all I can say is \\"this book is appalling.\\" It is poorly written, poorly organised, doesn't cover enough topics, and those topics that are covered are not covered in enough detail. Fortunately for me, I got a copy for free. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for such a shocking book. It would have been a complete waste of money. Buy \\"A Practical Guide to Solaris\\" by Mark Sobell instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Search Again","review":"We have this and the \\"Advanced\\" guide in the office.

I would elaborate on that but, to paraphrase Janice, that would be beyond the scope of this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good.","review":"I bought this book when starting my first full-time Solaris admin job. I read the bad reviews, but bought it on the basis of the Sun logo. MISTAKE.

Regardless, the arrangements of the few themes that were selected from The Adventures of Superman were very poor. The tempos and scoring are weak and not faithful enough to the original.

And badly done rerecordings. While they do sound similar to the original. They sound like they were done by a second rate orchestra. What's sad is that you can easily get the original recording that are on this set. Sure it would cost you a bit more in money, but in the end you would be glad you did.

So far, all you had know about Chinese Communist Party may not more than anti-human-right, uncivilized, insidious deadly manic. But, some of you may ever wondered, in very remote distance prehaps, how could them win Chinese civil war in 1940s, how could them defeat UN army in 1950s. by knowing some Korean War, you may also ask, how could CCP turned sloppiest old Chinese cowards into warriers.Well, if you have those questions, you will find answers in this book, if you never doubt about mainstreet media and don't have any of those question, you may going to draw a whole new conclusion about CCP after reading this book.If allows me please, I'll say this is the only book you will understand China in the past and present.

It worked okay. Recently, about two years later, I found that one of the steel 'loops' had broken, near the tip. It can no longer be used for most tasks, because the broken part catches on food and rips it (e.g., pancakes) or pushes food away instead of slipping under it. I don't know what circumstance caused the steel to break. I didn't notice when it happened. The turner has not been used for any unusual activity (e.g., turning screws), has not been used especially hard, or under extreme conditions. I didn't use it for blacksmithing, or heavy duty restaurant work. This thing must be made of very poor quality steel.

They sing the kind of songs my Grandmother sang around the house sitting her rocker. They sing the kind of Gospel songs that draw you closer to Lord. They have their own style that few can match, but would never quite get there.I don't know if I'm giving you good review on this CD or any tape or CD which has the Consolers singing on it; and if I were a betting person, I would say the Heavenly Choir would be honored to have them one day stand beside them and sing.

The plot plods along in incredibly predictable fashion. I couldn't have cared less what the mystery was about because it just wasn't original or interesting. The author's attempt to craft a female character is laughable and the constant aikido references are grating. I usually don't like to criticize but this book is so poorly written that I feel I have to submit this review. All that being said, the book does at times capture the unique qualities that make San Francisco such a beautiful city.

You'd be better off picking up just about any other mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, Largely Boring And Depressing","review":"Photography buffs or fans of Aikido might enjoy this one, but I didn't. I waited patiently throughout the story for something to spark my interest, but it never came along.

However, the writing in this book was awful. I love books, including murder mysteries, and read about 4 a week. Nonetheless, this one was so bad, I actually had to force myself to finish it just so I could find out how it ended. I didn't enjoy it at all and that is VERY unusual for me. I would not recommend this book to anyone; even if that person does not know, or care, about correct grammar and sentence structure. Even the most inept English student will become annoyed at how bad the writing is in this book. If you want to read a murder mystery, with a stong, leading female character, I strongly recommend Patricia Cornwall or Laura Lippman. Both are skillful authors with entertaining novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a book on tape, 'Trick of Light' is no delight","review":"As often happens in the abridged books on tape, the book is too abridged. In this case, the plot was herky-jerky. I thought that it was perhaps the fault of the abridgement, but after reading some other reviews, perhaps not.Regardless, our heroine's motivations are ill-defined at best. Is it revenge, curiousity, the desire to get a story? Why does she think a camera is on a par with a high powered rifle when she breaks into buildings? Who knows?The reader was, at times, right on the money. Other times, she was simply too emoting, nearly maudlin.

The character Allegra, instead of being as a front cover blurb suggests..'a likable, unpretentious protagonist'...is instead a mean spririted woman who snipes and bites at others for no apparent reason other than it's her nature.Instead of being forthright in asking others about her mother's life she sneaks and snivels her way into asking questions and berates even senile little old ladies.The ending is amazing.

Even if you're not a follower of wrestling you will likely enjoy this tale.I mostly appreciated Billy's open honesty about his mistakes and failures. He's not trying to candy coat his errors.

Even so, this wireless speaker performs admirably. Every once in a while, it gets a hiccup and I get a note of static, but it's generally brief and doesn't interrupt the party.The sound quality is very clean. Be realistic in your expectations though, this is a 5 Watt speaker. It's not terribly loud and there's isn't bass to write home about. I use it on a large balcony and it provides the perfect accompaniment to the music playing inside my apartment.It is practically ideal for apartment living as the sound quality is good, but not powerful enough to get you in trouble with the condo association. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Recording","review":"The Lindsays are not as well known in the US as in Europe. They are one of the best String Quartets ever! Comparable to Busch,Vegh,Hungarian and Amadeus.

This is one of their series of \\"Bohemian\\" Quartets and all of them are 5 stars.They have now retired and their like is not playing anymore.Get any of their CD's ( and the Beethoven is especially fine) and I assure you, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"This is ADD-friendly because it's clear & easy to install.

Other than that, great organizer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Some die wholly in half a breath-\\"","review":"This book starts with a three-line verse by Rudyard Kipling (Some Die Eloquent), and it is a very good way to describe the death that Sloan is faced with in this book. A lady with life-threatening diabetes is found dead in her home. That doesn't look so suspicious until it is discovered that this quiet chemistry teacher has 3/4 of a million pounds in her bank account. This puts Sloan and Crosby on the tail of a murderer. The book is quite fast-paced for a Catherine Aird, and there is a fair amount of tension throughout. This is certainly aided by the impending birth of Sloan's baby and the needs that his family situation put on him. But never fear, he's there for the arrest of the murderer, and he makes it in time for the birth of his son. A good entry in the Sloan series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This stuff didn't do anything for me. It was merely a lubrication and not very good at that.

Since it sounds similar to that, I opened on the kitchen faucet and measured the sound volume with a sound meter which was about 80db. Next I measured the buzzer from about 2 feet away. Even though the buzzer acheives the 90db claimed while uninstalled, the tone is like background noise so it is easily ignored and makes it seem quieter than it really is. It sounds about twice as loud as the water hitting the kitchen sink. Once installed it will probably be even quiter since it will be attached to a stiff wooden rafter that will deaden the sound. If there's other noise in the area, don't expect to be able to hear this over the other noise. This is not what I expected. If you need something loud try one the devices with a bell attached to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As much as religious conservatives want to villify Sanger","review":"...the reality is that she fought hard to make access to BASIC contraceptive information available to ALL families--wealthy, middle-class, poor, immigrant, WASP, African-American, etc.Her battle against Anthony Comstock's puritanical Comstock Law--which made it illegal to give a pamphlet to a woman explaining basic menstruation--is legendary. Her article \\"Comstockery in America,\\" written in 1915 and discussed in this book, highlighted the campaign by government officials to keep basic information out of the hands of the average person.Special interest groups have created a campaign over the past 20 years to smear Sanger as a eugenicist, writing books that are published by biased publishing companies as part of a clear agenda.

In her lifetime, Sanger encountered countless women, burdened by poverty and many mouths to feed, begging to hear the \\"secret\\" method to prevent pregnancy. Sanger's campaign took her across the nation and the continents, often times running a step ahead of church and legal authorities.I learned a great deal about the fight for birth control than I had ever thought possible. I learned that Sanger abhorred abortion while embracing contraception as a means to prevent conception. Ironically, I think this would exclude her from both of today's pro-life and pro-choice sides.

She worked for years to set up programs to exterminate the \\"feebleminded\\" (euphemism for minorities), and created Planned Parenthood. Her autobiography is a study in egoism. Sanger had family, but basically shows little interest in her husband and children because her main interest was genocide of the \\"unfit\\".

I won't bother to go into detail since I could never do justice to these stories by taking any parts out of context. Suffice to say that this collection is unique in it's ability to elicit laughter one moment, then fill the reader with melancholy and wistfulness the next. \\"Nuptials and Heathens\\" is the one I wish I had written, although almost all the tales in this collection are smart, insightful glimpses into human nature, and great additions to the field of contemporary short stories.

Modesitt, wondered if it would be worth the reading time. It was! I thoroughly enjoyed it. On the one hand, it was a standard \\"up through the ranks\\" science fiction war story that reminded me of Starship Troopers and Ender's Game. On the other hand, as the story progressed the issue of religious vs. secular belief systems came closer and closer to the surface, until the ending which brought both themes together. I was a little uncomfortable with the obvious linking of fanaticism with Islamic-style religion, and intrigued by what I thought might be Mormon echoes in the Revenant (religious) society. And personally I don't agree with Modesitt's conclusions about the nature and role of religion. None of that prevented me from appreciating a page-turner that also made me think a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parafaith War- Interesting Ideas, Slow Book","review":"While many of the concepts in 'The Parafaith War' are interesting: Quazi-Mormon religious fanatics, brain implants controlling 'modern' warfare, time delayed space travel, reverse racial discrimination, etc... the story is just too long with too many jumps of logic that it will put an end to any possible 'suspension of disbelief.' Besides that, it's just plain slow. Throughout an interstellar war the protagonist shifts through so many jobs that the reader can barely keep up. He's an infantry man, no, he's a pilot, no, he's a secret agent, no, he's a false prophet. While the ending did have a few nice surprises I fear most readers will have put the book down long before then, I almost did. Also, Mormon's and a few other religions might be a little offended at the parellels between their church and 'Parafaith's' antagonists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Sci-Fi with an anti-religious bend","review":"I picked this book up at a grocery store on a whim. A good chunk of the way into the book I figured out the evil religious society was based on Mormon Culture. This isn't an anti-Mormon tract; the book is filled with broad based anti-religious cliches that targets religion in general.If you are a Mormon you may find the book kind of funny, if you are looking for a great sci-fi book, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not find it interesting.........","review":"Alright, I can not, say really what this book is. I DID not like it one bit. My brother on the other hand LOVED IT, why I don't know. I never finished it, and could not get into it. The story line looks good, But it just didn't grab me. It was boring, VERY boring, even when the attack came onto the station he was in, It just wasn't good! Just alot of blarring warinings and messages that make no sense.

Well, this book gives you the answers to those questions and a whole lot more. Greg Palast gets access to information that the fat cats would rather you and I never see. He has an uncanny knack for building relationships with those with access to the insider info and the inner workings of those who craft our foreign and domestic policy, who they are, who they work for, their motivations and their goals. This really is a must read book for all Americans regardless of political stripe. You owe it to your country to know how and why we are in the mess we're in in Iraq and a whole lot more. Buy it today. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Book, Neocons should read it too.","review":"I just finished Palast's latest book. Wow.Here is a thoughtful, honest and well researched examination of America's current situation. I recommend this book to anyone who is still considering supporting the Neocon agenda and is willing to vote against their own best interest - again.Armed Madhouse covers a wide range of topics: Iraq, past and present vote scamming, the Democratic party, the economy, Bush and his oil-soaked buddies and other relevant subjects. Unlike the Neocons, Palast makes his case using FACTS and RESEARCH, not inflammatory rhetoric and lies (\\"he's a moonbat\\" - wrote one Neocon minion, typical mind-slave comment).I urge everyone to get over the fear, read this book and then do their own research. Maybe if enough people wake up, we won't all wind up unemployed or building military bases in Iran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"I read a lot of \\"Bush-bashing\\" books and consider myself to be up to date as to the perfidies of this administration. Even so, this book is shocking! I'm sure much of Palast's investigation is skewed to support his pre-conceived notions. Even so, it is research impressively done and presents a viewpoint I have not seen elsewhere. The book sheds a remarkable new light on the in-fighting in the Bush administration and also adds considerably to our knowledge of the ineptitude of principal Bush operatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I laughed, I cried\\"","review":"I've never read a book by such a witty investigative reporter.

The story was beautifully written and unlike Richard Ford's The Sportswriter, Friedman was able to tell a much better story in 150 less pages..Any brothers can pick up this story and immediately relate, whether you are older or younger. Joe, the narrator, represented the typical Californian liberal, always needing to be stroked and noticed in order to feel good about himself. Unfortunately, it was too late before he realized his incessant hatred toward his brother was ill-advised and ill-conceived. The simple lesson, as Joe learned through his brother's success and fall from baseball, was that being on top isn't always the best view.

What a waste of time. I could not even get a carrot through it without a great deal of effort. My hand held julienne peeler is faster and safer than this mandoline. I'm returning it this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slicer that doesn't slice","review":"My husband bought this slicer for me for Christmas. I loved the design and the way the blades were stored. It looked amazing. However, when I tried to chop an onion, I found that the blade was terribly dull (and yes I did remove the plastic covering first). On julienne, it made mush. I thought that maybe that wasn't the best choice, so I tried to slice. It took all of my strength to cross the blade and I got chunks out and the onion got stuck.After several Boerner V-slicers, which I have worn out over the years, and Pampered chef slicer - I would definitely go back to one of my older models. This one simply didn't work. The others were both one of my favorite kitchen tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good chef's knife is better","review":"This may be an exceptional mandoline, as all the experts say. But a good sharp chef's knife does a better job and, most importantly, requires a lot less clean-up.My first use of the mandoline was julienning carrots for chicken soup. While it did a find job on the first two-thirds of the carrot, it couldn't slice the last third. That last third was a ragged mess that only the chef's knife could finish. I think this limitation is inherent in any mandoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT cut it","review":"I have a German V-slicer that works great, but only cuts in two positions. I wanted adjustable thickness. I got a Japanese slicer with an adjustable blade. It works great, but is a bit narrow. I wanted an adjustable blade wide enough to slice a good sized onion. I got the Oxo slicer. I have a number of Oxo products and have been pleased with all of them.It is pretty. It is sturdy. It stands on it's own legs. It does not cut. I don't know why I didn't return it. I got it in 2004 and have attempted to use it maybe 3 or 4 times. It is just too dull to cut anything. It is safer than my other slicers-I don't think it could cut my finger. It is fairly effective at making tomato puree and crumbling cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"Like others have mentioned, the blades on this mandoline are very dull. There must be a quality control problem since others give it good reviews. In my case, it simply does not work well at all. This has nothing to do with reading the instructions or inexperience. My wife is a pastry chef. The simple fact is that ours came with a dull blade. It is useless! Big dissapointment.I though about sharpening the blade but I don't want to void the warranty. It is only one month old so I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I'm disappointed in this product.

It makes pretty good waffle fries using white potatoes but it doesn't cut a sweet potato at all. I had to get my boyfriend to try to push the sweet potato through (he's a muscular guy), and he had trouble. I abandoned the \\"food holder/grip\\" altogether. It's a joke. Needless to say I sliced my hand. Wont do that again. Like pervious users said, I am often left with unused portions of vegetables that I end up cutting with a knife (defeating the purpose of the mandoline). i love Oxo but this product doeasn't make sense. I am most disappointed with the food holder. it's good for a cucumber....that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade is way too dull","review":"Sorry, this isn't a reasonable alternative to a commercial mandoline. I just got mine and tried it out on two foods.1. An orange (unpeeled, exactly as depicted on the box): A total and complete disaster. Couldn't even get it started on the end slice, so I cut it to the flesh first with a knife to get it going. I did not get a single clean slice. By halfway through the orange, it was a pulpy lump of mush.2. A sweet potato: I would rate this one perhaps a \\"fair\\" for slices. When I switched to the thick julienne blade, however, it would not cut completely through the entire width of the sweet potato. It jammed, leaving me with a mess.As a review above noted, it would completely impossible to cut a tomato on this thing. I have doubts about a bell pepper, too, as those have a skin.These blades don't cut it (pun intended). I'm returning it and buying a commercial model. Serious cooks should avoid this slicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk O' Junk","review":"Like the other customers, I have the same complaint...Mainly, the gripper does not grip the food firmly and does not glide over the blade (the gripper is too wide). It is very awkward to use, which makes you inclined to just hold the food with your hand...not safe. My friend badly sliced two of her fingertips because the gripper was so awkward, she just went at it hand held. I'm not saying it was the products fault my friend sliced her fingers...just saying it probably wouldn't have happened if the gripper worked worth a damn. Not to mention the food waste...this slicer wastes 1/3 of your vegetable due to lack of proper gripping. Slices of potatoe and cucumber worked well (although still wasted a lot), but like the other folks, I could not julienne a carrot to save my life. Pretty disappointed with this product. OXO - please take heed and design a better/safer/more effective gripping mechanism and gliding action."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I didn't know my inlaws loved me...","review":"...I would think they were trying to kill/injure me by giving me this Mandoline. I received it as a Christmas gift and was very excited. Opened it up to slice some onions and the could barely get it through the onion once. I tried a tomato and it more crushed than sliced that. The blade is so dull that is dangerous to use. Buyer be ware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money!","review":"If you are going to use a mandoline I would assume that you are at least an accomplished home cook. You respect the blade and use it with caution wheither knife or slicers. With that said, I am a fan of OXO products and decided to purchase this one after my Benriner Japanese slicer of 6 yrs became somewhat dull. BIG mistake.The blade on this thing is a joke! It's so dull that it renders it dangerous,(its never a good idea to put a lot of pressure on any blade) a sharp blade will always give you a clean cut with very little pressure. It failed the most simple of task (simple slices of tomato, potato or cabbage). My old Benriner was sharper then this slicer which was brand spankin' new. I've tried sharpening the blade but to no avail. The blade itself is too soft and flimsy for sharpening. For a third of the price I could just replace my trusty Benriner which is simple, compact and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disappointing. The negative reviews are for good reason!","review":"I was not completely confident when purchasing this Mandoline due to the mixed reviews. I tried making waffle cut fries out of a sweet potato and it did not work at all. The fries came out too thick to have the holes in the waffle texture (after turning the sweet potato 90 degrees after each cut). Instead they were merely wavy on each side. It was also difficult to push with the perpendicular blade. It left food chunks after each push on the waffle setting. I also tried the large julienne setting with a regular potato. Again, it was hard to push and left chunks of food. This mandoline is NOT worth the money. My mom's $20 bowl top mandoline works SO much better. After trying this product I will look for an angled or v-bladed mandoline. OXO gets a big thumbs down on this mandoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand new: blade very dull","review":"I bought this several months ago, to replace my old, cheap V-slicer. I've always wanted a pro-type mandoline. I didn't have a need for it until last night and was sorely disappointed when trying to slice an onion. I thought I was doing something wrong as the onion shredded. When I examined the blade I found it very dull (and yes, I did remove the protective plastic). I would return it, but I bought it so long ago I am beyond any grace period they might give me. This review is the only satisfaction I can get. I'm going back to my old $20 V-slicer, if I can find it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"steer clear","review":"I purchased the oxo mandoline slicer and was so disappointed. The first thing I tried were potatoes and the blade was so dull it just mushed up my potatoes. I never got a clean slice. Fortunately I was able to return the item but that was another trip to the store. The main problem is that the blade is just not sharp enough to do the job so save your time and steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"We have many items from Oxo around the house and have liked every one except for the mandoline. After buying it I tried slicing a carrot, an orange, a tomato and a potato. It only worked on the potato. After looking at the Amazon reviews I tried sharpening the blade with no luck. Things still ended up looking like roadkill.I am very disappointed with Oxo's mandoline. It wasn't inexpensive, but I wouldn't want it if were half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree-the blade is not sharp enough.I bought it to make sweet potato fries and the julienne blade can't get though a sweet potato. It sticks & binds terribly and the force of the potato, broke the tab that sets the blade dial for julinne & it doesn't hold at all. I returned that one & got a replacement but its was no better. I now use the staight cut blade only and stack up the slices in the opposite direction to make fries. It still requires a lot of force & I often must wiggle things to get them through. The pusher is useless. I think a sharper machine with a simpler design would be better & much safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"I longed for a mandoline for years. When I finally decided to buy, it seemed the OXO mandoline would be a good choice: trusted brand name, decent price, good features. This mandoline makes interesting cuts and stands nicely on the counter. However, the food holder makes no sense to me, and the manual explains nothing about its use, only says to not use the mandoline without it. That's the only way I've been able to successfully slice anything--without the food holder. I have such a hard time removing the blade for washing that I finally resorted to prying it out with a table knife to clean it. I've enjoyed slicing cucumbers and carrots; have given up on tomatoes and cheese. I wish I'd known these drawbacks before I bought and used it, because it isn't meeting my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of OXO's winners","review":"I am a huge fan of OXO products, so when I saw that they'd come up with an inexpensive mandoline, something that I'd coveted but could not bring myself to spend $200+ on, I was thrilled. But when I assembled and tested it, not so much.While I liked the design, its performance was completely unacceptable. No matter what thickness I adjusted it to or what vegetable I tried to slice, the results were thoroughly disappointing.Judging from the fact that other reviewers found the same problem, and yet again others seemed quite happy with the performance (which is why I decided to try it out myself) I'm wondering if maybe some but not all of the blades were manufactured poorly. A mandoline blade should be frighteningly sharp. When I pulled the blade from the unit and tested its edge, it was much duller than any of my kitchen knives.Anyway, I am returning this item and going mandolineless again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the mandoline of my dreams - more like the nightmare","review":"It is helpful to read other reviews. I thought it was me. I thought it was the vegetables. Now I think it is the mandoline. I'm also an OXO fan, but this tool doesn't make the cut, literally and figuratively. The holder is a pitiful design. I often feel as if I'm risking my fingers' well-being as I grip the holder and drive the vegetables towards the blades, praying that I get a semi-decent cut of vegetable and not my knuckle. I also risk cracking my hand on the counter as the vegetable sticks and my hand keeps flying on by. I agree with other reviewers who complain that a major portion of vegetable is left to be cut when the holder decides it has done enough work. Folks, find another mandoline. This one will not make you love the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sharp. Straight blade chops, not slice","review":"I was so excited ot use this product as I make pickles a few times a year. This review is only for chopping cucumbers, so I don't know how well it works for other purposes. For cucumbers, it just plain sucks. The straight blade is not only too dull to cleanly cut cukes into chips (it tears the skin on the backside of the chip), it take a considerable amount of effort to just push it through the blade. It's also a bad design. The blade should be angled across the machine so it slices as well as chops.Returning it today to Crate and Barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO Good Grips Mandoline Slicer","review":"Don't go with this product. It has a much lacking design. I am returning mine and returns are a hassle. Even using their suggestion to cut firm tomatoes in a zigzag pattern, it won't cut tomatoes. My cheap plastic model does that very well.I am buying the V-Slicer by OXO. I have determined I need one that stands up rather than me holding it up and I have determined that the V-Slicer is the only mandoline that will cut the softer foods.So, we'll see how this goes. I would get the stainless Borner V-slicer, but it's 100 dollars...and I am trying to go less expensive. My plastic Borner is about worn out, but if you want a real cutter - and non-dulling blades, just buy 2 or 3 of those - if you don't need it to be self-standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like OXY but hate this product","review":"I'm usually pretty satisfied with the design and quality of this company's products. I used a $9 martha stewart one for years that finally warped and dulled but it did slice tomatoes. this one was so dull it couldn't slice anything. I returned it immediately. Its soured me on the straight blade design but I don't see higher end units with the angled/diagonal blade and they don't have as many cutting choices so I'm quite stuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have purchased Oxo products in the past and have been satisfied, but this one was a dog. The blade was not sharp and the hand guard would not grip food very well. The guard has these pins that are supposed to hold onto the food, but they are arranged on a section that moves up and down like a plunger. When you meet the resistance of a dull blade the pins would shred the food from the top. Very awkward to use and wasted a lot of food. Good grip in the hand, poor grip on the veggies. I ended up throwing it in the garbage after the return period was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good slicer for the money","review":"I love this slicer! It works great, easy to clean.

I enjoy using it and I really like the way that you adjust the blade for cutting widths. The only thing that I don't like is the food holder.

But I would recommend this and would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapointment. Potatos only:-(","review":"I received for Christmas. And YES, I did remove the blue film. The blade is Not sharp. Every knife I own is sharper. We tried lemons, fell out of the holder. Tried Carrots, they fell out. Cucumbers only if peeled, if really chunky (and if it a reg. one) it falls out, \\"english\\" cucumbers only.Tomatoes, forget about it. a heavy chunck of iceberg is ok and potatoes. So, as we eat few taters and rarely shred lettuce it it going back. I will buy the salad shooter. I am glad Presto is offering them again. OXO really missed the boat on this. I will think twice about that brand now. I use to trust it with no questions. I have used real ones. The blade is suppose to be like a razor blade. That is why they are so risky and tricky. But the way the food slips off their grip/holder, you may well cut yourself anyway. Funny they show sliced lemon and green pepper on their packaging, yet we could produce neither!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do much better for a lot less cost!","review":"I bought the Oxo slicer to replace and upgrade from my 20 year old Borner V-slicer, or so I thought. Despite the handy,ergonomic, feature-filled and attractive design that attracted me to it, I have to give it the lowest rating because it simply didn't work. I had a friend try it too and he agreed. It took a great effort to cut/slice and often tore things up in the process. My old one is still a breeze after all these years and I think I will now buy another, perhaps larger, model of that. It is really the most useful and used tool in my kitchen next to my basic knives. If you make a lot of vegetable dishes it's indispensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food pusher well not deep enough","review":"Looking for a replacement for my worn Borner mandoline, I gave this OXO mandoline a try.

My husband is blind & needed a slicer that is easy to assemble & adjust. This fits the bill perfectly. I saw some reviews stating that the adjustment cylinder is difficult to remove or replace for cleaning - however, neither I nor my husband had any difficulty. It is very easy to take apart & put back together.

Very hard vegetables are okay. I do not recommend it and in fact returned it. My $25 plastic model, that I've had for years, does a much superior job. The key is in the sharpeness of the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sharp, not useful","review":"This product is not terribly useful, because it is not sharp. At all. And there is no way to sharpen it - maybe the flat blade could be sharpened (I honed it a bit which helped), but the julienne blades cannot be sharpened and are therefore mostly useless. The only thing this can successfully cut is potatoes (and it does a pretty good job at that). Anything else just doesn't work. It even has a hard time with onions. You can forget about slicing bell peppers or tomatoes with this.This was the first mandoline I've ever tried, so I don't know if this is universal to mandolines or if this is just an exceptionally bad product. I don't see why they didn't just make all the blades razor-sharp; that would have made this a really great product. For now I'll have to stick with a chef's knife for anything but potatoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry -- incomplete review","review":"My previous review complained that the blade on this was so dull we were sure we were missing a part.

This is because the blade isn't really as sharp as it could be, at least on the unit I got. I have to use significantly more force than I'd have expected when sliding food over the blades to avoid making a mess. However, once I figured that out and started hammering things onto it I got better results.Still, it gets the job done and when you're finished, it's very easy to take apart and clean.

Do not waste your money.I've had this OXO mandoline about 2 months after being recommended at Williams Sonoma. I agree with many of the negative reviews here. I have one BIG COMPLAINT. The holder grabs a lot of whatever you are cutting, leaving huge chunks of leftover potato, cucumber, carrot or whatever.

So, I decided to replace it with a much more expensive OXO Mandoline. The Borner is no comparison. It's much sharper, so it's easier to push food through, and the food gripper is better. The OXO is being returned to the store today. The one feature that I did like about the OXO was that everything fit conveniently together, there weren't a ton of parts. That feature is not worth keeping it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!!","review":"What junk! It did not slice at all. Leaves big chunks, Gripper would not hold the food.

The food holder is simply terribly designed - food doesn't stay attached to it. And if you do find a small and light veggie that will stay attached to the holder, after slicing it leaves almost an inch of the veggie left, unable to be sliced anymore on the mandoline.I own tons of OXO products, but I was really disappointed in this one. I'll be looking for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased at all","review":"I am not pleased with this slicer. I bought it to make french fries. Half the potato doesn't slice.

It's well built and I love the way it easily pops apart making it easy to clean. I like the way the dial allows you to cut to an exact thickness. And most of all... it's fun to use!! But it does take practice. On larger vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, I find it easier to hold them in my hand for starting off. When I near the blade I switch to the holder. I find the holder is more effective to use when you have a more managable size of vegetable to hold.

My favorite locally-owned kitchen shop quit stocking it when customer after customer had exactly the same experience noted by the low-star reviewers here: The blades aren't sharp at all. It is no exaggeration to say they are as blunt as a butter knife.You can have the straight blade sharpened, but not so with the julienne. Since a nice, even julienne is one of the only things you really can't do sufficiently with a knife, this mandoline gets a big zero from me.It's too bad, because the body and overall design are the best I've ever seen -- much better than the French all-metal ones used in commercial kitchens.

There is a tacky Targus logo button sticking out in front. You might almost think, someone resurrected this model from 30 years ago and called it a notebook case.It is somewhat misleading to say it fits up to 15.4 notebooks. The interior has no special sleeve or casing for your computer. It would hold a much larger laptop equally well or equally poorly.However, the solid molded construction probably affords better protection than many nylon backpacks. The handle is comfortable and won't come off in your lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"I bought this lens to play around with. That is all it was good for, playing around. I sold mine about a month after I bought it to someone who wanted to do the same thing. It is very soft and hell to focus. Forget using the teleconverter. You might as well be looking into a black hole. If you really need 500mm, buy a teleconverter for your 200mm lens if you have it. A used one is about the same price.I used it on a D50. It took about 20 shots to get one that was useable. If you are looking for a spotting scope, it does that well.I did try the Pro Optics F6.3 version and it was a bit sharper but 6.3 made focusing a bit more tricky even though there was more light in the viewfinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you have no other options.","review":"This is a \\"everything manual\\" lens. Difficult to maintain sharp focus, even at 500 mm and more so at 1000 mm using the 2X extender that comes with it. I no longer attempt to use it without a tripod.I think you will get much better results if you use a 2X extender on your 200 or 300 mm lens. That is where I would put my money as you would retain most or all automatic features of your present lenses.

We couldn't afford a bike, nor was there room to put it. His therapist said the pedal exerciser was a good idea. Dad likes and USES it because he can watch golf on TV and pretend he's walking with the crowd! He uses it daily while watching TV. The only drawback for him is it is heavy to move; in addition, my mother and I aren't sure the tension can really be adjusted. It doesn't feel any different to her when she does adjust it to a stronger setting. The best thing is that Dad actually uses it, and he really doesn't like to exercise that much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy if I could go back.","review":"I couldn't get the hang of using this sitting down, so now I use it exclusively as an arm exerciser.

I would not buy if I could go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Item was supposed to be assembled when it arrived, but parts were in the bottom of the box.

I would recommend this product--and this company--to anyone, whether you love biking or you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy if I had it to do over","review":"I bought this because I have a bad hip and wanted convenient, low impact exercise. Also wanted to use it under desk at work.The bad: The motion is jerky. Can't type and pedal at the same time--have to hold onto chair in order to make motion smoother. Definitely not good for office. Tension adjustment makes little difference except to make it noisier and jerkier. One of the rubber feet keeps working itself off. Dislike that the pedal strap has to be adjusted with a screwdriver--what a pain to change it for different size shoes!The good: Fully assembled, except you have to insert the batteries. Booklet is clear on how to do it. Fairly lightweight and easy for a old lady with a bum hip to carry. Sturdy construction. While there is probably no cardio benefit with this, if you need to keep your joints moving while you're watching TV at home, it's probably okay for that.I gave it only 2 stars because I think it is too expensive for something that doesn't work that well."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive arm exerciser","review":"As a Post Stroke survivor.

Probably the only I finished it was because I was stuck in the car for six hours. I found myself having a hard time connecting or even feeling at all sympathetic for any of the characters.

I gave it 2 stars because it was interesting enough to read all the way through. Granted, it was a very short book- if it was any longer I probably would not have read it all the way. The characters lack complexity, the plot was just plain stupid, and the main character was not very likeable. Oh, she's so gorgeous and horny all the time. Geez, really? If I rolled my eyes one more time whilst reading this novel my eyeballs would've fallen out of their sockets. It's like a high school kid wrote this book; the writing was terrible.

I found it on a booklist for Twilight read-alikes, and I understand why it was included, I'm just saying - it's not like Twilight. In fact, if you didn't like Twilight, you may like this book. The protagonist is as full of self-confidance as Bella is full of self-doubt. Whereas Bella's relationship with her family is peripheral, Viviane is surrounded by family. She's part of a pack after all. She's a werewolf. In the end Viviane's dilemna is not far from Bella's; she wishes she could have a friend outside the pack. The theme is a perennial favorite with young adult fiction - finding where you fit in outside the stifling structure of one's family. I didn't like this one because it's too transparent. Too obvious. The angst is spelled out too clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"The thing I liked most about this was the relationship between Vivian and Gabriel. I never liked Adrian from the start, nor did I like Gabriel, for that matter.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blood and Chocolate?\\" More like Werewolf slut","review":"This book has no plot whatsoever. The entire novel is about who the girl should have sex with, a werewolf like her or a human. This book is awful! Half the time she licking and slobbering all over some guy or some werewolf, the vice-a-versa applies too. The book is little more than the repeated scenes and questions of who can I mate with and when? I would not advise this book to anyone. The main character is little more than an attractive whore and the book is nothing but scenes about sex and slobber. AWFUL! Don't read this book! It's ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried.

I decided to try giving werewolves a chance, so I picked this book up.If anything, this made me more \\"team vampire.\\" It didn't make me want to read more about werewolves.

There's no depth to it, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howling for More","review":"I first picked up this book while browsing through my school library; it was so good I finished it the same day.Having read \\"The Silver Kiss\\", I found this novel much more fulfilling than its award-winning predecessor. This is a story for any age level, and is extremely easy to read. Klause captures the teenage anguish of acceptance, friendship, and alienation in a powerfully atmospheric tale. This is a tale of the self-discovery of a girl caught between two species.

Gabriel is the fascinating and dark leader of her pack, with definite animal magnetism and charm. He frustrates, irritates, and attracts Vivian, who is learning what it means to grow up through the course of the book. There's danger and darkness, romance and horror, a believable heroine and, of course Gabriel, who is quite thrilling and an incredibly sexy character. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent biology, so-so character likeability","review":"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I didn't particularly like the protagonist Vivien (I won't call her a heroine because really... she wasn't) because she was cocky, arrogant, and not really very likeable. However, Klause's ability to make the family group feel like an actual wolfpack was incredibly well done and detailed, and her worldbuilding with the creation of the loup garou underworld was fabulous. So it was a good book (it was made into a movie recently, albeit a very loose adaptation) but I'm not sure it was my type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard - not a great read.","review":"This book seemed to be trying too hard to sound interesting or glamorous. I found the story to be tiresome - how many times do we need to hear how beautiful the main character thinks she is, or the sexual tension in the wolf community? A little of that would have been fine, but I wanted more character development. Perhaps this is too much to ask of teen fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe what I just read. . .","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read! I normally enjoy young adult supernatural and fantasy books, but I became more and more disappointed the further I got into the book. Vivian, the main character lives two different lives; the life of a \\"werewolf\\" and a life as a normal girl in high school. Vivian is a weak minded character that only cares about her looks and what men she can seduce. That is, when she is not cowering in passive defiance toward most the males in her life that treat her like the dirt she is. This book is full of misogyny and I would never recommend it to anyone. The only woman in her \\"pack\\" that dare stand up to any of the men turns out the be the \\"big bad guy\\" that Vivian must defeat, while the two main men in her life continue to hate and try to control her. Also, this book has a weak plot and unlikable characters throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!! COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!

IT'S A GREAT BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so...","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I have NEVER liked books or movies where the heroine is a stunningly beautiful girl with boys hanging all over her. And having her be a tough, in-your-face, nobody-messes-with-me don't-even-try-that-girlfriend stunningly beautiful girl makes it even worse. I do like strong heroines, mind, but there can definitely be too much of a good thing. Aside from the fact that I strongly disliked the main character, I did sort of enjoy the book, although the premise is overdone. There are some beautiful passages and strong descriptions, but aside from those points, this book isn't one of the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"Enchanting, intoxicating. Everyone will love this book! Vivian is a werewolf and thinks of herself as a beautiful creature, in both animal and human form. When her attraction grows to a human, Aiden, she is sure he will accept her for who she is and they will love each other. But then things start to terribly wrong - Aiden is not what Vivian hoped for...and there are murders, murders in which Vivian suspects are her fault when her evil unleashes. To add to that, a man named Gabriel wants her to mate - but will she let go of Aiden? This book is powerful, and addicting. It is also realistic, in which Aiden does not return his feelings. A lovely read. Buy this, it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Werewolf perspective on teen problems","review":"With all that goes on in the world, Vivian is a teenage femal werewolf. Her pack is large, but she feels more alone than she thinks anyone can imagine. She isolates herself from them after her father's death causes waves that don't seem to want to disipate.She wants to fit in somewhere, but doesn't think her place is with the pack. To cope, she reaches out to the meat-people(humans). This only succeeds in further seperation between the other werewolves and herself.Vivian deals with problems that most teens have, but hers are compounded by the wolf within her and the fear that she can't control it. Love, mother, friends, and being stuck. That is life for so many.Good book to read. You can feel Vivian's pain with her, but know that everything will end the way it is meant to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was sensual, touching, and mesmerising","review":"I definetly recommend reading Blood and Chocolate to anyone who enjoys the supernatural.

Seventeen Magazine recommended this book a long time ago, and I finally got around to reading it. I am extremely impressed. The characters are believable, and Vivian's thoughts creep into your head and seem to become your own. This is a book that you just can't put down. I am 18 years old, and still think it's great!

Vivian and her pack are werewolves, they look like humans, but can shift to wolf at will. A. Klause characterizes werewolves as something different than they are normally though to be. This was such a good book about love and sacrifice. I must say that the end was shocking, and a little disapointing. But even so, all young adults should read this book. The author's amazing writing technique and story ideas spin a web of magic around this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Don't be fooled by the first page. There is more to this book than boys and \\"catfights.\\" The name Gabriel is purely a biblical reference. The name Aiden means \\"fire\\". I'll leave you to think about those metaphors. While you're at it, don't forget thunder, the moon, the pentagram, and animals. At the end, Klause does have a message about humanity, clearly stated by Gabriel.Nevertheless, if you do take it at face value, it's still a fun read. It's suspenseful, seductive, and well tied together at the end. You'll be pulled through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This story is written very well, but something about it bothers me. The ending was so sad... ah, but if I say why, I'd give the ending away. It's worth reading. I've never read this author's work before, but really it's a good story.

This book is written at right around the 6th grade reading level, but I think its' content is more appropriate for an older audience. I read this book for a college course and there were times when sleep was hard to come by. There are very graphic, gruesome scences along with a mature sexual storyline. I admit to being somewhat of a chicken when it comes to scary stories, but I think I had the right to be scared reading this.

This is the werewolf book that got me interested in this type of fiction. It has a great ending, and it was not predicable. I definitely like the book over the movie, which are really different.

The 5 cats also do mean things to the dog, like tearing up all his toys he brought from his old home. Things come to a head about 3/4 through the book when the kids are being particularly cruel to all the animals. Rocky saves the day, and the cats are nice for the last 4 or so pages.

A single 1/4\\" phono plug to 1/8\\" phono jack adapter is included, which allowed me to plug in my headset. But to hook it to my sound system I had to buy a second 1/4\\" to 1/8\\" adapter. I had a patch cord with 1/8\\" plugs on each end. I cut off one end and soldered on three banana plugs (left, right, and ground).

I did not have to reach page 158 to notice that the \\"journal is a work of fiction.\\" While the library research was quite extensive, he missed the realities and language of the culture. No normal, free young man in a ranching environment would still be fumbling with a rope at 16. He would have a good handle on it by age 11.I cannot imagine a South Texas cowboy of that era calling men \\"guys\\", black people \\"colored\\" and horses \\"animals\\". These terms are more midwestern, perhaps more educated than was common among the people of that time.Finally within a week of Austin he has blacks picking cotton in May. Cotton might be picked in August, but even in Texas, cotton takes a while to mature after it is planted.The one thing that saves this book is the humor.

Within 3 weeks of using the fixture, one of the bulbs fell apart while it was in the fixture. The glass tube fell out of the ceramic base when the light was turned on. If the fixture guard had not caught the bulb, I would have been showered in galss shards.

Earlier reviews had complained about this product, so I guess I should have believed them, but I was desperate!Well, after sending it back, I had to give up and buy a whole new fixture!

We opened it, installed the batteries and followed the instructions. We inserted a slide, chose \\"Quiz\\" and tried to enter the slide's code with the letter keys. Every time we hit the letter keys to enter the slide's code it just repeats the instructions \\"Please enter a slide's code to begin\\". We tried to reinstall the batteries, and we even tried to use the reset button on the bottom. That did nothing. The instruction manual says to reset the toy, just remove and reinsert the batteries. There is no mention of how to use the reset button nor any description of what it should do. Very frustrating, especially since this gift was from \\"Santa\\"! Now I have to return it and find a way to explain that to my child. Shame on this educational toy company for selling such a sub-par item that SIMPLY DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX. Booooooo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! This is a piece of junk!","review":"Please believe the people who said this was a piece of junk. I didn't and ordered it anyways. We finally put the batteries in and it will not let you enter the codes on the slides. All it says is \\"Pick a slide and enter it's code\\". Very, Very annoying and disappointing for the kid. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational toy","review":"This will get your preschooler interested in science. My sons' preschool had this in the classroom and my one son was so fascinated with it he asked for it for his birthday. It is simple enough for a 4/5 yr old to use. My son loves to take the quizzes after his quick bug lesson. Would love to get additional slides - if none available, would be my only complaint. This toy is so much better than a video game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interest won't last with only 12 slides","review":"This toy was great for the first couple of days. The facts about the different bugs are interesting and educational, and my son really enjoyed playing with it. It is well made and should last a long time. Unfortunately, it only comes with 12 slides and you cannot purchase any others. After the first couple of days my son had memorized most of the facts the microscope talks about and started losing interest. If GeoSafari would have thought through the design of this product and made it so you could purchase additional slide, they would have additional revenue coming from me for a few years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Microscope for small kids","review":"I bought this for my 5 year old son who is really into bugs and science. He loves looking at the slides. We are having trouble typing in the code and getting the microscope to recognize the slide and begin asking questions etc...but he still has fun looking at the slides and talking about what he sees. I gave it a lower review on fun because it fails to hold his attention due to the fact we can't get the machine's talking portion to ask him questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, fun toy","review":"My son adored this toy and showed it off to everyone. Then the buttons stopped working after a week. He is so sad that it lasted such a short amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Known....","review":"The slides are photos.The slides are limited in number to what you get with the microscope, so once you've memorized them, the \\"educational value\\" becomes limited.The stage of the microscope is on such an angle as to make it difficult to place \\"found objects\\" on it to view under magnification.Really, is this the best we can come up with for the 5 to 7-year-old crowd interested in science?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"I purchased this toy for my son and when we first opened it up, he was very excited after looking at the slides on the microscope. However he was highly anticipating learning facts about the bugs on the slides and when I put the batteries in for him, that feature did not work. We entered the codes just as the directions stated and it never not once told us a fact about any of the 12 slides included. I am very upset, my son is upset and I regret buying this product. I will write to the company and ask for a replacement or that I get a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a good idea","review":"This is a great idea and my 3-yr-old was really excited to work with it, but the buttons didn't work and wouldn't let me enter the code for the slides.

The microscope wouldn't recognize the codes we were entering. It turns out that we weren't pushing the slide down far enough (they snaps in on the right side and then sits in the microscope a little crooked). It feels like the slide isn't in right but this is the only way the codes will work for us. That said, it's difficult for him to get the slide in just right and when he plays with it by himself he puts the slide in backwards so the code doesn't work. As other reviewers have noted the slides are only of bugs, you can't purchase other slides, and you can't magnify anything (and isn't that the cool part of a microscope?). A little disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't magnify","review":"This is a great product for a beginner. My 6 yr old really likes it. It does not however magnify anything. The slides are just magnified pictures of bugs and insects. The facts and quizzes are good, but it does just ask and say the same things over and over. Again, it's good for a trial microscope to see if your child is really going to be into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item and don't buy anything from Amazon","review":"Another piece of the s*** that made in China.

The slides of insects and spiders contain real animals. The view is very clear The microscope is light weight and easy to store (save your box for storage). My only complaint is that the microscope's eye piece gives off a bad plastic-smell. We smell it every time we put our faces to the eye piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth $30","review":"I thought this was an actual microscope. I also thought it would have a lot of cool slides with lots of interesting microscopic things to peer at. It's just a kids toy. And a very juvenile one at that. All that is included is bugs, and they are not really magnified. It's just a picture of a mosquito or a beetle on a white screen. Do you remember the old red \\"View Finders\\" from the 80's? This is a much more base-level version of that - only not nearly as much variety and not nearly as cool. My kid liked it, but I am sorry I spent $30 on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I actually borrowed this from our library. My kids had a ball with it. I even learned new things!

The whole collection, like the preceding LP of the 60's, is infectious and brilliantly played. The final sound is a little edgy... there seems to be a lack of sound space in the compressing. I would not hesitate to give this a 5-star rating. It will have you dancing for joy. The cackle and pop of the LP are gone. The sound is there, edgy as I said, but still quite musical. The next best version of \\"A Christmas Festival\\" is the one conducted by John Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"\\"A Leroy Anderson Christmas\\" (CD) is terrific! First, and last, we have Sleigh Ride, composed by Leroy Anderson. Next we have a Meldley, then 19 Christmas Carols, all arranged by Anderson, into a concert overture and three suites of Carols. Also, Anderson and his Orchestra and Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops recorded the music. I, already, had a high opinion of Leroy Anderson's musical abilities, but this CD moved my opinion up by an entire notch.Between 1992 and 2005, I lived about two or three towns over from Woodbury. The roads, fields, stone dry-wall fences, and Colonial-style houses in this part of Connecticut may be new or updated from the ninteenth century but they often have the same feel as they do in the Currier and Ives print on the front of the CD. And, some of the few farmers that are left in the area do have horse-drawn sleds that they bring out for the Holidays!This is very good music. I recommend this CD highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wendy","review":"I was shocked at some of the reviews on this they obviously only watched a couple parts of this movie.

They are totally differnt wars!!! and I liked both series but I do lean towards Pacific since it was easier to see since all of it wasn't filmed dark, but they all went with as close to reality as they could get, with what information they had. The interviews with the marines at the end is definently worth watching also. your heart goes out to them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific","review":"If you're into seeing things how they really were this is the series for you.

Instead of concentrating on our guys getting the very unpleasant duty of war done in the stoic manor that that generation had, it concentrates on making our troops look weak spirited, whiney, undisciplined, and just plain mean spirited to the enemy wounded. While there were some instances of that kind of behavior, the majority were not like that. The Japanese enemy, meanwhile are shown in a very sympathetic manner. THEY are brave, tenacious fighters. After four chapters, I have had enough. I will not watch the rest of this insulting crap! Shame on you Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome set!","review":"I purchased this set for my husband and was very impressed with not only the price, but also the case the set comes in and the quality of the DVD's.

The acting and directing is dismal, the characters dull and uninteresting. I did not feel like I was there, in the South Pacific in 1942.

Not even in the same league, not even in the same universe as Band of Brothers. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Realities of War - A Tribure To The Men of The Pacific","review":"Before beginning to watch this mini-series I was sketical due to some of the negative reviews I had read. I strongly disagree with those reviews after viewing the entire series.Simply put I believe this should be reviewed by anybody concerned with the sacrifices our men and women in the serice have made in the past and currently. This movie is a record of the grim realities of war and the price that is paid for freedom. This movie illustrates not only the physical sacrifies made by the men and women in the military but also the psychological and emotional sacrifies and wounds endured. The truth of it is the images and the reality of the film are not pleasant but they express in an incredibly vivid way how honored our country is and has been to have men and women willing to make the ulitmate sacrifice.Thank you to everyone who has served in the past and is serving today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"While Speilberg and Hanks are to be commended for bringing the Pacific Theatre portion of World War II to us, the series was dissapointing, especially after reading the compelling book by E.B. Sledge. Band of Brothers was character driven. We got to know the men and to care about them...I found none of that in The Pacific Series. I would not watch this again. I have watched Band of Brothers many, many times and always enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Former Marine here. This struck such a deep cord with me that I could not watch the whole first episode as it was just so true to the Corps. In other words, so well done that it made this former grunt burst out in tears. Absolutely amazing production. You want to really learn something about the U.S.M.C.? Watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Series.","review":"This series is awesome. The contrast between the war in Europe as depicted in Band of Brothers and the total hell of the war in the Pacific is remarkable. I am a U.S. Marine Corps vet and I endorse this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pacific is NOT family-friendly","review":"I purchased this series hoping that they would be like Band of Brothers. In their graphic depiction of the horrors of war, they match up well against that earlier series. I suspected that, like Band of Brothers, there would be some profanity and obscenity and probably a sex scene. But I believed that the overriding benefit would outweigh those factors. To those who are thinking along those same lines - be forewarned. The Pacific includes literally hundreds of uses of the F-word and S-word, at times peppering the dialogue in every single sentence, especially during the fighting scenes. There are also at least three graphic sex scenes, two with extensive breast nudity and movements, and references to pornography and masturbation. Whether these will dissuade you from watching this series is up to you, but I want to ensure that you are aware of this before you set your family in front of the television."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific: In their boots","review":"The Pacific is one of the most enthralling WWII miniseries I have ever seen. By taking the approach of a miniseries the three independent main characters were given greater depth, as was the representation of war in the Pacific. This miniseries was comprehensive in terms of identifying different stages of combat experience in war, and honourably represents the immense sacrifice that was made by U.S. Marines in WWII. It should never be forgotten that so many Marines gave their lives to protect the freedoms that we all enjoy today. This miniseries is a much-deserved distinction to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and those who survived intensely fought campaigns in the Pacific.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After seeing Band of Brothers, I was very interested in seeing the other side of the war. Band of Brothers is a masterpiece. I understand how difficult it is to try and document a war fought on so many fronts (islands) for the Pacific theater. That being said, it was too disjointed and had too many subplots to follow it accurately. I also found the gratuitous sex scenes unnecessary and even unrealistic for that period of time. Of course premarital sex was a reality but popping into bed twenty minutes after meeting someone in 1943 would be more appropriate for 2013. I'm thinking the writers parents were my generation and did not grasp the moral leanings of their grandparents generation. The carnage was true and accurate as well and who would doubt that this was the norm and not the exception. But, jeez, did we need to have so much of it to get the pont across?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the pacific","review":"2 discs were pretty scratched up and couldn't watch them but I have not watched all of them yet and will try to do so next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Don't spend money on this cheesy film.

It was made close to ten years later when the HBO viewing public expects more gore, more cussing, and more sex. A lot of it was unnecessary, especially the unnatural amount of blood and guts (literally) toward the last few episodes. All that being said, it was very entertaining and told a story not often heard... but more in a drama setting and less of a docudrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"Overall I liked Band Of Brothers a bit more but showing home life and time away from the front added some extra dimension to the characters in The Pacific."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pacific","review":"What's to say - Good Flick.Have to get, as of now - seven more words here.So - would I purchase it again - if I hadn't alreadyseen it - and own it - I suppose I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!","review":"I have always enjoyed the Band Of Brothers, this movie is right on the same lines.

I am more than dismayed by actually seeing the production. It is disjointed and incoherent with a paucity of character development. One star is all this deserves. After looking closely at the authors and directors of each episode, I noted that they are all different persons. I suspect that the disjointed series is due to uncoordinated authorship put to film by different directors. The outcome is mediocre at best (and not worth watching more than once)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pacific","review":"We have given this film a low rating for many reasons listed as follows:Historically inaccurateExcessive profanityMy husband was in the 2nd Marine Division, participating in five assault landings, and found the depiction of the Marines to be insulting.

From the begining you are told nothing so you do not know really much about what is going on except which they are on. My dad is a former Marine and also cant watch this movie.

Reminds me of \\"Shock and Awe\\" when we all sat glue to hours of TV and watched, well NOTHING happen. Winds of War had more going on than this. With no real character development, substandard acting and chopped up storylines, most of the film is dribble that you must get through to watch the next battle.

I have two family members who fought in the Pacific and might have come back, but never made it really back. He hasn't the right to speak of military history in the Pacific written by others that was acted out with real flesh and blood by brave men. That he could support suck ilk that is gutting the Marine Corps now just because his agent says it's good publicity and Speilberg loves him is an affront to brave men indeed.

But even without setting the bar that high, I was greatly dissapointed in the series.There was a lack of cohesion between episodes, the characters were all over the place, you weren't sure who to follow, or who to like, and the writing was poor. Cliche-City.To me, the most disappointing part of the whole thing was that I felt I lacked the sense of what really happened over there. In Band of Brothers, you saw D-Day to the fall of Berlin, step by bloody step. In Pacific, there were disjointed battle scenes, between all the scenes of R&R; in Australia, psych-ward stays, military hospitals, etc. Just a big, weird jumble.About the only character I felt was up to par with the group from Band of Brothers was Sledgehammer.Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"Got here before they said, In very good shape.
